President Trump just showed how low he'll go on immigration - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities/index.html,"Donald Trump just showed how low he'll go on immigration Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large Updated 1:00 PM EDT, Fri April 12, 2019
(CNN) Just when you thought he couldn't go any lower, he did.
The ""he"" here is President Donald Trump . And what he did was pressure Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to take undocumented immigrants detained trying to enter the country and bus them to sanctuary cities located in the congressional districts of prominent Democratic members of Congress including Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California). (Nielsen was removed from her post on Sunday, the first of a broader purge within DHS executed by Trump over the past five days.) View this interactive content on CNN.com
The cynicism here is towering. Trump -- and top aide Stephen Miller -- pushed this idea on two occasions under the belief that if they could put undocumented immigrants in the backyards, quite literally, of opponents of the administration's hard-line immigration plans that they would change some minds among those opponents. Or at the very least, make their lives harder.
Trump confirmed the reported plan in a set of tweets Friday: ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only ... The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!""
Trump's tweets contradict what administration officials said Thursday night -- that the busing policy had been floated and dismissed. The President's tweets suggest it remains under active consideration.
The fact that this would even be considered speaks volumes about how Trump (and Miller) view not only the ongoing crisis at the border, but human beings more generally.
Because this is, at heart, a story about people. People who tried to enter the country illegally, yes. But people nonetheless. And what the President of the United States wanted to do to these human beings was turn them, literally speaking, into political pawns. Ship them somewhere so that they could, maybe, accomplish a political goal of his -- and, if not that, then just make things more uncomfortable for his political opponents.
Sit with that for a minute. And then remember that this is the same administration that instituted a zero-tolerance policy at the border that led to mass separations of families -- including very young children. And seemingly had no set policy on how to track where the kids went after they were separated from their parents or any real clue on how to reunite them once Trump called for an end to the policy. And has proposed closing the border entirely to keep any immigrants from coming in. And has declared a national emergency -- and thereby diverted funds appropriated for other purposes -- in order to build a wall that even immigration hard-liners do not believe is the solution. All after the President blasted immigrants coming to America from ""sh--hole countries"" and asked why the US wasn't getting more immigrants from countries like Norway.
All of these policies -- those actually instituted and those merely dreamed up in the mind of Trump, Miller and others -- are in service of making good on Trump's spoken and unspoken campaign pledges that, if elected, he would stop the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country and, thereby, stop the dissolution of American culture.
That's why ""Make America Great Again"" was getting at -- that something was being lost amid PC culture, amid globalization and, most importantly, amid unfettered immigration into the United States. That who this country once was had been slipping away for years and that he was the only person who could return us to true greatness.
Inherent -- if largely unstated -- in that pitch was this fact: The America Trump was venerating was largely one dominated by white people -- and, more specifically, white males. And that the influx of immigrants into the country was to blame for this cultural ""loss.""
The creation of the ""other"" -- people who don't look like you, talk like you or share your belief system -- was a hugely potent weapon for Trump in the campaign. He created an image of an America teetering on the brink of destruction -- which he cast as a total loss of the culture that made America great. And he set the stakes of the election simply: If he didn't win, the America that his supporters loved would be gone forever.
Even in his inauguration address, Trump cast America as a declining empire -- brought low by its abandonment of the way things used to be. Said Trump in that speech :
""Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.""
It's only through a worldview of ""us vs. them"" that you can justify proposals like busing undocumented immigrants to sanctuary cities in Democratic districts. Only by seeing certain people as lesser or a threat can you treat them like political pawns on your broader chessboard.
And when you see people as something less than, well, people you can rationalize treating them in ways that no person should be treated. That's where we are with President Trump on immigration. There is no bottom. He just keeps going lower and lower. "
Tornado outbreak likely this weekend in the South - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Allie Mazurek and Judson Jones,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/south-severe-storms-weekend-tornado-outbreak-wxc/index.html,"(CNN) Dangerous and severe storms are expected to slam parts of the Southeast and Ohio River Valley this weekend, forecasters say.
The potent system will create the potential for life-threatening winds, strong tornadoes and large hail. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk (level 4 out of 5) for severe weather Saturday across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley. And on Sunday, an enhanced risk (level 3 out of 5) stretches from Atlanta to Cleveland. 4 tornado safety tips that could save your life Read More Severe storms possible from Texas to Mississippi The first severe storms are expected during lunchtime Saturday into late afternoon across East Texas, Louisiana, southern Arkansas and eastern Mississippi. Cities such as Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, may be affected. Track the storms with CNN's storm tracker CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the threat for severe weather is greatest at such times. He said that the warm air present during the afternoon will enhance the atmosphere's instability, creating more energy for storms to tap into and aiding in their development. The storms most capable of producing tornadoes and large hail will be the individual, rotating cells that form ahead of a larger complex of thunderstorms throughout the afternoon. Tornadoes possible overnight in Alabama By late Saturday, the storms will organize into a line as they cross the western border of Mississippi. The system will begin to move through Alabama overnight and is expected to reach Georgia by Sunday morning. The energy from warm afternoon temperatures will diminish, but the risk for tornadoes will not be over. ""The storm is so vigorous that tornadoes are still possible after dark,"" Myers said. Tornadoes at that time can be especially dangerous since they are difficult to see and people are less likely to receive warnings while they're asleep. Georgia, the Southern Appalachians and Ohio Valley The most significant risk of severe weather is expected Saturday, but there's still considerable potential Sunday. The Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk across a broad area, stretching from eastern Alabama through the southern Appalachians and into the Ohio Valley. The main line of storms will begin to push into this area late Sunday morning and trek to the east on Sunday afternoon. The center expects the threat of severe weather to increase throughout the afternoon. ""Damaging winds appear to be the greatest threat on Sunday, but tornadoes will also be possible,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The risk will slowly diminish as the system begins to weaken Sunday evening. The Masters tournament may see exciting final round Georgia's Augusta National Golf Club is included in the slight risk area Sunday as the Masters concludes. The storms are expected to move through the Augusta area during the afternoon and evening, which could affect the schedules of some players finishing up their rounds. The tornado threat will be lower by then, but damaging winds could still present hazardous conditions. Either way, it could make for a delayed and an interesting end to the four-day tournament."
"The homeless man whose story raised $400,000 was sentenced for taking part in the hoax - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Janet DiGiacomo and Madison Park,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/gofundme-homeless-scam-sentencing/index.html,"(CNN) A homeless Philadelphia man who was found guilty of helping to scam GoFundMe donors out of nearly $400,000 was sentenced for conspiract to commit theft by deception in New Jersey on Friday.
Johnny Bobbitt Jr. was sentenced to a five-year special probation period for participating in what turned out to be a viral hoax. He pleaded guilty to the charge in March. According to the story that was presented in 2017, New Jersey resident Kate McClure ran out of gas and was stranded on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. A homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas. McClure and her boyfriend, Mark D'Amico, posted about the ""good deed"" on social media, including a picture of her with Bobbitt on a highway ramp. They also started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the homeless man, saying they wanted to pay it forward to the good Samaritan and get him off the streets. Kate McClure, left, Mark D'Amico, center, and Johnny Bobbitt Jr. Read More Their story made national headlines that brought attention to their crowd-funding, which raised nearly $400,000. ""In reality, McClure never ran out of gas and Bobbitt never spent his last $20 for her,"" according to a US Attorney's Office press release. ""D'Amico and McClure allegedly conspired to create the false story to obtain money from donors."" The couple transferred the funds to their bank account and bought a BMW, expensive handbags and went on trips, including to casinos in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Nevada, according to court documents. McClure did transfer $25,000 from her bank account to Bobbitt's in December 2017, federal prosecutors said. He received a total of $75,000 in the campaign, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina. Both McClure and Bobbitt also pleaded guilty to federal charges in early March. How a GoFundMe scam started with $20 and a good story -- but slowly unraveled McClure, 28, could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She will be sentenced on June 19. Bobbitt, 36, could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He will be sentenced on the federal charge at a later date. The probationary terms for Friday's sentencing in Burlington County require him to enter the state Superior Court drug court program, in which he'll be expected to get a job and adhere to a structured regimen of treatment and recovery services. Any infractions could bring him a five-year prison sentence, according to Burlington County Prosecutor spokesman Joel Bewley. CNN reached out to Bobbitt's attorney for comment, but has not heard back. Feel-good story falls apart The story began to fall apart after Bobbitt sued McClure and D'Amico, accusing them of withholding the money raised on his behalf. That lawsuit invited a search warrant, a deposition and an investigation into their campaign, which uncovered the alleged conspiracy. GoFundMe has since made refunds to thousands of people who donated, thinking they were giving to Bobbitt. In November, prosecutors alleged that it was a scam perpetrated by all three individuals. Mark D'Amico, McClure's then-boyfriend, is not facing federal charges. But McClure and D'Amico are facing local charges of second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception. McClure is set to be in court in Burlington County on Monday April 15. ""The paying-it-forward story that drove this fundraiser might seem too good to be true,"" Coffina said then.""Unfortunately, it was. The entire campaign was predicated on a lie."""

Police Chief Jeff Potts quoted witnesses as saying the person suspected of pushing or throwing the child ""took off running immediately after the incident."" A suspect was soon found inside the mall's transit station and was taken into custody. Bloomington police said later Friday that Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, was charged with attempted homicide in connection with the incident. Aranda lives in the Bloomington area, police said. He had two previous trespass notices ordering him to stay away from the Mall of America, according to the Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis. Bloomington police released this photo of Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, charged with attempted homicide in an incident in which a child was pushed or thrown from the third floor of the Mall of America. Potts told reporters that police were called to the mall at 10:17 a.m. local time, and initial information suggested a child had fallen from the third level of the mall's interior to the first level. Additional information from witnesses indicated the 5-year-old might have been pushed or thrown, Potts said. Read More Police officers gave the child first aid along with witnesses, Potts said.

Walmart wants to build its advertising business - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Nathaniel Meyersohn,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/business/walmart-advertising-amazon-google/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Walmart is serious about giving Amazon a run for its money online. It's so determined that the company bought a startup to help it compete in an unexpected business: online advertising.
The retailer on Thursday bought Polymorph Labs, a Silicon Valley startup that specializes in managing digital ads for brands. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Walmart said adding the startup's technology would enable current and potential advertisers to reach consumers more effectively. The acquisition positions Walmart to compete with Amazon ( AMZN ) , which became the country's third largest ad platform last year behind Google ( GOOG ) and Facebook ( FB ) . ""Our data has never been monetized, and we have a tiny ad business,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts last year. ""It could be bigger."" Walmart's strategy to solve the Amazon puzzle is working Walmart hopes its pitch to consumer brands will stick. It's playing up the fact that it has a huge network of physical stores that it can use to recruit brands. Walmart says it has a trove of shopper data because 90% of America shops at Walmart every year, and its website and stores attract nearly 160 million visitors a week. Read More ""We can help brands understand if someone saw their ad on Walmart's platform or across the [internet], and then purchased the product in-store or online,"" said Stefanie Jay, vice president and general manager for Walmart Media Group. Walmart's ""scale and data could give it a unique opportunity to expand"" its ad business, UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research report last month. Walmart wants to squeeze out more digital advertising dollars because its profit is under pressure. The company sold $184 billion worth of groceries in the United States last year, more than a third of its more than $500 billion in sales. But groceries carry razor-thin margins. Walmart has also sacrificed profit in recent years by investing billions of dollars to build out its digital operation, lower its prices and add online pickup to thousands of stores. Profit has fallen three years in a row. But Walmart believes that building new revenue streams, such as advertising, health care and financial services, can help offset its heavy spending and boost profit. ""Retailers will need to innovate and find new profit pools,"" Lasser said. ""Pivoting traditional retail business models won't be easy, but will be necessary over time."" The retailer faces challenges, however. Walmart chief financial officer Brent Biggs told analysts at a conference last month that Walmart needed to be careful to prevent its website from becoming ""cluttered"" with ads. Rival grocers and retailers that want to expand their digital ad businesses also pose an obstacle for Walmart. Last year, Kroger ( KR ) , Albertsons and Ahold Delhaize all made big pushes into advertising. Kroger, for example, believes it has an opportunity to sell brands ads on its store shelves, and it's tapping Microsoft ( MSFT ) to help. The two companies struck a partnership in January to pilot two stores in Ohio and Washington State. Instead of paper tags for prices and promotions on the two stores' shelves, they will be digital. That creates room for Kroger to sell advertising space to brands."
"Disaster relief For Puerto Rico, Midwest: Congress leaves Washington without a deal - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Ted Barrett,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/disaster-relief-stalled-puerto-rico-trump-congress/index.html,"(CNN) Congress departs Washington this week for a long recess leaving behind a key piece of unfinished business: Funding for millions of Americans harmed by hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters.
Lawmakers can't reach a deal because President Donald Trump is refusing to provide the amount of money Democrats are demanding for Puerto Rico , which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria two years ago. Trump believes government leaders there -- who he has repeatedly clashed with politically -- haven't spent wisely the relief money already allocated to it. ""I cannot fathom why this President has so much antipathy towards Puerto Rico. These are American citizens, badly damaged by natural disasters,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland told reporters Friday, noting that the House approved significant funds for the territory. ""I do not know what the President and Republicans are thinking about in abandoning Puerto Rico."" The top Senate Republican leading the talks had what he described as a ""long"" meeting with Trump late Thursday and said they are ""trying to make some overtures to the Democrats to settle this disaster package."" Disaster aid issues unlikely to be resolved before 2-week Congress break Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, wouldn't provide any details about what a new offer might look like but said White House staff would work with congressional staff over the two-week recess when both chambers will be away. He said he hopes to vote on a proposal when Congress returns to session at the end of the month. Read More But Shelby wouldn't say if he got assurances from Trump that he would back new funding for Puerto Rico. ""That's the lynchpin of the whole negotiations. Their history of spending and everything that goes with it. I think most people want to help Puerto Rico, but we want to make sure that money is well spent,"" Shelby said. ""This has not always been the case."" Shelby acknowledged that problems with spending of federal funds exist in all 50 states not just Puerto Rico, which is a US territory. It's unusual for lawmakers to fail to pass disaster relief given that aid is typically a priority that both sides of the aisle can agree on. The stalled aid package is one more sign of how bitterly divided along partisan lines Congress has become. The split has left disaster-struck areas in the lurch. As the stalemate continues in Congress, a powerful blizzard hit parts of the country this week , including states damaged by recent floods, threatening to make recovery even more challenging. At the start of the month, the dispute came to a head when the Senate failed to advance two competing disaster relief plans , one supported by Democrats and the other backed by Republicans. The GOP-backed measure included $600 million to pay for nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico, but Democrats objected to the proposal, arguing that it did not provide adequate relief. The Democratic plan that came up for a vote was a measure that passed out of the Democratic-controlled House months ago. Republicans criticized that legislation for not providing relief for recent flooding that has devastated the Midwest. Since then, Democrats have introduced new disaster relief legislation that includes additional aid to deal with recent flooding, trying to ramp up political pressure on Republicans to pass the deal and force Trump to accept it. Earlier this week, House Democrats unveiled a $17.2 billion measure that includes $3 billion to provide relief for Midwest flooding and other natural disasters that have taken place since the House initially passed a relief bill in January. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee Sen. Patrick Leahy on Thursday introduced a companion version of the House bill in the Senate. Tensions between the White House and Puerto Rico have escalated amid the stalemate and the President's continued attacks directed at Puerto Rico. After the Senate failed to advance the competing disaster relief plans at the start of the month, Trump tweeted that Puerto Rico ""pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA."" In response to a tweet by the President referring to her as ""crazed and incompetent,"" San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz told CNN's Erin Burnett ""the President lives in an alternate world where he tries to pin people against one another."" The President has also made claims that fact-checkers have deemed false as he lashes out publicly at Puerto Rico. In one tweet, rated false by FactCheck.org, Trump claimed , ""Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before."""
House Democratic freshmen celebrate whirlwind first 100 days with new video - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Sunlen Serfaty,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/house-freshmen-democrats-first-100-days-alexandria-ocasio-cortez/index.html,"(CNN) Friday marks the Democrats' first 100 days in control of the House of Representatives and the first 100 days of the dynamic freshman class that has captured national attention, tested leadership, commandeered the conversation and, at times, the Democratic legislative agenda.
The group of more than 60 new Democratic members -- diverse , young, with strength in their record-setting numbers -- have not been without controversy over the last three months in office, which has threatened at times to overshadow the work of the broader Democratic House caucus. To mark the first 100 days on their ""own terms,"" nearly all of the freshmen contributed to a video to highlight what work they have accomplished in the first 100 days, led by freshman Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. 100 days ago, a brand new wave of Democrats took office ready to get to work. We haven't wasted any time! We were elected by the people & now we're hard at work fighting #ForThePeople . pic.twitter.com/fNQNZsvlaC
— Lauren Underwood (@RepUnderwood) April 12, 2019 ""I conducted oversight of big banks, credit reporting agencies and Trump officials who cheated consumers,"" says freshman Rep. Katie Porter , who has created many viral moments of her questioning during committee hearings, in the video. Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, whose son Vernon Jordan was killed by gun violence, says H.R. 8 is her biggest accomplishment, adding it would affect ""federal background checks for all gun sales and HR. 1112, closing the Charleston loophole."" Read More The video has short vignettes from all but one freshman -- some are serious, noting policy proposals they've started making headway on. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York touts the ""90 co-sponsors"" of her Green New Deal proposal . Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts mentions the amendment she's offered to lower the voting age to 16 years old. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota cites that she introduced and passed in the House the PAUL Act to strengthen the enforcement of foreign lobbying and to crack down on lobbyists who represent human rights abusers. Others focus on the basics like building a ""diverse staff"" in the first 100 days, holding town halls or answering constituents' letters as one of their accomplishments. ""I hope that people get a chance to know some people that that they might not have heard from before. We have a lot of superstars in our class,"" Underwood told CNN about organizing the video. ""Putting out a bold statement that says we're here, we're effective, we're impactful and look at what we've done in just a short amount of time."" Making news right out the gate Indeed, many of the freshmen have made big impressions on the caucus, winning high-profile committee assignments and introducing key legislation for the Democratic agenda. Some, like Porter, have created viral moments by breaking the mold of typical questioning on hearings. Their boldness has also created moments of controversy in a short amount of time. On day one -- the first night of the new Congress -- freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan declared that she and her fellow lawmakers were going to ""impeach the motherf**ker,"" referring to President Donald Trump. It was exactly the kind of rhetoric that Democratic leaders were worried about as they assumed the new majority. While it fired up the progressive base, it fed into a narrative that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had long been trying to manage: that Democrats were bloodthirsty for Trump's ouster and would undermine their own credibility if they moved too fast. JUST WATCHED The F-bomb and the divided Democrats Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
The F-bomb and the divided Democrats 03:14 Tlaib's comment quickly dominated the headlines, and Democrats arrived to the Capitol the next morning facing questions from reporters about her remarks. Two months later, as Tlaib unapologetically prepared to introduce an impeachment resolution , Pelosi forcefully reiterated her view that Democrats should not pursue impeachment unless there was significant evidence. ""He's just not worth it,"" she added. Pelosi's comments threw a massive bucket of cold water on Capitol Hill, and -- in a sign of the California Democrat's powerful influence over her caucus -- most members soon fell in line with downplaying impeachment. Only one other Democrat at the time joined Tlaib to support the resolution that she ultimately introduced in a rollout that had little fanfare. But the drama over Tlaib's comment paled in comparison to controversial tweets made by Omar . Critics, including many Democrats, argued the Minnesota freshman invoked anti-Semitic tropes and stereotypes in her comments criticizing US support for Israel. Ilhan Omar defends herself after calling Stephen Miller a 'white nationalist' Within a month, the House found itself voting on two resolutions condemning anti-Semitism -- both of which were seen as rebukes against Omar. While she apologized for some of her comments , she didn't apologize for everything and the debate exposed an emotional division among Democrats about US support for Israel. Republicans seized on the fracture, and with the President's help, started painting Democrats as an anti-Jewish party -- another distraction that Democrats lamented as they sought to promote their own legislative agenda. And Omar, who continues tweeting provocative comments -- including just this week, calling Stephen Miller a ""white nationalist"" -- has not shied away from taking on her critics head on, even those within her party. ""It's been interesting to see such a powerful conference of people be so fearful of a freshman member of Congress,"" Omar told CNN in March responding to criticism from members of her own party at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington, DC. ""I hope that they figure out a way to not allow me to have a permanent residency in their heads."" Omar drew criticism again this week over a comment that many viewed as minimizing the tragic events of 9/11. Refusing to back down, Omar went on the ""Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert to fend off attacks over her patriotism. ""I am as American as everyone else is,"" she said. The Twitter question In the same way that Republican lawmakers get irked by the President's tweets, some Democrats have begun expressing similar frustration with their own colleagues, many of those freshmen who came into office with powerful social media followings. As the Omar controversies unfolded, multiple members called for colleagues to ease up on the tweets. ""What we need to do is not be out there Twittering,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan told reporters last month. ""We need to talk to each other."" But Twitter is the same platform that has launched some of these freshmen into unprecedented fame. Many of them came into Congress using social media in nontraditional ways, from showing behind-the-scenes moments of their new journey to calling people out directly on Twitter. Ocasio-Cortez has built the largest following on Twitter, now with close to 4 million followers, surpassing even Pelosi. Financial Services is one of just four exclusive committees in the House. It oversees big banks, lending, & the financial sector.
I am very grateful for the opportunity to sit on this committee as a freshman, and look forward to working under the leadership of @RepMaxineWaters ! https://t.co/kIq5iDcrTV
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 16, 2019 AOC, as she is known, has become a media sensation that has soaked up a significant amount of coverage of the freshmen class. She regularly takes to her Twitter account to respond to news of the day, to take on Republican attacks directly, engage with journalists and call out what she sees as sexism on Capitol Hill. She also uses Instagram to show everyday life moments as a new congresswoman, featuring her at times cooking or assembling furniture in her apartment . House Democrats postpone budget vote as progressives push to raise spending caps Democratic leaders have largely sought to harness her Twitter use rather than dampen it. She, along with Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, were invited to give a Twitter training in January to other members. Still, Ocasio-Cortez's celebrity status marks a highly unusual trajectory for a freshman member and bucks the strategy that many take of laying low at the beginning of their service. Omar, in an appearance on the Stephen Colbert this week, said she also does not agree with those who tell her to ""go slow"" in Congress. ""Women have been told to go slow and not be seen and not be heard for many years,"" she said of herself, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez. ""We are not there to be quiet. We are not there to be invisible."" Balancing a large class Democratic leaders largely describe the attention on freshmen as a positive thing for the caucus, even as they try to corral and balance the power of a few within the broader context of the whole Democratic caucus. ""I think they are ... a force to reckon with and we're trying to reckon with them,"" House Whip James Clyburn told CNN last month. ""Somebody else's progress or success in the public arena is a plus for all of us,"" Pelosi said at an event last month, when asked if it bothers her at all that younger members are in the spotlight. ""It isn't a zero sum game that if you have this, then that subtracts from something else. Again, I thrive on the diversity."" Still, some feel frustrated with the media coverage, arguing only a few members of the freshman class are getting all the attention. ""If you read the papers or watch television, and you ask who are the new members of Congress, you come up with three names,"" Hoyer told reporters last month. ""There are 59 other extraordinarily competent, capable people. I mean it's an extraordinary class. I think it deserves the attention of all of you."" ""I think the coverage does not project what is the reality,"" he added. Leaders are eager to showcase their majority-making freshmen and the backgrounds they bring. Hoyer and Pelosi happily appear at their press conferences to support their initiatives. Hoyer, for example, joined Underwood last week as she helped announce a new caucus on black maternal health. Rep. Colin Allred, who won a previously red district in Texas , has been a big name on efforts by Democrats to preserve the Affordable Care Act . Leaders are also arguing their caucus is unified despite the ups and downs from the past 100 days. It's a message they've especially tried to convey to reporters at the Democratic issues conference in Virginia this week. ""We have such a unified caucus,"" Pelosi told the press, criticizing their coverage. ""You're on the wrong track. But you can waste your time on that while we go forward with what we are going to do for the American people."""
GM to reveal a radically new Corvette - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Peter Valdes-Dapena,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/success/gm-midengined-corvette/index.html,"Get ready for an all-new Chevrolet Corvette. On July 18, General Motors will reveal the latest version of ""America's sports car.""
It's big news anytime a new Corvette is unveiled, but this one will represent, arguably, the biggest change for the Corvette since the model was first introduced in 1953. The Corvette has changed a lot over the past 66 years, but it has always remained a front-engined, rear-wheel-drive sports car. The new 2020 Corvette will have its engine behind the seats. It's a design idea that was pioneered in the Lamborghini Miura in 1966, and has since become the standard for extreme high-performance sports car. The Corvette's chief engineer Tadge Juechter and General Motors CEO Mary Barra drive in a camouflaged next-generation Corvette near Times Square. Putting the engine behind the driver and passenger -- called a rear mid-engined layout -- places the heaviest single part of the car as close as possible to the vehicle's absolute center. This way, the car is balanced in its handling, being neither especially heavy at the front or at the back. Having the engine more toward the rear also helps during hard acceleration since there is more weight to hold down the rear wheels that power the car. The Corvette has long been a legitimate performance competitor, especially considering its relatively low price. While it's far from cheap -- the entry level Corvette starts at almost $60,000 -- its performance rivals that of cars costing six figures. But there is a limit to the capabilities of any car with a front-engined design and, evidently, GM engineers decided that it was finally time to make that change. Read More ""There's more potential in the mid-engined platform in terms of performance applications than there is in a front-engined car, that's for sure,"" said Travis Okulski, editor-in-chief of Road & Track magazine. It's not the first time GM ( GM ) has considered it. The company even built mid-engined research cars called CERV I and CERV II (Chevrolet Engineering Research Vehicle) in the 1960s and the CERV III in 1990. GM unveils 700-horsepower electric Camaro and, maybe, a way to build your own The new mid-engined Corvette has been the subject of much speculation in the automotive press. GM finally confirmed it would be unveiled this summer, releasing photos of the car covered in black and white camouflage driving toward New York's Times Square. The new car has the potential to further burnish GM's image as an engineering powerhouse, which has long been the role of the Corvette. It's a ""halo car"" that brings people into Chevrolet showrooms even if they ultimately end up buying something else, said Okulski, and this version should generate even more interest. ""It also gives Chevrolet something that can play on the big stage with the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, everybody,"" he said."

Bonnie Haim: Jurors now weigh her husband's claim of innocence against his son's boyhood memories - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Ray Sanchez, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/bonnie-michael-haim-trial-closing/index.html,"(CNN) Michael Haim, who took the stand to deny killing his wife and burying her body in their backyard in 1993, was found guilty by a Florida jury Friday of second-degree murder.
The jury of three men and three women deliberated about 90 minutes before their verdict in the high-profile cold case was announced. Haim showed no expression as the verdict was read. Haim's son, Aaron Fraser, was among the relatives of Haim's then-wife, Bonnie, sitting on the prosecution side of the court. Some wiped tears. As a boy, Fraser would play with a toy dump truck in his backyard in Jacksonville, Florida. As a man, excavating behind his childhood home in 2014 as part of a renovation, he wielded a shovel -- and discovered the yard was a clandestine grave. Fraser would find the skull and bones of his mother, who had gone missing in January 1993. Read More ""On that day, that mother and child reunion brought Aaron Fraser face to face with the product of this defendant's ill will,"" prosecutor Mac Heavener told a state jury Friday, referring to Haim. Michael Haim is accused of killing his wife, Bonnie Haim, in 1993. ""It brought him face to face with the product of this defendant's hatred,"" the prosecutor said. ""And it brought him face to face with the product of this defendant's spite and evil intent."" Wearing glasses and an olive-colored suit, Michael Haim, 53, stared straight ahead and displayed no emotion --not then, nor any other time Heavener pointed at him during closing arguments. The defendant took the stand this week and maintained his innocence, as he has since his wife disappeared. ""I loved my wife,"" he testified Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WJXT. ""I would never hurt my wife."" But Heavener described Michael Haim as a man going through marital problems and -- again pointing at the defendant -- a ""guy who's really good, really accomplished at burying the truth."" After reaching the verdict, Judge Steven Whittington began the penalty phase of the case. The same jurors heard testimony from witnesses about aggravating factors that could get Haim a longer sentence: whether the crime was committed in presence of a family member, included tampering with evidence, was committed in a heinous, atrocious and cruel manner, and inflicted severe emotional trauma on the victim's family. The jury agreed on three of the aggravating factors but found the crime was not committed in a heinous, atrocious and cruel manner. Fraser testified that he has been in therapy since childhood. He described a ""very uneasy"" encounter in which his paternal grandparents told him that they loved him but that he had been ""brainwashed."" He also spoke about finding his mother's skull in the yard of his childhood home. ""It was very tough,"" he said. ""I think everybody can imagine, even if it's not a loved one, finding a skull and picking it up and what that would do to somebody. Not to mention, that it was your mother."" Sentencing is set for May 17. Prosecutors lay out their theory On January 7, 1993, Bonnie Haim did not show up to work. Michael Haim would later say the couple fought the prior night and that she left the house alone around 11 p.m. Heavener told jurors the defendant had the motive, the opportunity and the ability to kill his wife. He knew Bonnie Haim planned to leave him and take their son, then 3 years old. The night before she disappeared, she called her best friend. She was crying and upset. She told her friend that she would speak with her in the morning. Referring to Michael Haim as ""Mr. Ill Will. Mr. Spite. Mr. Evil Intent,"" the prosecutor said the defendant owned the type of firearm used to kill Bonnie Haim and that a sandy footprint on the floor mat of her car matched his size 10 Nike sneakers. ""You'll see the truth scream from those floor mats,"" Heavener said. ""The shoe print speaks volumes in this case. ... He had just finished digging that grave."" Bonnie Haim's purse was later found behind a Red Roof Inn near Jacksonville International Airport, where police later discovered her car in an airport parking lot. Heavener said a lone key to Bonnie's car was in her purse. Another car key, along with her house key, was at the couple's home. ""It's pretty odd to think that a woman is going to leave her son, abandon her job and leave her house (without) a set of keys she normally uses, leaving all her earthly belongings inside,"" the prosecutor said. 'A lot of reasonable doubt in this case' Beyond his client's claim of innocence, Michael Haim's defense attorney told jurors the state's case was built on ""innuendo"" and ""hypotheticals that don't exist."" ""Michael Haim is not guilty, not because I say he's not, but because that's what the law is in this case,"" Tom Fallis said. ""You will find a lot of reasonable doubt in this case."" Prosecutors were stretching the truth to secure a conviction, Fallis said. ""They're going to stretch a lot because they don't have the evidence they need to prove beyond reasonable doubt,"" he said. ""They'll take anything and stretch it to get that conviction because that's what they do. That's what their job is."" In rebuttal, Assistant State Attorney Alan Mizrahi told jurors: ""The truth about this case demands justice. Bonnie Haim cannot get justice. It's up to us, the living, to find justice for her."" Michael Haim took the stand Thursday, attesting to his love for Bonnie Haim. He also testified to his wife's state of mind on their last night together in January 1993. ""She'd been unhappy for, maybe, a month, maybe two,"" he said. ""I can't put my finger on how long, but it had been going on where she wasn't her bubbly self like she was."" A prosecutor asked Michael Haim why he went to bed the night his wife walked out, tucking in next to his preschooler. ""I assumed she was going to her mother's,"" he said. ""I don't really know what else to tell you."" Defense attorney Janis Warren said during opening statements that prosecutors did not have enough evidence to prove Michael Haim's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ""We agree she's dead. We agree that's her body in the backyard. But they have to prove to you that he did it,"" she said. ""When you listen to the evidence, ladies and gentlemen, and when you're finished, you're gonna see the lack of evidence in this case far outweighs any evidence they brought you."" Inmates testify to jailhouse confession But two inmates on Wednesday testified that Michael Haim in 2015 confessed to killing his wife while he was in jail with them, WJXT reported. ""He started talking about, you know, how he killed his wife: how he choked her, how her son was mad at him. He buried her in the yard,"" Terrance Richardson said. The discovery of Bonnie Haim's body a year earlier had led officials to arrest Michael Haim and charge him with second-degree murder, prosecutors have said. He found a body at his childhood home's backyard during renovations. It was his mom ""The truth was always out there, buried in their backyard,"" prosecutor Mizrahi said Tuesday during opening statements. The childhood memories of Fraser, who reportedly assumed his last name when he was adopted, also became a major part of the case. Shortly after his mother vanished, he told a child welfare worker, ""Daddy hurt Mommy,"" WJXT reported. ""Aaron also stated that, 'Daddy shot Mommy,' and, 'My daddy could not wake her up,'"" a 2015 arrest affidavit said, according to WJXT . Bonnie Haim's remains were found under a shower pallet in the home's backyard, according to testimony. A .22-caliber shell was also found near the body, and Michael Haim owned a .22-caliber rifle. Although a medical examiner could not affirmatively determine how she was killed, Mizrahi argued that Michael Haim shot her in 1993, then buried her. ""The defendant's actions before the killing and after the killing demonstrate his depraved indifference to Bonnie Haim's life,"" he said. Investigators had searched the property several times in the years after her disappearance but did not find her remains until Fraser's discovery two decades later. But Warren, the defense attorney, reiterated to jurors that prosecutors would not be able to prove that Michael Haim killed her and placed her body there on the night she disappeared. ""The only thing that's important is: Can they prove he killed her? And can they prove he put the body in the yard?"" she said. ""There's no evidence of either one of those."""

Hill prepares to settle for Shanahan at DOD,edition.cnn.com,Michael Warren,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/shanahan-pentagon-trump-replacement/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Acting Defense secretary Patrick Shanahan remains President Donald Trump's top pick to be the permanent head of the Pentagon, say multiple sources in Congress and the administration. But with questions about whether he will make the cut, the administration is left with a daunting question: Does anyone actually want the job?
Several Republicans on Capitol Hill tell CNN they're concerned about Shanahan's ability to get through Senate confirmation. There's also a fear over a lack of willing alternatives for one of the most difficult Cabinet jobs. ""It's hard to find someone to take it,"" one senior Republican in Congress has told CNN. Shanahan is under investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general over possible ethics violations. A Boeing employee for more than three decades before joining the Pentagon in 2017 as Deputy Defense Secretary under then Defense Secretary James Mattis, Shanahan has been accused by a federal watchdog group of promoting his former company and disparaging its competitors internally. Even before the investigation began last month, delaying Shanahan's anticipated nomination for the permanent position, Republicans on the Hill were concerned about his fitness for the job. ""He has not impressed anybody on the Hill,"" said one Republican congressional aide said of Shanahan. ""I've not heard a single person defend this pick."" No alternatives Read More Given the lack of enthusiasm among key Republicans for Shanahan, a number of names have been floated as a permanent successor, including Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, former Missouri senator Jim Talent, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, and Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry. None have publicly expressed interest in the job, and there is rising concern among some Republicans on the Hill that none of the qualified alternatives actually want the job. A spokesman for Cotton, who has been a staunch ally of the President's and advises him on the military and national security, declined to comment on whether the Arkansas Republican would be interested in the job. Kevin Bishop, a spokesman for Graham, told CNN the South Carolina senator has ""zero interest in any Cabinet position."" When asked if Thornberry, the top-ranking Republican on the House Armed Services, would consider being Defense Secretary, a spokesman pointed to the Texas congressman's ""scoff"" at a similar question from a journalist last December. A spokesman for Esper also pointed to a December statement on the question from the Army secretary. ""I'm very happy and privileged to be secretary of the Army,"" he told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram . A spokesperson for Talent, who served in the Senate from 2002 to 2007, did not reply to a request for comment. Not only would a new nominee have less than two years guaranteed to do the job, there is also trepidation about taking on one of the most difficult Cabinet positions in a frequently dysfunctional administration. Mattis's clashes with President Trump over the decision to withdraw from Syria, which precipitated his resignation last year, offer a cautionary tale. So do the mixed messages from the administration on the withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. A permanent Defense secretary could be turned out of office in 2021 if Trump loses re-election. Shanahan's stumbles Despite him being under investigation, Shanahan's lengthy tenure -- at more than 100 days, he is the longest acting Defense secretary in history -- and the dearth of willing alternatives has given him an air of inevitability around Washington. Multiple administration officials tell CNN that Shanahan expects to be cleared by a current ethics investigation and expects to be nominated for the top job. And the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee says he expects the former Boeing executive, who has now served more than 100 days as the acting Pentagon chief, to get the nod. ""I want a permanent replacement,"" Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma told CNN Thursday. ""I want him. If it's not going to be him, I want somebody else. But I want him right now. He's the one that's in mind. We're long past the point where we should have an acting in that position."" Since January, Trump has been leaning toward nominating him to take the job permanently, but the President refrained from doing so before the inspector general's office began its investigation in March. Two administration officials claimed the initial delay was due to a backlog of other acting positions that needed permanent nominations. But a Republican aide on Capitol Hill says there were also concerns about getting enough support for Shanahan in the Senate. ""I think he's going to have some trouble on the confirmation side,"" said the aide. Defense-focused Republicans in Washington have been worried for months that Shanahan's problems go beyond potential ethical lapses. ""He's totally underwhelming,"" said a former Pentagon official from the George W. Bush administration who remains active in defense policy. In multiple meetings with Shanahan, the person said he came away with the impression that Shanahan lacked key qualifications, particularly on the foreign policy front. Members of Congress have also grumbled about Shanahan's performance in hearings, saying he's come across as not conversant with the details of defense policy. Two administration officials acknowledge that Shanahan has faced a learning curve when it comes to interacting with lawmakers. But they add Shanahan, an engineer by training, has improved from his first hearings at the Senate and House Armed Services committees in March, to his most recent trip to Capitol Hill at Thursday's Senate hearing on Space Force. He still seemed to struggle at times on Thursday, particularly compared to his more seasoned colleagues who joined him on the panel. Early on at this most recent hearing -- which also featured Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, Gen. John E. Hyten of Strategic Command, and Gen. James Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as witnesses -- Chairman Inhofe posed what he called a ""direct question"" to Shanahan. ""How would establishing a Space Force help the United States reassert its warfighting dominance?"" Inhofe asked. Shanahan's answer wasn't exactly direct. ""The fix -- I think what you're really speaking to is: how do we expand that margin?"" he began. ""Our proposal addresses all of the changes that are occurring simultaneously in space. And maybe just to set up the answer, these are the significant changes we have to address. The environment is contested, we are about to modernize -- for the first time in about 30 years, modernize the Department."" As Shanahan went on, Inhofe interjected, ""Yes, quickly now,"" prompting the defense chief to cut the answer short so the chairman could ask a similar question to Wilson. ""I do think that there is an opportunity to align defense space programs in a Space Force underneath the Air Force, including acquisition. And I think that that alignment will help,"" said Wilson succinctly. ""Okay,"" Inhofe said. ""That's a good answer."" But Inhofe denied he had any concerns about Shanahan's performance. ""Better than he did the first hearing he attended,"" he told CNN after the hearing. ""So I thought he did a very good job, answered the questions correctly. Didn't make any obvious mistakes."""

If it's nostalgia they crave, they'll get to bask in it with the launch of Disney+ . No more sneaking away during homework time to get their fix. For millennials like Fetch and Cohen, who have long cut the cable cord, the streaming service is bringing back their fondest childhood shows -- and long trips down memory lane. ""I know a slew of people that are Disney fanatics,"" Fetch, 27, said. ""Having all their Disney favorites in one place will certainly be a major attraction to said fanatics."" Read More Millennials prefer streaming ... Millennials love streaming. The content is always at their fingertips and often comes with few, if any, ads.

""I loved Disney as a kid,"" Cohen, 21, said. ""I watched the movies a lot and I watched almost exclusively Disney Channel.""

Although she said she'll probably end up subscribing to Disney's service, she isn't thrilled at the idea of paying another monthly fee.

The vicious White House sanctuary city revenge plan is too awful to gloss over (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Bill Carter,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/opinions/trump-sanctuary-cities-immigration-revenge-plan-carter/index.html,"Bill Carter, a media analyst for CNN, covered the television industry for The New York Times for 25 years, and has written four books on TV, including ""The Late Shift"" and ""The War for Late Night.""

(CNN) The story broke in the Washington Post after 8 p.m. Thursday: The Trump administration, in its latest spasm of anti-immigrant animus, had twice in recent months considered a plan to transport detainees to sanctuary cities and essentially dump them there as a form of retaliation against Democratic political adversaries, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. By Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump confirmed that he was considering this revenge plan.
Bill Carter The reaction across a broad swath of the most influential news outlets in America was something close to stupefaction. Jeffrey Toobin, chief legal analyst for CNN, appearing on Anderson Cooper's show ""360,"" called the proposed policy ""really grotesque"" after describing the plan as akin to ""using human beings to spread a form of pestilence around the country."" Maggie Haberman, the Pulitzer-winning New York Times correspondent (and Donald Trump savant), tweeted that she had read the Post story twice, leading to a simple reaction: ""It is insane."" On Brian Williams's ""11th Hour"" show on MSNBC, one guest, David Jolly, the one-time Republican congressman, who has renounced fealty to that party in the age of Trump, repeatedly used the word ""sociopathy"" to describe the policy, and said those who had come up with it were displaying ""unmitigated depravity.""

That is: a story that merited almost cartoon-character double-takes of astonishment, marked by extreme verbal descriptions like insanity, grotesquerie and depravity, grabbed, at least for the beginnings of one news cycle, a portion of media attention, before likely getting thrown into the wash of what has become the daily recitation of the gobsmacking news out of the nation's capital. This story was only the most recent example of the now-consuming dilemma that afflicts all media coverage of the current White House administration: How to adequately convey any lasting sense of context amid the swirling hurricane of events transpiring not just daily, but often hourly, piling up upon each other like remnants of coastal buildings swept up in the storm surge. Donald Trump is sabotaging America's democracy By any historical standard, the proposed White House plan to try to inflict some kind of damage on districts hospitable to immigrants by busing masses of detainees to those locations and setting them loose -- like an ""infestation,"" a favorite characterization of this White House about immigrants from Mexico and Central America -- would have unleashed a torrent of intense and sustained high-volume coverage. And viewers and readers encountering widespread analysis of a story marked by terms like insanity and sociopathy would recognize something extraordinary had happened. Instead, the din of incessant political noise can be expected to quickly obliterate any effort to give this latest development what would, in the past, have been its proper due as a screamer of a headline. And context will fly off into the ether. Astonishment will ebb. Media heads will snap back. And the beat goes on: Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain; ladeda dee; ladeda dah.

The media as an institution is certainly relevant. It's more than that; it's indispensable. But the degree of its influence is far less clear, precisely because of the frenzy it's trying to explain.

Alleged Mar-a-Lago trespasser indicted on two charges but no spying charge - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/zhang-mar-a-lago/index.html,"(CNN) Yujing Zhang, the Chinese national accused of carrying malware on a thumb drive into the Mar-a-Lago resort last month , was indicted by a federal grand jury on Friday for unlawfully entering a restricted zone and for lying to Secret Service agents.
The indictment on Friday closely adheres to parts of the criminal complaint prosecutors levied against her when she was first detained by the Secret Service and FBI. Prosecutors in court have suggested Zhang could have been trying to spy, but that is not reflected in the court filing Friday. The case so far has called into question foreigners' interest in Mar-a-Lago and the President's family, and the security at the compound President Donald Trump frequents. Trump was staying at the club, but off the property at the time of the alleged incident. Zhang, a 32-year-old consultant who owns a valuable home in China and a BMW, is currently in jail and scheduled for a detention hearing Monday in West Palm Beach federal court. Read More Defense Department charged $300,000 at Trump properties since 2017 Prosecutors have said they'll seek for her to stay in jail because she is a serious flight risk. When asked if she was authorized to be at Mar-a-Lago, a private club owned by the President, she said she was there to attend a ""United Nations Friendship Event,"" which was not actually scheduled to take place. Authorities later found a trove of electronics -- including a signal detector -- and about $8,000 in cash in her hotel room. Her defense lawyers, who at this time are court appointed, have tried to undermine the Secret Service's procedures when agents let her onto the Mar-a-Lago property on March 30. Zhang claimed she paid a Chinese businessman $20,000 to attend the event he promoted, apparently falsely."

Joaquin Phoenix plays Jesus in a new film. Here's the one thing he refused to do. - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Daniel Burke,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/entertainment/joaquin-phoenix-jesus/index.html,"(CNN) When Joaquin Phoenix took on the role of Jesus in the new film ""Mary Magdalene,"" he did many of the expected things: Grew long hair, adopted an intense and otherworldly stare, even meditated on a mountaintop.
But there was one thing he would not do. Near the beginning of ""Mary Magdalene,"" which opened Friday in the United States, the script called for Jesus to heal a blind woman by rubbing mud in her eyes, an echo of John's Gospel . (It's a blind man in the Bible, a blind woman in the film.) ""I knew about that scene from the Bible, but I guess I had never really considered it,"" Phoenix told CNN in a recent interview. ""When I got there, I thought: I'm not going to rub dirt in her eyes. Who the f*!# would do that? It doesn't make any sense. That is a horrible introduction to seeing."" Read More The Bible doesn't fully explain why Jesus used mud or clay to heal the blind, though some experts say it was a common practice among first-century healers. In ""Mary Magdalene,"" Phoenix decided to go with his gut, licking a mudless thumb and gently rubbing the woman's eyes. ""It freed me up, in some ways, to discover what is truthful in the moment,"" he said. ""That moment is not so much about a real miracle. It's about someone who has been dismissed by society finally being seen, embraced and encouraged to join the broader community. To me, that is a miracle. There's something profoundly beautiful about that sentiment."" That humanistic message captures the essence of ""Mary Magdalene,"" a film that aims for historic fidelity in some respects, but whose emotional and intellectual currents are radically contemporary. Rooney Mara plays the film's title role as a spiritual seeker and kindred soul to Jesus. A spiritual but not religious film The filmmakers' aim was to ""rescue"" the title character, telling Jesus' story from a feminine (and feminist) point of view. Embodied by a lithe and luminous Rooney Mara, Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a spiritual seeker and kindred soul to Jesus. Their bond perplexes and irks the other apostles, particularly Peter, who seeks to marginalize Mary. In that and other respects, ""Mary Magdalene"" seems to draw inspiration from both the #MeToo movement and the ""Gospel of Mary,"" an apocryphal book discovered in 1896. Somewhat ironically, the film's US distribution was delayed for several years after the Weinstein Co. folded during the real life #MeToo scandal. The director, Garth Davis, who drew acclaim for his first feature film, ""Lion,"" said he felt ""disconnected"" from church while growing up in Australia. Like a growing number of Westerners, his spiritual life lay outside of organized religion, another theme prevalent in ""Mary Magdalene."" ""I didn't want to make a religious film,"" Davis told CNN in an interview. ""I wanted to make a spiritual film."" In one pivotal scene, Mary strongly suggests that the apostles have clouded Jesus' message with their own. The coming kingdom that Jesus preached is not something we can see with our eyes, she tells Peter. It is the contentment of a soul that has renounced resentment and anger, that grows with every act of love and care. ""It's not a place that you can get there and stay forever,"" Mara told CNN in an interview. ""It's a choice you have to make every day, every moment."" In the film, Peter tells Mary that she's wrong, accusing her of weakening their movement and Jesus himself. Nevertheless, she persists. ""I will not be silent,"" Mary says. ""I will be heard."" Chiwetel Ejiofor as the Apostle Peter and Mara as Mary Magdalene. Whether ""Mary Magdalene"" accurately portrays its title character is a question for scholars. But its presentation of a woman challenging the patriarchal structure of organized religion is firmly of this moment. Even before the #MeToo explosion, women in conservative Christian circles have been pushing back against strictures that have often sidelined and silenced them. For centuries, Mary Magdalene herself was buried beneath false conflations with other biblical characters and called a demon-possessed whore. Not until 1969 did the Catholic Church's cease to identify her with the ""sinful woman"" who anoints Jesus' feet in Scripture. The church later gave Mary Magdalene her due, calling her the Apostle of the Apostles because she was the first to witness the resurrected Jesus. Mara, who was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools, said she was initially reluctant to take the title role. ""I had all these preconceived ideas about Mary Magdalene and about religion in general, a lot of baggage that made me hesitate,"" Mara said. ""It wasn't until speaking to Garth and looking at the story as an adult, without that baggage from Catholic school, that I could strip it back and see it with fresh eyes."" Even in the modern age, the urge to sexualize Mary Magdalene apparently runs strong, with popular books and movies proposing that the bond between Jesus was more than spiritual. In ""Mary Magdalene,"" their kinship is deeply emotional but not sexual. Mary alone sees the toll that Jesus' life has taken on his mind and body. ""The heart of the relationship is an understanding that they both see themselves in each other,"" Mara said. ""Mary has felt out of place her entire life, and they really understand each other in a way no one else can. There is a deep love there."" What will Christians see in 'Mary Magdalene'? Films about Jesus and the early Christians often have to pass through a narrow gate. If they are too pious, they risk turning away secular viewers. If they take risks and go ""off-Scripture,"" they could alienate religious believers. That's true of ""Mary Magdalene"" as well, said Kutter Callaway, an assistant professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary, an evangelical school in California. ""Many conservatives will get angry immediately if they even pretend to have a piece of art that puts words directly in Jesus' mouth that are not from Scripture."" Nonetheless, Callaway, who has seen the film, said it ""feminizes"" Jesus in a ""good way."" By de-centering the Jesus story and focusing on women, the film shows just how radical it was for a woman such as Mary Magdalene to give up her home and family to follow Jesus. ""It forces the viewer to be driven and oriented by gritty, on-the-ground female concerns,"" Callaway said. ""There's a pervasive threat of violence that even now is always in play. It's a very different message from most films about Jesus, but it is also really important for today, when we are having conversations in the religious community and more broadly about how women are treated."" In one terrifying scene, Mary's family performs an exorcism on her, thinking that her extraordinary behavior is the result of demonic possession. But already some conservative Christians have criticized ""Mary Magdalene,"" calling its message ""heresy"" and saying that it cannot be accurate since it relies on texts that are not in the Bible. Phoenix's portrayal of Jesus, too, is far from the ""shiny, happy, super-powered"" Christ of many Jesus films, Callaway said. ""Mary Magdalene"" captures Jesus in his later years, when he is wearied by his past and worried about his future. As portrayed by Phoenix, he is often disheveled and remote, more the prophetic Man of Sorrows than the exalted King of Kings. His slow burn in the temple as he watches the money lenders sell animal sacrifices, a prefiguring of his own sacrificial crucifixion, captures the film's ambivalence about Jesus' mission. ""Mary Magdalene"" captures Jesus in his later years, with Phoenix often disheveled and remote. Phoenix said he sought to portray the humanity of Jesus while recognizing his divinity as well. ""What the film is saying is that all of us contain both of those things simultaneously. That's my personal belief."" How does an actor convey that belief on screen? ""The key for me was not to apply any rules to the character,"" he told CNN. ""There are times when he is filled with rage and times when he is at peace. He is very much a human being. The one thing we keyed in on was that everything he felt, he felt strongly. I don't know if it was a sixth sense or something else, but he made an effort to listen to others and be deeply empathetic."" After he arrived on set in southern Italy, Phoenix said, his mind was swimming in research and thoughts about Jesus. He decided to go up to the mountains, alone. What did he do up there? ""A bunch of stupid sh** that I'm not going to tell you,"" the actor said with a laugh. ""It was a meditative moment where there is nothing to do and you just stop. Your mind stops. And that is the key."""
Social media progressives are drowning out centrist Democrats (opinions) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,John Avlon,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/opinions/twitter-distortion-2020-dems-avlon/index.html,"John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst and anchor.

(CNN) If you believe what you read on Twitter, you might think the Democratic electorate is made up entirely of proto-socialists trying to ""out-woke"" each other in a daily outrage Olympics.
John Avlon But while social media mobs are loud, they're not the real deal. Study after study shows that if you are getting your opinion of the political state-of-play primarily from social media platforms, you're barking up the wrong feed. Or, as CNN's Harry Enten put it, ""Want to understand the 2020 Democratic primary? Stay off Twitter."" He points out that Democratic electorate polls consistently put Joe Biden ahead of Bernie Sanders in the 2020 race. But you might get the opposite impression if you were looking only at social media. As Enten writes , ""Fans of other candidates (especially Sanders) make their presence known quite loudly...."" In other words, there's a sample set bias. Pew Research dug into this and found that liberal Democrats are especially likely to use social media. Throw in social media algorithms that show people what they are interested in, and this can easily lead to a hive mind. Read More Approximately half of Democrats who describe themselves as moderate or even conservative are far less likely to proselytize on social media . That's not to say that there isn't a growing progressive movement in the Democratic party. But it's not disproportionately dominant. And remember, the number one issue for Democrats in 2020 isn't ideological purity, but who can beat Donald Trump . Donald Trump is sabotaging America's democracy This disparity was displayed on the front page of the New York Times Tuesday in an article titled , ""The Democratic Electorate on Twitter Is Not the Actual Democratic Electorate."" The Times piece features graphics that show that this ""outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered"" by the more centrist and more diverse Democratic voters who are less likely to post political content online. And all along, we thought the ""silent majority"" was just a Republican phenomenon. All this goes hand in hand with the fact that social media tends to skew younger and more liberal. Consider this: Enten's analysis shows that among Democrats who use Twitter, those under 50 outnumber the overall population of Democrats by almost 20 points. But that doesn't represent the reality of the Democratic electorate or the fact that older Americans are far more likely to actually go out and vote . So while social media can give the impression of being a direct connection with the Democratic street, it actually over-samples a new kind of activist elite. It amplifies ideological divides, often drowns out dissent from liberal orthodoxy and leads to what former President Barack Obama recently described as a ""circular firing squad, where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.""

Trump told CBP head he'd pardon him if he were sent to jail for violating immigration law,edition.cnn.com,Jake Tapper,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/trump-cbp-commissioner-pardon/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan he would grant McAleenan a pardon if he were sent to jail for having border agents block asylum seekers from entering the US in defiance of US law, senior administration officials tell CNN.
Trump reportedly made the comment during a visit to the border at Calexico, California, a week ago. It was not clear if the comment was a joke. Two officials briefed on the exchange say the President told McAleenan, since named the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that he ""would pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying US entry to migrants,"" as one of the officials paraphrased. The White House referred CNN to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman told CNN, ""At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal. Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law."" Trump denied reports he offered pardons in a tweet late Friday night. Read More Trump confirms he's looking at releasing detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities The exchange came amid threats by the President to close the border in response to a steep uptick of migrants at the border. In March, there were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry on the southern border, up from 37,390 last March, according to CBP . During his visit to Calexico last Friday, Trump said on camera: ""We're full, our system's full, our country's full -- can't come in! Our country is full, what can you do? We can't handle any more, our country is full. Can't come in, I'm sorry. It's very simple."" Behind the scenes, two sources told CNN, the President told border agents to not let migrants in. Tell them we don't have the capacity, he said. If judges give you trouble, say, ""Sorry, judge, I can't do it. We don't have the room."" RELATED: Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants After the President left the room, agents sought further advice from their leaders, who told them they were not giving them that direction and if they did what the President said they would take on personal liability. You have to follow the law, they were told. Trump has grown frustrated by the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border, placing blame on Democrats and the nation's immigration laws. On Friday, the President said he's considering releasing immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities in part to retaliate against Democrats, undercutting earlier denials from his own administration officials. ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!"" Yet the White House received legal guidance months ago that such a policy would run afoul of the law, open the administration to lawsuits, and ultimately undermine the President's desire to deport undocumented immigrants. WH told by lawyers in February that proposal to drop migrants in sanctuary cities had legal issues In February, according to documents obtained by CNN, the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, John Mitnick, told the White House in writing that such a move could only be done if there was a ""strong, mission-related rationale"" pertaining to the responsibilities of the department."

At two high-stakes hearings on Capitol Hill, Barr said he's worried about potential FBI misconduct at the early stages of the Russia investigation and that he also is scrutinizing how the government obtained secret surveillance warrants against a Trump campaign associate. Barr's surprising announcement came just a few days after President Donald Trump publicly demanded investigations like these . With the Russia probe concluded, Trump has turned his ire to the investigators themselves and has called for a review of their conduct. The attorney general's move is a boon to Trump allies who've clamored for nearly two years that the Russia investigation was a ""witch hunt"" controlled by political partisans who abused government surveillance tools to stop Trump's election. But many of these allegations rely upon theories that are barely supported by evidence or have been debunked in the two-plus years since the investigation began. Of course, there is always more for the public to learn, and Barr could uncover new details that change the calculus.

'Spying' on Trump campaign aides What Barr said: ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal. ... I think there is spying that did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated, and I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated but I need to explore that. I think it's my obligation."" What we know: It's not entirely clear what Barr was referring to with these explosive comments . He's probably referring to how the FBI used secret surveillance and an informant to monitor Trump aides. The surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, has become a rallying cry for Republicans. They say it proves that the FBI abused tools typically meant to target terrorists to instead prey on the Trump campaign. But these talking points ignore critical facts. The surveillance did begin under the Obama administration, but Trump's own appointees at the Justice Department continued it. When it started, Page had already left Trump's campaign. And all four federal judges who approved the warrants and renewals had been appointed by Republican presidents. The FBI controversially used some material from a dossier of explosive memos written by a retired British spy alleging widespread Trump-Russia collusion, in addition to other intelligence that remains redacted, when applying for the first FISA warrant. Republicans have said this is an abuse of US intelligence because the dossier was funded by Democrats who opposed Trump. There's also the informant , a longtime FBI source who met with Page, Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and another Trump campaign official to glean information for investigators about their Russia ties. Trump dubbed this situation ""spygate"" and said it shows that the Obama administration planted a ""spy"" in his campaign. But CNN reported that this isn't true . The informant wasn't spying on Team Trump for political purposes. His role was to assist a serious FBI investigation. Both Page and Papadopoulos later acknowledged having extensive contacts with Russians. Perhaps Barr's review could determine whether the FBI made a mistake by sending the source to talk to people affiliated with an ongoing presidential campaign. The Justice Department's internal watchdog is already examining the informant's role and the FISA warrants on Page. Origins of the Russia investigation What Barr said : ""I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016."" What we know: Trump and his Republican allies have slammed the FBI for starting the investigation in the first place. But their arguments hang on a widely debunked lie that the probe began because of ""the dossier."" That's not true. Bipartisan reports from Congress say the FBI opened the investigation after it got a tip from a foreign diplomat that a Trump campaign aide knew about Russian hacks before the emails were released by WikiLeaks. The adviser was Papadopoulos, who later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts and served two weeks in prison. ""The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an enterprise counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign after receiving information related to Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos,"" according to a 2018 report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee after its own yearlong investigation. Democrats agreed with almost nothing in the GOP report except for this point. Perhaps there is more to the story, and Barr's review could offer context for the FBI's actions in 2016. But Barr could find himself in the awkward position of debunking his boss's favorite conspiracy theory."
"Why Tesla's $35,000 Model 3 remains an endangered species",edition.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/tech/tesla-model-3/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The cheapest version of the Model 3 has become part marketing ploy, part afterthought for Tesla.
Tesla wants to fulfill CEO Elon Musk's long-running promise of a $35,000 car, which he first promised in 2013. It will deliver the first $35,000 version of its Model 3 this weekend. But Tesla doesn't intend to sell many of that version. Six times as many buyers are willing to upgrade their Model 3s than buy the base version, Tesla says. If customers pay $4,500 more than the lowest sticker price, they'll get autopilot features, a slightly longer range on a single charge, as well as some creature comforts, like seat warmers. Tesla announced Thursday that it would no longer sell the $35,000 version online. Every other Tesla can be purchased that way. Customers who want a Tesla at rock bottom price will have to order it by phone or go into a service center or one of its shrinking number of stores. That means many Tesla customers may not even be aware that a $35,000 version is available. Read More ""They're still offering it for the PR value of saying they have a $35,000 car,"" said Kelsey Mays, senior consumer affairs editor of Cars.com. ""It is a little bait and switch, but it's certainly not unprecedented for an automaker to do that."" A $35,000 Tesla has become the latest of Musk's grand promises that the company has struggled to meet. When Musk announced in February that Tesla would finally start making a $35,000 version of the Model 3, he also warned that the company would probably lose money in the first quarter (Tesla will report results on April 24). It demonstrates the difficulty of making money while selling cutting-edge cars at mass-market prices. ""I would guess that Elon Musk saw a point in time years ago where he could sell a $35,000 car and make money on it,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Cox Automotive. ""So he committed to that number. Now they can technically say they have done it. But they realize it's not a good business model. They're probably losing money on each $35,000 car."" Tesla has not commented on the profitability of its different models, But it will make more money on what it calls the Standard Plus, which will start at $39,500. That's because the $35,000 Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are essentially the same car. Tesla downgrades the abilities of the Model 3 Standard version, limiting the miles it can travel on a single charge, blocking some autopilot features and preventing drivers from turning on the seat warmers. ""Making different versions of the same car costs money because it slows down production,"" said Brauer. ""So they've crunched the numbers and decided it's better to make the same car for both the $35,000 version and the $39,500 version."" Tesla and GM electric car sales could get a big boost if this bill passes The more expensive version is still a mass market car. The average transaction price of a new car purchase in the United States is just less than $36,000 according to Kelley Blue Book. ""You can buy a Ford F-150 or a Honda Pilot for far more than $40,000, and they're not luxury models,"" said Brauer. The fact that Tesla is essentially selling the Model 3 with a $39,500 starting price, by making it more difficult to buy one at the long-promised $35,000 price, probably won't hurt the company in the eyes of its customers. ""Tesla shoppers are not bargain hunters. They're early adopters of technology. And they're buying a brand with a premium reputation,"" said Mays."
WH told by lawyers in February that proposal to drop migrants in sanctuary cities had legal issues - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Jake Tapper,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities-migrants/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Though President Donald Trump on Friday publicly revealed his proposal to transport and release undocumented immigrants into sanctuary cities, the White House received legal guidance months ago that such a policy would run afoul of the law, open the administration to lawsuits, and ultimately undermine the President's desire to deport undocumented immigrants.
In February, according to documents obtained by CNN, the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, John Mitnick, told the White House in writing that such a move could only be done if there was a ""strong, mission-related rationale"" pertaining to the responsibilities of DHS. The reasons the President has publicly stated for the policy proposal -- one that senior administration officials tell CNN he has been pushing for behind the scenes for months -- are decidedly not related to the DHS mission statement. ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,"" Trump tweeted Friday. ""The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!"" Mitnick, whose insistence that immigration policies and actions fall within the confines of the law, has aroused the ire of Trump, top aide Stephen Miller and other immigration hardliners in the White House, made it clear in his legal guidance that the ""mission related rationale"" for transporting undocumented immigrants did not include political retaliation. Read More While the department has the legal authority to use its budget to move and release migrants to locations far from where they were apprehended, detained or processed, officials could only do so in a way consistent with what the comptroller general had referred to as ""an authorized agency purpose,"" Mitnick wrote. Examples of this that he cited included providing appropriate health care, fulfilling a transfer request or relieving facility overcrowding. Moreover, Mitnick noted, such a proposal could be self-defeating: transporting an undocumented immigrant to a remote location where he had no ties would increase the likelihood that he would become a flight risk and not attend his removal proceedings. Challenging the White House to provide a ""strong mission-related rationale"" for the proposal, Mitnick noted that even if they could provide such rationales, the new policy would prompt a ""litigation risk"" for the US government for violating the ""due process"" rights of the undocumented immigrants by moving them to places where they have no community, family ties, or employment opportunities. The move would have created grounds for a migrant to claim hardship and increasing the likelihood of habeas litigation accusing the US government of ordering releases that were not ""reasonable,"" he argued. Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment. Senior administration officials tell CNN that Mitnick's legal analysis was shared with the White House and DHS lawyers spoke with the White House Counsel's Office within days to explain their reasoning. ""Once the lawyers explained it, the issue was ultimately dropped,"" an official said. That is, until it broke on Thursday and the President took to Twitter to defend it and bring it back to life on Friday."
Nancy Pelosi suggests tech companies need more regulation: 'It's a new era' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Ashley Killough,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/nancy-pelosi-tech-regulation-recode-interview/index.html,"(CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is signaling support for changing a provision in the law that says internet companies aren't considered publishers of anything that's posted on their platforms, and thus aren't held responsible.
Pelosi, in a podcast interview with Kara Swisher of Recode that published Thursday evening, suggested internet companies were taking advantage of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. ""There has to be a bigger sense of responsibility on it,"" she said of the provision. ""And it is not out of the question that that could be removed."" The California Democrat, who represents San Francisco, said the era of self-regulation for these companies should ""probably"" end -- the latest warning sign for Silicon Valley as Democrats grow increasingly critical of big tech firms and their role in shaping the economy, politics and society. ""I think we have to subject it all to scrutiny and cost-benefits and all that, but I do think that it's a new era,"" she said. Read More Her comments come as Vera Jourová, the European Union Commissioner for Justice who's responsible for data privacy, met with senators as well as the US attorney general in Washington this week. Pelosi said she hasn't closely studied Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up big companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, but said ""there could be some clear lines that we see in our community, of companies that maybe could be easily broken up without having any impact, one on the other."" ""I'm a big believer in the antitrust laws, I think that's very important for us to have them and to use them, and to subject those who should be subjected to it. I don't know how all of these should be painted with the same brush, but I think that's a look that should be taken."" Warren released an aggressive plan last month to break up tech giants, targeting the power of Silicon Valley with her populist message as sprawling Internet giants face mounting political backlash ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The far-reaching proposal would impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies with $25 billion or more in annual revenue, forcing Amazon and Google to spin off parts of their companies and relinquish their overwhelming control over online commerce. The plan also aims to unwind some of the highest profile mergers in the industry, like the combinations of Amazon and Whole Foods, and Google and DoubleClick, as well as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp."

When Woods' birdie putt at the last stayed out the sound of deflation was palpable, but the former world No.1 is in prime position as he chases a 15th major title and first since 2008. Ahead of Woods, though, stands a thicket of major champions -- Francesco Molinari, Jason Day, Brooks Koepka, Adam Scott and Louis Oosthuizen. Read More All proven in the heat of battle, and in 2013 Masters winner Scott and past runners-up Day and Oosthuizen loaded with serious Augusta credentials.

""Felt very good to be out there doing what I was doing. This is now three straight majors that I've been in the mix, so it's good stuff,"" he said afterward. Tiger Woods evoked memories of his heyday at Augusta Friday.

But almost immediately the siren sounded to suspend play because of a threat of thunderstorms. When the all clear came half an hour later, Woods missed the birdie putt, and squandered another birdie chance under persistent drizzle on the 13th. But after an errant drive into trees on the left of the 14th, he weaved a stunning second through a gap in the timber to find the green. As Woods moved off and the crowd closed in, a rushing marshal slipped and collided with Woods' ankle. Woods recoiled and limped off, but was none the worse for it. ""I'm good. Accidents happen,"" said Woods. Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos The Masters, Augusta – The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April.

""Ill people in this outbreak report eating ground beef at home and in restaurants,"" the CDC said in its outbreak update. No single supplier, distributor or brand has been identified as the source of the outbreak. Therefore, no recall has been issued, and the CDC is not recommending that consumers avoid ground beef at this time or that restaurants stop serving it. Illnesses are now being reported in six states : Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and Indiana. Mystery E. coli outbreak sickens 72 people in 5 states, CDC says That's one more state and 13 more illnesses since the previous update reported by the CDC on Tuesday. Read More As part of the investigation, 75 of those reporting illnesses have been interviewed by health investigators. Eighty-four of them reported eating ground beef in the week before their symptoms began, according to the CDC. Symptoms include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. They begin, on average, three to four days after ingesting the bacteria. Most people recover in five to seven days. The first reported symptoms from this outbreak began March 2. Seventeen patients have been hospitalized due to their illness. Federal, state and local health officials are continuing to investigate. In the meantime, the CDC reminds consumers to prevent E. coli by washing hands, cooking ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a meat thermometer, and keeping foods that aren't cooked away from raw beef to prevent cross-contamination."

Few series approach the estimated 30 million viewers that ""Thrones"" averaged last year from all sources, a feat made even more impressive given that subscription-based HBO is in far fewer homes than broadcast and basic cable shows. Yet while the show nears the finish line -- at least in this form -- the channel that airs it has reached a crossroads, and the end of a corporate era. HBO marks this latest milestone while undergoing a management overhaul, one that's unusual for a place characterized in part by its stability and institutional knowledge. New owner AT&T ( T ) has pressed for an evolution of the network's strategy, seeking to meet the challenge from the streaming barbarians at the gate. (AT&T also owns CNN's parent company WarnerMedia) HBO's longtime CEO Richard Plepler announced his resignation in February after 28 years with the company, and a number of other senior employees at the network -- which earned autonomy thanks to regular annual profits exceeding $1 billion ---- have followed suit by taking a buyout package, or are contemplating whether to do so. Read More Meanwhile, HBO is looking to reload its programming lineup with a barrage of new series and key returning ones, like ""Big Little Lies,"" hoping to piggyback on ""Game of Thrones'"" huge sendoff as a promotional springboard. Game of Thrones cast at season 3 red carpet premiere The TV world, however, has changed dramatically from ""The Sopranos'"" goodbye a dozen years ago. Netflix ( NFLX ) has become a major rival -- matching HBO's Emmy haul last year, and ending its streak as the most-nominated network. Other new rivals, including Amazon, Hulu and a coming challenge from Apple, have joined networks like Showtime, FX and AMC in aggressively courting the prestige marketplace. How 'Game of Thrones' conquered TV with drama and dragons Standing out from the crowd has thus become more difficult, making the enormous investment in a project like ""Thrones"" -- one of the most expensive ever produced for television -- more perilous if it doesn't deliver. On April 3, HBO hosted its last ""Game of Thrones"" premiere, the kind of lavish party for which the channel is known. A crowd filled Radio City Music Hall in New York, where HBO assembled dozens of actors who have appeared in the series, many of whose characters had met a violent end. At the screening D.B. Weiss, who with producing partner David Benioff brought author George R.R. Martin's creation to the screen, summed up the mood. He conspicuously thanked Plepler for having faith in the show, before talking about the ride that the cast and crew have enjoyed together. ""It's possible no one will have an experience like this again,"" he said. Bob Greenblatt The new team at HBO will be eager to prove that wrong, with AT&T having made the network a central pillar of its plans for a streaming service that is scheduled for launch later this year. Although the premiere marked a celebration, it took on a more somber and nostalgic tone. The question is whether that amounts to a temporary chill or augurs a long winter. Bob Greenblatt, the former entertainment chief at NBC and before that HBO rival Showtime, joined the company in March as chairman of entertainment and director to consumer, with oversight of HBO. As ""The Sopranos"" baton pass demonstrated, the TV business has a way of confounding expectations and predictions. If it's premature to state there won't be another premium series with ""Game of Thrones""-scale scale, it's fair to say there won't be a mob capable of making a legitimate claim as its heir."
Amber Heard details why she called Johnny Depp 'the Monster' in court filing - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/entertainment/amber-heard-johnny-depp-abuse/index.html,"(CNN) Amber Heard has outlined the abuse she says she experienced by her former husband, Johnny Depp, as she fights a $50 million defamation suit he has filed against her.
In an affidavit obtained by CNN and included in Heard's motion to have the case against her dismissed, the actress alleges that a year into their relationship, she began to witness the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star abusing drugs and alcohol. ""Whenever he was using I worried for both of us,"" Heard stated in the filing. ""He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, 'the Monster.'"" The court documents detail multiple instances of alleged abuse in which Heard claims that Depp hit her, threw bottles, yelled at her, shoved Heard, pulled out chunks of her hair and at one point strangled her. ""I remember being afraid that Johnny might not know when to stop, and that he might kill me,"" Heard said in the filing. Read More In response to the allegations, Depp's attorney, Adam Waldman, told CNN, ""A hoax confronted with the reality of evidence requires new lies to sustain itself."" ""Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard. Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse,"" Heard's attorney, Eric George, said in a statement to CNN. ""It is regrettable that it will take a judge to finally end the persistent harassment of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp, but Ms. Heard will take whatever action is necessary to vindicate the truth."" Depp's suit, which was filed last month in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, was sparked by an op-ed Heard wrote for the Washington Post in December. The actress wrote of the ""wrath"" she says she faced after becoming a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"" two years prior, seemingly in reference to when her abuse allegations against Depp first became public, but she did not name Depp as her alleged abuser in the op-ed. Depp's suit charges that while the actor is not named, ""the op-ed plainly was about (and other media consistently characterized it as being about) Ms. Heard's purported victimization after she publicly accused her former husband, Johnny Depp (""Mr. Depp), of domestic abuse in 2016, when she appeared in court with an apparently battered face and obtained a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp on May 27, 2016."" Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship timeline That occurred two days after Heard filed for divorce in 2016. The couple, who met on the set of ""The Rum Diary"" in 2009, married in 2015 and went on to be embroiled in a contentious split for months, with charges of bad behavior levied by both sides. Depp denied the accusations at the time, and through his representatives, claimed Heard made up the abuse. The estranged couple settled their divorce months later, released a statement saying they ""have agreed to resolve their divorce proceeding privately."" ""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,"" the statement read. Heard also withdrew her petition to extend a restraining order against Depp. Depp's suit charged that Heard's allegations led to financial losses for him, including being dropped from future ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films after leading the franchise for 15 years. Heard alleges in her filing that she also lost work, including a part in a movie and a campaign with a ""global fashion brand."""
Cursive writing's been making a comeback and Texas is the latest - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/cursive-is-coming-back-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) It's a familiar refrain. Parents lament that technology is turning good, legible handwriting into a lost art form for their kids.
In response, lawmakers in state after state -- particularly in the South -- are carving out space in teachers' classroom time to keep the graceful loops of cursive writing alive for the next generation. Alabama passed a law requiring it in 2016. That same year, Louisiana passed its own cursive law. Others like Arkansas, Virginia, California, Florida, North Carolina , have similar laws. Texas is the latest state in which educators are pushing to bring back cursive writing in elementary schools. The changes in the Lone Star State, which were adopted in 2017, are set to go into effect during the upcoming 2019-20 school year. Read More Each state's curriculum differs in subtle ways. The roadmap described in the Texas Education Code , for instance, includes requirements for instruction to begin with teaching second graders how to form cursive letters with the ""appropriate strokes when connecting letters."" Third graders would focus on writing complete words, thoughts, and answers to questions, and fourth graders would need to be able to complete their assignments outright in cursive. Cursive is again becoming widespread across the South Data compiled by the Southern Regional Education Board in 2016 showed that 14 of the 16 states the SREB oversees expect that cursive instruction begin by the third grade. The year 2010 was a ""pivotal year"" for the cursive comeback, the SREB says. That's when ""college- and career-readiness standards did not explicitly include it,"" including the national Common Core standards. The SREB showed the number of cursive-teaching states dropping from 12 down to six that year. But by 2016, the flowing script has rebounded up to 14 Southern states. With another Southern state, Texas, coming on board that make 18 total in the US. Advocates for handwriting have struggled against technological change Anne Trubek, the author of "" The History and Uncertain Future of Handwriting ,"" told CNN that efforts to emphasize cursive have been ongoing ""for years."" And debates about whether we should preserve handwriting are not a strictly modern phenomena, as various periods in history featured standoffs between traditionalists and those who favored new writing and communication technologies. In ancient Greece, Socrates had opposed writing outright, Trubek noted. The philosopher preferred the Greeks' oral tradition and felt those who didn't write things down would preserve a ""better memory,"" she said. Later, monks in the Middle Ages agitated against the invention of the printing press, which threatened to make their beautiful, hand-copied texts obsolete. As inventions like the printing press and the Internet catapult humanity forward, ""there will be a loss,"" Trubek said. In the history of handwriting, we're in a unique place in which most Americans alive learned cursive writing, and efforts to re-instill cursive in a new generation of youth represented a new ""reaction"" to ongoing change, she said. A handwriting scholar doesn't think cursive is an essential modern skill Today, debates in favor of cursive take the form of ""tradition strangely grafted onto patriotism,"" she said, nothing that some legislators complained that if students didn't learn how to write in cursive, then they wouldn't be able to read the Declaration of Independence. Trubek, who served as a tenured professor at Oberlin College, said she herself can't read the original flowing script of the Declaration of Independence, and there was nothing wrong with students reading the nation's founding documents in transcribed versions with fonts legible to modern eyes. Trubek also said students didn't necessarily need cursive to come up with their own signature that conferred their ""indviduality"" and ""uniqueness"" in signing legal forms either. She said technology like the chips in credit cards were more effective in preventing fraud than in pen-and-paper signatures that can be forged. ""I don't think children should be required to learn cursive if they don't want to,"" Trubek said. But, still, she said careful, thoughtful has its virtues. ""It's a fine motor skill,"" and taking time to skillfully perfect the art has positive effects on students' cognitive development. ""Handwriting is slower,"" Trubek said, ""And sometimes you just want to slow down."""

Trump Fed pick Stephen Moore is a self-described 'radical' who said he's not a 'big believer in democracy',edition.cnn.com,"Andrew Kaczynski and Paul LeBlanc, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/stephen-moore-kfile/index.html,"(CNN) Stephen Moore, who President Donald Trump announced last month as his nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has a history of advocating self-described ""radical"" views on the economy and government.
In speeches and radio interviews reviewed by CNN's KFile, Moore advocated for eliminating the corporate and federal income taxes entirely, calling the 16th Amendment that created the income tax the ""most evil"" law passed in the 20th century. Moore's economic worldview envisions a slimmed down government and a rolled back social safety net. He has called for eliminating the Departments of Labor, Energy and Commerce, along with the IRS and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. He has questioned the need for both the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education. He has said there's no need for a federal minimum wage, called for privatizing the ""Ponzi scheme"" of Social Security and said those on government assistance lost their dignity and meaning. In other interviews and appearances, Moore repeatedly said he believed capitalism was more important than democracy. Trump announced he would nominate Moore to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last month. Moore works at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He served as an adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and is a friend of the president's economic adviser Larry Kudlow. He was formerly a CNN contributor. Read More The nomination immediately drew criticism because Moore has been a fierce critic of the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell. In 2015 , he called for abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold standard (Moore told CNN's Erin Burnett on Thursday he changed his mind on the gold standard. He told CNN's KFile on Friday he no longer believed in abolishing the Federal Reserve). In a column in December , Moore called for Powell to resign for hiking interest rates. Moore claimed the comments were probably written ""in a time of anger,"" but in February, he called Powell one of Trump's ""worst appointments"" and called for firing hundreds of employees at the Federal Reserve Board who he called ""worthless"" economists. ""There's no bigger swamp in Washington than the Federal Reserve Board,"" Moore said in a February interview posted on Vimeo . ""It's filled with hundreds of economists who are worthless, who have the wrong model in their mind. They should all be, they should all be fired and they should be replaced by good economists."" Turning to Powell, Moore said, ""I spoke to the President last week about this and he was extremely upset that he had, I think made -- it was one of his worst political appointments -- and now he's stuck with the guy for, I think he's under a four-or-five-year appointment."" Views on taxes Moore has repeatedly called for a ""radical"" plan to grow the economy by getting rid of the corporate income tax and personal income tax. ""We have to eliminate the corporate income tax entirely in my opinion because it is just a millstone around the neck of this economy,"" Moore said on a 2012 panel . Speaking in 2015, Moore called for getting rid of the income tax and moving to a national sales tax. ""What is the income tax rate in Texas and Florida,"" Moore said. ""Zero. There is no income tax. Why can't we have no income tax on the federal level. Let's get rid of the damn income tax and do taxes like we do in Texas and Florida. So Texas and Florida have no income tax."" Speaking on the Glenn Beck Program in 2007, a transcript of which is available on the Web Archive, Moore called the 16th amendment -- which created the federal income tax -- ""the most the most evil act that has passed in 100 years."" Views on capitalism and democracy Moore has repeatedly said he believes capitalism is more important than democracy. In an interview for Michael Moore's 2009 film ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" Moore said he wasn't a big believer in democracy. ""Capitalism is a lot more important than democracy,"" Moore said. ""I'm not even a big believer in democracy. I always say that democracy can be two wolves and a sheep deciding on what to have for dinner. Look, I'm in favor of people having the right to vote and things like that. But there are a lot of countries that have the right to vote that are still poor. Democracy doesn't always lead to a good economy or even a good political system."" Speaking on the Thom Hartmann Show in 2010 , Moore reiterated this belief, saying Hitler was democratically elected and Saudi Arabia wouldn't be better off as a democracy. ""I think capitalism, without free market capitalism, countries don't get rich,"" Moore said, when asked if capitalism was more important than democracy. ""And so I would rather have a country that's based on, you know, a free enterprise system of property rights and free exchange of free trade of low tax rates, than a country that state, there are a lot of democracies --."" In a 2010 speech , Moore said he believed democracy meant that Democrats have an ""intentional"" plan to take voters off the income tax rolls and have them vote for expanding government. Moore told CNN's KFile, ""I believe in free market capitalism and representative government. It is what has made America the greatest nation and the most prosperous nation on earth."" Views on the minimum wage, social security, and welfare Moore has repeatedly expressed a desire to rollback the social safety net in the country, including Social Security, which he has called ""the soft underbelly of the welfare state"" and frequently said is ""a Bernie Madoff-style Ponzi scheme that will eventually sink into insolvency unless reformed."" Moore told CNN's KFile he believes in letting young people put their retirement savings in 401K accounts on a voluntary basis instead of Social Security and that wouldn't cut benefits to those already on it. Speaking at an event in 2014, Moore said those on government assistance ---- ""the dole"" ---- were depleted of dignity or meaning in their lives. ""You know, we have too many people dependent on government and the cost isn't so much of what it costs our fisc -- you know, the fiscal situation, it's really expensive. The cost, it just depletes people of their dignity and their meaning in life,"" he said. ""I mean, there's nothing worse than being on the dole, right?"" Moore told CNN's KFile, ""There are too many people on welfare and the best way to help the poor is to get them a job and good schools and economic opportunity. The welfare state hurts the very people it has supposed to have helped. No one should go hungry or homeless or without basic health care, but there is abetted (sic) way than handouts."" Medicaid, Moore said in February 2018, was a ""dumbass"" system. ""You cannot come up -- I said this earlier this morning to one of the sessions, some of you may have been in it -- you truly could not come up with a dumber system than Medicaid. I mean really, I mean if we sat here and tried to think how can we make the dumbass, you know, Medicaid system the worst system possible we would come up with what they have right now."" Moore told CNN's KFile he stood by his comments on Medicaid, saying he'd instead give ""the poor a medical savings account and let them buy health care in the open market."" And a federal minimum wage, Moore said last year at a Heritage Foundation event, is not necessary. ""You don't need a federal minimum wage. You need, you need pro-growth policies that will cause companies to raise the ratio."" Moore told CNN's KFile he doesn't want to abolish the minimum wage."
Kushner registered as a Republican just ahead of 2018 midterms,edition.cnn.com,Maegan Vazquez,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/jared-kushner-voter-registration-republican/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House senior adviser Jared Kushner registered as a Republican ahead of the 2018 midterm elections , New York state voter registration records obtained by CNN show.
His switch from no party affiliation to the Republican Party came about a year and a half after he joined his father-in-law, President Donald Trump, in Washington to work at the White House. According to voter registration documents, Kushner requested an absentee ballot and registered as a Republican on September 20, 2018 -- just over a month before he cast his absentee ballot in November. Vice News first reported on Kushner's party change. Elections board: Our error Kushner listed as female Voting records indicate that Kushner registered to vote in the state in 2009 and voted in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2018. Prior to voting in New York, Nexis records show Kushner was registered to vote in New Jersey for 10 years, where he did not choose to affiliate with a political party on paper. Read More In 2017, the New York Board of Elections acknowledged a report which said Kushner had been misidentified as a female on his voter registration form. It has since been corrected. Though Kushner is registered in New York, he and his wife, White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, also maintain a residence in Washington, which they began renting when they took their jobs in the West Wing. Prior to Trump's presidential run, the couple had made donations to, and fundraised for, Democrats, including hosting a fundraiser for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who is pursuing the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination."
"Controversial Colorado gun bill becomes law, 11 sheriffs willing to choose jail over enforcement - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Scott McLean,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/colorado-red-flag-gun-laws/index.html,"(CNN) Colorado's controversial ""red flag"" bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis on Friday, with more than half of the state's counties declaring opposition to it and many sheriffs promising not to enforce it at all.
""This is a moment of progress,"" said Colorado House Majority Leader Alec Garnett, one of the legislation's four sponsors. ""Today, we did something that was difficult and that is going to save lives."" Known as the ""Extreme Risk Protection Order,"" the law will allow a family member, a roommate or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily seize a person's firearms if they are deemed a risk to themselves or others. Fourteen other states have passed similar legislation. Still, the law now faces major hurdles, with a pro-gun lobby group promising to challenge it in court. Additionally, a growing number of sheriffs in the state have vowed to ignore the law when it takes effect next year, calling it unconstitutional. Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams told CNN last month that he would rather be found in contempt of court and locked up in his own county jail than carry out a court order to seize a person's weapon. Read More At least 10 other sheriffs contacted by CNN are lining up behind Reams, saying they are prepared to go to jail rather than enforce a law they believe would violate a person's constitutional rights. ""How many judges are going to send all the sheriffs in Colorado who are standing up to this to jail?"" wondered Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, who is among the sheriffs willing to choose jail over enforcement. Garnett said he wasn't concerned about sheriffs being locked up. ""What I'm going to lose sleep over is, if that's the choice that they make, and someone loses their life, someone in crisis goes on a shooting spree, (or) someone commits suicide"" because a gun wasn't taken away, he said. Laws that remove firearms from those considered a safety risk reduce gun-related suicides, study finds Already, 38 of Colorado's 64 counties have officially declared their opposition to the bill, and 35 of them have passed formal resolutions against the law. Many of the resolutions declare the jurisdictions to be Second Amendment ""sanctuary"" or ""preservation"" counties, and pledge not to allocate resources to enforcement of the law. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser he is ""confident that when and if the time comes, all law enforcement officials will follow the rule of law."" Reams insists he's not bluffing. So does Prowers County Sheriff Sam Zordel. ""I've already asked the coroner if he wanted to come over (to the jail) and get some training,"" he said, explaining that if he becomes an inmate, the coroner would be tasked with running the county jail. This Colorado sheriff is willing to go to jail rather than enforce a proposed gun law Others took a more measured approach. ""I'm willing to go to my jail for it, the only exception would be a totally extreme case and most sheriffs would agree with that,"" said Park County Sheriff Tom McGraw. The law is meant to be used only in the most extreme cases, but critics believe it will allow for guns to be taken based on a false accusation. A non-partisan analysis of the bill by Colorado's Legislative Council Staff predicted that the number of false red flag petitions would be minimal, and that the law would only be used 170 times per year. California and Washington use similar red flag laws even less than that, though a similar law in Maryland is enforced six times more often than the Colorado estimate. Legal challenges could be on the way ""Rocky Mountain Gun Owners is going to file a lawsuit against the red flag legislation before the end of the session,"" the lobby group's executive director, Dudley Brown, said. The legislative session ends May 3. Brown also said there could be a second lawsuit filed after the bill becomes law, but declined to provide more details. Brown is also planning recall efforts of ""at least 10"" state lawmakers who supported the legislation. Two Colorado lawmakers were successfully recalled in 2013 after supporting controversial background check legislation and a restriction on magazine size. The El Paso County Sheriff's office initially said the county would file a lawsuit when the legislation became law. The county now says it is still ""in the brainstorming phase"" of a potential lawsuit, according to county spokesman Matt Steiner. New York's governor, joined by Nancy Pelosi, signs 'red flag' gun protection law According to the Giffords Law Center, which lobbies for tougher gun laws, there have not been any successful legal challenges of any similar state laws. There is, however, an ongoing complaint in an Illinois district court asking for an injunction, arguing that the law violates the Second and 14th amendments. Assuming Colorado's law withstands a court challenge, defiant local sheriffs are on a legal collision course with the state. State law enforcement agencies like the Colorado State Patrol do ""not have the authority to supersede local control,"" and seize the guns instead, according to Shelby Wieman, a spokeswoman for Gov. Polis. Polis is confident that law enforcement will not ignore court orders to seize weapons, but if they do, it would be for the district courts or the state attorney general to resolve. Ignoring gun laws versus immigration laws The declaration of a ""sanctuary county"" borrows the phrasing used by immigration advocates to describe jurisdictions where local law enforcement does not cooperate with federal immigration authorities, even when undocumented immigrants charged with crimes enter local jails. If it's OK to ignore immigration laws, why can't Colorado counties ignore gun laws? University of Denver law professor John Campbell said local law enforcement ""can't choose not to enforce their state's law."" But the enforcement of federal laws, such as immigration legislation, are voluntary for local authorities. If a sheriff were to ignore a court order to seize a person's guns and they use them to hurt someone, Campbell believes the sheriff could be held liable. Law enforcement has immunity for genuine mistakes, but not for recklessness or blatantly ignoring their legal duty. ""Those are classic conditions to create liability even when people typically would enjoy immunity,"" he said. While the legal obligation to enforce court-ordered gun seizures is different than enforcing immigration laws, Campbell said the outcomes can be the same -- someone getting hurt or killed. Kate Steinle In 2015, 31-year-old Kate Steinle was killed by an undocumented immigrant who was released from jail despite a request from federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to turn him over. A federal appeals court ruled last month that Steinle's parents cannot sue over San Francisco's ""sanctuary"" policy that allowed her killer to avoid deportation and walk free. Garnett said sheriffs should enforce the new gun law, but wouldn't make a statement on enforcing immigration law. ""Immigration laws are primarily federal issues and I'm not going to get into that,"" he said. Sheriff Reams acknowledged his risk of liability for ignoring a court-ordered gun seizure, but he's not worried. ""The person who commits a crime against another is truly the person responsible,"" he said, adding that if a person is mentally ill, he would use existing laws to detain them for treatment. ""We still intend to deal with the person."""
'Crying girl' picture near US border wins World Press Photo of the Year - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jason Hanna, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/crying-girl-john-moore-immigration-photo-of-the-year/index.html,"(CNN) A photo of a 2-year-old girl crying near the US-Mexico border -- a child who became an iconic face of President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy last year -- has won the World Press Photo of the Year award.
The image, titled ""Crying Girl on the Border,"" was taken by Getty photographer and Pulitzer Prize-winner John Moore on June 12 near McAllen, Texas. The Netherlands-based World Press Photo organization announced the award Thursday evening at a ceremony in Amsterdam. ""I think this image touched many people's hearts, as it did mine, because it humanizes a larger story,"" the organization quoted Moore as saying . Before the photo was taken, the Honduran girl and her mother had rafted with others across the Rio Grande and were stopped in Texas by US Border Patrol agents. Read More Agents were searching people before they were put into vans to be driven to a processing center. Moore took the award-winning picture after the toddler's mother set her down so that the mother could be searched. ""One of the last people to get on the bus was the mother of this child and her daughter together,"" Moore told CNN's Ana Cabrera last year . ""And when they went to body-search (the mother) against the vehicle, they asked her to put down her child. And right then, in that moment, the little girl broke into tears."" The annual photo award, decided by a jury of photojournalists and photographers , carries a prize of 10,000 euros (nearly $11,300). Photo appeared as controversy about immigration policy heated up Photos that Moore took of the girl that night were widely published amid a fierce public debate last year about the Trump administration's immigration policies, which effectively resulted in children being separated from adults after they crossed the US border from Mexico. Children could not follow their adult family members or guardians into custody, so US guidelines mandated that those children be separated -- often from their parents. After the picture was published, US Customs and Border Protection said the girl and her mother had not been separated . Later that month, Trump signed an executive order reversing the policy to separate children from adults. A similar photo was used in a Time magazine cover A different photo of the girl -- taken by Moore on the same night, with the crying girl gazing upward -- was used as part of Time magazine's July 2 cover .

Elijah Cummings says he will issue 'friendly subpoena' to Trump accounting firm - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/elijah-cummings-subpoena-mazars-usa/index.html,"(CNN) House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said Friday he will issue what he has previously called a ""friendly subpoena"" to the accounting firm that prepared several years' worth of President Donald Trump's financial statements.
The accounting firm, Mazars USA , had requested such a subpoena from the committee before providing records, and Cummings wrote to committee members he would serve it on Monday. Bank tells House Democrats to issue subpoena if they want Trump financial documents Cummings had requested financial information from Mazars USA dating back 10 years after Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen accused Trump of inflating his net worth in an attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills football team. Cohen provided the committee with Trump's financial statements from 2011, 2012 and 2013 that were prepared by Mazars USA. ""Counsel to Mazars sent a response letter explaining that, pursuant, to the company's legal obligations, Mazars cannot voluntarily turn over the documents 'unless disclosure is made pursuant to, among other things, a congressional subpoena,"" Cummings wrote in his memo to committee members. Cummings and other Democratic committee chairman have been seeking Trump's financial information as part of a plethora of probes into the President and his businesses. Cummings and two other committee chairmen have also requested financial information related to the Trump International Hotel from Capital One, which also requested a subpoena before providing material to Congress. Read More Republicans accused Cummings of abusing the committee's oversight powers in targeting Trump's finances, arguing it's outside of the committee's purview. ""Chairman Cummings's announcement of a subpoena to a private company to pry into the President's personal finances is an astonishing abuse of this Committee's authority and a disgraceful departure from the fair and legitimate oversight he promised,"" Oversight's top Republican, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, said in a statement Friday. But Cummings responded to Republicans in his memo Friday, accusing Jordan of taking ""unprecedented"" action writing to Mazars urging the company not to comply with Cummings' request. This is the first subpoena Cummings has issued as chairman where the committee did not hold a markup to vote on the subpoena. Cummings wrote that he cannot hold a markup because Congress is in recess for the next two weeks, but he instead offered members to send the committee feedback before the subpoena is issued on Monday. House committee chairmen have powers to issue subpoenas unilaterally, but both Cummings and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler have opted to hold markups for their subpoenas so far in the new Congress. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday."
"Sudan will prosecute Bashir but won't hand him over, military says",rss.cnn.com,"Farai Sevenzo, Sarah El Sirgany and Nima Elbagir",04-12-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/cCUZ-zp2c18/index.html,"(CNN) Sudan's ruling military council will prosecute deposed President Omar al-Bashir but will not extradite him, a military officer said Friday.
In a press conference, the head of transitional military council's political committee Lt. General Omar Zein Alabedin vowed to try Bashir, forced out of power in a military coup on Thursday morning, and said that the army would help pave the path to democratic transition. Bashir faces five counts of crimes against humanity and two counts of war crimes at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague in connection with Sudanese military actions in Darfur between 2003 and 2008. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir looks on as he receives his Egyptian counterpart at Khartoum International Airport outside the Sudanese capital on October 25, 2018. The United Nations human rights office called on Sudan on Friday to cooperate with the ICC. ""We do encourage the authorities in Sudan to fully cooperate with the ICC. There is a Security Council resolution as far back as 2005 calling on the government of Sudan to fully cooperate with and provide assistance,"" UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said in a Geneva press briefing. The ICC issued two arrest warrants for Bashir, first in March 2009 and then in July 2010. It now considers him to be ""at large."" Read More Joy turns into fear Protesters who rushed on to the streets to celebrate the ouster of the Sudanese strongman are facing the prospect of a long struggle ahead as the military figures who ended his 30-year rule seem to be preparing to hang on to power. As news of Bashir's downfall was still reverberating around the world, a military council dissolved the government, suspended the country's constitution and declared a three-month state of emergency. The military said it will remain in control for at least two years to oversee a ""transition of power,"" leading to dismay from protesters and outside observers that elections will not be held anytime soon. On Thursday, regime forces and regime-aligned militia killed 13 peaceful protesters with live ammunition, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors. Two of the dead were killed in Khartoum, one dead in Atbara and eight were killed in Darfur, according to CCSD. Sudanese protesters gather near the military headquarters in Khartoum as they continue to rally demanding a civilian body to lead the transition to democracy one day after a military council took control of the country, on April 12, 2019. In a statement, the African Union said that a military takeover ""is not the appropriate response to the challenges facing Sudan and the aspirations of its people."" It added that Sudan was a signatory to international treaties which ""strongly condemn any unconstitutional change of Government and commit member states to the respect of the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights."" On Thursday, protesters celebrating their victory over Bashir quickly turned to chanting against the country's defense minister, Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf, who made a statement explaining the military's seizure of power on state TV. Ibn Auf was sworn in as head of the military transitional council hours later. ""The people want to topple Ibn Auf,"" a crowd chanted in Khartoum. The group that has been leading the anti-government protests, the Sudanese Professionals Association, or SPA, has rejected the ""coup declaration,"" and has called on people to press on with demonstrations and to stage a sit-in outside military headquarters. The group said protests would continue until ""power is handed over to a civilian transitional government."" ""The regime has conducted a military coup to reproduce the same faces and entities that our great people have revolted against,"" the SPA, an umbrella organization of doctors, lawyers and journalists, said in a statement, Thursday. ""Those who destroyed the country and killed its people want to appropriate every drop of blood shed by the great people of Sudan during their revolution."" Speaking to CNN, activist Omar al-Neel said that ""the street refuses totally the announcement by Ibn Auf."" ""All Sudanese people are in the street and demanding the downfall of the regime and not recycling the same people,"" he said. Late Friday, in a statement on state news, Ibn Auf announced he would step down from his position as the head of the military transitional council, appointing Lt. Gen. Abdel Al-Fatah Abdel Rahman Burhan as the council's new head. Ibn Auf also said he released the deputy head of the transitional military council, Kamal Abedel Maarouf, from his duties. Key 'test' for military The US said Thursday that it had ordered the departure of all non-emergency US government personnel from Sudan following the coup against President Bashir. The State Department also raised its travel advisory to the highest level -- Level 4: Do Not Travel. The UK also warns against ""all but essential travel to Khartoum and all remaining areas of Sudan."" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said the US is ""monitoring"" the situation and that the ""big focus for the United States right now is the safety and welfare of our embassy team on the ground as well as private citizens, American citizens in Sudan."" He added that ""the Sudanese people should determine who leads them and their future,"" and that they ""should be allowed to do so sooner than two years from now."" Human Rights Watch associate Africa director Jehanne Henry said how the new Sudanese authorities handled protests against them would be a key ""test"" for the new regime. Sudanese demonstrators cheer as they drive towards a military vehicle. ""Protestors watching are right to be skeptical,"" she said, adding that Ibn Auf ""doesn't have a good record at all ... the US has sanctioned him for his role in Darfur atrocities."" On Friday morning, the UN Security Council was set to discuss developments in Sudan in closed door discussions, according to the United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations. Jonathan Allen, UK deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said Thursday that ""the main message again is there must be no violence against those protesters."" ""The change proposed by the military isn't enough. It's not enough to say that it's a two-year transition to civilian rule is adequate,"" Allen said. ""We need to see much faster transition. We need to see civilian rule now. That's what the protesters have been calling for, and that is what we need to do."" JUST WATCHED Why a second Arab Spring could be dawning Replay More Videos ...

At 3:30 a.m. Thursday, Bashir was visited by the heads of his four main security apparatuses and was told ""there was no alternative"" but for him to step down, two senior military sources with direct knowledge of the conversation told CNN. According to the sources, Bashir responded by saying ""with the blessings of God,"" an expression of acquiescence in Islamic tradition. Bashir is under house arrest, according to sources. His personal guard has been replaced and is under close watch, sources added. Sudanese Prime Minister Mohamed Taher Ayala and Ahmed Haroun, the head of the ruling National Congress Party, were among dozens of officials who were also arrested, a top military official with direct knowledge of the arrests told CNN.

When Woods' birdie putt at the last stayed out the sound of deflation was palpable, but the former world No.1 is in prime position as he chases a 15th major title and first since 2008.

But almost immediately the siren sounded to suspend play because of a threat of thunderstorms. When the all clear came half an hour later, Woods missed the birdie putt, and squandered another birdie chance under persistent drizzle on the 13th. But after an errant drive into trees on the left of the 14th, he weaved a stunning second through a gap in the timber to find the green. As Woods moved off and the crowd closed in, a rushing marshal slipped and collided with Woods' ankle. Woods recoiled and limped off, but was none the worse for it. ""I'm good. Accidents happen,"" said Woods. Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos The Masters, Augusta – The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April.

Fast-forward 13 years, and Francesco is in the running for a green jacket instead of a white suit.

General Electric has moved a step closer to putting its disastrous adventure into subprime mortgages behind it.
The Justice Department announced on Friday a $1.5 billion penalty on GE over WMC Mortgage, the subprime lender it shut down a decade ago.
The settlement puts to rest allegations that WMC, like other subprime lenders before the mortgage meltdown , misrepresented the quality of subprime mortgages.
Those low-quality loans were then sold to investment banks, which packaged them into securities that were sold to invest investors who suffered billions of dollars in losses when the housing market collapsed. ""The failure to disclose material deficiencies in those loans contributed to the financial crisis,” Jody Hunt, the assistant attorney general, said in a statement.
Between 2004 and 2007, WMC made more than $65 billion of mortgage loans . The DOJ alleged that the majority of the subprime loans WMC originated and sold into securities ""did not comply"" with the lender's representations about the loans.
GE said in a statement that the settlement contains ""no admission of any allegations"" and marks a step towards de-risking GE Capital, the company's financial arm.
""We are pleased to put this matter behind us,"" GE said. 14 hr 24 min ago Stocks climb higher amid bank earnings, Disney rally, Anadarko purchase From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe

Netflix ( NFLX ) might be more expensive than the upcoming Disney+ service, but one analyst says Netflix has a big advantage: It's producing more original content .
That's what Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger told clients in a note. Here are some highlights: There are dozens of websites on the Internet dedicated to 'what's new to watch on Netflix this week,' We don’t think there will be any websites similarly dedicated to 'what's new to watch on Disney+ this week.'""
Juenger said there will be only a "" little more than one new thing per week"" by the time Disney+ hits its production peak by 2024: We're not sure the Disney+ [user interface] will even have a 'what's new' feature as one of its categories. Too embarrassing to have 'what's new' be the same thing for weeks at a time.""
Juenger also doubts that parents would automatically want to buy Disney+ ( DIS ), despite the brand's reputation for family friendly content. We also question, a bit, how much of Disney's brand strength and appeal stems from nostalgic memories from the parents, as opposed to demand from the kids. Of course, parents are the decision-makers so maybe that's what matters most.

"Cord-cutting millennials are geeking out over Disney's new streaming service, which promises a sweet nostalgia fix",rss.cnn.com,Michelle Lou and Saeed Ahmed,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/wOI5Omujtyk/index.html,"(CNN) Hilary Fetch is pretty sure she broke her VHS tape of ""The Lion King"" from watching it one too many times.
And Annie Cohen still looks back fondly at the hours she spent in front of the TV devouring ""Hannah Montana"" and ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody."" If it's nostalgia they crave, they'll get to bask in it with the launch of Disney+ . No more sneaking away during homework time to get their fix. For millennials like Fetch and Cohen, who have long cut the cable cord, the streaming service is bringing back their fondest childhood shows -- and long trips down memory lane. ""I know a slew of people that are Disney fanatics,"" Fetch, 27, said. ""Having all their Disney favorites in one place will certainly be a major attraction to said fanatics."" Read More Millennials prefer streaming ... Millennials love streaming. The content is always at their fingertips and often comes with few, if any, ads. One survey found that 36 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said they were likely to subscribe to the new Disney streaming service, which will offer classics ranging from ""Kim Possible"" to ""Lilo and Stitch."" ""I loved Disney as a kid,"" Cohen, 21, said. ""I watched the movies a lot and I watched almost exclusively Disney Channel."" Now, however, most of what she consumes is on streaming services such Hulu and Netflix. So, to people like her, Disney+ may seem like a godsend: it offers the best of both worlds. Disney's a favorite too Here are the movies and shows coming to Disney+ Mary McGill, 23, remembers the hundreds of DVDs and VHS tapes in her childhood home. ""I would just sit there and watch them on repeat,"" McGill said of movies like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""The Little Mermaid."" She often finds herself babysitting her nine nieces and nephews. She'll consider subscribing to Disney+ because it would make it easier for her to find family-friendly content without the clutter of DVDs and VHS tapes. ""Disney movies do a really good job at giving you a good sense of hope and (tell you that) the ability to have an imagination is not a bad thing,"" she said. Plus, McGill added, she finds even the new Disney content relatable and entertaining. ... but there are too many streaming services 5 things to know about Disney+ But while they're pumped about the sweet nostalgia fix that awaits, they're also frustrated with the growing number of streaming services.

Although she said she'll probably end up subscribing to Disney's service, she isn't thrilled at the idea of paying another monthly fee. Though Disney has set an initial monthly fee of $6.99, the company could eventually raise prices like Netflix did when it started churning out more original content. ""I feel like (Disney+) is going to get a lot more expensive, especially when they get more original shows,"" Cohen said.

The Emperor brings new hope to 'Star Wars: Episode IX',rss.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/WcXwQhvyBCA/index.html,"(CNN) The Emperor is back, and with him, a new hope for ""Star Wars: Episode IX.""
The Emperor's trademark cackle at the end of the new trailer , and a surprise appearance by the actor who plays him, Ian McDiarmid, saved the best for last at the Star Wars Celebration presentation devoted to the next movie, which also revealed its subtitle, ""The Rise of Skywalker."" Related: 'Star Wars: Episode IX' trailer is finally here Still, it was the suggestion that the Emperor -- who appeared to die in ""Return of the Jedi"" -- would again somehow be part of the story that provided a surge of enthusiasm for the next movie, and seems in some way to address many of the criticisms aimed at the previous one, ""The Last Jedi."" One of the complaints about ""Last Jedi"" involved the lineage of the character of Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, after all the speculation devoted to how she might connect to characters of the past. Read More In essence, the tantalizing possibilities that ""Star Wars"" enthusiasts spent two years analyzing and debating after ""The Force Awakens"" were largely dismissed by director Rian Johnson's movie, in a way that left many (including this critic ) feeling disappointed. Whatever the explanation, bringing the Emperor back creates a powerful link to the original trilogy, and the promise of a denser addition to the ""Star Wars"" mythology. It also gave an additional wallop to a line spoken in the trailer by the unseen presence of Luke Skywalker, ""No one's ever really gone."" Obviously, the concluding installment in what has been billed as the Skywalker family saga was going to be a huge deal, and the anticipation for the December release was destined to be enormous, even with the naysaying about Episode VIII. But seeing McDiarmid on stage, somehow, just made ""The Rise of Skywalker"" feel a whole lot bigger -- a movie where, after some misgivings, suddenly the sky's the limit."
Joaquin Phoenix plays Jesus in a new film. Here's the one thing he refused to do.,rss.cnn.com,Daniel Burke,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/zEczyoEoI8I/index.html,"(CNN) When Joaquin Phoenix took on the role of Jesus in the new film ""Mary Magdalene,"" he did many of the expected things: Grew long hair, adopted an intense and otherworldly stare, even meditated on a mountaintop.
But there was one thing he would not do. Near the beginning of ""Mary Magdalene,"" which opened Friday in the United States, the script called for Jesus to heal a blind woman by rubbing mud in her eyes, an echo of John's Gospel . (It's a blind man in the Bible, a blind woman in the film.) ""I knew about that scene from the Bible, but I guess I had never really considered it,"" Phoenix told CNN in a recent interview. ""When I got there, I thought: I'm not going to rub dirt in her eyes. Who the f*!# would do that? It doesn't make any sense. That is a horrible introduction to seeing."" Read More The Bible doesn't fully explain why Jesus used mud or clay to heal the blind, though some experts say it was a common practice among first-century healers. In ""Mary Magdalene,"" Phoenix decided to go with his gut, licking a mudless thumb and gently rubbing the woman's eyes. ""It freed me up, in some ways, to discover what is truthful in the moment,"" he said. ""That moment is not so much about a real miracle. It's about someone who has been dismissed by society finally being seen, embraced and encouraged to join the broader community. To me, that is a miracle. There's something profoundly beautiful about that sentiment."" That humanistic message captures the essence of ""Mary Magdalene,"" a film that aims for historic fidelity in some respects, but whose emotional and intellectual currents are radically contemporary. Rooney Mara plays the film's title role as a spiritual seeker and kindred soul to Jesus. A spiritual but not religious film The filmmakers' aim was to ""rescue"" the title character, telling Jesus' story from a feminine (and feminist) point of view. Embodied by a lithe and luminous Rooney Mara, Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a spiritual seeker and kindred soul to Jesus. Their bond perplexes and irks the other apostles, particularly Peter, who seeks to marginalize Mary. In that and other respects, ""Mary Magdalene"" seems to draw inspiration from both the #MeToo movement and the ""Gospel of Mary,"" an apocryphal book discovered in 1896. Somewhat ironically, the film's US distribution was delayed for several years after the Weinstein Co. folded during the real life #MeToo scandal. The director, Garth Davis, who drew acclaim for his first feature film, ""Lion,"" said he felt ""disconnected"" from church while growing up in Australia. Like a growing number of Westerners, his spiritual life lay outside of organized religion, another theme prevalent in ""Mary Magdalene."" ""I didn't want to make a religious film,"" Davis told CNN in an interview. ""I wanted to make a spiritual film."" In one pivotal scene, Mary strongly suggests that the apostles have clouded Jesus' message with their own. The coming kingdom that Jesus preached is not something we can see with our eyes, she tells Peter. It is the contentment of a soul that has renounced resentment and anger, that grows with every act of love and care. ""It's not a place that you can get there and stay forever,"" Mara told CNN in an interview. ""It's a choice you have to make every day, every moment."" In the film, Peter tells Mary that she's wrong, accusing her of weakening their movement and Jesus himself. Nevertheless, she persists. ""I will not be silent,"" Mary says. ""I will be heard."" Chiwetel Ejiofor as the Apostle Peter and Mara as Mary Magdalene. Whether ""Mary Magdalene"" accurately portrays its title character is a question for scholars. But its presentation of a woman challenging the patriarchal structure of organized religion is firmly of this moment. Even before the #MeToo explosion, women in conservative Christian circles have been pushing back against strictures that have often sidelined and silenced them. For centuries, Mary Magdalene herself was buried beneath false conflations with other biblical characters and called a demon-possessed whore. Not until 1969 did the Catholic Church's cease to identify her with the ""sinful woman"" who anoints Jesus' feet in Scripture. The church later gave Mary Magdalene her due, calling her the Apostle of the Apostles because she was the first to witness the resurrected Jesus. Mara, who was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools, said she was initially reluctant to take the title role. ""I had all these preconceived ideas about Mary Magdalene and about religion in general, a lot of baggage that made me hesitate,"" Mara said. ""It wasn't until speaking to Garth and looking at the story as an adult, without that baggage from Catholic school, that I could strip it back and see it with fresh eyes."" Even in the modern age, the urge to sexualize Mary Magdalene apparently runs strong, with popular books and movies proposing that the bond between Jesus was more than spiritual. In ""Mary Magdalene,"" their kinship is deeply emotional but not sexual. Mary alone sees the toll that Jesus' life has taken on his mind and body. ""The heart of the relationship is an understanding that they both see themselves in each other,"" Mara said. ""Mary has felt out of place her entire life, and they really understand each other in a way no one else can. There is a deep love there."" What will Christians see in 'Mary Magdalene'? Films about Jesus and the early Christians often have to pass through a narrow gate. If they are too pious, they risk turning away secular viewers. If they take risks and go ""off-Scripture,"" they could alienate religious believers. That's true of ""Mary Magdalene"" as well, said Kutter Callaway, an assistant professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary, an evangelical school in California. ""Many conservatives will get angry immediately if they even pretend to have a piece of art that puts words directly in Jesus' mouth that are not from Scripture."" Nonetheless, Callaway, who has seen the film, said it ""feminizes"" Jesus in a ""good way."" By de-centering the Jesus story and focusing on women, the film shows just how radical it was for a woman such as Mary Magdalene to give up her home and family to follow Jesus. ""It forces the viewer to be driven and oriented by gritty, on-the-ground female concerns,"" Callaway said. ""There's a pervasive threat of violence that even now is always in play. It's a very different message from most films about Jesus, but it is also really important for today, when we are having conversations in the religious community and more broadly about how women are treated."" In one terrifying scene, Mary's family performs an exorcism on her, thinking that her extraordinary behavior is the result of demonic possession. But already some conservative Christians have criticized ""Mary Magdalene,"" calling its message ""heresy"" and saying that it cannot be accurate since it relies on texts that are not in the Bible. Phoenix's portrayal of Jesus, too, is far from the ""shiny, happy, super-powered"" Christ of many Jesus films, Callaway said. ""Mary Magdalene"" captures Jesus in his later years, when he is wearied by his past and worried about his future. As portrayed by Phoenix, he is often disheveled and remote, more the prophetic Man of Sorrows than the exalted King of Kings. His slow burn in the temple as he watches the money lenders sell animal sacrifices, a prefiguring of his own sacrificial crucifixion, captures the film's ambivalence about Jesus' mission. ""Mary Magdalene"" captures Jesus in his later years, with Phoenix often disheveled and remote. Phoenix said he sought to portray the humanity of Jesus while recognizing his divinity as well. ""What the film is saying is that all of us contain both of those things simultaneously. That's my personal belief."" How does an actor convey that belief on screen? ""The key for me was not to apply any rules to the character,"" he told CNN. ""There are times when he is filled with rage and times when he is at peace. He is very much a human being. The one thing we keyed in on was that everything he felt, he felt strongly. I don't know if it was a sixth sense or something else, but he made an effort to listen to others and be deeply empathetic."" After he arrived on set in southern Italy, Phoenix said, his mind was swimming in research and thoughts about Jesus. He decided to go up to the mountains, alone. What did he do up there? ""A bunch of stupid sh** that I'm not going to tell you,"" the actor said with a laugh. ""It was a meditative moment where there is nothing to do and you just stop. Your mind stops. And that is the key."""

Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play sleepers recalled - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/fisher-price-rock-n-play-sleeper-recall/index.html,"(CNN) The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price are recalling all of the company's Rock 'n Play Sleepers, with the commission linking the product to over 30 infant deaths in 10 years.
The recall will impact about 4.7 million sleepers, the commission said. ""I'm urging parents to stop using this product immediately and to contact Fisher-Price for a refund or a voucher,"" said Ann Marie Buerkle, the CPSC's acting chairwoman. This grieving family wants Fisher-Price's Rock 'n Play sleeper recalled and pediatrics group agrees Chuck Scothon, general manager at Fisher-Price, said the company considered the recall the ""best course of action"" and will continue to stand by the safety of all its products. ""With these actions, we want parents around the world to know that safety will always be a cornerstone of our mission, that we are committed to these values, and will continue to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of the infants and preschoolers who utilize our products,"" Scothon said. Read More The decision comes a week after the commission and Fisher-Price issued a warning about the product, prompting calls from the American Academy of Pediatrics and grieving parents for an immediate recall. The commission said Friday that ""over 30 infant fatalities have occurred in Rock 'n Play Sleepers, after the infants rolled over while unrestrained, or under other circumstances"" since 2009. The recall did not say what caused the infants' deaths. Last week, the CPSC had only cited reports of 10 fatalities -- of babies 3 months or older -- but a Consumer Reports analysis linked the popular sleeper to 32 infant deaths, between 2011 and 2018. Patty Davis, a spokeswoman with CPSC, had said the commission was aware of the report of additional fatalities and were looking into those deaths. Following Friday's recall, Buerkle said the investigation into the sleepers had been a top priority for the commission and announced that officials will continue looking into other inclined sleep products. ""I urge consumers to report any incidents with inclined sleepers or other nursery products to CPSC at saferproducts.gov,"" she said in a video statement. ""As a mother and grandmother there's nothing more important to me than the safety of our children.""

Their 5-month-old son died in 2017 Keenan and Evan Overton 's son had been sleeping in the product when he died three days before Christmas 2017. Their son, 5-month-old Ezra, was napping in the sleeper while his father, Keenan Overton, was asleep on the couch next to him.

He is the author of ""Go See the Principal,"" a book of essays about the life of an educator. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) The nation is in an uproar about the latest college admissions scandal. Some wealthy parents flagrantly broke the rules and the law, and spent a ton of money, to make sure their children got into elite schools.
Gerry Brooks The scandal even blew up more than usual because it ensnared the actors Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. No one could believe our beloved Aunt Becky from ""Full House"" would do such a thing. Do you know who isn't surprised by the situation? Every educator in America. This thing occurs all the time, in every school. Maybe not at the same scale, with the same amounts of cash, but bad parental behavior and entitlement are old news. When a parent signs a reading log saying a child read for 10 minutes that night but they really didn't, because they were out late for a sports event or just didn't have time, they are basically doing the same thing. They believe a rule or policy is not important or dumb or optional. Do you know who else thought the rules were dumb? Aunt Becky. Read More You have to understand what went on with these parents. What were they doing? They were trying to do what they believed was best for their child, yet they forgot what was best for the child. Parents circumvent rules, policies (and even laws) because they feel the rules are hurting, hindering or causing stress for their children or simply because they think the rules do not apply to them. Understand that, and you'll understand why no educator is surprised. JUST WATCHED Actresses among dozens facing admissions scam charges Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Actresses among dozens facing admissions scam charges 03:31 Some people will say lying about your child reading at night is different from lying on a college application. It's not like a dishonest reading log denies another student a spot in a particular college. OK, agreed, but what about the parents who lie about where their children live in order to get them into a school with a better sports team? They believe what they are doing is best for their child. However, there is a child (who actually lives in the school district) sitting on the bench not getting playing time. Do you know who thought she was doing what was best for her child? Aunt Becky. We set up rules, policies and laws for a reason. Sometimes I think rules, policies and laws are ridiculous and I should not have to follow them. But if I violate them, what kind of example am I setting? I think that is also part of the uproar. These parents have basically said, ""We understand this is a rule, but it doesn't apply to us because we think we have a better idea we that will benefit us."" When you drive around parking cones in the school parking lot because you have to get to work, you are showing your child the rules don't apply to you. When you send in Mountain Dew in your child's thermos for their birthday even though the school does not allow soda for lunches, you are saying to the child, ""I understand there is a rule against soda but this is a special occasion so I really shouldn't have to abide by that rule.""

When you choose to flout it, you're basically saying to your child ""I know there's a rule, but I choose not to follow it because I think I know what's best for our family."" Isn't that what Aunt Becky and all these parents did? Is that what you do also? I would certainly raise my hand to admit that sometimes I am Aunt Becky, too, when it comes to what's best for my children. Not many of us could pay $500,000 to falsely show that our child was on a sports team. Very few people could pay $15,000 to have SAT scores bumped up. But all of us can sign a reading log when our child didn't actually read. All of us can drive around traffic cones put out for the safety of the kids because it's inconvenient. All of us can ""over help"" a child on a science fair project because we want them to win. I can't tell you how many times I wished I could hang the 1st Place Science Fair medal around the parent's neck, not the child's. We are all Aunt Beckys, just on a smaller scale."

"Federal judge rebukes Trump attacks on courts, compares to segregationist era - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Ariane de Vogue,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/federal-judge-compares-trump-segregationist-era/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A federal district court judge took a broad, unprecedented swipe against President Donald Trump on Thursday, accusing his administration of launching a ""great assault on our judiciary.""
Judge Carlton Wayne Reeves of the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi called for more diversity in the federal courts, arguing that a more diverse judicial system ensures justice for all. ""When politicians attack courts as 'dangerous,' 'political' and guilty of 'egregious overreach,' you can hear the Klan's lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South,"" Reeves told an audience at University of Virginia Law School on Thursday while accepting the school's Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal. For his remarks, Reeves, was nominated by President Barack Obama in 2010, quoted directly from Trump's tweets, campaign speeches and interviews, although he did not specifically name Trump in his speech. The Point: Donald Trump just showed how low he'll go on immigration ""When the powerful accuse courts of 'opening up our country to potential terrorists' you can hear the Southern Manifesto's authors smearing the judiciary for simply upholding the rights of black folk,"" Reeves said, adding, ""And when the Executive Branch calls our courts and their work 'stupid,' 'horrible,' 'ridiculous,' 'incompetent,' 'a laughingstock,' and a 'complete and total disgrace,' you can hear the slurs and threats of executives like George Wallace echoing into the present."" Read More BuzzFeed first reported on his remarks. It is exceedingly rare for a sitting judge to launch an attack against a sitting president. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reeves particularly noted Trump's attacks against US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a federal district judge in the Southern District of California. During the 2016 campaign, Trump had accused Curiel, who was born in the US, of having an ""inherent conflict of interest"" in a lawsuit against Trump University lawsuit because of his Mexican heritage. ""I know what I heard when a federal judge was called 'very biased and unfair' because he is 'of Mexican heritage,'"" Reeves said, quoting again from Trump. ""When that judge's ethnicity was said to prevent his issuing 'fair rulings.' When that judge was called a 'hater' simply because he is Latino."" ""I heard the words of James Eastland, a race-baiting politician, empowered by the falsehood of white supremacy, questioning the judicial temperament of a man solely because of the color of his skin. I heard those words, and I did not know if it was 1967 or 2017,"" Reeves said. Reeves shared that he has been sent ""countless letters of hatred"" containing insults, profanity and threats aimed to ""bully and scare judges who look like me from the judiciary."" The judge also castigated Trump's administration for its lack of racial and gender diversity in its judicial nominations. ""There is no excuse for this exclusion of minority experiences from our courts,"" said Reeves, who became Mississippi's second black federal judge in its history. Reeves added that ""courts can and should be criticized"" because ""judges get it wrong -- all the time. That includes me."" ""But the slander and falsehoods thrown at courts today are not those of a critic seeking to improve the judiciary's search for truth. They are words of an attacker, seeking to distort and twist that search toward falsehood."""
Amber Heard details why she called Johnny Depp 'the Monster' in court filing,rss.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/ZW427ASvJbo/index.html,"(CNN) Amber Heard has outlined the abuse she says she experienced by her former husband, Johnny Depp, as she fights a $50 million defamation suit he has filed against her.
In an affidavit obtained by CNN and included in Heard's motion to have the case against her dismissed, the actress alleges that a year into their relationship, she began to witness the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star abusing drugs and alcohol. ""Whenever he was using I worried for both of us,"" Heard stated in the filing. ""He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, 'the Monster.'"" The court documents detail multiple instances of alleged abuse in which Heard claims that Depp hit her, threw bottles, yelled at her, shoved Heard, pulled out chunks of her hair and at one point strangled her. ""I remember being afraid that Johnny might not know when to stop, and that he might kill me,"" Heard said in the filing. Read More In response to the allegations, Depp's attorney, Adam Waldman, told CNN, ""A hoax confronted with the reality of evidence requires new lies to sustain itself."" ""Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard. Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse,"" Heard's attorney, Eric George, said in a statement to CNN. ""It is regrettable that it will take a judge to finally end the persistent harassment of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp, but Ms. Heard will take whatever action is necessary to vindicate the truth."" Depp's suit, which was filed last month in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, was sparked by an op-ed Heard wrote for the Washington Post in December. The actress wrote of the ""wrath"" she says she faced after becoming a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"" two years prior, seemingly in reference to when her abuse allegations against Depp first became public, but she did not name Depp as her alleged abuser in the op-ed. Depp's suit charges that while the actor is not named, ""the op-ed plainly was about (and other media consistently characterized it as being about) Ms. Heard's purported victimization after she publicly accused her former husband, Johnny Depp (""Mr. Depp), of domestic abuse in 2016, when she appeared in court with an apparently battered face and obtained a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp on May 27, 2016."" Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship timeline That occurred two days after Heard filed for divorce in 2016. The couple, who met on the set of ""The Rum Diary"" in 2009, married in 2015 and went on to be embroiled in a contentious split for months, with charges of bad behavior levied by both sides. Depp denied the accusations at the time, and through his representatives, claimed Heard made up the abuse. The estranged couple settled their divorce months later, released a statement saying they ""have agreed to resolve their divorce proceeding privately."" ""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,"" the statement read. Heard also withdrew her petition to extend a restraining order against Depp. Depp's suit charged that Heard's allegations led to financial losses for him, including being dropped from future ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films after leading the franchise for 15 years. Heard alleges in her filing that she also lost work, including a part in a movie and a campaign with a ""global fashion brand."""
Francesco Molinari: From caddie to leading the Masters,rss.cnn.com,"Rob Hodgetts, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/RZdV6Ke1JU0/index.html,"(CNN) On his first visit to the Masters in 2006 he was a bundle of nerves as he shared the first tee with defending champion Tiger Woods.
But Italy's Francesco Molinari wasn't playing, he was dressed in the distinctive white jumpsuit of an Augusta National caddie, lugging the bag for his older brother Edoardo. Fast-forward 13 years, and Francesco, last year's British Open champion, leads the 83rd Masters halfway through round two. Instead of a white suit, a green jacket beckons. The 36-year-old, the world No.7, had been a pro for two years when ""Dodo,"" as he has always called his elder brother by two years, qualified for the Masters as the US amateur champion. The pair had struck a deal as kids -- if one gets to the Masters, the other caddies.

Francesco also won the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill earlier this season and was third at the recent WGC Match Play. His 67 Friday lifted him to seven under where he was joined by Australia's former world No.1 Jason Day, and first-round co-leader Brooks Koepka, who has won three of his last six majors. Molinari's round included five birdies and no bogeys, and just 25 putts, but he insisted it wasn't as easy as it looked. ""It never feels smooth around here,"" Molinari, whose best finish in seven Masters has been tied 19th in 2012, told Sky Sports. Still on the course, four-time champion Tiger Woods birdied the ninth and 11th to reach four under and had a putt from a few feet for another birdie on the short 12th when the siren sounded to suspend play because of the threat of thunderstorms.

Jamie Dimon: Banking sector pays employees better than others - CNN,rss.cnn.com,"Anneken Tappe, CNN Business",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_us/~3/FHlKh1iZMZs/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Minimum wage is haunting JPMorgan.
On Friday's earnings call with the press, CEO Jamie Dimon no doubt intended to boast about the bank's better-than-expected performance in the first quarter of the year. But he couldn't avoid the minimum wage subject. Reporters questioned whether JPMorgan ( JPM ) intended to meet Bank of America's ( BAC ) recent pledge to up minimum wage to $20 an hour by 2021. Dimon said raising wages was ""not an arms race."" ""We take very good care of our entry-level employees,"" he said, noting the bank paid $35,000 to $37,000 for starting salaries plus benefits. ""When you look at wages, you better look at other people. The banking sector is pretty good,"" Dimon said. He questioned whether media companies like CNBC or the New York Times paid employees right out of high school this well. Read More During a House Financial Committee hearing on Wednesday, major US bank CEOs, including Dimon, were repeatedly pressed on pay, particularly in relation to their multi-million-dollar compensation packages. Rep. Katie Porter claimed during the hearing that a single parent in a starting job at JPMorgan couldn't make ends meet. JPMorgan pays entry level employees between $15 and $18 per hour, depending on their location, with salaries in major cities being higher. ""We believe we pay fairly and competitively,"" added Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's chief financial officer. Earlier this week, Amazon's ( AMZN ) Jeff Bezos challenged his peers in the retail world to up their minimum pay . Could Dimon be succeeded by a woman? Besides minimum wage, Dimon was also pressed on whether he could be succeeded by a woman — Lake, for example. During Wednesday's House hearing , the seven Caucasian male CEOs were asked by show of hands whether they thought a woman or person of color would succeed them. Dimon kept his hand down. ""We don't comment on succession,"" he said on Friday's call, also pointing out that it is of course JPMorgan's board that appoints a CEO, not the departing executive, and that the timeline mattered as well. ""We have exceptional women and my successor might well be a woman,"" he said, addingt that there were plenty of people in the bank's operating committee that could fill Dimon's shoes after his departure. JPMorgan declined to further comment on the matter."
Injured veteran finds renewed purpose saving birds - CNN,rss.cnn.com,Amy Chillag,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_us/~3/q-so-Za8NIk/index.html,"(CNN) Robert Vallieres hikes for miles, often three times a week, climbing to reach cliffs and quarries, just to get a glimpse of his beloved birds.
It's his joy and renewed purpose to track and rehabilitate the peregrine falcon and the bald eagle - two species nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT in the 1960s. It's hard physical work for anyone, but especially a disabled Gulf War veteran who suffered a traumatic brain injury, aneurisms, chemical exposure, and PTSD that ended his military career and left him fighting for his life. But Vallieres is a natural at it, because his military training is a perfect match. The 57-year-old carries a heavy backpack filled with scopes, and binoculars plus a tripod. Read More ""When I see an eagle soaring it's like, 'Wow!,'"" Vallieres tells CNN. He's been a volunteer for New Hampshire Audubon for some 25 years. And today, in part thanks to him, the birds are making a comeback -- a comeback that parallels his own. Traumatized by war As a young combat engineer, Vallieres was struck in the head on a mission in Kuwait to fortify a foxhole in 1990. ""A big beam came flying off of a truck and caught me in the temple area. I woke up in a medical hospital somewhere,"" says Vallieres. ""A few days later, they sent me back to my unit and then I became really ill with an aneurysm on the verge of bursting in my heart."" Vallieres shows an owl to a veteran during a demonstration at the New Hampshire Veterans Home. That took Vallieres out of the war and back home where he suffered a second aneurysm. For decades he's lived in constant pain from migraines and scar tissue. He has a hard time breathing sometimes and a feeling of numbness partly due to artificial parts in his body. ""Nobody wants numbness,"" he says. ""We want our senses."" He was 28 years old and battled depression, anger, survivor's guilt and cognitive issues from his head injury and PTSD. ""When you're incapacitated and you really can't move too much, you're wondering if death is nearby."" Despite his trauma, Vallieres still had to be a father to his little boy -- a curious child who helped jump start his love for birds. Revitalized by birds One day, his three-year-old son noticed a bird and asked his father what kind it was. Vallieres bought a bird identification book and started learning along with his son. He bought some small binoculars and the two began observing birds together near their home in Concord, New Hampshire. Robert Vallieres showing a peregrine falcon to boy at an Audubon camp. Then came another turning point. Vallieres saw an ad in the newspaper for a birding trip in New Hampshire's White Mountains and signed up. While most of the group was observing song birds, he saw something else: A falcon grab a bird in midair. ""All I saw were feathers all over the place. I stuck with it and saw (the falcon) took it to a snag and started eating it,"" he says. The drama of nature inspired him. He wanted to learn more about birds of prey; he loved how being outdoors made him feel. ""It uses all of our senses. Our sight, hearing, tasting, feeling,"" Vallieres says. ""It gets you out in the fresh air -- these things you take for granted sometimes if you get sick and stuck in a room."" A purpose in life As a veteran on disability, Vallieres couldn't work. But he could volunteer. At the time, in the mid-1990s, just when he needed a new purpose in life, New Hampshire Audubon was looking for volunteers to count and track peregrine falcons and bald eagles. The species became endangered after the now-banned insecticide DDT, used heavily in the 1950s and 1960s, killed unhatched chicks. A nationwide recovery effort bred falcons and eagles in captivity which then needed to be released and tracked. Robert Vallieres cradles a peregrine chick at a nest in Rumney, New Hampshire during leg-banding in 2002. Vallieres stepped right up to monitor those birds as they grew up and bred, built nests and cared for their young. Today the nearly extinct peregrine falcon and the bald eagle -America's national symbol- are no longer considered endangered species. Just this winter, Vallieres found a new bald eagle's nest in a pine tree. ""The basis of science is having data. Without somebody saying, 'I saw these birds incubating. I know there's eggs up there that should've hatched or failed to hatch,' we couldn't collect that information,"" says New Hampshire Audubon Senior Biologist Chris Martin. Birdwatching for peace of mind and better health His military training was a plus. Volunteers need to have lots of patience, keen observation skills and time -- lots of time. ""People will give up on watching and lose their attention. Robert is able to hunker down in the woods and be okay. You can't teach that skill easily,"" says Martin, who's Vallieres' friend and long-time colleague. You also have to be able to read the numbers off tiny bird leg bands through binoculars from 100 feet or more away. Vallieres has always been good at reading maps and navigating. A change in outlook It takes Vallieres a while to walk the miles on these birding trips -he does it slowly- due to his injuries. But he gets there. In the winter, he walks with snowshoes. Other times, he canoes across a lake to set his sights on a bird. Contemplating suicide, this Marine turned to yoga to save his life Vallieres says not only does his volunteering help with physical fitness, it helps his mental state tremendously. ""Finding rhythm or purpose in life besides myself,"" says Vallieres, ""Not to get stuck on myself, to have an outlet and be semi-physically fit."" ""He was struggling with focus at the time with what to do after his injuries,"" says Martin. ""This just turned a light on in his mind. It's given him a concentration point."" You can hear the positivity and sense of wonder in Vallieres' voice when he talks about birding. ""I'd be out in nature and then all these animals kind of cross your path or you cross theirs. It's taught me something."" He's even built a bird box to draw kestrel falcons to his own yard. It worked and now he has breeding pairs - thrilling both him and his son with the cycle of life. Vallieres also builds nesting boxes for falcons. Today he has a pair of kestrels nesting in his yard in Concord, New Hampshire. Vallieres is also involved in rehabbing birds for a local wildlife hospital, Wings of Dawn. He learned to train unreleasable birds as educational ambassadors -- having them fly back and forth to a heavy glove on his arm. ""They're stuck inside the cage. I would try to just keep them moving,"" says Vallieres. He sees the parallels with his early life and those of many injured veterans. ""Don't get stuck in the cage; get outside."" A gift for others Every month he takes an owl, an eagle, or some other bird of prey to the New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton. He wants to give back to the veterans organizations that have helped him with his recovery through the years. ""He gets a huge crowd. There are always people that want to talk to him,"" volunteer supervisor Patty Copeland tells CNN. Vallieres helps a veteran spot a bird using binoculars at the New Hampshire Veterans Home. ""They're very engaged, very interested."" Vallieres has had such an impact, the home applied for a grant and got dozens of binoculars for the veterans to observe birds on the property that includes woods and a pond.

Mike Pence: Migrant family separations will not return - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Caroline Kelly,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/11/politics/mike-pence-border-family-separations-cnntv/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_us+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+U.S.%29,"Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday that the Trump administration would not return to separating families at the southern border as a way of deterring illegal immigration.
""The President made it very clear this week, we're not rethinking bringing back family separation,"" Pence told CNN's Dana Bash. On Monday, senior administration officials told CNN's Jake Tapper that in the last four months or so, Trump had been pushing then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers, as well as separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming, the sources said. Trump repeatedly denied that was the case on Tuesday, and Pence backed up the President's public statements. ""The President made it clear a year ago: We ended family separation, and we're not considering going back to it,"" Pence said. Read More More undocumented immigrants and migrants were apprehended along the southern border in March than in any month since 2007, according to Customs and Border Protection data released Tuesday. There were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry along the southern border in March, up from 37,390 the previous March. Overall in March, more than 103,000 individuals were apprehended along the border or encountered at a port of entry and deemed ""inadmissible."" Pence stressed that the onus was on Congress to act and provide a legislative solution to what he said was an inadequate immigration system. ""We've got to close the loopholes in our law. We've got to end 'catch and release.' We've got to reform our asylum system,"" Pence told Bash. ""And that's why Congress needs to sit down, Democrats in Congress need to sit down and take a break from everything else they're focused on and deal with what the American people want them to deal with, which is securing our border and protecting our country."" The vice president sidestepped a question about whether Trump's Wednesday night tweet that Democrats' views on border policy were ""TREASONOUS"" increased the likelihood of such a compromise. ""I think what you hear the President expressing is the frustration of the American people, that last month alone more than 100,000 people came across our southern border illegally,"" Pence said. "
Trump told CBP head he'd pardon him if he were sent to jail for violating immigration law - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/trump-cbp-commissioner-pardon/index.html,"Trump told CBP head he'd pardon him if he were sent to jail for violating immigration law By Jake Tapper, Anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Updated 4:53 PM EDT, Fri April 12, 2019
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan he would grant McAleenan a pardon if he were sent to jail for having border agents block asylum seekers from entering the US in defiance of US law, senior administration officials tell CNN.
Trump reportedly made the comment during a visit to the border at Calexico, California, a week ago. It was not clear if the comment was a joke.
Two officials briefed on the exchange say the President told McAleenan, since named the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that he ""would pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying US entry to migrants,"" as one of the officials paraphrased.
The White House referred CNN to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman told CNN, ""At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal. Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law."" Trump confirms he's looking at releasing detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities
The exchange came amid threats by the President to close the border in response to a steep uptick of migrants at the border. In March, there were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry on the southern border, up from 37,390 last March, according to CBP .
During his visit to Calexico last Friday, Trump said on camera: ""We're full, our system's full, our country's full -- can't come in! Our country is full, what can you do? We can't handle any more, our country is full. Can't come in, I'm sorry. It's very simple.""
Behind the scenes, two sources told CNN, the President told border agents to not let migrants in. Tell them we don't have the capacity, he said. If judges give you trouble, say, ""Sorry, judge, I can't do it. We don't have the room.""
RELATED: Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants
After the President left the room, agents sought further advice from their leaders, who told them they were not giving them that direction and if they did what the President said they would take on personal liability. You have to follow the law, they were told.
Trump has grown frustrated by the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border, placing blame on Democrats and the nation's immigration laws. On Friday, the President said he's considering releasing immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities in part to retaliate against Democrats, undercutting earlier denials from his own administration officials.
""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!""
Yet the White House received legal guidance months ago that such a policy would run afoul of the law, open the administration to lawsuits, and ultimately undermine the President's desire to deport undocumented immigrants. WH told by lawyers in February that proposal to drop migrants in sanctuary cities had legal issues
In February, according to documents obtained by CNN, the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, John Mitnick, told the White House in writing that such a move could only be done if there was a ""strong, mission-related rationale"" pertaining to the responsibilities of the department. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report. "
Hastings to depart Facebook's board as competition with Netflix heats up,edition.cnn.com,Sara Ashley O'Brien,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/tech/facebook-board-shakeup/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Facebook is shaking up its board.
On Friday, the company announced that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings will not be up for reelection for his role as a director on Facebook's board. The move comes as Facebook is investing more in original video content, potentially competing directly with Netflix. Hastings has served on the board since 2011. Facebook is reportedly spending around $1 billion on original programming and content deals for Facebook Watch, the video platform it launched in August 2018. Its original video content ranges from Jada Pinkett Smith's popular talk show ""Red Table Talk"" to the drama series ""Sorry For Your Loss"" starring Elizabeth Olsen. In February, the social media giant announced several new shows, including a reimagined version of reality show ""The Real World,"" in partnership with MTV. It also hosts YouTube-like shows from content creators. At $6.99 a month, Disney+ will start a streaming price war At a time when the company is grappling with the spread of controversial content on its core Facebook platform, including election misinformation, anti-vaccination content, and hate speech, its content creation efforts appear to be something of a bright spot. It announced in December that 400 million viewers watch at least one video on Facebook's Watch platform every month. Read More Hastings was one part of broader changes to the company's board. Facebook said that Erskine Bowles, who has been on the board since 2011, would not be up for reelection. Facebook has also nominated Peggy Alford, an executive at PayPal, to join. Alford would be the first African American woman on the board, and the second African American overall. Former American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault joined last year amid pressure from activists to add black representation to the all-white board. PayPal executive Peggy Alford has been nominated to join Facebook's board. Alford previously worked at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropic organization owned by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, before rejoining PayPal in March 2019. She previously worked at PayPal in various senior roles from 2011 to 2017. ""What excites me about the opportunity to join Facebook's board is the company's drive and desire to face hard issues head-on while continuing to improve on the amazing connection experiences they have built over the years,"" Alford said in a statement. Alford's nomination will be voted on at the company's upcoming annual stockholder meeting on May 30."
Pentagon transgender policy goes into effect,edition.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/transgender-troop-ban-starts/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Pentagon's controversial policy banning transgender recruits from joining the military went into effect on Friday.
The Pentagon says the new policy does not affect transgender troops currently serving in the armed forces, a contention that's strongly denied by advocates, who point to the potential for discrimination and harassment. The ban blocks individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition known as gender dysphoria from joining. Transgender individuals can serve, but only if they meet the standards of the sex they were assigned at birth. The Pentagon says the policy doesn't block transgender individuals from service, but advocates say it is designed to operate as a comprehensive ban on their presence. Current military leaders have testified to Congress that transgender troops have not affected cohesion, while retired military leaders have decried the policy as misguided and damaging. 'Bigoted' Read More ""It's a bigoted policy. It has not one shred of evidence behind it,"" Ray Mabus, a former secretary of the Navy, told CNN. ""In fact, all the evidence goes the other way. It goes against the basic American notion that it should be about what you can do and not who you are. ... To do this to patriots who are willing to serve -- not only willing, but eager to serve, who have raised their hands and said send me -- weakens our democracy and seriously weakens our military."" Anthony Kurta, a Pentagon official acting for the deputy under secretary of personnel and readiness, told reporters Friday that ""the department will continue to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, and every service member is able to express their gender identity. DOD will take no action solely based on gender identity."" The policy, signaled when President Donald Trump tweeted a call for a blanket ban in 2017, still faces lower court challenges, but the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 January order that it could go forward. The justices took no stand on the legality of the ban. Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, a think thank that researches gender and the military, said that ""the policy stigmatizes all trans people. ... The way the policy will play out on the ground -- this will be a green light to commanders who are transphobic,"" putting the estimated 14,700 trans members of the military at a disadvantage and forcing many to stay in the closet. Public opposes the policy Most Americans oppose the policy, according to a Quinnipiac University poll . That poll found 70% believe transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military. The only listed group that disagreed were Republicans, with 50% saying they shouldn't be allowed and 40% in favor. Most transgender persons are now disqualified from military service, except: • Service members who have been stable for three years in their biological sex prior to joining the military -- meaning 36 months after surgery and after ending hormone treatments. • Service members diagnosed with ""gender dysphoria"" after joining the military can stay in the military if they don't require a change of gender and remain deployable. Gender dysphoria involves a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies, according to the American Psychiatric Association. • Service members who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria before the effective date of the policy can still serve and receive medical treatment. • Transgender persons without a gender dysphoria diagnosis or history can serve in their birth sex. Case by case The Defense Department can issue waivers on a case-by-case basis. Kurda said Friday that the policy originated in 2017 when ""service leadership"" approached then-Defense Secretary James Mattis and ""expressed some readiness reservations."" Over a series of hearings by the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, now a Democratic presidential candidate, asked the chiefs of staff of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force about the issue of transgender troops. All four said they saw no negative effects from transgender personnel serving. ""I have received precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion, discipline, morale and all those sorts of things,"" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at one of the hearings. Mabus said the case being made against transgender troops has been recycled several times through history. History repeats itself ""The same arguments are used every time we expand who can serve,"" he said. ""It affects unit cohesion, it is too costly, it is too disruptive. That was the argument used against integrating the armed forces in the 1940s. Those same arguments were used against recruiting large numbers of women in the '80s. The same arguments were used during the repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' "" -- the policy on gay service members -- ""and on the opening of all ground combat positions to women."" ""And every single time those reasons have been bogus,"" Mabus said. ""Every time. Just like they're bogus today."" The House of Representatives passed a resolution last month expressing opposition to the Trump administration's ban. The resolution ""strongly opposes President Trump's discriminatory ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces,"" and ""rejects the flawed scientific and medical claims upon which it is based."" The vote was 238-185, and five Republicans voted with Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Trump administration's ban ""an act of cruelty"" in a speech on the House floor and said that ""the men and women who step forward to serve in the US military are patriots, all of them."" ""The House will continue to fight this discriminatory action, which has no place in our country,"" the California Democrat said. ""We will never allow hate and prejudice to dictate our national security."""
"Pompeo dismisses data showing positive impact of Central American aid, defends cuts - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/pompeo-tapper-central-america-aid-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the Trump administration's decision to cut aid to Central American countries in a Friday interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead,"" dismissing data that shows aid has lowered murder rates and migrant flows to the US in the past.
Tapper cited State Department statistics that show that after the US launched an aid program to El Salvador, homicide rates went down and the number of migrants fleeing to the US dropped as well. Similar results were seen in Honduras and Guatemala, the other two ""Northern Triangle"" countries to which the Trump administration announced April 1 that it will cut aid. Tapper asked Pompeo if the aid cuts were ""self-defeating"" given past results. Disconnect Read More ""Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent,"" said Pompeo, ""and you see the results."" He argued that the US had been ""throwing more money at those problems"" with little impact and there is ""no reason to expect we'll get any different outcome."" When Tapper pointed out that the data showed the aid had a positive impact and that the numbers came from Pompeo's own department, the top US diplomat said, ""I think that President Trump's decision makes perfect sense ... I think the data you describe proves this point."" ""If what you're doing doesn't work,"" Pompeo said, you should stop. Tapper tried again, pointing out that homicides went down and ""fewer people came,"" according to ""your agency's data."" The Obama administration launched an ""Alliance for Prosperity"" initiative in 2014 to respond to a crisis of unaccompanied minors being sent to the US southern border. The goal was to improve security and economic opportunity in those countries to reduce the incentive for migrants to leave and try to enter the US. 'Return on our investment' The US committed $420 million to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for fiscal year 2017, while the three Northern Triangle countries committed $5.4 billion to support investments public safety and opportunity. The Global Leadership Coalition, an organization of retired military leaders, diplomats and members of Congress, reported that the aid "" not only worked , but also delivered a return on our investment for the American taxpayer."" Homicide rates declined by 42% in El Salvador, 13% in Guatemala, and 23% in Honduras from 2015 to 2017. By 2017, American assistance helped improve security and economic conditions throughout the region, and border-crossing apprehensions had fallen to their lowest point since 1971, the group reports. In fiscal year 2017, the US provided approximately $837 million in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico for such programs to help them address the root causes of migration including brutal violence, hunger, and instability in communities. Salvadoran migrants begin their journey in caravan heading the United States, in San Salvador, on November 18, 2018. - The migrants are mostly fleeing poverty and unrest in Central America's ""Northern Triangle"" -- El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where brutal gang violence has fuelled some of the highest murder rates in the world. (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS / AFP) (Photo credit should read MARVIN RECINOS/AFP/Getty Images) Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced April 1 that the Trump administration would cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras because the countries ""could do more"" to mitigate the ""humanitarian crisis"" at the southern border. The decision has been criticized by lawmakers, analysts, security and migration experts. Officials would not say exactly how much money would be affected by the Trump directive and some of it has likely already been spent. Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region, with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service."
Trump Fed pick Stephen Moore is a self-described 'radical' who said he's not a 'big believer in democracy' - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,"Andrew Kaczynski and Paul LeBlanc, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/stephen-moore-kfile/index.html,"(CNN) Stephen Moore, who President Donald Trump announced last month as his nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has a history of advocating self-described ""radical"" views on the economy and government.
In speeches and radio interviews reviewed by CNN's KFile, Moore advocated for eliminating the corporate and federal income taxes entirely, calling the 16th Amendment that created the income tax the ""most evil"" law passed in the 20th century. Moore's economic worldview envisions a slimmed down government and a rolled back social safety net. He has called for eliminating the Departments of Labor, Energy and Commerce, along with the IRS and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. He has questioned the need for both the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education. He has said there's no need for a federal minimum wage, called for privatizing the ""Ponzi scheme"" of Social Security and said those on government assistance lost their dignity and meaning. In other interviews and appearances, Moore repeatedly said he believed capitalism was more important than democracy. Trump announced he would nominate Moore to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last month. Moore works at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He served as an adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and is a friend of the president's economic adviser Larry Kudlow. He was formerly a CNN contributor. Read More The nomination immediately drew criticism because Moore has been a fierce critic of the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell. In 2015 , he called for abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold standard (Moore told CNN's Erin Burnett on Thursday he changed his mind on the gold standard. He told CNN's KFile on Friday he no longer believed in abolishing the Federal Reserve). In a column in December , Moore called for Powell to resign for hiking interest rates. Moore claimed the comments were probably written ""in a time of anger,"" but in February, he called Powell one of Trump's ""worst appointments"" and called for firing hundreds of employees at the Federal Reserve Board who he called ""worthless"" economists. ""There's no bigger swamp in Washington than the Federal Reserve Board,"" Moore said in a February interview posted on Vimeo . ""It's filled with hundreds of economists who are worthless, who have the wrong model in their mind. They should all be, they should all be fired and they should be replaced by good economists."" Turning to Powell, Moore said, ""I spoke to the President last week about this and he was extremely upset that he had, I think made -- it was one of his worst political appointments -- and now he's stuck with the guy for, I think he's under a four-or-five-year appointment."" Views on taxes Moore has repeatedly called for a ""radical"" plan to grow the economy by getting rid of the corporate income tax and personal income tax. ""We have to eliminate the corporate income tax entirely in my opinion because it is just a millstone around the neck of this economy,"" Moore said on a 2012 panel . Speaking in 2015, Moore called for getting rid of the income tax and moving to a national sales tax. ""What is the income tax rate in Texas and Florida,"" Moore said. ""Zero. There is no income tax. Why can't we have no income tax on the federal level. Let's get rid of the damn income tax and do taxes like we do in Texas and Florida. So Texas and Florida have no income tax."" Speaking on the Glenn Beck Program in 2007, a transcript of which is available on the Web Archive, Moore called the 16th amendment -- which created the federal income tax -- ""the most the most evil act that has passed in 100 years."" Views on capitalism and democracy Moore has repeatedly said he believes capitalism is more important than democracy. In an interview for Michael Moore's 2009 film ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" Moore said he wasn't a big believer in democracy. ""Capitalism is a lot more important than democracy,"" Moore said. ""I'm not even a big believer in democracy. I always say that democracy can be two wolves and a sheep deciding on what to have for dinner. Look, I'm in favor of people having the right to vote and things like that. But there are a lot of countries that have the right to vote that are still poor. Democracy doesn't always lead to a good economy or even a good political system."" Speaking on the Thom Hartmann Show in 2010 , Moore reiterated this belief, saying Hitler was democratically elected and Saudi Arabia wouldn't be better off as a democracy. ""I think capitalism, without free market capitalism, countries don't get rich,"" Moore said, when asked if capitalism was more important than democracy. ""And so I would rather have a country that's based on, you know, a free enterprise system of property rights and free exchange of free trade of low tax rates, than a country that state, there are a lot of democracies --."" In a 2010 speech , Moore said he believed democracy meant that Democrats have an ""intentional"" plan to take voters off the income tax rolls and have them vote for expanding government. Moore told CNN's KFile, ""I believe in free market capitalism and representative government. It is what has made America the greatest nation and the most prosperous nation on earth."" Views on the minimum wage, social security, and welfare Moore has repeatedly expressed a desire to rollback the social safety net in the country, including Social Security, which he has called ""the soft underbelly of the welfare state"" and frequently said is ""a Bernie Madoff-style Ponzi scheme that will eventually sink into insolvency unless reformed."" Moore told CNN's KFile he believes in letting young people put their retirement savings in 401K accounts on a voluntary basis instead of Social Security and that wouldn't cut benefits to those already on it. Speaking at an event in 2014, Moore said those on government assistance ---- ""the dole"" ---- were depleted of dignity or meaning in their lives. ""You know, we have too many people dependent on government and the cost isn't so much of what it costs our fisc -- you know, the fiscal situation, it's really expensive. The cost, it just depletes people of their dignity and their meaning in life,"" he said. ""I mean, there's nothing worse than being on the dole, right?"" Moore told CNN's KFile, ""There are too many people on welfare and the best way to help the poor is to get them a job and good schools and economic opportunity. The welfare state hurts the very people it has supposed to have helped. No one should go hungry or homeless or without basic health care, but there is abetted (sic) way than handouts."" Medicaid, Moore said in February 2018, was a ""dumbass"" system. ""You cannot come up -- I said this earlier this morning to one of the sessions, some of you may have been in it -- you truly could not come up with a dumber system than Medicaid. I mean really, I mean if we sat here and tried to think how can we make the dumbass, you know, Medicaid system the worst system possible we would come up with what they have right now."" Moore told CNN's KFile he stood by his comments on Medicaid, saying he'd instead give ""the poor a medical savings account and let them buy health care in the open market."" And a federal minimum wage, Moore said last year at a Heritage Foundation event, is not necessary. ""You don't need a federal minimum wage. You need, you need pro-growth policies that will cause companies to raise the ratio."" Moore told CNN's KFile he doesn't want to abolish the minimum wage. "
Tornado outbreak likely this weekend in the South - CNN,us.cnn.com,Allie Mazurek and Judson Jones,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/south-severe-storms-weekend-tornado-outbreak-wxc/index.html,"(CNN) Dangerous and severe storms are expected to slam parts of the Southeast and Ohio River Valley this weekend, forecasters say.
The potent system will create the potential for life-threatening winds, strong tornadoes and large hail. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk (level 4 out of 5) for severe weather Saturday across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley. And on Sunday, an enhanced risk (level 3 out of 5) stretches from Atlanta to Cleveland. 4 tornado safety tips that could save your life Read More Severe storms possible from Texas to Mississippi The first severe storms are expected during lunchtime Saturday into late afternoon across East Texas, Louisiana, southern Arkansas and eastern Mississippi. Cities such as Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, may be affected. Track the storms with CNN's storm tracker CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the threat for severe weather is greatest at such times. He said that the warm air present during the afternoon will enhance the atmosphere's instability, creating more energy for storms to tap into and aiding in their development. The storms most capable of producing tornadoes and large hail will be the individual, rotating cells that form ahead of a larger complex of thunderstorms throughout the afternoon. Tornadoes possible overnight in Alabama By late Saturday, the storms will organize into a line as they cross the western border of Mississippi. The system will begin to move through Alabama overnight and is expected to reach Georgia by Sunday morning. The energy from warm afternoon temperatures will diminish, but the risk for tornadoes will not be over. ""The storm is so vigorous that tornadoes are still possible after dark,"" Myers said. Tornadoes at that time can be especially dangerous since they are difficult to see and people are less likely to receive warnings while they're asleep. Georgia, the Southern Appalachians and Ohio Valley The most significant risk of severe weather is expected Saturday, but there's still considerable potential Sunday. The Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk across a broad area, stretching from eastern Alabama through the southern Appalachians and into the Ohio Valley. The main line of storms will begin to push into this area late Sunday morning and trek to the east on Sunday afternoon. The center expects the threat of severe weather to increase throughout the afternoon. ""Damaging winds appear to be the greatest threat on Sunday, but tornadoes will also be possible,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The risk will slowly diminish as the system begins to weaken Sunday evening. The Masters tournament may see exciting final round Georgia's Augusta National Golf Club is included in the slight risk area Sunday as the Masters concludes. The storms are expected to move through the Augusta area during the afternoon and evening, which could affect the schedules of some players finishing up their rounds. The tornado threat will be lower by then, but damaging winds could still present hazardous conditions. Either way, it could make for a delayed and an interesting end to the four-day tournament."
Cursive writing's been making a comeback and Texas is the latest state to add it - CNN,us.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/cursive-is-coming-back-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) It's a familiar refrain. Parents lament that technology is turning good, legible handwriting into a lost art form for their kids.
In response, lawmakers in state after state -- particularly in the South -- are carving out space in teachers' classroom time to keep the graceful loops of cursive writing alive for the next generation. Alabama passed a law requiring it in 2016. That same year, Louisiana passed its own cursive law. Others like Arkansas, Virginia, California, Florida and North Carolina , have similar laws. Texas is the latest state in which educators are pushing to bring back cursive writing in elementary schools. The changes in the Lone Star State, which were adopted in 2017, are set to go into effect during the upcoming 2019-20 school year. Read More Each state's curriculum differs in subtle ways. The road map described in the Texas Education Code , for instance, includes requirements for instruction to begin with teaching second-graders how to form cursive letters with the ""appropriate strokes when connecting letters."" Third-graders would focus on writing complete words, thoughts, and answers to questions, and fourth-graders would need to be able to complete their assignments outright in cursive. DeEtta Culbertson, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, told CNN that previous education standards released in Texas, including in 2009, have included cursive writing, but the new standards set to go into effect added ""more emphasis"" on cursive. Cursive is again becoming widespread across the South Data compiled by the Southern Regional Education Board in 2016 showed that 14 of the 16 states the SREB oversees expect that cursive instruction begin by the third grade. The year 2010 was a ""pivotal year"" for the cursive comeback, the SREB says. That's when ""college- and career-readiness standards did not explicitly include it,"" including the national Common Core standards. The SREB showed the number of cursive-teaching states dropping from 12 down to six that year. But by 2016, the flowing script has rebounded up to 14 Southern states. With another Southern state, Texas, coming on board that make 18 total in the US. Advocates for handwriting have struggled against technological change Anne Trubek, the author of "" The History and Uncertain Future of Handwriting ,"" told CNN that efforts to emphasize cursive have been ongoing ""for years."" And debates about whether we should preserve handwriting are not a strictly modern phenomena, as various periods in history featured standoffs between traditionalists and those who favored new writing and communication technologies. In ancient Greece, Socrates had opposed writing outright, Trubek noted. The philosopher preferred the Greeks' oral tradition and felt those who didn't write things down would preserve a ""better memory,"" she said. Later, monks in the Middle Ages agitated against the invention of the printing press, which threatened to make their beautiful, hand-copied texts obsolete. As inventions like the printing press and the internet catapult humanity forward, ""there will be a loss,"" Trubek said. In the history of handwriting, we're in a unique place in which most Americans alive learned cursive writing, and efforts to re-instill cursive in a new generation of youth represented a new ""reaction"" to ongoing change, she said. A handwriting scholar doesn't think cursive is an essential modern skill Today, debates in favor of cursive take the form of ""tradition strangely grafted onto patriotism,"" she said, nothing that some legislators complained that if students didn't learn how to write in cursive, then they wouldn't be able to read the Declaration of Independence. Trubek, who served as a tenured professor at Oberlin College, said she herself can't read the original flowing script of the Declaration of Independence, and there was nothing wrong with students reading the nation's founding documents in transcribed versions with fonts legible to modern eyes. Trubek also said students didn't necessarily need cursive to come up with their own signature that conferred their ""indviduality"" and ""uniqueness"" in signing legal forms either. She said technology like the chips in credit cards were more effective in preventing fraud than in pen-and-paper signatures that can be forged. ""I don't think children should be required to learn cursive if they don't want to,"" Trubek said. But, still, she said careful, thoughtful has its virtues. ""It's a fine motor skill,"" and taking time to skillfully perfect the art has positive effects on students' cognitive development. ""Handwriting is slower,"" Trubek said, ""And sometimes you just want to slow down."""
Elijah Cummings says he will issue 'friendly subpoena' to Trump accounting firm - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/elijah-cummings-subpoena-mazars-usa/index.html,"(CNN) House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said Friday he will issue what he has previously called a ""friendly subpoena"" to the accounting firm that prepared several years' worth of President Donald Trump's financial statements.
The accounting firm, Mazars USA , had requested such a subpoena from the committee before providing records, and Cummings wrote to committee members he would serve it on Monday. Bank tells House Democrats to issue subpoena if they want Trump financial documents Cummings had requested financial information from Mazars USA dating back 10 years after Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen accused Trump of inflating his net worth in an attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills football team. Cohen provided the committee with Trump's financial statements from 2011, 2012 and 2013 that were prepared by Mazars USA. ""Counsel to Mazars sent a response letter explaining that, pursuant, to the company's legal obligations, Mazars cannot voluntarily turn over the documents 'unless disclosure is made pursuant to, among other things, a congressional subpoena,"" Cummings wrote in his memo to committee members. Cummings and other Democratic committee chairman have been seeking Trump's financial information as part of a plethora of probes into the President and his businesses. Cummings and two other committee chairmen have also requested financial information related to the Trump International Hotel from Capital One, which also requested a subpoena before providing material to Congress. Read More Republicans accused Cummings of abusing the committee's oversight powers in targeting Trump's finances, arguing it's outside of the committee's purview. ""Chairman Cummings's announcement of a subpoena to a private company to pry into the President's personal finances is an astonishing abuse of this Committee's authority and a disgraceful departure from the fair and legitimate oversight he promised,"" Oversight's top Republican, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, said in a statement Friday. But Cummings responded to Republicans in his memo Friday, accusing Jordan of taking ""unprecedented"" action writing to Mazars urging the company not to comply with Cummings' request. This is the first subpoena Cummings has issued as chairman where the committee did not hold a markup to vote on the subpoena. Cummings wrote that he cannot hold a markup because Congress is in recess for the next two weeks, but he instead offered members to send the committee feedback before the subpoena is issued on Monday. House committee chairmen have powers to issue subpoenas unilaterally, but both Cummings and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler have opted to hold markups for their subpoenas so far in the new Congress. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday."
Nancy Pelosi suggests tech companies need more regulation: 'It's a new era' - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Ashley Killough,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/nancy-pelosi-tech-regulation-recode-interview/index.html,"(CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is signaling support for changing a provision in the law that says internet companies aren't considered publishers of anything that's posted on their platforms, and thus aren't held responsible.
Pelosi, in a podcast interview with Kara Swisher of Recode that published Thursday evening, suggested internet companies were taking advantage of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. ""There has to be a bigger sense of responsibility on it,"" she said of the provision. ""And it is not out of the question that that could be removed."" The California Democrat, who represents San Francisco, said the era of self-regulation for these companies should ""probably"" end -- the latest warning sign for Silicon Valley as Democrats grow increasingly critical of big tech firms and their role in shaping the economy, politics and society. ""I think we have to subject it all to scrutiny and cost-benefits and all that, but I do think that it's a new era,"" she said. Read More Her comments come as Vera Jourová, the European Union Commissioner for Justice who's responsible for data privacy, met with senators as well as the US attorney general in Washington this week. Pelosi said she hasn't closely studied Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up big companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, but said ""there could be some clear lines that we see in our community, of companies that maybe could be easily broken up without having any impact, one on the other."" ""I'm a big believer in the antitrust laws, I think that's very important for us to have them and to use them, and to subject those who should be subjected to it. I don't know how all of these should be painted with the same brush, but I think that's a look that should be taken."" Warren released an aggressive plan last month to break up tech giants, targeting the power of Silicon Valley with her populist message as sprawling Internet giants face mounting political backlash ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The far-reaching proposal would impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies with $25 billion or more in annual revenue, forcing Amazon and Google to spin off parts of their companies and relinquish their overwhelming control over online commerce. The plan also aims to unwind some of the highest profile mergers in the industry, like the combinations of Amazon and Whole Foods, and Google and DoubleClick, as well as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp."
"Controversial Colorado gun bill becomes law, 11 sheriffs willing to choose jail over enforcement - CNN",us.cnn.com,Scott McLean,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/colorado-red-flag-gun-laws/index.html,"(CNN) Colorado's controversial ""red flag"" bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis on Friday, with more than half of the state's counties declaring opposition to it and many sheriffs promising not to enforce it at all.
""This is a moment of progress,"" said Colorado House Majority Leader Alec Garnett, one of the legislation's four sponsors. ""Today, we did something that was difficult and that is going to save lives."" Known as the ""Extreme Risk Protection Order,"" the law will allow a family member, a roommate or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily seize a person's firearms if they are deemed a risk to themselves or others. Fourteen other states have passed similar legislation. Still, the law now faces major hurdles, with a pro-gun lobby group promising to challenge it in court. Additionally, a growing number of sheriffs in the state have vowed to ignore the law when it takes effect next year, calling it unconstitutional. Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams told CNN last month that he would rather be found in contempt of court and locked up in his own county jail than carry out a court order to seize a person's weapon. Read More At least 10 other sheriffs contacted by CNN are lining up behind Reams, saying they are prepared to go to jail rather than enforce a law they believe would violate a person's constitutional rights. ""How many judges are going to send all the sheriffs in Colorado who are standing up to this to jail?"" wondered Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, who is among the sheriffs willing to choose jail over enforcement. Garnett said he wasn't concerned about sheriffs being locked up. ""What I'm going to lose sleep over is, if that's the choice that they make, and someone loses their life, someone in crisis goes on a shooting spree, (or) someone commits suicide"" because a gun wasn't taken away, he said. Laws that remove firearms from those considered a safety risk reduce gun-related suicides, study finds Already, 38 of Colorado's 64 counties have officially declared their opposition to the bill, and 35 of them have passed formal resolutions against the law. Many of the resolutions declare the jurisdictions to be Second Amendment ""sanctuary"" or ""preservation"" counties, and pledge not to allocate resources to enforcement of the law. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser he is ""confident that when and if the time comes, all law enforcement officials will follow the rule of law."" Reams insists he's not bluffing. So does Prowers County Sheriff Sam Zordel. ""I've already asked the coroner if he wanted to come over (to the jail) and get some training,"" he said, explaining that if he becomes an inmate, the coroner would be tasked with running the county jail. This Colorado sheriff is willing to go to jail rather than enforce a proposed gun law Others took a more measured approach. ""I'm willing to go to my jail for it, the only exception would be a totally extreme case and most sheriffs would agree with that,"" said Park County Sheriff Tom McGraw. The law is meant to be used only in the most extreme cases, but critics believe it will allow for guns to be taken based on a false accusation. A non-partisan analysis of the bill by Colorado's Legislative Council Staff predicted that the number of false red flag petitions would be minimal, and that the law would only be used 170 times per year. California and Washington use similar red flag laws even less than that, though a similar law in Maryland is enforced six times more often than the Colorado estimate. Legal challenges could be on the way ""Rocky Mountain Gun Owners is going to file a lawsuit against the red flag legislation before the end of the session,"" the lobby group's executive director, Dudley Brown, said. The legislative session ends May 3. Brown also said there could be a second lawsuit filed after the bill becomes law, but declined to provide more details. Brown is also planning recall efforts of ""at least 10"" state lawmakers who supported the legislation. Two Colorado lawmakers were successfully recalled in 2013 after supporting controversial background check legislation and a restriction on magazine size. The El Paso County Sheriff's office initially said the county would file a lawsuit when the legislation became law. The county now says it is still ""in the brainstorming phase"" of a potential lawsuit, according to county spokesman Matt Steiner. New York's governor, joined by Nancy Pelosi, signs 'red flag' gun protection law According to the Giffords Law Center, which lobbies for tougher gun laws, there have not been any successful legal challenges of any similar state laws. There is, however, an ongoing complaint in an Illinois district court asking for an injunction, arguing that the law violates the Second and 14th amendments. Assuming Colorado's law withstands a court challenge, defiant local sheriffs are on a legal collision course with the state. State law enforcement agencies like the Colorado State Patrol do ""not have the authority to supersede local control,"" and seize the guns instead, according to Shelby Wieman, a spokeswoman for Gov. Polis. Polis is confident that law enforcement will not ignore court orders to seize weapons, but if they do, it would be for the district courts or the state attorney general to resolve. Ignoring gun laws versus immigration laws The declaration of a ""sanctuary county"" borrows the phrasing used by immigration advocates to describe jurisdictions where local law enforcement does not cooperate with federal immigration authorities, even when undocumented immigrants charged with crimes enter local jails. If it's OK to ignore immigration laws, why can't Colorado counties ignore gun laws? University of Denver law professor John Campbell said local law enforcement ""can't choose not to enforce their state's law."" But the enforcement of federal laws, such as immigration legislation, are voluntary for local authorities. If a sheriff were to ignore a court order to seize a person's guns and they use them to hurt someone, Campbell believes the sheriff could be held liable. Law enforcement has immunity for genuine mistakes, but not for recklessness or blatantly ignoring their legal duty. ""Those are classic conditions to create liability even when people typically would enjoy immunity,"" he said. While the legal obligation to enforce court-ordered gun seizures is different than enforcing immigration laws, Campbell said the outcomes can be the same -- someone getting hurt or killed. Kate Steinle In 2015, 31-year-old Kate Steinle was killed by an undocumented immigrant who was released from jail despite a request from federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to turn him over. A federal appeals court ruled last month that Steinle's parents cannot sue over San Francisco's ""sanctuary"" policy that allowed her killer to avoid deportation and walk free. Garnett said sheriffs should enforce the new gun law, but wouldn't make a statement on enforcing immigration law. ""Immigration laws are primarily federal issues and I'm not going to get into that,"" he said. Sheriff Reams acknowledged his risk of liability for ignoring a court-ordered gun seizure, but he's not worried. ""The person who commits a crime against another is truly the person responsible,"" he said, adding that if a person is mentally ill, he would use existing laws to detain them for treatment. ""We still intend to deal with the person."""

Mall of America: A man in custody after he allegedly threw or pushed a child from balcony - CNN,us.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/mall-of-america-child-thrown/index.html,"(CNN) A 5-year-old child suffered life-threatening injuries when, according to witnesses, a man either threw or pushed the child from the third floor of the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, police said Friday.
Police Chief Jeff Potts Quote: d witnesses as saying the person suspected of pushing or throwing the child ""took off running immediately after the incident."" A suspect was soon found inside the mall's transit station and was taken into custody. Bloomington police said later Friday that Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, was charged with attempted homicide in connection with the incident. Aranda lives in the Bloomington area, police said. He had two previous trespass notices ordering him to stay away from the Mall of America, according to the Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis. Bloomington police released this photo of Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, charged with attempted homicide in an incident in which a child was pushed or thrown from the third floor of the Mall of America. Potts told reporters that police were called to the mall at 10:17 a.m. local time, and initial information suggested a child had fallen from the third level of the mall's interior to the first level. Additional information from witnesses indicated the 5-year-old might have been pushed or thrown, Potts said. Read More Police officers gave the child first aid along with witnesses, Potts said. ""The child did suffer significant injuries,"" he said. ""The child has been transported to the hospital and has been receiving care."" Police said in a later statement that the child's injuries were life-threatening. ""At this time, we do not believe that there is a relationship between the child or the family of the child,"" Potts said Friday, emphasizing that police believe this to be an ""isolated incident."" The area where the fall occurred was closed. A witness told CNN affiliate WCCO that the child's mother was screaming that someone had thrown her child from the balcony. ""She was screaming, 'Everyone pray, everyone pray. Oh my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge,'"" Brian Johnson told WCCO. A Mall of America spokesperson said in a statement that any additional information about the incident would come from police."
WH told by lawyers in February that proposal to drop migrants in sanctuary cities had legal issues - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jake Tapper,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities-migrants/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Though President Donald Trump on Friday publicly revealed his proposal to transport and release undocumented immigrants into sanctuary cities, the White House received legal guidance months ago that such a policy would run afoul of the law, open the administration to lawsuits, and ultimately undermine the President's desire to deport undocumented immigrants.
In February, according to documents obtained by CNN, the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, John Mitnick, told the White House in writing that such a move could only be done if there was a ""strong, mission-related rationale"" pertaining to the responsibilities of DHS. The reasons the President has publicly stated for the policy proposal -- one that senior administration officials tell CNN he has been pushing for behind the scenes for months -- are decidedly not related to the DHS mission statement. ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,"" Trump tweeted Friday. ""The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!"" Mitnick, whose insistence that immigration policies and actions fall within the confines of the law, has aroused the ire of Trump, top aide Stephen Miller and other immigration hardliners in the White House, made it clear in his legal guidance that the ""mission related rationale"" for transporting undocumented immigrants did not include political retaliation. Read More While the department has the legal authority to use its budget to move and release migrants to locations far from where they were apprehended, detained or processed, officials could only do so in a way consistent with what the comptroller general had referred to as ""an authorized agency purpose,"" Mitnick wrote. Examples of this that he cited included providing appropriate health care, fulfilling a transfer request or relieving facility overcrowding. Moreover, Mitnick noted, such a proposal could be self-defeating: transporting an undocumented immigrant to a remote location where he had no ties would increase the likelihood that he would become a flight risk and not attend his removal proceedings. Challenging the White House to provide a ""strong mission-related rationale"" for the proposal, Mitnick noted that even if they could provide such rationales, the new policy would prompt a ""litigation risk"" for the US government for violating the ""due process"" rights of the undocumented immigrants by moving them to places where they have no community, family ties, or employment opportunities. The move would have created grounds for a migrant to claim hardship and increasing the likelihood of habeas litigation accusing the US government of ordering releases that were not ""reasonable,"" he argued. Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment. Senior administration officials tell CNN that Mitnick's legal analysis was shared with the White House and DHS lawyers spoke with the White House Counsel's Office within days to explain their reasoning. ""Once the lawyers explained it, the issue was ultimately dropped,"" an official said. That is, until it broke on Thursday and the President took to Twitter to defend it and bring it back to life on Friday."
International Criminal Court rejects call to investigate war crimes in Afghanistan - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jennifer Hansler,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/icc-rejects-afghanistan-investigation/index.html,"(CNN) The International Criminal Court's pre-trial judges on Friday unanimously rejected a request by the court's chief prosecutor to investigate alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan -- a move applauded by the Trump administration.
Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda sought authorization in November 2017 to open an investigation into crimes connected to the conflict in Afghanistan. According to a statement from the time, Bensouda's office ""determined that there is a reasonable basis to believe"" that members of the US armed forces and the CIA committed ""war crimes,"" particularly in 2003-2004. US revokes visa of International Criminal Court chief prosecutor According to a media release about the decision, the three judge panel ""concluded that an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan at this stage would not serve the interests of justice."" The judges considered the time since the 2006 preliminary examination ""and the political changing scene in Afghanistan since then"" as well as ""the lack of cooperation that the Prosecutor has received,"" which they said was ""likely to go scarcer should an investigation be authorized."" However, the judges found Bensouda's request ""establishes a reasonable basis to consider that crimes within the ICC jurisdiction have been committed in Afghanistan,"" according to the release. Bensouda's office noted this in its statement about the decision and said it would ""further analyse the decision and its implications, and consider all available legal remedies."" Amnesty International pilloried the decision, calling it ""a shocking abandonment of the victims"" that ""ultimately will be seen as a craven capitulation to Washington's bullying and threats."" Read More ""The court has a moral and legal duty to reach out to the victims of crimes in Afghanistan and explain this decision,"" Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International, said in a statement. The Trump administration welcomed the move, which came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in mid-March that the US would deny or revoke visas for ICC staff in response to the potential investigation. ""This decision is a victory for the rule of law and the integrity of the ICC as an institution, given the United States is not subject to the ICC's jurisdiction,"" Pompeo said in a statement Friday. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead,"" Pompeo reiterated that the ICC ""has no jurisdiction"" over the US. ""This would have been a very political effort to try to take on people acting on behalf of the United States in ways that were completely consistent with our laws and try to hold them accountable in ways that were completely inappropriate,"" he said. ""I am very pleased the ICC made this decision today. It's the right one."" ""Know that if Americans are found things to have done things that are unlawful or against the laws of war, the US system will always hold them accountable, but the ICC is not the right place to do it,"" Pompeo said. President Donald Trump said that it was ""a major international victory, not only for these patriots, but for the rule of law."" ""We welcome this decision and reiterate our position that the United States holds American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards,"" he said in a statement, warning that ""any attempt to target American, Israeli, or allied personnel for prosecution will be met with a swift and vigorous response."" National security adviser John Bolton hailed the move as ""a vindication of our position."" ""We are a democratic society, we are accountable for what we do and we hold our own citizens responsible for their actions. No international court under those circumstances can be constitutionally legitimate,"" Bolton said during a briefing with reporters Friday. In early April, Bensouda's office and the State Department confirmed that her entry visa to the US had been revoked. ""The Office of the Prosecutor has an independent and impartial mandate under the Rome Statute of the ICC. The Prosecutor and her Office will continue to undertake that statutory duty with utmost commitment and professionalism, without fear or favor,"" her office said in a statement. Correction: This story has been updated to correct the first name of the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor."
"Pompeo dismisses data showing positive impact of Central American aid, defends cuts - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/pompeo-tapper-central-america-aid-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the Trump administration's decision to cut aid to Central American countries in a Friday interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead,"" dismissing data that shows aid has lowered murder rates and migrant flows to the US in the past.
Tapper cited State Department statistics that show that after the US launched an aid program to El Salvador, homicide rates went down and the number of migrants fleeing to the US dropped as well. Similar results were seen in Honduras and Guatemala, the other two ""Northern Triangle"" countries to which the Trump administration announced April 1 that it will cut aid. Tapper asked Pompeo if the aid cuts were ""self-defeating"" given past results. Disconnect Read More ""Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent,"" said Pompeo, ""and you see the results."" He argued that the US had been ""throwing more money at those problems"" with little impact and there is ""no reason to expect we'll get any different outcome."" When Tapper pointed out that the data showed the aid had a positive impact and that the numbers came from Pompeo's own department, the top US diplomat said, ""I think that President Trump's decision makes perfect sense ... I think the data you describe proves this point."" ""If what you're doing doesn't work,"" Pompeo said, you should stop. Tapper tried again, pointing out that homicides went down and ""fewer people came,"" according to ""your agency's data."" The Obama administration launched an ""Alliance for Prosperity"" initiative in 2014 to respond to a crisis of unaccompanied minors being sent to the US southern border. The goal was to improve security and economic opportunity in those countries to reduce the incentive for migrants to leave and try to enter the US. 'Return on our investment' The US committed $420 million to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for fiscal year 2017, while the three Northern Triangle countries committed $5.4 billion to support investments public safety and opportunity. The Global Leadership Coalition, an organization of retired military leaders, diplomats and members of Congress, reported that the aid "" not only worked , but also delivered a return on our investment for the American taxpayer."" Homicide rates declined by 42% in El Salvador, 13% in Guatemala, and 23% in Honduras from 2015 to 2017. By 2017, American assistance helped improve security and economic conditions throughout the region, and border-crossing apprehensions had fallen to their lowest point since 1971, the group reports. In fiscal year 2017, the US provided approximately $837 million in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico for such programs to help them address the root causes of migration including brutal violence, hunger, and instability in communities. Salvadoran migrants begin their journey in caravan heading the United States, in San Salvador, on November 18, 2018. - The migrants are mostly fleeing poverty and unrest in Central America's ""Northern Triangle"" -- El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where brutal gang violence has fuelled some of the highest murder rates in the world. (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS / AFP) (Photo credit should read MARVIN RECINOS/AFP/Getty Images) Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced April 1 that the Trump administration would cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras because the countries ""could do more"" to mitigate the ""humanitarian crisis"" at the southern border. The decision has been criticized by lawmakers, analysts, security and migration experts. Officials would not say exactly how much money would be affected by the Trump directive and some of it has likely already been spent. Between last year and this year, about $1.3 billion was allocated to the region, with the vast majority of it going to those three countries, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service."

""Game of Thrones"" is not just a TV show. Since it premiered eight years ago, it has inspired countless articles, fan sites, podcasts and viewing parties. The HBO series has been a boon for bloggers and journalists who have made careers out of reporting on every development from Westeros. ""I think that's the question everyone's asking themselves: What comes next? "" Joanna Robinson, a senior writer at Vanity Fair , told CNN Business.
Robinson, who specializes in ""Thrones"" coverage for the magazine while also hosting three ""Thrones"" podcasts in her spare time, said that she's written ""likely hundreds of stories"" about the show. That may seem normal now due to its popularity, but when she started at Vanity Fair, she said she had an editor who told her that one ""Thrones"" story a week was more than enough. ""Now, there's no such thing as too much 'Game of Thrones' content,"" she said.
Robinson said the show definitely helped ""elevate her career"" and gave her opportunities she never expected, like writing a cover story on ""Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke. But she isn't too emotional about the series coming to an end -- at least not yet. ""Talk to me again in a few weeks and maybe I'll cry about the end of 'Game of Thrones,'"" she said. ""But now there's too much work to do.""

David Benioff loved the way ""The Sopranos"" ended, but he well remembers all of the arguments about it.
Benioff and his fellow ""Game of Thrones"" showrunner Dan Weiss talked to Entertainment Weekly about their show's forthcoming series finale.
The eighth and final ""GoT"" season starts Sunday and viewers have already started theorizing about, and agonizing over, how it will all conclude .
Benioff told EW ""From the beginning, we've talked about how the show would end."" ""A good story isn't a good story if you have a bad ending,"" he said. ""Of course we worry.""
Benioff talked about how hotly debated the ending of ""The Sopranos"" was was when it aired in 2007. The screen cut abruptly to black in the middle of a tense scene, leading many viewers to think their cable had gone out.
""I've gotten into a lot of arguments with people about why that was a great ending, but people felt legitimately cheated and that's their right to feel that way, just as it's my right to feel like they're idiots,"" he said.
Benioff is not shying from such debate.
""It's also part of the fun of any show that people love arguing about it,"" he said.
Weiss said there's another popular finale he hopes their ending evokes.
""I'm hoping we get the 'Breaking Bad' [finale] argument where it's like, ""Is that an A or an A+?,'"" he said. ""I want that to be the argument. I just wish we found better directors for it.""

""People say I look like a White Walker,"" Anderson Cooper recalls saying to ""60 MInutes"" producer John Hamlin. ""It would be cool to become one.""
It took about four hours, but it happened.
Watch as Cooper, reporting for ""60 Minutes,"" transforms into a White Walker while behind the scenes of ""Game of Thrones."" 10 hr 7 min ago What's this GoT phenomenon all about, anyway? By Brian Lowry
""When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,"" the character of Cersei, played by Lena Headey, said in season one of ""Game of Thrones.""
Those uninitiated in the phenomenon must surely wonder what all the fuss is about, especially as the HBO drama becomes increasingly difficult to avoid in the build-up to its series finale. Dragons and debauchery, after all, don't sound like much of a breakthrough.
While there's seldom a simple explanation for why something catches on in Hollywood, the show's popularity stems in part from how well it has bridged the gap between movies and TV, between theatrical blockbusters and dense serialized drama. ""Thrones"" managed to answer the question what it would look like if ""The Sopranos"" and ""Star Wars"" had a baby, with all the pop-culture hysteria that entails.
Some keys to its appeal include: A deft mix of character-driven drama Carefully layered fantasy elements A brilliant cast Epic battle sequences and startling deaths
Even if sex, violence and dragons aren't your cup of tea (or ale), ""Thrones"" accomplished what it set out to do -- commercially as well as creatively -- in a manner that's virtually unmatched in terms of its scope and scale. 10 hr 7 min ago A little history lesson By Sarah Dwyer Minnear and Brandon Griggs
The fantasy world of ""Game of Thrones"" is not as mythical as it seems.
Some of the show's most pivotal moments are rooted in history as author George R.R. Martin often draws from the historical record. The rampant feuding in ""Game of Thrones"" is likely inspired in part by the Wars of the Roses in 15th-century England between the Lancasters and the Yorks -- and the feuding in Scotland, which was far more prevalent.
Blood feuding, both in Scotland and in Westeros, evokes images of bloodthirsty men of the aristocracy, eager to exact retribution for slain family members. However, for every Rob Stark we have a Catelyn Stark, who took it upon herself to avenge her dead husband.
So what does history tell us about these bold women?
Historian Keith Brown, Dean of Humanities at the University of Manchester, notes that the women of early Scottish history were seen as ""soft targets"" in the eyes of acquisitive neighbors -- or sometimes their own family -- and their ""best defense lay in marriage."" Yet these women could also wield power to avenge their families, not unlike Cersei Lannister, Margaery Tyrell and Sansa Stark.

"Bonnie Haim case: Husband found guilty of killing her in 1993, burying body in backyard - CNN",us.cnn.com,"Ray Sanchez and Tristan Smith, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/bonnie-michael-haim-trial-closing/index.html,"(CNN) Michael Haim, who took the stand to deny killing his wife and burying her body in their backyard in 1993, was found guilty by a Florida jury Friday of second-degree murder.
The jury of three men and three women deliberated about 90 minutes before their verdict in the high-profile cold case was announced. Haim showed no expression as the verdict was read. Haim's son, Aaron Fraser, was among the relatives of Haim's then-wife, Bonnie, sitting on the prosecution side of the court. Some wiped tears. As a boy, Fraser would play with a toy dump truck in his backyard in Jacksonville, Florida. As a man, excavating behind his childhood home in 2014 as part of a renovation, he wielded a shovel -- and discovered the yard was a clandestine grave. Fraser would find the skull and bones of his mother, who had gone missing in January 1993. Read More ""On that day, that mother and child reunion brought Aaron Fraser face to face with the product of this defendant's ill will,"" prosecutor Mac Heavener told a state jury Friday, referring to Haim. Michael Haim is accused of killing his wife, Bonnie Haim, in 1993. ""It brought him face to face with the product of this defendant's hatred,"" the prosecutor said. ""And it brought him face to face with the product of this defendant's spite and evil intent."" Wearing glasses and an olive-colored suit, Michael Haim, 53, stared straight ahead and displayed no emotion --not then, nor any other time Heavener pointed at him during closing arguments. The defendant took the stand this week and maintained his innocence, as he has since his wife disappeared. ""I loved my wife,"" he testified Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WJXT. ""I would never hurt my wife."" But Heavener described Michael Haim as a man going through marital problems and -- again pointing at the defendant -- a ""guy who's really good, really accomplished at burying the truth."" After reaching the verdict, Judge Steven Whittington began the penalty phase of the case. The same jurors heard testimony from witnesses about aggravating factors that could get Haim a longer sentence: whether the crime was committed in presence of a family member, included tampering with evidence, was committed in a heinous, atrocious and cruel manner, and inflicted severe emotional trauma on the victim's family. The jury agreed on three of the aggravating factors but found the crime was not committed in a heinous, atrocious and cruel manner. Fraser testified that he has been in therapy since childhood. He described a ""very uneasy"" encounter in which his paternal grandparents told him that they loved him but that he had been ""brainwashed."" He also spoke about finding his mother's skull in the yard of his childhood home. ""It was very tough,"" he said. ""I think everybody can imagine, even if it's not a loved one, finding a skull and picking it up and what that would do to somebody. Not to mention, that it was your mother."" Sentencing is set for May 17. Prosecutors lay out their theory On January 7, 1993, Bonnie Haim did not show up to work. Michael Haim would later say the couple fought the prior night and that she left the house alone around 11 p.m. Heavener told jurors the defendant had the motive, the opportunity and the ability to kill his wife. He knew Bonnie Haim planned to leave him and take their son, then 3 years old. The night before she disappeared, she called her best friend. She was crying and upset. She told her friend that she would speak with her in the morning. Referring to Michael Haim as ""Mr. Ill Will. Mr. Spite. Mr. Evil Intent,"" the prosecutor said the defendant owned the type of firearm used to kill Bonnie Haim and that a sandy footprint on the floor mat of her car matched his size 10 Nike sneakers. ""You'll see the truth scream from those floor mats,"" Heavener said. ""The shoe print speaks volumes in this case. ... He had just finished digging that grave."" Bonnie Haim's purse was later found behind a Red Roof Inn near Jacksonville International Airport, where police later discovered her car in an airport parking lot. Heavener said a lone key to Bonnie's car was in her purse. Another car key, along with her house key, was at the couple's home. ""It's pretty odd to think that a woman is going to leave her son, abandon her job and leave her house (without) a set of keys she normally uses, leaving all her earthly belongings inside,"" the prosecutor said. 'A lot of reasonable doubt in this case' Beyond his client's claim of innocence, Michael Haim's defense attorney told jurors the state's case was built on ""innuendo"" and ""hypotheticals that don't exist."" ""Michael Haim is not guilty, not because I say he's not, but because that's what the law is in this case,"" Tom Fallis said. ""You will find a lot of reasonable doubt in this case."" Prosecutors were stretching the truth to secure a conviction, Fallis said. ""They're going to stretch a lot because they don't have the evidence they need to prove beyond reasonable doubt,"" he said. ""They'll take anything and stretch it to get that conviction because that's what they do. That's what their job is."" In rebuttal, Assistant State Attorney Alan Mizrahi told jurors: ""The truth about this case demands justice. Bonnie Haim cannot get justice. It's up to us, the living, to find justice for her."" Michael Haim took the stand Thursday, attesting to his love for Bonnie Haim. He also testified to his wife's state of mind on their last night together in January 1993. ""She'd been unhappy for, maybe, a month, maybe two,"" he said. ""I can't put my finger on how long, but it had been going on where she wasn't her bubbly self like she was."" A prosecutor asked Michael Haim why he went to bed the night his wife walked out, tucking in next to his preschooler. ""I assumed she was going to her mother's,"" he said. ""I don't really know what else to tell you."" Defense attorney Janis Warren said during opening statements that prosecutors did not have enough evidence to prove Michael Haim's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ""We agree she's dead. We agree that's her body in the backyard. But they have to prove to you that he did it,"" she said. ""When you listen to the evidence, ladies and gentlemen, and when you're finished, you're gonna see the lack of evidence in this case far outweighs any evidence they brought you."" Inmates testify to jailhouse confession But two inmates on Wednesday testified that Michael Haim in 2015 confessed to killing his wife while he was in jail with them, WJXT reported. ""He started talking about, you know, how he killed his wife: how he choked her, how her son was mad at him. He buried her in the yard,"" Terrance Richardson said. The discovery of Bonnie Haim's body a year earlier had led officials to arrest Michael Haim and charge him with second-degree murder, prosecutors have said. He found a body at his childhood home's backyard during renovations. It was his mom ""The truth was always out there, buried in their backyard,"" prosecutor Mizrahi said Tuesday during opening statements. The childhood memories of Fraser, who reportedly assumed his last name when he was adopted, also became a major part of the case. Shortly after his mother vanished, he told a child welfare worker, ""Daddy hurt Mommy,"" WJXT reported. ""Aaron also stated that, 'Daddy shot Mommy,' and, 'My daddy could not wake her up,'"" a 2015 arrest affidavit said, according to WJXT . Bonnie Haim's remains were found under a shower pallet in the home's backyard, according to testimony. A .22-caliber shell was also found near the body, and Michael Haim owned a .22-caliber rifle. Although a medical examiner could not affirmatively determine how she was killed, Mizrahi argued that Michael Haim shot her in 1993, then buried her. ""The defendant's actions before the killing and after the killing demonstrate his depraved indifference to Bonnie Haim's life,"" he said. Investigators had searched the property several times in the years after her disappearance but did not find her remains until Fraser's discovery two decades later. But Warren, the defense attorney, reiterated to jurors that prosecutors would not be able to prove that Michael Haim killed her and placed her body there on the night she disappeared. ""The only thing that's important is: Can they prove he killed her? And can they prove he put the body in the yard?"" she said. ""There's no evidence of either one of those."""
'Crying girl' picture near US border wins World Press Photo of the Year - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Jason Hanna, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/crying-girl-john-moore-immigration-photo-of-the-year/index.html,"(CNN) A photo of a 2-year-old girl crying near the US-Mexico border -- a child who became an iconic face of President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy last year -- has won the World Press Photo of the Year award.
The image, titled ""Crying Girl on the Border,"" was taken by Getty photographer and Pulitzer Prize-winner John Moore on June 12 near McAllen, Texas. The Netherlands-based World Press Photo organization announced the award Thursday evening at a ceremony in Amsterdam. ""I think this image touched many people's hearts, as it did mine, because it humanizes a larger story,"" the organization Quote: d Moore as saying . Before the photo was taken, the Honduran girl and her mother had rafted with others across the Rio Grande and were stopped in Texas by US Border Patrol agents. Read More Agents were searching people before they were put into vans to be driven to a processing center. Moore took the award-winning picture after the toddler's mother set her down so that the mother could be searched. ""One of the last people to get on the bus was the mother of this child and her daughter together,"" Moore told CNN's Ana Cabrera last year . ""And when they went to body-search (the mother) against the vehicle, they asked her to put down her child. And right then, in that moment, the little girl broke into tears."" The annual photo award, decided by a jury of photojournalists and photographers , carries a prize of 10,000 euros (nearly $11,300). Photo appeared as controversy about immigration policy heated up Photos that Moore took of the girl that night were widely published amid a fierce public debate last year about the Trump administration's immigration policies, which effectively resulted in children being separated from adults after they crossed the US border from Mexico. Children could not follow their adult family members or guardians into custody, so US guidelines mandated that those children be separated -- often from their parents. After the picture was published, US Customs and Border Protection said the girl and her mother had not been separated . Later that month, Trump signed an executive order reversing the policy to separate children from adults. A similar photo was used in a Time magazine cover A different photo of the girl -- taken by Moore on the same night, with the crying girl gazing upward -- was used as part of Time magazine's July 2 cover . In a photo illustration, Trump looms over the sobbing child. ""Welcome to America,"" the illustration reads. Moore told Time that he had to ""stop and take deep breaths"" after capturing images of the girl."
Trump Fed pick Stephen Moore is a self-described 'radical' who said he's not a 'big believer in democracy' - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,"Andrew Kaczynski and Paul LeBlanc, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/stephen-moore-kfile/index.html,"(CNN) Stephen Moore, who President Donald Trump announced last month as his nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has a history of advocating self-described ""radical"" views on the economy and government.
In speeches and radio interviews reviewed by CNN's KFile, Moore advocated for eliminating the corporate and federal income taxes entirely, calling the 16th Amendment that created the income tax the ""most evil"" law passed in the 20th century. Moore's economic worldview envisions a slimmed down government and a rolled back social safety net. He has called for eliminating the Departments of Labor, Energy and Commerce, along with the IRS and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. He has questioned the need for both the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education. He has said there's no need for a federal minimum wage, called for privatizing the ""Ponzi scheme"" of Social Security and said those on government assistance lost their dignity and meaning. In other interviews and appearances, Moore repeatedly said he believed capitalism was more important than democracy. Trump announced he would nominate Moore to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last month. Moore works at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He served as an adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and is a friend of the president's economic adviser Larry Kudlow. He was formerly a CNN contributor. Read More The nomination immediately drew criticism because Moore has been a fierce critic of the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell. In 2015 , he called for abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold standard (Moore told CNN's Erin Burnett on Thursday he changed his mind on the gold standard. He told CNN's KFile on Friday he no longer believed in abolishing the Federal Reserve). In a column in December , Moore called for Powell to resign for hiking interest rates. Moore claimed the comments were probably written ""in a time of anger,"" but in February, he called Powell one of Trump's ""worst appointments"" and called for firing hundreds of employees at the Federal Reserve Board who he called ""worthless"" economists. ""There's no bigger swamp in Washington than the Federal Reserve Board,"" Moore said in a February interview posted on Vimeo . ""It's filled with hundreds of economists who are worthless, who have the wrong model in their mind. They should all be, they should all be fired and they should be replaced by good economists."" Turning to Powell, Moore said, ""I spoke to the President last week about this and he was extremely upset that he had, I think made -- it was one of his worst political appointments -- and now he's stuck with the guy for, I think he's under a four-or-five-year appointment."" Views on taxes Moore has repeatedly called for a ""radical"" plan to grow the economy by getting rid of the corporate income tax and personal income tax. ""We have to eliminate the corporate income tax entirely in my opinion because it is just a millstone around the neck of this economy,"" Moore said on a 2012 panel . Speaking in 2015, Moore called for getting rid of the income tax and moving to a national sales tax. ""What is the income tax rate in Texas and Florida,"" Moore said. ""Zero. There is no income tax. Why can't we have no income tax on the federal level. Let's get rid of the damn income tax and do taxes like we do in Texas and Florida. So Texas and Florida have no income tax."" Speaking on the Glenn Beck Program in 2007, a transcript of which is available on the Web Archive, Moore called the 16th amendment -- which created the federal income tax -- ""the most the most evil act that has passed in 100 years."" Views on capitalism and democracy Moore has repeatedly said he believes capitalism is more important than democracy. In an interview for Michael Moore's 2009 film ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" Moore said he wasn't a big believer in democracy. ""Capitalism is a lot more important than democracy,"" Moore said. ""I'm not even a big believer in democracy. I always say that democracy can be two wolves and a sheep deciding on what to have for dinner. Look, I'm in favor of people having the right to vote and things like that. But there are a lot of countries that have the right to vote that are still poor. Democracy doesn't always lead to a good economy or even a good political system."" Speaking on the Thom Hartmann Show in 2010 , Moore reiterated this belief, saying Hitler was democratically elected and Saudi Arabia wouldn't be better off as a democracy. ""I think capitalism, without free market capitalism, countries don't get rich,"" Moore said, when asked if capitalism was more important than democracy. ""And so I would rather have a country that's based on, you know, a free enterprise system of property rights and free exchange of free trade of low tax rates, than a country that state, there are a lot of democracies --."" In a 2010 speech , Moore said he believed democracy meant that Democrats have an ""intentional"" plan to take voters off the income tax rolls and have them vote for expanding government. Moore told CNN's KFile, ""I believe in free market capitalism and representative government. It is what has made America the greatest nation and the most prosperous nation on earth."" Views on the minimum wage, social security, and welfare Moore has repeatedly expressed a desire to rollback the social safety net in the country, including Social Security, which he has called ""the soft underbelly of the welfare state"" and frequently said is ""a Bernie Madoff-style Ponzi scheme that will eventually sink into insolvency unless reformed."" Moore told CNN's KFile he believes in letting young people put their retirement savings in 401K accounts on a voluntary basis instead of Social Security and that wouldn't cut benefits to those already on it. Speaking at an event in 2014, Moore said those on government assistance ---- ""the dole"" ---- were depleted of dignity or meaning in their lives. ""You know, we have too many people dependent on government and the cost isn't so much of what it costs our fisc -- you know, the fiscal situation, it's really expensive. The cost, it just depletes people of their dignity and their meaning in life,"" he said. ""I mean, there's nothing worse than being on the dole, right?"" Moore told CNN's KFile, ""There are too many people on welfare and the best way to help the poor is to get them a job and good schools and economic opportunity. The welfare state hurts the very people it has supposed to have helped. No one should go hungry or homeless or without basic health care, but there is abetted (sic) way than handouts."" Medicaid, Moore said in February 2018, was a ""dumbass"" system. ""You cannot come up -- I said this earlier this morning to one of the sessions, some of you may have been in it -- you truly could not come up with a dumber system than Medicaid. I mean really, I mean if we sat here and tried to think how can we make the dumbass, you know, Medicaid system the worst system possible we would come up with what they have right now."" Moore told CNN's KFile he stood by his comments on Medicaid, saying he'd instead give ""the poor a medical savings account and let them buy health care in the open market."" And a federal minimum wage, Moore said last year at a Heritage Foundation event, is not necessary. ""You don't need a federal minimum wage. You need, you need pro-growth policies that will cause companies to raise the ratio."" Moore told CNN's KFile he doesn't want to abolish the minimum wage."
Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play sleepers recalled - CNN,us.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/fisher-price-rock-n-play-sleeper-recall/index.html,"(CNN) The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price are recalling all of the company's Rock 'n Play Sleepers, with the commission linking the product to over 30 infant deaths in 10 years.
The recall will impact about 4.7 million sleepers, the commission said. ""I'm urging parents to stop using this product immediately and to contact Fisher-Price for a refund or a voucher,"" said Ann Marie Buerkle, the CPSC's acting chairwoman. This grieving family wants Fisher-Price's Rock 'n Play sleeper recalled and pediatrics group agrees Chuck Scothon, general manager at Fisher-Price, said the company considered the recall the ""best course of action"" and will continue to stand by the safety of all its products. ""With these actions, we want parents around the world to know that safety will always be a cornerstone of our mission, that we are committed to these values, and will continue to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of the infants and preschoolers who utilize our products,"" Scothon said. Read More The decision comes a week after the commission and Fisher-Price issued a warning about the product, prompting calls from the American Academy of Pediatrics and grieving parents for an immediate recall. The commission said Friday that ""over 30 infant fatalities have occurred in Rock 'n Play Sleepers, after the infants rolled over while unrestrained, or under other circumstances"" since 2009. The recall did not say what caused the infants' deaths. Last week, the CPSC had only cited reports of 10 fatalities -- of babies 3 months or older -- but a Consumer Reports analysis linked the popular sleeper to 32 infant deaths, between 2011 and 2018. Patty Davis, a spokeswoman with CPSC, had said the commission was aware of the report of additional fatalities and were looking into those deaths. Following Friday's recall, Buerkle said the investigation into the sleepers had been a top priority for the commission and announced that officials will continue looking into other inclined sleep products. ""I urge consumers to report any incidents with inclined sleepers or other nursery products to CPSC at saferproducts.gov,"" she said in a video statement. ""As a mother and grandmother there's nothing more important to me than the safety of our children."" For more information about the recall, customers can contact Fisher-Price at www.service.mattel.com and click on ""Recalls & Safety Alerts"" or at 866-812-6518 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. Their 5-month-old son died in 2017 Keenan and Evan Overton 's son had been sleeping in the product when he died three days before Christmas 2017. Their son, 5-month-old Ezra, was napping in the sleeper while his father, Keenan Overton, was asleep on the couch next to him. ""I looked up and I found him in a standing position but faced down in the chair, his face was on the back of the seat and he was already passed away. I picked him up and his face was already blue and his nose was squished in,"" Keenan Overton told CNN. Ezra Overton Ezra wouldn't have been able to roll over yet, Overton said. Evan Overton, the infant's mother, said they haven't filed suit but are negotiating with Fisher-Price. ""Fisher-Price and Mattel, their parent company, we are in negotiations to discuss kind of what we expect from talking about and speaking out on the dangers of this chair,"" Evan Overton said. ""Our main thing is to inform other people so, that it won't happen to somebody else."" Jan Hinson, an attorney representing the Overtons, said they were glad to hear about the recall and are now planning to sue Fisher-Price. ""They want parents to know this chair is not for any babies,"" Hinson said. ""The chair is not fit for any age."""
"Federal judge rebukes Trump attacks on courts, compares to segregationist era - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Ariane de Vogue,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/federal-judge-compares-trump-segregationist-era/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A federal district court judge took a broad, unprecedented swipe against President Donald Trump on Thursday, accusing his administration of launching a ""great assault on our judiciary.""
Judge Carlton Wayne Reeves of the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi called for more diversity in the federal courts, arguing that a more diverse judicial system ensures justice for all. ""When politicians attack courts as 'dangerous,' 'political' and guilty of 'egregious overreach,' you can hear the Klan's lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South,"" Reeves told an audience at University of Virginia Law School on Thursday while accepting the school's Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal. For his remarks, Reeves, was nominated by President Barack Obama in 2010, Quote: d directly from Trump's tweets, campaign speeches and interviews, although he did not specifically name Trump in his speech. The Point: Donald Trump just showed how low he'll go on immigration ""When the powerful accuse courts of 'opening up our country to potential terrorists' you can hear the Southern Manifesto's authors smearing the judiciary for simply upholding the rights of black folk,"" Reeves said, adding, ""And when the Executive Branch calls our courts and their work 'stupid,' 'horrible,' 'ridiculous,' 'incompetent,' 'a laughingstock,' and a 'complete and total disgrace,' you can hear the slurs and threats of executives like George Wallace echoing into the present."" Read More BuzzFeed first reported on his remarks. It is exceedingly rare for a sitting judge to launch an attack against a sitting president. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reeves particularly noted Trump's attacks against US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a federal district judge in the Southern District of California. During the 2016 campaign, Trump had accused Curiel, who was born in the US, of having an ""inherent conflict of interest"" in a lawsuit against Trump University lawsuit because of his Mexican heritage. ""I know what I heard when a federal judge was called 'very biased and unfair' because he is 'of Mexican heritage,'"" Reeves said, quoting again from Trump. ""When that judge's ethnicity was said to prevent his issuing 'fair rulings.' When that judge was called a 'hater' simply because he is Latino."" ""I heard the words of James Eastland, a race-baiting politician, empowered by the falsehood of white supremacy, questioning the judicial temperament of a man solely because of the color of his skin. I heard those words, and I did not know if it was 1967 or 2017,"" Reeves said. Reeves shared that he has been sent ""countless letters of hatred"" containing insults, profanity and threats aimed to ""bully and scare judges who look like me from the judiciary."" The judge also castigated Trump's administration for its lack of racial and gender diversity in its judicial nominations. ""There is no excuse for this exclusion of minority experiences from our courts,"" said Reeves, who became Mississippi's second black federal judge in its history. Reeves added that ""courts can and should be criticized"" because ""judges get it wrong -- all the time. That includes me."" ""But the slander and falsehoods thrown at courts today are not those of a critic seeking to improve the judiciary's search for truth. They are words of an attacker, seeking to distort and twist that search toward falsehood."""
Jamie Dimon: Banking sector pays employees better than others - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Anneken Tappe, CNN Business",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/investing/minimum-wage-discussion-jpmorgan-earnings/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Minimum wage is haunting JPMorgan.
On Friday's earnings call with the press, CEO Jamie Dimon no doubt intended to boast about the bank's better-than-expected performance in the first quarter of the year. But he couldn't avoid the minimum wage subject. Reporters questioned whether JPMorgan ( JPM ) intended to meet Bank of America's ( BAC ) recent pledge to up minimum wage to $20 an hour by 2021. Dimon said raising wages was ""not an arms race."" ""We take very good care of our entry-level employees,"" he said, noting the bank paid $35,000 to $37,000 for starting salaries plus benefits. ""When you look at wages, you better look at other people. The banking sector is pretty good,"" Dimon said. He questioned whether media companies like CNBC or the New York Times paid employees right out of high school this well. Read More During a House Financial Committee hearing on Wednesday, major US bank CEOs, including Dimon, were repeatedly pressed on pay, particularly in relation to their multi-million-dollar compensation packages. Rep. Katie Porter claimed during the hearing that a single parent in a starting job at JPMorgan couldn't make ends meet. JPMorgan pays entry level employees between $15 and $18 per hour, depending on their location, with salaries in major cities being higher. ""We believe we pay fairly and competitively,"" added Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's chief financial officer. Earlier this week, Amazon's ( AMZN ) Jeff Bezos challenged his peers in the retail world to up their minimum pay . Could Dimon be succeeded by a woman? Besides minimum wage, Dimon was also pressed on whether he could be succeeded by a woman — Lake, for example. During Wednesday's House hearing , the seven Caucasian male CEOs were asked by show of hands whether they thought a woman or person of color would succeed them. Dimon kept his hand down. ""We don't comment on succession,"" he said on Friday's call, also pointing out that it is of course JPMorgan's board that appoints a CEO, not the departing executive, and that the timeline mattered as well.

"The homeless man whose story raised $400,000 was sentenced for taking part in the hoax - CNN",us.cnn.com,Janet DiGiacomo and Madison Park,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/gofundme-homeless-scam-sentencing/index.html,"(CNN) A homeless Philadelphia man who was found guilty of helping to scam GoFundMe donors out of nearly $400,000 was sentenced for conspiracy to commit theft by deception in New Jersey on Friday.
Johnny Bobbitt Jr. was sentenced to a five-year special probation period for participating in what turned out to be a viral hoax. He pleaded guilty to the charge in March. According to the story that was presented in 2017, New Jersey resident Kate McClure ran out of gas and was stranded on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. A homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas. McClure and her boyfriend, Mark D'Amico, posted about the ""good deed"" on social media, including a picture of her with Bobbitt on a highway ramp. They also started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the homeless man, saying they wanted to pay it forward to the good Samaritan and get him off the streets. Kate McClure, left, Mark D'Amico, center, and Johnny Bobbitt Jr. Read More Their story made national headlines that brought attention to their crowd-funding, which raised nearly $400,000. ""In reality, McClure never ran out of gas and Bobbitt never spent his last $20 for her,"" according to a US Attorney's Office press release. ""D'Amico and McClure allegedly conspired to create the false story to obtain money from donors."" The couple transferred the funds to their bank account and bought a BMW, expensive handbags and went on trips, including to casinos in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Nevada, according to court documents. McClure did transfer $25,000 from her bank account to Bobbitt's in December 2017, federal prosecutors said. He received a total of $75,000 in the campaign, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina. Both McClure and Bobbitt also pleaded guilty to federal charges in early March. How a GoFundMe scam started with $20 and a good story -- but slowly unraveled McClure, 28, could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She will be sentenced on June 19. Bobbitt, 36, could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He will be sentenced on the federal charge at a later date. The probationary terms for Friday's sentencing in Burlington County require him to enter the state Superior Court drug court program, in which he'll be expected to get a job and adhere to a structured regimen of treatment and recovery services. Any infractions could bring him a five-year prison sentence, according to Burlington County Prosecutor spokesman Joel Bewley. CNN reached out to Bobbitt's attorney for comment, but has not heard back. Feel-good story falls apart The story began to fall apart after Bobbitt sued McClure and D'Amico, accusing them of withholding the money raised on his behalf. That lawsuit invited a search warrant, a deposition and an investigation into their campaign, which uncovered the alleged conspiracy. GoFundMe has since made refunds to thousands of people who donated, thinking they were giving to Bobbitt. In November, prosecutors alleged that it was a scam perpetrated by all three individuals. Mark D'Amico, McClure's then-boyfriend, is not facing federal charges. But McClure and D'Amico are facing local charges of second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception. McClure is set to be in court in Burlington County on Monday April 15. ""The paying-it-forward story that drove this fundraiser might seem too good to be true,"" Coffina said then. ""Unfortunately, it was. The entire campaign was predicated on a lie."""
Pentagon transgender policy goes into effect - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/transgender-troop-ban-starts/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Pentagon's controversial policy banning transgender recruits from joining the military went into effect on Friday.
The Pentagon says the new policy does not affect transgender troops currently serving in the armed forces, a contention that's strongly denied by advocates, who point to the potential for discrimination and harassment. The ban blocks individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition known as gender dysphoria from joining. Transgender individuals can serve, but only if they meet the standards of the sex they were assigned at birth. The Pentagon says the policy doesn't block transgender individuals from service, but advocates say it is designed to operate as a comprehensive ban on their presence. Current military leaders have testified to Congress that transgender troops have not affected cohesion, while retired military leaders have decried the policy as misguided and damaging. 'Bigoted' Read More ""It's a bigoted policy. It has not one shred of evidence behind it,"" Ray Mabus, a former secretary of the Navy, told CNN. ""In fact, all the evidence goes the other way. It goes against the basic American notion that it should be about what you can do and not who you are. ... To do this to patriots who are willing to serve -- not only willing, but eager to serve, who have raised their hands and said send me -- weakens our democracy and seriously weakens our military."" Anthony Kurta, a Pentagon official acting for the deputy under secretary of personnel and readiness, told reporters Friday that ""the department will continue to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, and every service member is able to express their gender identity. DOD will take no action solely based on gender identity."" The policy, signaled when President Donald Trump tweeted a call for a blanket ban in 2017, still faces lower court challenges, but the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 January order that it could go forward. The justices took no stand on the legality of the ban. Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, a think thank that researches gender and the military, said that ""the policy stigmatizes all trans people. ... The way the policy will play out on the ground -- this will be a green light to commanders who are transphobic,"" putting the estimated 14,700 trans members of the military at a disadvantage and forcing many to stay in the closet. Public opposes the policy Most Americans oppose the policy, according to a Quinnipiac University poll . That poll found 70% believe transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military. The only listed group that disagreed were Republicans, with 50% saying they shouldn't be allowed and 40% in favor. Most transgender persons are now disqualified from military service, except: • Service members who have been stable for three years in their biological sex prior to joining the military -- meaning 36 months after surgery and after ending hormone treatments. • Service members diagnosed with ""gender dysphoria"" after joining the military can stay in the military if they don't require a change of gender and remain deployable. Gender dysphoria involves a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies, according to the American Psychiatric Association. • Service members who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria before the effective date of the policy can still serve and receive medical treatment. • Transgender persons without a gender dysphoria diagnosis or history can serve in their birth sex. Case by case The Defense Department can issue waivers on a case-by-case basis. Kurda said Friday that the policy originated in 2017 when ""service leadership"" approached then-Defense Secretary James Mattis and ""expressed some readiness reservations."" Over a series of hearings by the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, now a Democratic presidential candidate, asked the chiefs of staff of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force about the issue of transgender troops. All four said they saw no negative effects from transgender personnel serving. ""I have received precisely zero reports of issues of cohesion, discipline, morale and all those sorts of things,"" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at one of the hearings. Mabus said the case being made against transgender troops has been recycled several times through history. History repeats itself ""The same arguments are used every time we expand who can serve,"" he said. ""It affects unit cohesion, it is too costly, it is too disruptive. That was the argument used against integrating the armed forces in the 1940s. Those same arguments were used against recruiting large numbers of women in the '80s. The same arguments were used during the repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' "" -- the policy on gay service members -- ""and on the opening of all ground combat positions to women."" ""And every single time those reasons have been bogus,"" Mabus said. ""Every time. Just like they're bogus today."" The House of Representatives passed a resolution last month expressing opposition to the Trump administration's ban. The resolution ""strongly opposes President Trump's discriminatory ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces,"" and ""rejects the flawed scientific and medical claims upon which it is based."" The vote was 238-185, and five Republicans voted with Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Trump administration's ban ""an act of cruelty"" in a speech on the House floor and said that ""the men and women who step forward to serve in the US military are patriots, all of them."" ""The House will continue to fight this discriminatory action, which has no place in our country,"" the California Democrat said. ""We will never allow hate and prejudice to dictate our national security."""
Trump told CBP head he'd pardon him if he were sent to jail for violating immigration law - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jake Tapper,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/trump-cbp-commissioner-pardon/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan he would grant McAleenan a pardon if he were sent to jail for having border agents block asylum seekers from entering the US in defiance of US law, senior administration officials tell CNN.
Trump reportedly made the comment during a visit to the border at Calexico, California, a week ago. It was not clear if the comment was a joke. Two officials briefed on the exchange say the President told McAleenan, since named the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that he ""would pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying US entry to migrants,"" as one of the officials paraphrased. The White House referred CNN to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman told CNN, ""At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal. Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law."" Trump denied reports he offered pardons in a tweet late Friday night. Read More Trump confirms he's looking at releasing detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities The exchange came amid threats by the President to close the border in response to a steep uptick of migrants at the border. In March, there were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry on the southern border, up from 37,390 last March, according to CBP . During his visit to Calexico last Friday, Trump said on camera: ""We're full, our system's full, our country's full -- can't come in! Our country is full, what can you do? We can't handle any more, our country is full. Can't come in, I'm sorry. It's very simple."" Behind the scenes, two sources told CNN, the President told border agents to not let migrants in. Tell them we don't have the capacity, he said. If judges give you trouble, say, ""Sorry, judge, I can't do it. We don't have the room."" RELATED: Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants After the President left the room, agents sought further advice from their leaders, who told them they were not giving them that direction and if they did what the President said they would take on personal liability. You have to follow the law, they were told. Trump has grown frustrated by the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border, placing blame on Democrats and the nation's immigration laws. On Friday, the President said he's considering releasing immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities in part to retaliate against Democrats, undercutting earlier denials from his own administration officials. ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy -- so this should make them very happy!"" Yet the White House received legal guidance months ago that such a policy would run afoul of the law, open the administration to lawsuits, and ultimately undermine the President's desire to deport undocumented immigrants. WH told by lawyers in February that proposal to drop migrants in sanctuary cities had legal issues In February, according to documents obtained by CNN, the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, John Mitnick, told the White House in writing that such a move could only be done if there was a ""strong, mission-related rationale"" pertaining to the responsibilities of the department."

Rwanda genocide survivor: 'not every hutu wanted us dead',us.cnn.com,"Jessie Gretener, CNN",04-12-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/world/rwanda-denise-uwimana-amanpour/index.html,"London (CNN) Nine-months pregnant and hiding under a bed, soaked in blood from her murdered relatives, Denise Uwimana's waters broke. She had no safe place to give birth. Her eldest son whispered, ""Mama, is this the end of the world?""
While a quarter of a century has passed since the Rwanda genocide, it feels like yesterday for survivors. ""I breathed in the blood,"" Uwimana told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview airing Friday. It was April 16th, 1994. Ten days earlier, President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down, ending the cease-fire in Rwanda's civil war and igniting 100 days of slaughter. Hutu extremists targeted the minority ethnic Tutsis and other moderate Hutus, murdering between 800,000 and a million people, with clubs, machetes, and their bare hands. Neighbors turned on neighbors. Husbands turned on wives. Churches became abattoirs and schools became graveyards. Not even the young were spared. Read More 'Angels sent from God' ""Not every Hutu wanted us dead"" Uwimana wrote in her memoir 'From Red Earth,', ""I knew my children and I would have been dead many times over, had it not been for my few Hutu friends watching over us."" Uwimana says she gave birth under the protection of a Hutu neighbor. Cutting the umbilical cord with a dirty knife, her Hutu friend pleaded with the Hutu mayor to let them take Uwimana and her children to the village's health clinic. The clinic became a refuge for Tutsis, with Hutu friends bringing them food, warning of danger, and taking Uwimana's baby to get vaccinated. ""I had unexpected support from Hutus,"" she told Amanpour. ""Some of my neighbors whom I did not expect that they [would be] the ones to support me."" ""They were like angels sent from God."" 'I don't know where they put him' Uwimana's newborn son -- now celebrating his 25th birthday - never met his father, Charles, who was not with the family during the time of the attack. ""I know he was killed by the Hutu militias, but I don't know where they put him."" ""This is still a trauma for us."" Asked if she ever expected to be widowed at 29 years old, Uwimana replied, ""never."" ""I was dreaming of many good things with my husband. So suddenly, all were cut."" The last time she saw her husband was on April 5th, 1994. ""He just embraced me, he told me I love you, and he went."" 'I told God: You disappoint me' On Uwimana's mother's side, most of her relatives were killed in their place of worship. A number of churches became scenes of mass killings during the genocide, set alight with hundreds locked inside. Over 90% of Rwanda is Christian, the majority Catholic. Hundreds of hundreds of priests and nuns were killed in the genocide. But others were active participants. In 2017, Pope Francis apologized for the ""sins and failings of the church and its members"" during the genocide. Several priests and nuns have been charged for their actions during the genocide. Uwimana, a Protestant, described her struggle with faith as a deep trauma. ""I could not believe that people who believed [in] God, who were called Christians, were involved, directly or indirectly,"" Uwimana said. ""I told God ""You disappointed me."" 'Rwanda is a family again' Yet it was her faith that forged her journey of forgiveness. Uwimana found strength in a bible: a need to end the hate to find peace. ""[I had to] give chance [to] these Hutu people who killed, so that they recognize that they have done bad."" Since the genocide, Uwimana has dedicated herself to protesting any implication that any person or group is less human than another. She founded Iriba Shalom International, a non-profit helping genocide survivors find forgiveness and reconciliation. On Sunday, at a memorial marking the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide, President Paul Kagame reflected on such reconciliation ""in 1994, there was no hope, only darkness, Today, light radiates from this place... Rwanda became a family once again."""
Why did Ecuador give up Assange after seven years? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/uk/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-eviction-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) Hours after Julian Assange was ousted from his diplomatic refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, the country released a laundry list of alleged transgressions which brought the WikiLeaks founder's seven-year residency to an end.
Foreign Minister José Valencia and Interior Minister María Paula Romo accused Assange of riding scooters around the cramped embassy hallways, insulting staff and smearing feces on the walls. But while Ecuador had undoubtedly tired of its London house guest, the motivations for stripping Assange of his asylum and allowing in officers of the Metropolitan Police are likely to have been more complex. Julian Assange: Bond villain or cyber-messiah? It's complicated WikiLeaks had already been needling the Ecuadorian authorities in other ways. For months, Assange had been pursuing a legal action against the Ecuadorian government, accusing it of violating his rights by introducing strict new house rules for living at the embassy. An Ecuadorian judge rejected the assertions last October. Quito was also irritated by Assange's support for the Catalonian independence movement: Its Foreign Ministry told Assange to refrain from making statements that could impair Ecuador's relations with other countries, including Spain. Read More More recently, WikiLeaks got personal. On March 25, WikiLeaks posted a tweet bringing attention to a corruption probe that Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno is facing. It linked to an anonymously registered website hosting a vast trove of leaked emails, text messages and other documents pertaining to Moreno's private life. British MPs urge government to extradite Julian Assange to Sweden The Ecuadorian government blamed WikiLeaks for the leaked documents, dubbed the INA Papers, an allegation that WikiLeaks denies. For WikiLeaks and its supporters, the Ecuadorian government tried to use the INA Papers leak as yet another pretext to terminate Assange's asylum. Moreno has denied any wrongdoing. The attorney general's office has launched an investigation into the allegations. WikiLeaks denied any involvement in the release of the INA Papers, but that hasn't stopped Moreno from pointing the finger at Assange and WikiLeaks. Assange does not have the right to ""hack accounts or personal phones,"" Moreno told the Ecuadorian Radio Broadcasters' Association last Tuesday Over the weekend, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Relations ramped up the rhetoric against Assange when it put out a fiery statement rejecting ""the fake news that has circulated in the last few days on social media, many of them spread by an organization linked to Mr. Julian Assange."" Relations between Assange and Ecuador deteriorated further on Wednesday when WikiLeaks called a press conference and claimed the group had discovered a spying operation against Assange from within the embassy. Speaking to reporters in London, Kristinn Hrafnsson, the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said Ecuador had made surreptitious video and audio recordings of Assange and his interactions at the embassy, including a medical examination and meetings with legal representatives.

(CNN) Once upon a time the ethical debates around journalism were comparatively simple -- beginning with the most basic question of all: Who is a journalist?
But here in 2019, nothing about Julian Assange is simple. Looking like a befuddled Old Testament prophet, the WikiLeaks founder was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London on Thursday to a new form of captivity -- and to challenge journalists around the world as to whether he is a hero deserving their support, or a villain for whom few would weep tears if he spent the rest of his life in a jail cell. Why the polarized differences? Assange's story is an extraordinary one.

Who is Julian Assange? 01:39 So is Assange really a journalist? The answer in 2019 is a complicated one. New technologies allow millions of people to commit individual acts of journalism. That may not make them ""journalists"" in a conventional sense, but it does raise the question of whether these journalistic acts deserve the same sort of protection as those carried out by people who have had more traditional careers in journalism. To my mind, Assange is partly a journalist. Part of what he does has involved the selection, editing, verifying and contextualizing of news material -- just as any journalist would do. But Assange is also a publisher, a political activist, a hacker, an information anarchist, a player. Yes, he believes -- sometimes -- in editing. But he also believes in dumping vast oceans of documents, unedited and unredacted, careless to the consequences. One is journalism, the other isn't. Things become still more complicated if -- and it's a big ""if"" because we don't know the whole truth -- Assange subsequently allowed himself to become the conduit for material stolen by one foreign power to destabilize another: The release of thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and published at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign. It prompted the man who would become President of the United States to declare: ""I love WikiLeaks!"" JUST WATCHED 'I know nothing about WikiLeaks,' claims Donald Trump Replay More Videos ...

'I know nothing about WikiLeaks,' claims Donald Trump 04:18 On the basis of the US extradition request to the British government, the charges against Assange are currently rather thin. He is accused of pushing his source, Chelsea Manning, to come up with still more documents around 2010. Well, many journalists might put their hands up and say they've done the same. Next he's accused of trying to help Manning conceal her identity on various official computer systems as she roamed around for more documents to download and leak. Is this a sinister sign of Assange trying to hack secret systems (though the indictment doesn't use the word ""hack"")? Or is it what any decent journalist would do: Try to protect their sources from detection? We won't know the answers to these questions until the case comes to court in the US -- a process that could well take months, if not years. The US authorities could come up with more ammunition as the case proceeds. But -- on the basis of what we know so far -- it is not clear that Assange is being accused of behaving in ways that respected Pulitzer Prize winning journalists would disavow. His case is not a simple one. But disliking Assange shouldn't be the same as disowning him."
Hastings to depart Facebook's board as competition with Netflix heats up,us.cnn.com,Sara Ashley O'Brien,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/tech/facebook-board-shakeup/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Facebook is shaking up its board.
On Friday, the company announced that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings will not be up for reelection for his role as a director on Facebook's board. The move comes as Facebook is investing more in original video content, potentially competing directly with Netflix. Hastings has served on the board since 2011. Facebook is reportedly spending around $1 billion on original programming and content deals for Facebook Watch, the video platform it launched in August 2018. Its original video content ranges from Jada Pinkett Smith's popular talk show ""Red Table Talk"" to the drama series ""Sorry For Your Loss"" starring Elizabeth Olsen. In February, the social media giant announced several new shows, including a reimagined version of reality show ""The Real World,"" in partnership with MTV. It also hosts YouTube-like shows from content creators. At $6.99 a month, Disney+ will start a streaming price war At a time when the company is grappling with the spread of controversial content on its core Facebook platform, including election misinformation, anti-vaccination content, and hate speech, its content creation efforts appear to be something of a bright spot. It announced in December that 400 million viewers watch at least one video on Facebook's Watch platform every month. Read More Hastings was one part of broader changes to the company's board. Facebook said that Erskine Bowles, who has been on the board since 2011, would not be up for reelection. Facebook has also nominated Peggy Alford, an executive at PayPal, to join. Alford would be the first African American woman on the board, and the second African American overall. Former American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault joined last year amid pressure from activists to add black representation to the all-white board. PayPal executive Peggy Alford has been nominated to join Facebook's board. Alford previously worked at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropic organization owned by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, before rejoining PayPal in March 2019. She previously worked at PayPal in various senior roles from 2011 to 2017. ""What excites me about the opportunity to join Facebook's board is the company's drive and desire to face hard issues head-on while continuing to improve on the amazing connection experiences they have built over the years,"" Alford said in a statement. Alford's nomination will be voted on at the company's upcoming annual stockholder meeting on May 30."
"Why Tesla's $35,000 Model 3 remains an endangered species",us.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/tech/tesla-model-3/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The cheapest version of the Model 3 has become part marketing ploy, part afterthought for Tesla.
Tesla wants to fulfill CEO Elon Musk's long-running promise of a $35,000 car, which he first promised in 2013. It will deliver the first $35,000 version of its Model 3 this weekend. But Tesla doesn't intend to sell many of that version. Six times as many buyers are willing to upgrade their Model 3s than buy the base version, Tesla says. If customers pay $4,500 more than the lowest sticker price, they'll get autopilot features, a slightly longer range on a single charge, as well as some creature comforts, like seat warmers. Tesla announced Thursday that it would no longer sell the $35,000 version online. Every other Tesla can be purchased that way. Customers who want a Tesla at rock bottom price will have to order it by phone or go into a service center or one of its shrinking number of stores. That means many Tesla customers may not even be aware that a $35,000 version is available. Read More ""They're still offering it for the PR value of saying they have a $35,000 car,"" said Kelsey Mays, senior consumer affairs editor of Cars.com. ""It is a little bait and switch, but it's certainly not unprecedented for an automaker to do that."" A $35,000 Tesla has become the latest of Musk's grand promises that the company has struggled to meet. When Musk announced in February that Tesla would finally start making a $35,000 version of the Model 3, he also warned that the company would probably lose money in the first quarter (Tesla will report results on April 24). It demonstrates the difficulty of making money while selling cutting-edge cars at mass-market prices. ""I would guess that Elon Musk saw a point in time years ago where he could sell a $35,000 car and make money on it,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Cox Automotive. ""So he committed to that number. Now they can technically say they have done it. But they realize it's not a good business model. They're probably losing money on each $35,000 car."" Tesla has not commented on the profitability of its different models, But it will make more money on what it calls the Standard Plus, which will start at $39,500. That's because the $35,000 Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are essentially the same car. Tesla downgrades the abilities of the Model 3 Standard version, limiting the miles it can travel on a single charge, blocking some autopilot features and preventing drivers from turning on the seat warmers. ""Making different versions of the same car costs money because it slows down production,"" said Brauer. ""So they've crunched the numbers and decided it's better to make the same car for both the $35,000 version and the $39,500 version."" Tesla and GM electric car sales could get a big boost if this bill passes The more expensive version is still a mass market car. The average transaction price of a new car purchase in the United States is just less than $36,000 according to Kelley Blue Book. ""You can buy a Ford F-150 or a Honda Pilot for far more than $40,000, and they're not luxury models,"" said Brauer. The fact that Tesla is essentially selling the Model 3 with a $39,500 starting price, by making it more difficult to buy one at the long-promised $35,000 price, probably won't hurt the company in the eyes of its customers. ""Tesla shoppers are not bargain hunters. They're early adopters of technology. And they're buying a brand with a premium reputation,"" said Mays."
GM to reveal a radically new Corvette,us.cnn.com,Peter Valdes-Dapena,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/success/gm-midengined-corvette/index.html,"Get ready for an all-new Chevrolet Corvette. On July 18, General Motors will reveal the latest version of ""America's sports car.""
It's big news anytime a new Corvette is unveiled, but this one will represent, arguably, the biggest change for the Corvette since the model was first introduced in 1953. The Corvette has changed a lot over the past 66 years, but it has always remained a front-engined, rear-wheel-drive sports car. The new 2020 Corvette will have its engine behind the seats. It's a design idea that was pioneered in the Lamborghini Miura in 1966, and has since become the standard for extreme high-performance sports car. The Corvette's chief engineer Tadge Juechter and General Motors CEO Mary Barra drive in a camouflaged next-generation Corvette near Times Square. Putting the engine behind the driver and passenger -- called a rear mid-engined layout -- places the heaviest single part of the car as close as possible to the vehicle's absolute center. This way, the car is balanced in its handling, being neither especially heavy at the front or at the back. Having the engine more toward the rear also helps during hard acceleration since there is more weight to hold down the rear wheels that power the car. The Corvette has long been a legitimate performance competitor, especially considering its relatively low price. While it's far from cheap -- the entry level Corvette starts at almost $60,000 -- its performance rivals that of cars costing six figures. But there is a limit to the capabilities of any car with a front-engined design and, evidently, GM engineers decided that it was finally time to make that change. Read More ""There's more potential in the mid-engined platform in terms of performance applications than there is in a front-engined car, that's for sure,"" said Travis Okulski, editor-in-chief of Road & Track magazine. It's not the first time GM ( GM ) has considered it. The company even built mid-engined research cars called CERV I and CERV II (Chevrolet Engineering Research Vehicle) in the 1960s and the CERV III in 1990. GM unveils 700-horsepower electric Camaro and, maybe, a way to build your own The new mid-engined Corvette has been the subject of much speculation in the automotive press. GM finally confirmed it would be unveiled this summer, releasing photos of the car covered in black and white camouflage driving toward New York's Times Square. The new car has the potential to further burnish GM's image as an engineering powerhouse, which has long been the role of the Corvette. It's a ""halo car"" that brings people into Chevrolet showrooms even if they ultimately end up buying something else, said Okulski, and this version should generate even more interest. ""It also gives Chevrolet something that can play on the big stage with the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, everybody,"" he said."
This company uses AI to flag racist and sexist comments from potential hires,us.cnn.com,Kathryn Vasel,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/success/fama-prescreen-employment/index.html,"(CNN) Hiring the wrong person can be costly.
Interviews are often the only way employers have to get to know a candidate personally before they offer them a job. While background and reference checks are standard for most new hires, they don't always catch behaviors that can clash with a company's culture and values and create a toxic work environment. California-based Fama Technologies is offering another layer of screening to help identify risky applicants before they get hired. It uses artificial intelligence to analyze a person's public digital footprint to find problematic behaviors like sexual harassment, bigotry and bullying. ""If you make a hire and it turns out they were posting, sexist, racist and other lunacy online...that is not only a liability for an employer, it also calls into question your ability of making a hiring decision,"" said Alex Granovsky, an employment lawyer in New York City. More from Success What happened when these women found out what male colleagues made
Handling a crisis is always hard. Here's how companies can do better
Are you ever too old to start investing?
Fama, which was launched in 2015, creates risk profiles for job applicants or even current employees by scouring publicly-available content online, including social media, message boards, blogs, news articles and comment sections that can be tied to a current or prospective employee. Read More ""We do not score, there's no thumbs up or down,"" said Fama CEO Ben Mones. ""We aren't saying anything about the person ... We can say this piece of text is an example of bigotry."" About 12% to 15% of the time a report will affect an employment or a hiring decision, said Mones. Companies using Fama are legally obligated to share the report with job candidates and employees to contest or explain the results, according to Mones, who added the accuracy on reports is 99.98% as reported by candidates. Companies can select which behaviors to focus on for the screening, but sexism, bigotry and violence are the most frequently searched categories. But there are some categories of information that are off-limits. Toxic behavior drives down productivity and innovation. Other employees feel disconnected and can feel less focused and less motivated to come to work. The sphere of influence that a toxic employee has will adversely affect others.""
Ben Mones, CEO of Fama
Employees have protections when it comes to hiring discrimination. It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a job applicant based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability. Fama says it ensures companies never interact with these protected classes of information. ""Every person controls their own social media,"" said Granovsky. ""You choose what you put up there and there are consequence for making statements that offend others. It can result in not being hired, job loss, or even a punch in the face."" While most of the screens are for potential hires, Fama has recently seen a large increase in the number of companies running checks on current workers. ""It's about level setting. It's saying, maybe where you grew up or where you worked this stuff could be OK, but here at this company it is not,"" said Mones. The company has more than 120 clients and screens 20,000 people a month. In 2018, Fama screened more than 20 million pieces of public content online and found 14.2% of people had red flags for misogyny and sexism and 10.3% had indicators for bigotry, racism and hate speech. Almost 12% had red flags for violence, drugs and crime. How to know what it's really like to work at a company Mones said Fama works with companies in a variety of industries, including major brands in financial services, entertainment and media and professional sports. The software can also flag drug and alcohol use, but Mones says the majority of companies aren't looking at these subjects on social media as a factor of employability. So when it comes to that picture of you at that party that's posted on Facebook? ""Don't worry about having the Solo cup in your hand."" Mones came up with the idea for Fama after he brought on a new employee at a former company that harassed a fellow colleague after a few months on the job. After the incident, Mones realized that the hire had exhibited harassing behavior on social media. He said if he had seen it, he wouldn't have hired the person. ""Toxic behavior drives down productivity and innovation,"" said Mones. ""Other employees feel disconnected and can feel less focused and less motivated to come to work. The sphere of influence that a toxic employee has will adversely affect others."""

Walmart wants to build its advertising business,us.cnn.com,Nathaniel Meyersohn,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/business/walmart-advertising-amazon-google/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Walmart is serious about giving Amazon a run for its money online. It's so determined that the company bought a startup to help it compete in an unexpected business: online advertising.
The retailer on Thursday bought Polymorph Labs, a Silicon Valley startup that specializes in managing digital ads for brands. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Walmart said adding the startup's technology would enable current and potential advertisers to reach consumers more effectively. The acquisition positions Walmart to compete with Amazon ( AMZN ) , which became the country's third largest ad platform last year behind Google ( GOOG ) and Facebook ( FB ) . ""Our data has never been monetized, and we have a tiny ad business,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts last year. ""It could be bigger."" Walmart's strategy to solve the Amazon puzzle is working Walmart hopes its pitch to consumer brands will stick. It's playing up the fact that it has a huge network of physical stores that it can use to recruit brands. Walmart says it has a trove of shopper data because 90% of America shops at Walmart every year, and its website and stores attract nearly 160 million visitors a week. Read More ""We can help brands understand if someone saw their ad on Walmart's platform or across the [internet], and then purchased the product in-store or online,"" said Stefanie Jay, vice president and general manager for Walmart Media Group. Walmart's ""scale and data could give it a unique opportunity to expand"" its ad business, UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research report last month. Walmart wants to squeeze out more digital advertising dollars because its profit is under pressure. The company sold $184 billion worth of groceries in the United States last year, more than a third of its more than $500 billion in sales. But groceries carry razor-thin margins. Walmart has also sacrificed profit in recent years by investing billions of dollars to build out its digital operation, lower its prices and add online pickup to thousands of stores. Profit has fallen three years in a row. But Walmart believes that building new revenue streams, such as advertising, health care and financial services, can help offset its heavy spending and boost profit. ""Retailers will need to innovate and find new profit pools,"" Lasser said. ""Pivoting traditional retail business models won't be easy, but will be necessary over time."" The retailer faces challenges, however. Walmart chief financial officer Brent Biggs told analysts at a conference last month that Walmart needed to be careful to prevent its website from becoming ""cluttered"" with ads. Rival grocers and retailers that want to expand their digital ad businesses also pose an obstacle for Walmart. Last year, Kroger ( KR ) , Albertsons and Ahold Delhaize all made big pushes into advertising. Kroger, for example, believes it has an opportunity to sell brands ads on its store shelves, and it's tapping Microsoft ( MSFT ) to help. The two companies struck a partnership in January to pilot two stores in Ohio and Washington State. Instead of paper tags for prices and promotions on the two stores' shelves, they will be digital. That creates room for Kroger to sell advertising space to brands."
HBO is at a crossroads as its wildly popular 'Game of Thrones' ends,us.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/media/hbo-network-turmoil/index.html,"Los Angeles (CNN Business) When ""The Sopranos"" went black in 2007, there was speculation that HBO might never generate another hit of that magnitude. Four years later, ""Game of Thrones"" premiered, a drama that has matched and even surpassed the mob show in accolades, cultural buzz and audience, which is ending as new threats amass at the pay network's walls.
How fans are bracing for life after 'Game of Thrones' ""Thrones"" begins its six-episode final season on Sunday, in what should be a triumphant moment for HBO. Few series approach the estimated 30 million viewers that ""Thrones"" averaged last year from all sources, a feat made even more impressive given that subscription-based HBO is in far fewer homes than broadcast and basic cable shows. Yet while the show nears the finish line -- at least in this form -- the channel that airs it has reached a crossroads, and the end of a corporate era. HBO marks this latest milestone while undergoing a management overhaul, one that's unusual for a place characterized in part by its stability and institutional knowledge. New owner AT&T ( T ) has pressed for an evolution of the network's strategy, seeking to meet the challenge from the streaming barbarians at the gate. (AT&T also owns CNN's parent company WarnerMedia) HBO's longtime CEO Richard Plepler announced his resignation in February after 28 years with the company, and a number of other senior employees at the network -- which earned autonomy thanks to regular annual profits exceeding $1 billion ---- have followed suit by taking a buyout package, or are contemplating whether to do so. Read More Meanwhile, HBO is looking to reload its programming lineup with a barrage of new series and key returning ones, like ""Big Little Lies,"" hoping to piggyback on ""Game of Thrones'"" huge sendoff as a promotional springboard. Game of Thrones cast at season 3 red carpet premiere The TV world, however, has changed dramatically from ""The Sopranos'"" goodbye a dozen years ago. Netflix ( NFLX ) has become a major rival -- matching HBO's Emmy haul last year, and ending its streak as the most-nominated network. Other new rivals, including Amazon, Hulu and a coming challenge from Apple, have joined networks like Showtime, FX and AMC in aggressively courting the prestige marketplace. How 'Game of Thrones' conquered TV with drama and dragons Standing out from the crowd has thus become more difficult, making the enormous investment in a project like ""Thrones"" -- one of the most expensive ever produced for television -- more perilous if it doesn't deliver. On April 3, HBO hosted its last ""Game of Thrones"" premiere, the kind of lavish party for which the channel is known. A crowd filled Radio City Music Hall in New York, where HBO assembled dozens of actors who have appeared in the series, many of whose characters had met a violent end. At the screening D.B. Weiss, who with producing partner David Benioff brought author George R.R. Martin's creation to the screen, summed up the mood. He conspicuously thanked Plepler for having faith in the show, before talking about the ride that the cast and crew have enjoyed together. ""It's possible no one will have an experience like this again,"" he said. Bob Greenblatt The new team at HBO will be eager to prove that wrong, with AT&T having made the network a central pillar of its plans for a streaming service that is scheduled for launch later this year. Although the premiere marked a celebration, it took on a more somber and nostalgic tone. The question is whether that amounts to a temporary chill or augurs a long winter. Bob Greenblatt, the former entertainment chief at NBC and before that HBO rival Showtime, joined the company in March as chairman of entertainment and director to consumer, with oversight of HBO. As ""The Sopranos"" baton pass demonstrated, the TV business has a way of confounding expectations and predictions. If it's premature to state there won't be another premium series with ""Game of Thrones""-scale scale, it's fair to say there won't be a mob capable of making a legitimate claim as its heir."

Joaquin Phoenix plays Jesus in a new film. Here's the one thing he refused to do.,us.cnn.com,Daniel Burke,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/entertainment/joaquin-phoenix-jesus/index.html,"(CNN) When Joaquin Phoenix took on the role of Jesus in the new film ""Mary Magdalene,"" he did many of the expected things: Grew long hair, adopted an intense and otherworldly stare, even meditated on a mountaintop.
But there was one thing he would not do. Near the beginning of ""Mary Magdalene,"" which opened Friday in the United States, the script called for Jesus to heal a blind woman by rubbing mud in her eyes, an echo of John's Gospel . (It's a blind man in the Bible, a blind woman in the film.) ""I knew about that scene from the Bible, but I guess I had never really considered it,"" Phoenix told CNN in a recent interview. ""When I got there, I thought: I'm not going to rub dirt in her eyes. Who the f*!# would do that? It doesn't make any sense. That is a horrible introduction to seeing."" Read More The Bible doesn't fully explain why Jesus used mud or clay to heal the blind, though some experts say it was a common practice among first-century healers. In ""Mary Magdalene,"" Phoenix decided to go with his gut, licking a mudless thumb and gently rubbing the woman's eyes. ""It freed me up, in some ways, to discover what is truthful in the moment,"" he said. ""That moment is not so much about a real miracle. It's about someone who has been dismissed by society finally being seen, embraced and encouraged to join the broader community. To me, that is a miracle. There's something profoundly beautiful about that sentiment."" That humanistic message captures the essence of ""Mary Magdalene,"" a film that aims for historic fidelity in some respects, but whose emotional and intellectual currents are radically contemporary. Rooney Mara plays the film's title role as a spiritual seeker and kindred soul to Jesus. A spiritual but not religious film The filmmakers' aim was to ""rescue"" the title character, telling Jesus' story from a feminine (and feminist) point of view. Embodied by a lithe and luminous Rooney Mara, Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a spiritual seeker and kindred soul to Jesus. Their bond perplexes and irks the other apostles, particularly Peter, who seeks to marginalize Mary. In that and other respects, ""Mary Magdalene"" seems to draw inspiration from both the #MeToo movement and the ""Gospel of Mary,"" an apocryphal book discovered in 1896. Somewhat ironically, the film's US distribution was delayed for several years after the Weinstein Co. folded during the real life #MeToo scandal. The director, Garth Davis, who drew acclaim for his first feature film, ""Lion,"" said he felt ""disconnected"" from church while growing up in Australia. Like a growing number of Westerners, his spiritual life lay outside of organized religion, another theme prevalent in ""Mary Magdalene."" ""I didn't want to make a religious film,"" Davis told CNN in an interview. ""I wanted to make a spiritual film."" In one pivotal scene, Mary strongly suggests that the apostles have clouded Jesus' message with their own. The coming kingdom that Jesus preached is not something we can see with our eyes, she tells Peter. It is the contentment of a soul that has renounced resentment and anger, that grows with every act of love and care. ""It's not a place that you can get there and stay forever,"" Mara told CNN in an interview. ""It's a choice you have to make every day, every moment."" In the film, Peter tells Mary that she's wrong, accusing her of weakening their movement and Jesus himself. Nevertheless, she persists. ""I will not be silent,"" Mary says. ""I will be heard."" Chiwetel Ejiofor as the Apostle Peter and Mara as Mary Magdalene. Whether ""Mary Magdalene"" accurately portrays its title character is a question for scholars. But its presentation of a woman challenging the patriarchal structure of organized religion is firmly of this moment. Even before the #MeToo explosion, women in conservative Christian circles have been pushing back against strictures that have often sidelined and silenced them. For centuries, Mary Magdalene herself was buried beneath false conflations with other biblical characters and called a demon-possessed whore. Not until 1969 did the Catholic Church's cease to identify her with the ""sinful woman"" who anoints Jesus' feet in Scripture. The church later gave Mary Magdalene her due, calling her the Apostle of the Apostles because she was the first to witness the resurrected Jesus. Mara, who was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools, said she was initially reluctant to take the title role. ""I had all these preconceived ideas about Mary Magdalene and about religion in general, a lot of baggage that made me hesitate,"" Mara said. ""It wasn't until speaking to Garth and looking at the story as an adult, without that baggage from Catholic school, that I could strip it back and see it with fresh eyes."" Even in the modern age, the urge to sexualize Mary Magdalene apparently runs strong, with popular books and movies proposing that the bond between Jesus was more than spiritual. In ""Mary Magdalene,"" their kinship is deeply emotional but not sexual. Mary alone sees the toll that Jesus' life has taken on his mind and body. ""The heart of the relationship is an understanding that they both see themselves in each other,"" Mara said. ""Mary has felt out of place her entire life, and they really understand each other in a way no one else can. There is a deep love there."" What will Christians see in 'Mary Magdalene'? Films about Jesus and the early Christians often have to pass through a narrow gate. If they are too pious, they risk turning away secular viewers. If they take risks and go ""off-Scripture,"" they could alienate religious believers. That's true of ""Mary Magdalene"" as well, said Kutter Callaway, an assistant professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary, an evangelical school in California. ""Many conservatives will get angry immediately if they even pretend to have a piece of art that puts words directly in Jesus' mouth that are not from Scripture."" Nonetheless, Callaway, who has seen the film, said it ""feminizes"" Jesus in a ""good way."" By de-centering the Jesus story and focusing on women, the film shows just how radical it was for a woman such as Mary Magdalene to give up her home and family to follow Jesus. ""It forces the viewer to be driven and oriented by gritty, on-the-ground female concerns,"" Callaway said. ""There's a pervasive threat of violence that even now is always in play. It's a very different message from most films about Jesus, but it is also really important for today, when we are having conversations in the religious community and more broadly about how women are treated."" In one terrifying scene, Mary's family performs an exorcism on her, thinking that her extraordinary behavior is the result of demonic possession. But already some conservative Christians have criticized ""Mary Magdalene,"" calling its message ""heresy"" and saying that it cannot be accurate since it relies on texts that are not in the Bible. Phoenix's portrayal of Jesus, too, is far from the ""shiny, happy, super-powered"" Christ of many Jesus films, Callaway said. ""Mary Magdalene"" captures Jesus in his later years, when he is wearied by his past and worried about his future. As portrayed by Phoenix, he is often disheveled and remote, more the prophetic Man of Sorrows than the exalted King of Kings. His slow burn in the temple as he watches the money lenders sell animal sacrifices, a prefiguring of his own sacrificial crucifixion, captures the film's ambivalence about Jesus' mission. ""Mary Magdalene"" captures Jesus in his later years, with Phoenix often disheveled and remote. Phoenix said he sought to portray the humanity of Jesus while recognizing his divinity as well. ""What the film is saying is that all of us contain both of those things simultaneously. That's my personal belief."" How does an actor convey that belief on screen? ""The key for me was not to apply any rules to the character,"" he told CNN. ""There are times when he is filled with rage and times when he is at peace. He is very much a human being. The one thing we keyed in on was that everything he felt, he felt strongly. I don't know if it was a sixth sense or something else, but he made an effort to listen to others and be deeply empathetic."" After he arrived on set in southern Italy, Phoenix said, his mind was swimming in research and thoughts about Jesus. He decided to go up to the mountains, alone. What did he do up there? ""A bunch of stupid sh** that I'm not going to tell you,"" the actor said with a laugh. ""It was a meditative moment where there is nothing to do and you just stop. Your mind stops. And that is the key."""
Ariana Grande shares brain scan and opens up about PTSD Ariana Grande shares brain scan and opens up about PTSD,us.cnn.com,"Gabrielle Sorto, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/entertainment/ariana-grande-ptsd-brain-scan-instagram-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Ariana Grande took to Instagram to share photos of her brain scan that she says shows post-traumatic stress disorder.
""Hilarious and terrifying,"" she captioned the photo, adding that it is ""not a joke."" Ariana Grande shares her brain scan on Instagram. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that can develop in some people after witnessing or being involved in traumatic events. Charles B. Nemeroff, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry at The University of Texas at Austin said several studies have shown changes in the brains of patients with PTSD. ""There is no doubt that PTSD changes the way the brain responds to trauma-related and other emotional stimuli, however there are not brain imaging tests that are diagnostic of PTSD."" he told CNN. This isn't the first time the singer has been open about her struggles since the suicide bombing that killed 22 people at her concert in Manchester, United Kingdom, in May 2017. Read More Grande said she didn't think she'd ever know how to talk about the attack ""and not cry"" in a July 2018 interview with British Vogue . ""I know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it as well,"" Grande said of suffering the symptoms of PTSD. ""I feel like I shouldn't even be talking about my own experience -- like I shouldn't even say anything."" Grande's supporters have expressed concern for the 25-year-old on social media. Many are urging her to take time away from the spotlight to heal. ""I just hope she doesn't overwork herself and drain herself anymore mentally/physically,"" one person wrote on Twitter. It's not shocking that ariana puts up a strong font up to a crowd when she's still struggling and suffering from trauma and ptsd from manchester and other situations she was sadly involved in.

Amber Heard details why she called Johnny Depp 'the Monster' in court filing,us.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/entertainment/amber-heard-johnny-depp-abuse/index.html,"(CNN) Amber Heard has outlined the abuse she says she experienced by her former husband, Johnny Depp, as she fights a $50 million defamation suit he has filed against her.
In an affidavit obtained by CNN and included in Heard's motion to have the case against her dismissed, the actress alleges that a year into their relationship, she began to witness the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star abusing drugs and alcohol. ""Whenever he was using I worried for both of us,"" Heard stated in the filing. ""He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, 'the Monster.'"" The court documents detail multiple instances of alleged abuse in which Heard claims that Depp hit her, threw bottles, yelled at her, shoved Heard, pulled out chunks of her hair and at one point strangled her. ""I remember being afraid that Johnny might not know when to stop, and that he might kill me,"" Heard said in the filing. Read More In response to the allegations, Depp's attorney, Adam Waldman, told CNN, ""A hoax confronted with the reality of evidence requires new lies to sustain itself."" ""Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard. Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse,"" Heard's attorney, Eric George, said in a statement to CNN. ""It is regrettable that it will take a judge to finally end the persistent harassment of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp, but Ms. Heard will take whatever action is necessary to vindicate the truth."" Depp's suit, which was filed last month in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, was sparked by an op-ed Heard wrote for the Washington Post in December. The actress wrote of the ""wrath"" she says she faced after becoming a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"" two years prior, seemingly in reference to when her abuse allegations against Depp first became public, but she did not name Depp as her alleged abuser in the op-ed. Depp's suit charges that while the actor is not named, ""the op-ed plainly was about (and other media consistently characterized it as being about) Ms. Heard's purported victimization after she publicly accused her former husband, Johnny Depp (""Mr. Depp), of domestic abuse in 2016, when she appeared in court with an apparently battered face and obtained a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp on May 27, 2016."" Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship timeline That occurred two days after Heard filed for divorce in 2016. The couple, who met on the set of ""The Rum Diary"" in 2009, married in 2015 and went on to be embroiled in a contentious split for months, with charges of bad behavior levied by both sides. Depp denied the accusations at the time, and through his representatives, claimed Heard made up the abuse. The estranged couple settled their divorce months later, released a statement saying they ""have agreed to resolve their divorce proceeding privately."" ""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,"" the statement read. Heard also withdrew her petition to extend a restraining order against Depp. Depp's suit charged that Heard's allegations led to financial losses for him, including being dropped from future ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films after leading the franchise for 15 years. Heard alleges in her filing that she also lost work, including a part in a movie and a campaign with a ""global fashion brand."""
Waka Flocka Flame was inside an Atlanta recording studio during a shooting,us.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/entertainment/waka-flocka-flame-shooting-atlanta/index.html,"(CNN) Waka Flocka Flame was at an Atlanta recording studio where three men open fire, injuring at least one person, police said.
