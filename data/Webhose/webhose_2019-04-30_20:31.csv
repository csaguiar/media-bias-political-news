Family First mind altering cannabis poll,yournz.org,Pete George,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://yournz.org/2019/04/28/family-first-mind-altering-cannabis-poll/," Family First mind altering cannabis poll
It’s easy to see what Family First were on when they commissioned a cannabis poll with Curia Market Research – publishing their results on a website called saynopetodope.org.nz/poll confirms a distinct bias.
Curia is a reputable polling company, but they do what clients want, and Family First got what they wanted. To get a different result to past polls showing clear majorities support cannabis law reform of some sort required some leading poll questions and misleading reporting to the poll.
Family First: New poll suggests only 18% of Kiwis support recreational cannabis legalisation
A new poll commissioned by conservative Christian lobbyist group Family First has found that less than 20% of New Zealanders support legalisation of recreational marijuana, but there is strong support for its medicinal use.
The independent poll, carried out earlier this month by Curia Market Research, surveyed 1000 randomly selected people reflective of overall voters.
But the results contradict previous polls, conducted in New Zealand using similar sample sizes, which have found that Kiwis tend to be evenly divided on the issue. For instance, a 1 NEWS Colmar Brunton poll conducted in October suggested that 46% of Kiwis were in favour of legalisation of cannabis for personal use and 41% were against.
They are correct about the Colmar Brunton poll …
“The Government will hold a referendum on legalising marijuana. Do you think the personal use of marijuana should be legalised?” No 41% Don’t know 12%
Interviewing took place from October 15 to October 19, with 1006 eligible voters contacted either by landline or mobile phone. The maximum sampling error was ±3.1 per cent.
…but that doesn’t ask what the Greens are proposing for the referendum – some legalisation, but with age and sale restrictions.
But they didn’t mention a NZ Herald/Horizon poll also taken in October: 60 per cent support for legal cannabis – new poll A new poll shows that 60 per cent of New Zealanders would vote to legalise cannabis for personal use in a referendum. It also reveals that over 300,000 Kiwi adults – mainly the youngest and the poorest – are using cannabis daily – in contrast with other research that show far lower daily use. The poll is the first since the Government announced last month that the referendum on the issue will take place at the same time as the 2020 election and would be binding . Though the question that will be put to voters has yet to be decided, the confidence and supply agreement between Labour and the Greens states that the referendum will be “on legalising the personal use of cannabis”.
That is the same question that was used in a new survey, by Horizon Research and commissioned by licensed medicinal cannabis company Helius Therapeutics. Yes 60% No 24% No opinion 16%
Quite a different result. Why? It can depend on what questions are asked, and how they are asked.
The Horizon poll asked more detailed questions: 63% wanted a regulated market for legal cannabis with licensed operators 39% wanted the legal age to buy cannabis to be 18; 36% supported 21; 32% said if the legal age was set too high, it would lead to a black market 58% said penalties for breaking the law in a legal cannabis market should be about the same for breaking the law on alcohol sales; 28% supported severe penalties 18% supported the Government owning and controlling all production and sale of cannabis 40% wanted a Government excise tax, and 68% said any tax revenue should go towards health services 60% said they believed legal cannabis would result in lower levels of crime, or have no effect, while about a third said it would reduce harm and a quarter said it would increase harm. 81% support medicinal cannabis From a nationwide survey conducted in October of 995 adults 18 and over, and weighted to be representative of the population at the 2013 census. The margin of error is 3.1 per cent.
To understand the Family First poll result it’s worth looking at the questions they asked. If restrictions on the use of cannabis were reduced, do you think the use of cannabis would increase, decrease or remain the same? Do you believe tobacco companies are pushing for restrictions on cannabis to be lifted? Do you think cannabis use can damage the brains of young people under the age of 25? Do you think that drivers using cannabis are more likely or less likely to cause accidents? Do you think that young people under the age of 25 who regularly use cannabis are more likely or less likely to get a job?
So the poll starts by asking four questions about possible negative effects of cannabis use, plus a bizarre implication that tobacco companies could be involved.
Only then did they ask the question that they headline:
6. Which of the following statements comes closest to your opinion on cannabis? Current restrictions remain 7% Lift restrictions for medical but not recreational use 65% Lift restrictions for recreational use 18% Unsure/Refuse 10%
The Government is not proposing to “lift restrictions for recreational use” anywhere near completely. They make it clear they want significant restrictions to remain.
Asking leading questions like this is a technique that is specifically not recommended in polling. Curia is a member of the Research Association of NZ, which states in their political polling guidelines :
Question Order
It is recommended the principal voting behaviour question be asked before all other questions
The report must disclose the order of questions asked and any political questions asked before the principal voting behaviour question
The story should disclose any other questions which may have impacted the responses to the principal voting behaviour question
The principal voting behaviour question was asked last, not first, and this was not disclosed in the Family First publicity releases. The story also did not disclose the wording of the questions and did not disclose all the questions.
The full poll report (not clearly linked) headed Curia Market Research did disclose the questions and order of questions. it states:
CODE COMPLIANCE: This poll was conducted in accordance with the New Zealand Political Polling Code, the Research Association New Zealand Code of Practice and the International Chamber of Commerce/European Society for Opinion and Market Research Code on Market and Social Research.
It also included the NZ Political Polling Code emblem as per “Compliant polls Polls following the code are entitled to use the emblem below to signal their compliance.”
I question whether the Family First cannabis poll complied with the Polling Code or Code of Practice.
It doesn’t help perceptions that Curia does National Party polling, and Simon Bridges and other National MPs have expressed their opposition to cannabis law reform.
Family First are trying to alter minds and opinions on the proposed cannabis referendum by pushing some fairly strong crap into the debate."
Sri Lankan bombings – on the alleged ringleader,yournz.org,Pete George,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://yournz.org/2019/04/28/sri-lankan-bombings-on-the-alleged-ringleader/," Sri Lankan bombings – on the alleged ringleader
The alleged ringleader of the Sri Lankan bombing of churches and hotels, Mohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran, has a history of differences with his school and various mosques, including a mosque he set up himself.
Reuters – ‘Black sheep’: The mastermind of Sri Lanka’s Easter Sunday bombs
Mohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran was 12 years old when he began his studies at the Jamiathul Falah Arabic College. He was a nobody, with no claim to scholarship other than ambition.
The boy surprised the school with his sharp mind. For three years, Zahran practiced memorizing the Koran. Next came his studies in Islamic law. But the more he learned, the more Zahran argued that his teachers were too liberal in their reading of the holy book.
“He was against our teaching and the way we interpreted the Koran – he wanted his radical Islam,” said Aliyar. “So we kicked him out.”
Zahran’s path from provincial troublemaker to alleged jihadist mastermind was marked by years of missed or ignored signals that the man with a thick beard and paunch was dangerous.
His increasingly militant brand of Islam was allowed to grow inside a marginalized minority community – barely 10 percent of the country’s roughly 20 million people are Muslim – against a backdrop of a dysfunctional developing nation.
The precise relationship between Zahran and Islamic State is not yet known. An official with India’s security services, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that during a raid on a suspected Islamic State cell by the National Investigation Agency earlier this year officers found copies of Zahran’s videos.
Zahran joined a mosque in 2006, the Dharul Athar, and gained a place on its management committee. But within three years they’d had a falling out.
“He wanted to speak more independently, without taking advice from elders,” said the mosque’s imam, or spiritual leader, M.T.M. Fawaz. Also, the young man was more conservative, Fawaz said, objecting, for instance, to women wearing bangles or earrings.
Mohamed Yusuf Mohamed Thaufeek, a friend who met Zahran at school and later became an adherent of his, said the problems revolved around Zahran’s habit of misquoting Islamic scriptures.
The mosque’s committee banned him from preaching for three months in 2009. Zahran stormed off.
Despite being “a bit rough-edged”, Zahran was a skilled speaker and others his age were drawn to his speeches and Koranic lessons, said Thaufeek. He traveled the countryside at times, giving his version of religious instruction as he went.
Also, Zahran had found a popular target: the town’s Sufi population, who practice a form of Islam often described a mystical, but which to conservatives is heresy.
Tensions in the area went back some years. In 2004, there was a grenade attack on a Sufi mosque and in 2006 several homes of Sufis were set afire. Announcements boomed from surrounding mosques at the time calling for a Sufi spiritual leader to be killed, said Sahlan Khalil Rahman, secretary of a trust that oversees a group of Sufi mosques.
He blamed followers of the fundamentalist Wahhabi strain of Islam that some locals say became more popular after funding from Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Wahhabism, flowed to mosques in Kattankudy.
It was, Rahman said, an effort “to convert Sufis into Wahhabis through this terrorism”. Rahman handed over a photograph album showing charred homes, bullet holes sprayed across an office wall and a shrine’s casket upended.
It was an ideal backdrop for Zahran’s bellicose delivery and apparent sense of religious destiny.
In 2012, Zahran started a mosque of his own. The Sufis were alarmed and, Rahman said, passed on complaints to both local law enforcement and eventually national government offices. No action was taken.
The then-officer in charge of Kattankudy police, Ariyabandhu Wedagedara, said in a telephone interview that he couldn’t arrest people simply because of theological differences.
This is a problem we are trying to address in New Zealand now – where does ‘free specch’ cross the line into dangerous or inciteful speech.
Zahran found another megaphone: the internet. His Facebook page was taken down after the bombings, but Muslims in the area said his video clips had previously achieved notoriety.
His speeches went from denouncing Sufis to “kafirs”, or non-believers, in general.
In 2017, Zahran’s confrontations boiled over. At a rally near a Sufi community, his followers came wielding swords. At least one man was hacked and hospitalized. The police arrested several people connected to Zahran, including his father and one of his brothers. Zahran slipped away from public view.
That December, the mosque Zahran founded released a public notice disowning him. Thaufeek, his friend from school, is now the head. He counted the places that Zahran had been driven away from – his school, the Dharul Athar mosque and then, “we ourselves kicked him out, which would have been hard for him to take”.
Until now his reported conflict was within the Muslim community in Sri Lanka.
The next year, a group of Buddha statues was vandalized in the town of Mawanella, about five hours drive from Kattankudy. There, in the lush mountains of Sri Lanka’s interior, Zahran had taken up temporary residence.
“He was preaching to kill people,” said A.G.M. Anees, who has served as an imam at a small mosque in the area for a decade. “This is not Islam, this is violence.”
Zahran went into hiding once more.
What he did from there is still under investigation.
Reuters – Sri Lanka bans groups suspected to be behind attacks; ringleader’s relatives wounded
Sri Lanka’s president on Saturday outlawed two Islamist groups suspected to be behind the suicide bombings on churches and hotels while the wife and child of the suspected ringleader were wounded during a military raid in safe house, his family and police said.
The National Thawheedh Jamaath (NTJ) and Jamathei Millathu Ibrahim were banned under his emergency powers, President Maithripala Sirisena said in a statement, nearly a week after the Easter Sunday attacks that killed more than 250 people.
Police believe the suspected mastermind of the bombings, Mohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran, led either the NTJ or a splinter group. Less is known about Jamathei Millathu Ibrahim, whose members are also believed to have played a role in the bombings.
A gunbattle erupted on Friday evening during a raid on a safe house in Sainthamaruthu in Ampara district on the island’s east coast, killing at least 15 people including three people with suicide vests and six children, a military spokesman said.
The wounded included the wife and a daughter of Zahran, his family said.
The bombings that Zahran is alleged to have been involved with targeted both churches (attended by Christians on Easter Sunday) and hotels. The victims and intended victims in the hotel bombings could have been associated with a variety of religions, and some may not have been religious.
The motives for the attacks have not been made known publicly. Obviously Christians were a target, but more general targets may have been aimed at a wider agenda – 70% of Sri Lankans are Buddhist.
Muslim attacks on other religions would also cause problems within the Islamic population, some at least of which had conflicted with Zahran over his radical ideas and ‘misinterpretation’ of religions scriptures.
No group benefits from terrorist attacks. Apart from the death and destruction they inflict they cause problems for just about any group associated with the attacks in any way, or perceived to be associated.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now we'd like to check on recovery efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were hit by two Category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria, about 18 months ago. For more, we're joined by NPR's Greg Allen, who recently returned from the U.S. territory.
Greg, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us.
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Certainly.
MARTIN: Now, you've actually been there a number of times. And you were telling us that, you know, flying into the islands, visitors were seeing lots of blue roofs. Those are houses where the tarps are the only thing keeping the rain out. And the big resorts were closed. But how about now?
ALLEN: Well, you know, recovery is going very slowly there, you know, not unlike the way it is in Puerto Rico. In many ways, for people there in the Virgin Islands, life is still a daily struggle. There's a real high cost of living there in the islands. You know, housing is very expensive. Food's expensive. Supplies that - for rebuilding - they all come from the mainland, so that really raises the cost on things.
Isolation makes, you know, rebuilding very costly and slow. And even getting a contractor is very difficult. You know, and then take - set that aside, you talk about basic services - things like health care and education. The schools are back on full-day sessions now, but things are certainly not back to normal.
MARTIN: Well, tell us more about that. What's happening with the schools?
ALLEN: Well, you know, last year, a lot of the buildings were damaged, and so the students were doubled up in many of the schools. And so they did half-day sessions, which left some students going to school just for four hours a day. And after all of it was done, teachers say the students are academically behind where they should be. Modular classrooms have been brought in, replacing many of the schools.
But other students are just going to school in buildings that are really not in good shape. You know, some of them have real severe damage to him.
I visited the oldest high school in St. Thomas. It's Charlotte Amalie High. Principal Alcede Edwards took me on a tour and showed me some of the damage.
ALCEDE EDWARDS: This particular building, Building B - as you can see, we fenced it off.
ALLEN: Yeah.
EDWARDS: And we lost 30 classrooms, laboratories and everything else.
ALLEN: You know, many other buildings in that school were damaged also. Space is very tight. Cafeteria workers bring lunch out to serve the students who eat in the hallways outside the school, so that's how bad things are.
MARTIN: So what's going to happen? I mean, are the schools, the hospitals and, you know, the houses, for that matter, going to get repaired?
ALLEN: I think eventually. I think that's what you hear from people. Although most of the people I talked to don't expect it to be done anytime soon. They know it's going to take years. I sat down with the new governor in the Virgin Islands, Governor Albert Bryan. He took office in January. He's still getting his hands around all the challenges ahead. He says a large part of the problem there is that the Virgin Islands is an expensive place to live, and as many as a third of the children who live there are below the poverty level.
So there's a real issue of rich and poor there. And for the people who don't have a lot of money, the safety net is really not back yet. I asked the governor about how recovery's going. He recalled something that he heard from one of the aid workers after the storms.
ALBERT BRYAN: Every day, the rich and the middle class, it gets better. And every day, for poor people, it gets worse. And, you know, everybody has forgotten now about the Virgin Islands.
MARTIN: Well, you know, what about that, Greg? I mean, the truth is you don't hear much about the Virgin Islands now. I mean, is FEMA still providing aid, for example, to help people rebuild?
ALLEN: FEMA is still there and still providing aid. Although one FEMA program, the STEP program, that repairs people's roofs and windows - that's expired now. And, as we said at the top, there's a lot of people who still need their roofs repaired. The governor says one of the big problems is that many people lack the property deeds or other documents they need to show FEMA that they own the buildings. That's something that's required. There is more than a billion dollars in housing and urban development funds that are coming in, though, eventually, which are slated to help the territory rebuild. Some of that's for housing, but it'll also be for big projects like schools, hospitals and rebuilding the power grid.
But the problem they see in the Virgin Islands is similar to what I've heard in Puerto Rico and in Florida after hurricanes here. The federal government requires a lot of documentation from local authorities before it releases funds, and that slows down the disbursement of funds, which requires local governments, in many cases, to take out loans. And that can be costly and frustrating for them. I talked to Governor Bryan about this, and he said he's been through big hurricanes in the past, like Hurricane Hugo in 1989. And he says it wasn't always like this.
BRYAN: Accountability has really changed the speed at which recovery happens. So in Hugo, for instance, things happened a lot faster. We really need an emergency fast-track process to federal disbursement of dollars.
ALLEN: Governor Bryan says he's making that argument to officials in Washington. The federal government has been great, he says, but they've only done half the job. Now the challenge is getting the money into the hands of the people in the Virgin Islands who need it, he says.
MARTIN: That is NPR's Greg Allen. Greg, thank you.
ALLEN: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
And now for the biggest news of the week, the year, maybe the decade, at least for fans of Marvel's ""Avengers"" movies. The last installment of the franchise is in theaters now. And fans are flocking to see how it all comes out. Will Thanos get away with disappearing half the population of the universe? Which of our favorite superheroes will show up and save the day? Well, we promise not to give away any spoilers but we did want to talk to a super fan about all the excitement. So we've called Tony Mitchell, or as he's known on Twitter, Nem: The Infinity Watcher. And he got that name by watching Marvel's ""Infinity War"" - get this - 103 times. And Tony Mitchell, Nem, thanks so much for talking with us.
TONY MITCHELL: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: OK. We did the math, not our strongest subject, but we came up...
MITCHELL: OK.
MARTIN: ...With 274 hours and 40 minutes. That's how much time you spent watching and re-watching ""Infinity War."" Sound right?
MITCHELL: That is absolutely correct. And that's also including the credits and end credits scene.
MARTIN: Yeah. I mean, of course.
MITCHELL: You got to.
MARTIN: But, you know - but I do want to ask, why?
MITCHELL: Why? Well, that is the quintessential question, is it? Obviously, I'm a huge Marvel fan. I've grown up reading the comic books. I watched the cartoons in the '90s. But the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it really hit home for me when ""Iron Man"" came out in 2008. It was a game-changer for superhero movies. It was different. It was exciting. So I just kept watching them as the years went by, started getting invested into the characters and the backstories and the lore.
And when ""Infinity War"" came out, I was just blown away. It was brilliant, the storytelling. The visuals were stunning. The movie itself was bold, the way they ended it. So it just all came to a reckoning on this movie. And I just thought it was brilliantly done.
MARTIN: And was it like a personal quest for yourself to see it that many times? Or was it just something that once you started, it just became a thing?
MITCHELL: Well, what happened was after, like, maybe my sixth or seventh time watching it in the theater, I just asked myself, I wonder if this is, like, a thing that anybody else has done. I just wondered if it was a world record. And I went and looked it up. And there's actually a category for watching the same film in the theater the most times. But there was no one holding that record. So when I contacted, you know, Guinness and asked them what I needed to do, they just told me just hit an astronomical number, and we'll give you the record.
MARTIN: OK, so there it is.
MITCHELL: So - yeah.
MARTIN: So 103. OK. So, you know, drum roll please, ""Endgame."" Don't ruin it for the people who haven't yet gotten to see it. But love it, don't love it? Is it how you thought it would end? Or what's your take on it?
MITCHELL: Well, I love it, obviously. I've already seen it twice. I've already got my tickets for tonight. And I've got four more days of tickets. So I'm going to be watching it a lot. Not going after the record again, just to throw that out there. That's a one time, one-and-done thing. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is definitely - it's amazing. You know, it's - I would say it's just - it's a satisfying payoff to what happened over the last 10 years.
MARTIN: Did you cry? Tell the truth. Did you cry?
MITCHELL: I didn't cry, no.
MARTIN: You didn't?
MITCHELL: Everybody else in the theater did. I didn't.
MARTIN: Oh, yeah, right.
MITCHELL: Every single person cried except for me.
MARTIN: Oh, yeah, because they were only slicing onions for you?
MITCHELL: Right, yeah.
MARTIN: Right, next to your seat. OK. That's Tony Mitchell, Nem: the Infinity Watcher, telling us about his love of Marvel. And good luck to you. Thank you so much for joining us.
MITCHELL: Thank you so much for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
For something that doesn't move or talk, monuments have been the subject of much debate and deep feeling in recent years. And not just Confederate monuments, but also religious ones. And one of those debates played out in Arkansas, where State Senator Jason Rapert petitioned to erect a statue of the Ten Commandments outside the Capitol building in Little Rock. In response, a group called The Satanic Temple asked to have a monument of their choosing displayed on government property. It was of Baphomet, a goat-headed angel-winged icon. And let's just say the offer wasn't that well received.
That fight and The Satanic Temple more broadly is the subject of a new documentary called ""Hail Satan?"" - that's with a question mark. And it follows the founding of this group, which is bringing a puckish new voice to a very thoughtful and actually serious debate over religious freedom.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""HAIL SATAN?"")
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We are Satanists. We are also Americans. We are just as powerful as those who work in this institution here.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yes, we are.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We do not seek followers. We are seeking collaborators.
MARTIN: The film was directed by Penny Lane, known for her award-winning film ""Our Nixon."" And Penny Lane is with us now from our studios at NPR West in Culver City, Calif. And she's there with Lucien Greaves. He's the co-founder and spokesperson for The Satanic Temple. Welcome to you both. Thank you both so much for joining us.
PENNY LANE: Hello.
LUCIEN GREAVES: Thanks for having us.
MARTIN: Penny Lane, I'm going to start with you. How did you come across The Satanic Temple? And how did you decide that you wanted to make a film about them?
LANE: Well, I came across The Satanic Temple kind of like everyone else. I saw some really funny, startling news headlines about this Baphomet monument and its sort of success and journey in Oklahoma and into Arkansas. And I was interested in making a film about The Satanic Temple because I saw a real storytelling opportunity in the sense that lots of news coverage had existed of this movement, but all of the news coverage stopped at the top level, most obvious questions, and then never went any deeper. And the more I looked into it the more amazing, surprising, thought-provoking, funny and ultimately moving and inspiring things I found.
MARTIN: So, Lucien, early in the film, you say, quote, ""what we want to do is force people to evaluate their notions of the United States being a Christian nation. It's not. We're a secular nation. And we are supposed to be a democratic pluralistic nation. We're supposed to be a nation that doesn't allow the government to dictate what is appropriate religious expression.""
It's a very complete and complex philosophy, right? And as briefly as you, can can you just describe how you came to the place of this is what I believe, but not just this is what I believe, but this is how I'm going to express it?
GREAVES: Well, the this is what I believe came a lot earlier. And really, I had no inclination to advertise my affinity for the non-theistic satanic construct until there was a real need to do so in the activism world. We think it's really our duty to show people where their cognitive dissonance is when they consider issues of religious liberty and don't think beyond it only privileging their one tribalistic point of view. And that's something The Satanic Temple has really forced people to evaluate.
MARTIN: Somebody in the film asks not you, but one of the other chapter heads, why not just be an atheist? And he says atheism is boring.
LANE: Yeah, it is boring.
MARTIN: Is that about right, though? Is that really it? Or is there more to it?
LANE: It's not just that atheism is boring. It's that atheism in and of itself is not a kind of affirmative set of organized values. It's more saying what you're not than what you are. And as a lifelong atheist myself, I can attest to the fact that atheism doesn't give you a community. It doesn't give you a mythology, a sort of organizing set of principles or ethics. And it doesn't give you a kind of way to organize yourself in relationship to others and make change in the world.
MARTIN: There's a montage in the film where the various members talk about why they joined. Let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""HAIL SATAN?"")
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I'm not a very social person. Most of my interactions are online.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: It wasn't until I took that step to try to meet these people. That's where it really all came together. And I was terrified that I was just going to meet a bunch of people that were, like, all right, so we're going to meet up at the church. We'll hand out spray paint cans. And we'll kick over some graves. And everyone was amazing.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: I came from a very, like, conservatively religious background.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: I was very much a devout Christian growing up. You could almost say a zealot.
MARTIN: OK, Lucien, don't - you can't hit me because you're far away. It sounds like church. It sounds like church. People are looking for something. They find their people. And they're together. And it's awesome, right?
GREAVES: Well, those are the best elements of a church. And I'm not going to say that anything associated with religion is wrong. Obviously I believe we are an authentic form of religious expression. I stand by that we are a religion.
LANE: It is like church. Nobody wants to hit you for saying that.
GREAVES: But those are the best parts of a church, right, that sense of community, that sense of common purpose and ethics. And, I mean, we might not agree with different churches and the ethics they have, but I certainly don't put down the need for anybody to have those elements in their lives.
MARTIN: Penny, what's your take? Why do you think people join The Satanic Temple?
LANE: Well, it's sort of exactly what you said before. Like, you were a little nervous to say it's like church. And I think it is a church for people who didn't think they liked church. I mean, there is one person in my film who says I am very surprised to find myself part of an actual religion. And I think that's true for many, many members of The Satanic Temple. They have lived in this society where the idea of religion and religious identity and going to church has been so exclusively tied to values that they don't share that they had given up on that idea. And as Lucien said earlier, giving up on the idea of religion leaves a gigantic meaning-hole in your life.
MARTIN: Lucien, I'm sorry, you're still such a mystery to me because I feel like, you know, if people have watched a lot of the local news coverage of your groups in various different places, you would kind of see it as this quirky oddity. But you, in fact, have a very complete and thought-out philosophy and methodology. And, you know, forgive me, I just want to know where it comes from.
GREAVES: I read a lot. I get out a lot. I talk to people a lot. I don't claim to even be the author of this movement. I think it would be a real failing of mine if I began to think that I created this cultural moment that makes The Satanic Temple relevant. Now, all I can do is work to recognize what those elements are.
MARTIN: I totally get it. But I still want to know, like, where were you born? Like, what did your parents do?
GREAVES: I try not to personalize any of these things. And that was kind of a...
MARTIN: Is it in part because you don't want people to deify you?
LANE: Yeah, no.
GREAVES: Right. That is very much - that's very much it. And those were kind of restrictions we put on Penny in making the film is that we didn't want it to become anybody's biography. We didn't want it to be biographical vignettes. We wanted it to be clear that this is a broader movement. And I feel anytime I start to give a biography of myself, people fall into this assumption that you need to have these characteristics or that background to truly understand what this is. And I think that there is a lot of people who can understand this and it denigrates all the people who work with us, I think, to turn it into any one person's mission.
MARTIN: I wonder if you have any compassion or empathy for people who are either afraid of you or who think - not just you, the movement - who would think that it's not just dangerous, but bad for society? I mean, I understand that that can be hard to do if you experience other people as oppressors, but religious impulses have also fueled the civil rights movement, you know, the peace movement, the anti-nuclear movement. Do you have any empathy for people who have these religious commitments, traditional religious commitments?
GREAVES: Well, there's this idea that Satan is the author of all cruelty and evil. And if you acknowledge Satan as a mythological character, some people think you're just kind of arbitrarily trying to change that story. But I think there's something more important going on there. And that retaining this myth of Satan being the ultimate evil has done real tangible harm in the world. This idea that Satan is the author of all evil kind of upholds this notion that those who claim to be speaking on behalf of Jesus are the ones who are the arbiters of what is morally correct at all times, and that they're right about everything, and they don't need to revise their thinking on anything at all.
I can understand why they would be put off by somebody saying that they're a Satanist. I also expect people to at least be flexible enough to see what we're actually doing, judge us for our real-world actions, and have some kind of ability to revise their thinking based upon what they know about us.
MARTIN: That's Lucien Greaves. He's the co-founder and spokesperson for The Satanic Temple. It's the subject of a new film by Penny Lane. It's called ""Hail Satan?"" - that's with a question mark. And they were both with us from NPR West in Culver City, Calif. Penny Lane, Lucien Greaves, thank you so much for talking to us.
LANE: Thank you.
GREAVES: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
Barbershop: 2020 Electability,www.gpb.org,editor,04-28-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/barbershop-2020-electability,"Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now we want to head into the Barbershop to take a look at a debate that seems to be emerging from another pivotal week in politics. And that debate is who is electable. And we're talking about this in part because former Vice President Joe Biden announced his run for the presidency. This would be his third, but he hopes it's the charm. He quickly raised a bunch of money and emerged as a frontrunner - or so say the analysts. And that's similar to what happened with former candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who also raised a lot on his first day out and jumped to the head of the pack - at least, according to the early polling.
But this is new territory when it comes to a Democratic field. It's the largest ever, the most diverse ever when it comes to gender and race, as evidenced by a well-attended forum held this week in Houston organized by women of color. So we wondered, why are two older white men the frontrunners? And that got us thinking about electability and, like, what it means and who decides what that is.
So we decided to take that question to the Barbershop because that's where we talk to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds. Joining us now are A'shanti Gholar. She's the national political director for Emerge America. That's an organization that recruits and trains women to run for elected office. She's with us in our Washington, D.C., studios.
Welcome. Thanks for coming.
A'SHANTI GHOLAR: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: Leah Daughtry is a political strategist. She's the former CEO of the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions. She's with us from New York City.
Nice to have you with us as well.
LEAH DAUGHTRY: Thank you.
MARTIN: And she, along with A'shanti, have organized...
DAUGHTRY: Appreciate you having me.
MARTIN: Well, glad to have you back with us. And she helped organize the She the People event in Houston. And Reed Galen is also with us. He's an independent political consultant. He worked in the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, and he's with us from Park City, Utah.
Reed Galen, welcome to you as well.
REED GALEN: Thanks for having me.
MARTIN: So we're going to start with this Quinnipiac poll from last month that showed that 76% of Democratic-leaning voters said that they want someone who is electable. But Biden and Sanders are leading that pack among the same group, followed by Beto O'Rourke. So I want to ask each of you, what does electability mean? A'shanti, I'll start with you. I mean, is that code? I mean, is that just a way of saying a white male?
GHOLAR: It really is. And the fact is, women are electable. If they weren't, we wouldn't have any women in elected office period. And we look at the majority of the women candidates who are running - they hold elected office now. So when we just think about the founding of this country, it was made for white men who own land. They were what power was. And we still think, you know, a statesman, a guy with influence - we default back to white men. But in 2019, we know that electability does include women and people of color.
MARTIN: OK. But the Quinnipiac poll of Democrats and Democratic-leaning...
GHOLAR: Yeah (laughter).
MARTIN: ...Voters also showed Biden with 44% support among black voters...
GHOLAR: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...Followed by Sanders with 17%, O'Rourke with 16% and Harris with 8%. Elizabeth Warren barely registered, as well as a number of other candidates. So wouldn't it be fair to say - according to these numbers, at least - that African American voters - at least, a significant portion of them - may hold the same view?
GHOLAR: This issue, they do. But specifically, when we're talking about Biden and Sanders, they do have name recognition. People know them. And with Joe Biden, you mentioned this is his third time running. But he also ran in 2008. So back then, people were also saying he was electable, but we ended up with Barack Obama. And part of me, particularly what Joe Biden thinks, how much of this is people wanting those good, old days back - that nostalgia that they had? And is that leading them to say, oh, well, he was a vice president, we want that feel-good, so we're going with Joe Biden?
MARTIN: OK, could be. Leah, what do you think about this?
DAUGHTRY: Yeah. I agree with A'shanti on much of what she said. You know, I think electability is in the eye of the beholder. In these polls, it's - you know, you reference Quinnipiac from a month ago when Vice President Biden wasn't even in the race. So, you know, my - part of my pet peeve here is polling people about people who aren't in the race. And so that automatically skews numbers. And there is a high degree of name recognition.
But look. If we just go back to 2008, no one thought Barack Obama was electable. Everybody was leaning to Biden or someone else that was in the race or Clinton. And it wasn't until he actually did win in Ohio that people began to dream and imagine that he could be electable. So, you know, I always say, you know, the only poll that matters is Election Day. And so, you know, it's hard to put a lot of stock in this. They will - it will change 29 times in the next 10 months.
So I think if Democrats - I think the article of faith among all of us is that we want to win, and we are going to do what we need to do in order to make that a reality. Who actually gets the nomination is going to be something that we - that will happen as a result of the work that these 21 candidates - I think we're at 21. We may be more. Who knows today?
What they do over the next several months in order to raise their name recognition for people who don't know them and to get on the ground - and this is a race for delegates. Who's going to put together the operation that will yield them the delegates they need to get to 50%-plus-one on the convention floor?
MARTIN: So, Reed, you're probably wondering, like, why did we call you? We called you because...
GALEN: (Laughter).
MARTIN: ...You are a moderate Republican. But as I mentioned, you now identify as an independent. Independents are the fastest-growing part of the electorate according to these polls that, you know, everybody's mad at. But - so the question for you is, like, what do you consider your hierarchy of priorities? And what does electability mean to you?
GALEN: Sure. Well, I mean, I think, you know, going back to what one of the other guests said about - I mean, I think it was Leah - you know, no one thought that then-Senator Obama was electable. Certainly no one - or no one who thinks of us as smart enough to do this for a living thought that Donald Trump was electable. And look where we are today, right?
So I think the electability question is one that is - it is not just cut and dry, you know? Well, this person could win. This person couldn't win. I think that, you know, one thing that all of these candidates on the Democratic side are going to have to go through is the crucible that is a presidential nominating contest.
You know, two months from now or so, there'll be the first debate - couple of debates, I guess - you know, with people on different stages. And what you're going to see is, you know, presidential campaigns, you know, reveal character. They reveal that sort of what-it-takes moment or that what-it-takes grit and determination that Richard Ben Cramer talked about in his book, you know, almost 30 years ago, of which, you know, Joe Biden was a key part, just to give you a sense of how long he's been around.
And so I think that, you know, the electability piece is one that I think it's a little bit too early. I think that on the Biden and Bernie front, I think both the other guests are absolutely right. Bernie, you know, made a real run at secretary Clinton four years ago. Biden's been around, you know, forever - since before I was born. And so I think that, you know, name ID helps a lot in these early times.
MARTIN: You know, A'shanti, I want to - I'm not going to ask you to sort of tell me which candidate you - if there is one - that you like at this particular point. But all the accounts from the Houston event that you and Leah Daughtry were were a part of said that Elizabeth Warren seemed to really catch fire because of the specificity of her proposals. People really were impressed that she took the time to really focus on and craft policy and to present those policies in a way that really spoke to the people at that audience. But the question is, other people have compelling biographies as well.
So just from - just your seat of the pants from right now, what do you sense is the thing that is catching fire with people? Is it compelling biography - because a number of people have them? Or is it these well-honed policies?
GHOLAR: So yes. Elizabeth Warren did very well. I am uncommitted. But when everyone left the forum, the name that you heard the most was Elizabeth Warren. And a lot of it had to do with the fact that she is able to connect biography, her policies with storytelling. She was relatable. And I did not feel pandered to at all. There was this connection. And you had women in the audience going, she ready, she ready...
MARTIN: (Laughter).
GHOLAR: ...Which was really great. And the moderators, Aimee Allison and Joy Ann Reid, asked her about this electability question. And she looked at the audience and gave a very awesome side-eye. I have never seen her side-eye before, but it was wonderful. And one of the things that she said regarding this is, are we going to show up for people that we didn't actually believe in because we were too afraid to do anything else?
MARTIN: Interesting.
GHOLAR: And that's not who we are. And she got a standing ovation for that...
MARTIN: Interesting.
GHOLAR: ...Because we do want someone who we can believe in but who sees us. And with her, she is making people feel seen and valued and that she has a plan for them.
MARTIN: Leah, very briefly, if you would, who else impressed you there? I'm not asking you to endorse. I'm saying, who impressed you?
DAUGHTRY: Well, I think a close second - for those who follow me on social - the close second with Kamala Harris...
MARTIN: OK.
DAUGHTRY: ...Who was insightful and incisive, who also presented policies in a very straightforward manner...
MARTIN: OK.
DAUGHTRY: ...And was connected and relatable to the audience. I think what people have to remember...
MARTIN: OK.
DAUGHTRY: ...About black voters is that we want to know the policy. We are savvy voters. We like to...
MARTIN: OK.
DAUGHTRY: ...Size up a candidate. And it has to be the right combination of, what are you going to do for me, and tell me the story of who you are...
MARTIN: OK.
DAUGHTRY: ...And where you come from.
MARTIN: All right. Well, great.
DAUGHTRY: And those two candidates that day at She The People were able to connect both of those.
MARTIN: All right. Sorry for the short time. We'll come back to you on this. Obviously, it's going to be a very interesting year. That's Leah Daughtry, Democratic strategist...
DAUGHTRY: Yes.
MARTIN: ...Co-Author of ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics,"" Reed Galen, independent political consultant, and A'shanti Gholar, national political director for Emerge America.

Everything Is Not Awesome For Chinese Company Busted For Selling Fake Legos,www.gpb.org,Gabriela Saldivia,04-27-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/everything-not-awesome-chinese-company-busted-selling-fake-legos,"By Gabriela Saldivia • 13 hours ago The toy company Lepin was raided by Chinese authorities in Shenzhen, China last week for allegedly manufacturing fake Lego products. picture alliance / picture alliance via Getty Image
A quick visit to the website LepinLand.com and it's pretty clear, the toys the Chinese company sells are eerily similar to another very popular toy on the market: Legos.
But it won't be selling them much longer.
The Chinese company posted a message on its website to say that at the request of the Chinese Government and Shanghai Police, it is temporarily stopping production of their block sets starting in May.
Chinese authorities raided Lepin's factory located in Shenzhen, China last week after discovering it was allegedly manufacturing fake Lego products. The raid turned up $30 million worth of counterfeit Legos and police arrested four people, the BBC reported .
Most Lepin sets, including its Star Wars series, are advertised on its website as "" compatible with Lego. ""
And now we know why. Police said in a statement that the toys were copied from Lego blueprints and more than 630,000 finished products were sized from the factory, the BBC reported .
A police investigation is still underway. According to the BBC, images posted by Chinese authorities after the raid showed products that looked nearly identical to those produced by the Danish toy giant, Lego.
The Lepin brand is definitely a cheaper option, often selling for a fraction of the price of Legos. As of Saturday afternoon, Lepin's website had its Star Wars Millennium Falcon kit listed for $313.30 whereas an authentic Lego one goes for $799.99 .
Zhong Shikai, one of the police officers responsible for investigating the case, told the state-run news agency Xinhua that there are big differences in the craftsmanship and quality when comparing the two.
Lego China and Asia Pacific's vice president Robin Smith said the products could pose a safety concern for consumers, Xinhua reported .
Foreign companies in China have long expressed dissatisfaction about intellectual property enforcement because of the prevalence of counterfeiting. The AFP reports the raid was a move by China to double down on intellectual property infringements, possibly in an attempt to ease trade tensions with Washington.
Xinhua reported that the number of intellectual property rights trials in Shanghai hit a record high last year.
Lepin's website says it will continue selling all remaining sets, but will not restock in the future. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
At Least 1 Killed In California Synagogue Shooting,www.gpb.org,Shannon Van Sant,04-27-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/least-1-killed-california-synagogue-shooting,"California Synagogue Shooting Investigated As A Hate Crime After 1 Killed, 3 Injured By editor • 13 hours ago Synagogue members talk to a San Diego County Sheriff's deputy outside of the Chabad of Poway Synagogue on Saturday in Poway, Calif. Denis Poroy / AP Originally published on April 28, 2019 2:47 am
Updated at 1:44 a.m. ET Sunday
A gunman opened fire at a California synagogue Saturday morning, killing one and wounding three more people.
The incident took place at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in the San Diego suburb of Poway, Calif., and came on the final day of Passover.
Authorities say the suspect fled the synagogue and called police to say he was involved in the shooting. They identified the suspect as 19-year-old John Earnest of San Diego, who was arrested.
Reports say a document posted online by someone with the same name is full of anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim views and claims responsibility for setting a nearby mosque on fire in March.
Four people were wounded and taken to a hospital, where a woman died from her wounds, police said.
Friends and members of the congregation identified the woman who died as 60-year-old Lori Gilbert Kaye of Poway.
""She's a huge presence here. She's just one of those people that were always here in some form or fashion,"" fellow congregant Tanya Wervy told reporter Max Rivlin-Nadler. Wervy said Gilbert Kaye was a generous person who will be missed.
""Witnesses said she jumped in front of the synagogue's founding rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein, who was wounded in the index fingers on both hands,"" The San Diego Union-Tribune reports.
Police say a rabbi suffered gunshot wounds to his hands and underwent surgery, while a 34-year-old man and child were hit by bullet shrapnel. Doctors say they are doing well, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said.
The child was transferred to a children's hospital.
The suspect had an AR-style assault weapon in his vehicle when he was arrested. Authorities say he had no prior arrest warrants or contact with law enforcement, and that they are reviewing social media posts and a letter attributed to the suspect.
The shooting is being investigated as a possible homicide, hate crime and federal civil rights violation. Authorities are also working with the FBI to investigate whether the suspect is linked to the mosque arson.
""This is not Poway,"" Mayor Steve Vaus told reporters. ""We always walk with our arms around each other, and we will walk through this tragedy with our arms around each other ... Poway will stay strong, and we will always be a community that cares for each other.""
The shooting occurred six months to the day since 11 people were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
The Chabad of Poway synagogue was scheduled to host a Passover Holiday Celebration on Saturday, beginning at 11 a.m., according to its website. The festivities were scheduled to conclude with a holiday meal at 7 p.m.
But shortly after the scheduled start time, deputies were called to the area.
Speaking to reporters outside of the White House, President Trump offered his condolences to members of the synagogue. Trump said, ""My deepest sympathies go to the people that were affected, the families, their loved ones. ... It looks like a hate crime. Hard to believe.""
Sara Bloomfield, the Director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, said in a statement, ""Moving forward this must serve as yet another wake-up call that antisemitism is a growing and deadly menace. The Holocaust is a reminder of the dangers of unchecked antisemitism and the way hate can infect a society. All Americans must unequivocally condemn it and confront it in wherever it appears.""
Trump expanded on his comments to the shooting Saturday evening, speaking to a crowd of supporters at the start of a rally in Green Bay, Wis.
""Tonight, America's heart is with the victims of the horrific synagogue shooting in Poway, Calif., just now,"" the president said. ""Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community. We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate, which must be defeated.""
He also thanked law enforcement for their ""courageous response,"" and sent a message of inclusiveness.
""Together we're building a new chapter of American greatness,"" he said, ""one founded on the idea that all citizens are entitled to live in safety, prosperity and peace.""
The sheriff's department said it was not aware of any more threats to the community.

Archdiocese Of New York Names 120 Clergy 'Credibly Accused' Of Child Sex Abuse,www.gpb.org,Gabriela Saldivia,04-27-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/archdiocese-new-york-names-120-clergy-credibly-accused-child-sex-abuse,"By Gabriela Saldivia • 16 hours ago St. Patrick's Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which has released a list of 120 clergy members ""credibly accused"" of child sexual abuse. Spencer Platt / Getty Images Originally published on April 27, 2019 4:25 pm
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York released the names on Friday of 115 priests and five deacons who have been ""credibly accused"" of sexually abusing children.
In a letter to members and family of the archdiocese , New York's archbishop, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, asked forgiveness ""for the failings of those clergy and bishops who should have provided for the safety of our young people but instead betrayed the trust placed in them by God and by the faithful."" After hearing from many of you, including many victim-survivors, I have decided to publish a comprehensive list of all archdiocesan clergy found credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor, or any…[1/4] — Cardinal Dolan (@CardinalDolan) April 26, 2019
The disclosure from one of the largest archdioceses in the nation follows similar revelations in recent months that further exposed the depth of a decades-long abuse crisis in Catholic communities across the United States. Last August, for example, a grand jury investigation revealed widespread sexual abuse by more than 300 priests in Pennsylvania .In February, Roman Catholic bishops in New Jersey and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn also provided lists totaling nearly 300 clergy members who faced accusations of sexual assault.
The revelations have come as the Catholic Church continues to face criticism that it systematically covered up allegations of child sex abuse by clergy members.
Included in the release from the New York Archdiocese were the names of 53 priests and deacons who were credibly accused of abuse, admitted to abuse, were convicted of a crime related to abuse or were involved in a civil settlement. Most on the list were removed from ministry, deceased or both, the church said.
Names of 59 other clergy members were disclosed. Most had died or left the ministry before being accused in cases that led to financial settlements from the church's Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program, according to the report.
Also included were the names of eight priests who have been defrocked and are still waiting for final canonical or archdiocesan disposition of allegations against them.
One of the most recognizable names included was Theodore McCarrick, the former cardinal and archbishop of Washington, D.C.,who was expelled from the priesthood in February after he was found guilty by the Vatican of sexual abuse. McCarrick, who had previously served as a priest in the New York Archdiocese, is one of the highest-ranking Catholic officials to be defrocked as a result of the abuse crisis.
A graph provided by the archdiocese of New York shows most of the alleged abuse took place between the 1950s and the 1990s. The report states that since 2002, when the church overhauled its practices surrounding abuse claims, two cases have been determined to be credible. Both cases were handled by law enforcement and resulted in the priest being removed from ministry, according to the report.
""Please be assured there is not a single priest or deacon of the Archdiocese of New York against whom there has been a credible and substantiated claim of abuse against a minor currently in ministry,"" Dolan said in the letter.
The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests or SNAP, a prominent support group for victims, said that while they are grateful for the list of names, it's ""belated"" and that the ""information is good but not enough for a complete list""
""Cardinal Timothy Dolan should update his list to include, at a minimum, the work histories of each accused priest so that communities where abusers served know to look for survivors in their midst,"" according a statement from SNAP issued on Friday. ""Similarly, he should include information about when the archdiocese first received the allegations and what they did in response.""
SNAP says the only way to prevent similar situations in the future is to know what went wrong to enable abusers in the past.
""While we are grateful for the bit of transparency shown by the Archdiocese of New York today, we will be looking to the conclusion of the ongoing investigation by [New York] Attorney General Letitia James for the full transparency that the public deserves and needs.""
SNAP said it hopes the publicizing of this type of information will ""encourage survivors who may be suffering in silence to come forward and make a report to police and the attorney general"" and better inform communities.
In his apology letter, Dolan also urged ""anyone who has an allegation of abuse of a minor to go immediately to the district attorney to report it."" Correction: 4/26/19

"As NRA Leadership Fight Spills Into Public, N.Y. Attorney General Opens Investigation",www.gpb.org,Tim Mak,04-27-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/oliver-north-says-he-will-not-seek-2nd-term-nra-president,"By Tim Mak • 16 hours ago Oliver North speaks at the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action Leadership Forum at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Friday. Michael Conroy / AP Originally published on April 27, 2019 6:04 pm
Updated at 6:01 p.m. ET
National Rifle Association leader Oliver North announced Saturday that he will not seek a second term as president of the gun rights group, as is customary.
The decision plunged the organization into chaos ahead of a board meeting on Monday and sparked debate among NRA members over a resolution on whether to oust Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre.
North's decision to step aside from his leadership role comes amid infighting within the group and follows a number of articles from The New Yorker , The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times detailing allegations of financial mismanagement by senior NRA officials.
""The current situation,"" North wrote in a letter to the NRA's membership, means that the organization's ""non-profit status is threatened.""
Even as the NRA struggled to handle its internal divisions, an external threat emerged this weekend in the form of a new investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
""The Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James has launched an investigation related to the National Rifle Association (NRA),"" a spokesperson for the attorney general told NPR. ""As part of this investigation, the Attorney General has issued subpoenas. We will not have further comment at this time.""
The NRA has received a document preservation notice in connection with the investigation being undertaken by the New York attorney general, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The NRA responded to the announcement of the investigation by pledging its cooperation.
""The NRA will fully cooperate with any inquiry into its finances,"" said William A. Brewer III, an outside lawyer for the NRA. ""The NRA is prepared for this, and has full confidence in its accounting practices and commitment to good governance.""
North's announcement on Saturday shocked the hundreds of NRA members and donors gathered at the NRA annual meeting in Indianapolis — the news was met with absolute silence.
Following the announcement, rank-and-file NRA members proposed a resolution holding LaPierre accountable for the allegations of financial mismanagement within the organization and calling for him to step down.
The resolution was ultimately defeated, but not before a passionate debate broke out among members — with escalating rhetoric. Some members demanded information on the allegations of financial impropriety. Others suggested that because of ongoing litigation, the matter should not be debated in public. At one point, one NRA member compared the resolution to an attempted hanging of LaPierre.
North — who is perhaps best known for his role in the Reagan-era Iran-Contra affair — was expected to join Saturday's meeting himself, but his chair onstage was empty.
""Please know I hoped to be with you today as NRA president, endorsed for reelection,"" North wrote in a letter, read aloud to the NRA membership by NRA First Vice President Richard Childress. ""I am now informed that that will not happen.""
North, who has served on the NRA board for more than two decades, said there was a ""clear crisis"" within the organization that ""needs to be dealt with immediately and responsibly so the NRA can continue to focus on protecting the Second Amendment.""
North said he had been approached by LaPierre in the spring of 2018, asking him to retire from his post at Fox News to become president of the gun rights group.
North said he accepted a salaried position with Ackerman McQueen, one of the NRA's most prominent outside contractors, as part of the agreement. NRA presidents typically do not receive a salary from the organization.
He said that after starting as president in September 2018, he was ""confronted by NRA board members and donors"" about how much the association was paying for an outside law firm. His attempts to address the problem, he said, were ""rebuffed repeatedly."" He also stated that before his departure, he had started a ""crisis committee"" to deal with the allegations.
The NRA recently filed a lawsuit against Ackerman McQueen, which for decades has served as an outside group shaping the NRA's messaging. The lawsuit alleges the firm refused to comply with requests to justify its billings. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal , the firm said the suit was ""frivolous, inaccurate and intended to cause harm to the reputation of our company.""
The NRA has been plunged into internal turmoil at a vulnerable time. It was outspent by gun control groups in the 2018 midterm elections.

Fresh Air Weekend highlights some of the best interviews and reviews from past weeks, and new program elements specially paced for weekends. Our weekend show emphasizes interviews with writers, filmmakers, actors and musicians, and often includes excerpts from live in-studio concerts. This week:
Glenda Jackson On Playing King Lear: Gender Barriers 'Crack' With Age: The 82-year-old British actor is currently playing Shakespeare's famed tragic figure on Broadway. ""Doors have opened for women that were firmly locked many decades ago,"" she says.
'Socialism' Isn't The Scare Word It Once Was: It isn't yet clear where ""socialist"" will settle in the vocabulary of the American left, as it jostles with labels like ""liberal"" and ""progressive."" But it's not the S-word anymore.
From Fastballs To Greaseballs, 'K' Offers A History Of Baseball's Most Iconic Pitches: New York Times baseball writer Tyler Kepner spoke to 22 hall-of-fame pitchers about what they throw, and how they get a mental edge over hitters. His new book is K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches.

WHOSE AGENDA? Polis Administration Takes Direction from Special Interests,coloradopeakpolitics.com,ColoradoPeakPolitics,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://coloradopeakpolitics.com/2019/04/26/whose-agenda-polis-administration-takes-direction-from-special-interests/,"WHOSE AGENDA? Polis Administration Takes Direction from Special Interests
During the oil and gas debate, lefties screeched on Twitter that the Polis administration was not taking cues from special interests (in their minds, the oil and gas industry). Someone probably forgot to send fractivists the memo that the Polis administration, in fact, was taking direction from special interests – environmentalists for example, according to Western Wire .
Here’s one example:
“On Monday, January 28, Jill Ryan, the new Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) under the Polis administration emailed Garry Kaufman, Division Director of the Air Pollution Control Division at the CDPHE about an upcoming meeting, and shared a list of to-dos suggested by Ryan’s friends at Colorado Communities for Climate Action, an organization Ryan headed as president before resigning to take up the position at CDPHE under Gov. Jared Polis.”
In addition to taking up suggestions that WildEarth Guardians, radical environmentalists, offered, the CC4CA argued that the CDPHE should:
“…let the federal Clean Air Act “run its course” and allow the area to get ‘bumped up to a serious [nonattainment] area’ so that emitters would be forced to seek a major source permit—and to hasten the action by certifying the CDPHE data earlier than the May 1 st deadline.”
All in all, a poor showing for an administration whose supporters insisted that it was not beholden to special interests. The truth is that this administration is not just beholden, but actually taking orders from them. 114"

Abril 27,2019.- Un grupo de cinco venezolanos recorre a pie las calles de Cúcuta para conseguir cartón. Cada paso es un intento por surgir fuera del país. Su oficina son las calles de la zona céntrica de la ciudad fronteriza y su materia prima es la basura. Llevan a cuestas el peso de una supuesta revolución: un bulto tricolor que los identifica como los venezolanos que intentan surgir en Colombia. Así lo reseña el-nacional.com
Oriundos de Acarigua, estado Portuguesa, hurgan en bolsas de basura a paso cansino por las vías de la ciudad, arreando su vehículo, sin motor, pero que soporta la estructura metálica en la que se almacena todo lo que se recoge en el día. Los hombres, de piel tostada y con rostros rojos hostigados por el sol, recuerdan que militares venezolanos les quitaron la mitad de sus pertenencias cuando cruzaron la frontera.
“Teníamos todo cuando llegamos al cruce fronterizo. Dos militares nos pararon para preguntarnos de dónde veníamos. Lo único que teníamos en nuestros bolsos era comida y ropa para ayudarnos, pero nos quitaron todo sin darnos explicaciones. Incluso a dos de nosotros nos quitaron el carnet fronterizo, y tuvimos que pasar por una trocha”, relata Keyber Quiñones.
Indican que su hogar se encuentra a tres horas de distancia y salen en la tarde para empezar a trabajar cuando el sol se ha ocultado. Visitan las calles más concurridas en busca de materiales que puedan vender; tienen que preguntar a taxistas en cada esquina para guiarse. Agregan que no tienen horario, pero todos los días llegan al refugio a las 2:00 am.
En Venezuela se dedicaban a arreglar teléfonos. “Somos técnicos en telefonía”, dicen con orgullo. Para ellos el reciclaje es una actividad temporal, mientras consiguen un empleo.
“Me vine a Colombia dejando toda mi vida atrás, una vida porque nosotros somos técnicos en telefonía móvil. Llegamos a Cúcuta para tratar de surgir, pero aquí la vida no es fácil. Nos ayudamos con el reciclaje, recogemos cartón. Salimos a las 2:00 pm y llegamos aproximadamente a las 6:00 pm. También reciclamos papeles, periódico y sobrevivimos para comprar alimentos”, afirma Luigi Marcano, otro de los caminantes.
Afirman que el cartón debe ser llevado a las recuperadoras y comercializadoras de esta mercancía, donde pueden recibir a cambio 250 pesos por kilo, equivalente a 431 bolívares. Aunque es una actividad muy común en las calles de la ciudad colombiana, el problema es que nunca se consigue mucho cartón. “Hay días buenos en los que hago hasta 5.000 pesos, pero eso casi nunca pasa”, expresa mientras descansa un momento recostado de las bolsas.
Marcano calcula que por una bolsa llena de cartón, que puede pesar entre 10 y 15 kilos, pueden obtener hasta 2.250 pesos, los cuales solo le alcanzan para un refresco pequeño y un pan en algún abasto.
El cartón no es lo único que se recoge. El kilo de vidrio se paga a 100 pesos, el plástico a 300 pesos, la chatarra a 350 pesos, el cobre a 11.000 pesos y el bronce a 7.500 pesos, siendo estos últimos los más buscados, pero los más difíciles de conseguir.
“Tuvimos que rebuscarnos con el reciclaje para salir adelante. Cada vez que uno pasa por una esquina dicen: ‘Mira, por ahí van los venezolanos’, pero como uno no está en su país se tiene que quedar callado. Desde que llegamos un comedor nos ayuda con el desayuno y el almuerzo. A veces tenemos para la cena, otras no”, manifiesta Marcano, de 27 años de edad.
Henderson Lagos piensa dos veces antes de hablar. Dejó a su familia en Venezuela y no quiere que la próxima vez que lo vean sea deambulando por las calles de Cúcuta. Respira profundo para narrar la situación que viven los venezolanos que deciden salir de sus tierras para poder enviar comida a sus hijos.
“En mi país nos están haciendo pasar hambre, esa es la principal razón que nos lleva a buscar otras fronteras; no lo estamos haciendo porque queremos. Nosotros no queremos estar buscando cartón, ni caminar todo el día. Yo considero que huí de mi país, le dije a mi esposa antes de irme que me iba solo con la intención de que tuvieran algo que comer todos los días”, se queja Lagos.
Indica que aunque muchos colombianos les han brindado ayuda, otros los han señalado y hasta humillado mientras hurgan en la basura.
“Hay personas que nos identifican porque la mayoría tenemos el bolso tricolor que daban en Venezuela. Sabemos que mucha gente mala ha salido del país, pero no nos tienen que juzgar a todos por igual”, dice.
Víctimas de la crisis en Venezuela continúan su ruta en la búsqueda de cartón. Desgastados, encorvados y con tatuajes desteñidos por la exposición al sol nunca dejan de sonreír, a pesar de la situación que viven. Cruzaron la frontera con la ilusión de alejarse lo más que puedan de una revolución que acabó con sus sueños. Aunque no son pocas las adversidades, hoy estos caminantes intentan reconstruir sus vidas con humildad y esfuerzo.

Abril 27,2019.- Llegar a Maracaibo es entrar en una especie de zona de guerra. Los habitantes deambulan como fantasmas entre las ruinas de calles desoladas y montones de basura que ellos mismos han de quemar porque ningún servicio público se ocupa de recogerlas. Los escombros, fruto de los saqueos a comercios durante los últimos apagones, dominan el decadente paisaje urbano. Así lo reseña abc.es
Venezuela se muere. Y en muchos casos no por falta de alimentos, sino de dinero para acceder a ellos. ABC muestra los efectos de la tragedia venezolana que el régimen de Maduro quiere ocultar. Entre chabolas destartaladas en los barrios de Maracaibo malviven enfermos físicos y mentales, niños desnutridos, las víctimas más vulnerables de la dictadura chavista.
Pero la capital del estado Zulia, otrora el centro del orgullo petrolero de Venezuela, no es Siria ni Libia. La causa de la ruina de Maracaibo, la segunda ciudad el país, es la descomunal crisis en la que ha hundido al país el régimen chavista, agudizada ahora, aún más, por los cortes en el suministro eléctrico, que obliga a los maracuchos a peregrinar durante horas en busca de agua potable, alimentos y combustible o a quedarse refugiados en sus casas, a la espera de luz para encender el aire acondicionado con que hacer frente a un calor abrasador.
«Llevamos más de un año sin agua. ¡Yo debería estar en mi escuela y no voy porque debo ayudar a mi mamá en esto!», grita con rabia Michelle, una adolescente con la ropa empapada y el rostro demacrado, mientras intenta conseguir agua potable de una tubería subterránea, por la que hacen cola y se pelean niños, mujeres y hombres. «Aquí donde me ve, no me he llevado un pan a la boca desde anoche», añade esta chica de 14 años que parece mayor.
Los carteles y vallas publicitarias con el eslogan «La primera ciudad de Venezuela» que salpican Maracaibo son hoy un sarcasmo agraz. Zulia, donde se extrae el 60% del crudo venezolano y con un extraordinario potencial agrícola y ganadero, llegó a ser la envidia de Iberoamérica. En su aeropuerto había un intenso tráfico internacional. Ahora la lucha por la supervivencia es extrema para los cuatro millones de habitantes de la región, las colas para llenar el depósito son kilométricas y sobran los dedos de una mano para contar las rutas de vuelos.
«Aquí los pobres perdemos la vida. Hoy voy para cuatro horas y ahora acaban de cerrar la estación para ver si llega otro camión para surtir», dice con resignación Abelardo Montiel, mientras espera cerveza en mano en una gasolinera. «Yo no tengo los cobres (dinero) para pagar a los guardias que te quieren vender hasta en un dólar el litro, cuando la gasolina es regalada en este país», se lamenta.
El drama en toda su crudeza
La miseria es también patente en Caracas, pero el régimen de Maduro destina los recursos que puede a la capital del país para protegerla como una burbuja y evitar que haya estallidos sociales. Si el problema no ocurre en Caracas, es como si no existe. En Maracaibo, en cambio, el drama del chavismo se presenta en toda su crudeza.
Por eso también el régimen se esfuerza por mantenerla aislada, fuera de la vista de los medios independientes. Militares, milicianos y paramilitares armados de los «colectivos» vigilan para impedir el acceso de la prensa a los puntos calientes de la ciudad. Los hospitales están blindados y entrar en ellos sin autorización puede acarrear ser detenido o expulsado, en caso de los periodistas extranjeros. «Nadie nos escucha ni nos toma en cuenta»: Keliver Chourio, de 26 años, con una grave desnutrición y paralizada por una meningitis que a los once meses dejó secuelas irreversibles en su sistema nervioso. Al lado su madre, Juana, que cree que le habría podido dar una vida mejor si la revolución bolivariana le hubiese dado oportunidades, como prometía. «No se imagina cuántas cartas he mandado a la gobernación y a Miraflores. Incluso viajé en enero a Caracas solicitando una silla de ruedas, medicinas y alguna bolsa de comida mensual, pero nadie nos escucha ni nos toma en consideración. Y tanto que apoyamos a Chávez…», suspira.
«La censura es cada vez mayor. A nosotros nos han metido hasta tanques dentro de las residencias», asegura Carmen Gamboa, residente de un bastión opositor, las Torres del Saladillo. «Estos grupos no respetan a nadie –explica–. Vienen con armas y nos amenazan si protestamos o denunciamos lo que está ocurriendo».
Además, la señal de internet es intermitente. Los periódicos de papel han desaparecido y solo quedan panfletos de propaganda del Gobierno, por lo que en Maracaibo, si no hay conexión a la red, uno no se entera de nada.
Solo hay luz unas pocas horas al día. Los cortes no tienen ningún tipo de programación. Una zona de la ciudad pasa una semana entera a oscuras, mientras otras tienen electricidad un par de horas. A veces aparece inesperadamente, pero si llueve puede que los transformadores estallen o fallen. «Paso las noches en vela viendo llorar a la niña» Sarangeli Castilla nació prematura, con tan solo 1,5 kilos, y su peso permanece estancado. Tiene dos meses, pero padece ya una desnutrición crónica. Su madre, Katherine Castilla, tiene otros seis hijos y comenta que solo le da pecho, porque le es imposible comprar las fórmulas especiales. «La situación es muy dura, yo soy una madre soltera y solo cuento con la ayuda de mi padre, que está jubilado. No tenemos cómo llevar a mi hijo a un médico o un especialista. Paso todas las noches en vela, viéndolo llorar sin saber qué es lo que le duele», asegura Katherine.

Abril 27,2019.- Un ciudadano estadounidense arrestado en Venezuela hace cinco años por cargos de tráfico de armas e intento de asesinato, acusaciones que su familia descalificó, fue liberado esta semana, dijo el viernes su familia en un comunicado.
Todd Leininger, de 37 años y quien ya se encuentra en Estados Unidos, fue arrestado en el estado fronterizo de Táchira, donde junto con su esposa venezolana visitaba a su cuñada, informó Reuters en ese momento.
Táchira, cercano a la frontera con Colombia, era en ese momento el foco de violentas protestas contra el gobierno, y las autoridades dijeron que Leininger estaba entre los 58 “mercenarios” extranjeros detenidos.
Su liberación se produjo cuando las relaciones entre los dos países han alcanzado su punto más bajo en años.
En enero, Nicolás Maduro rompió relaciones diplomáticas y políticas con Washington luego de que Estados Unidos reconociera al líder de la Asamblea Nacional, Juan Guaidó, como el presidente legítimo del país.
En su declaración, la familia de Leininger dijo que fue cambiado de prisión a prisión en Venezuela y que los funcionarios “se negaron a cumplir” con las órdenes de su liberación antes de quedar libre el jueves y trasladado a Miami.
“Este fue un viaje largo y a menudo desgarrador, pero estoy muy agradecida de haberme reunido con mi hijo”, dijo su madre Barbara Leininger, quien vive en Bloomington, Indiana.
Ni el Ministerio de Información de Venezuela ni la Fiscalía respondieron a las solicitudes de comentarios.
Hablando bajo la condición de anonimato, un funcionario del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos dijo la liberación se dio “con mucho retraso” y que Leininger no fue liberado después de que un juez venezolano le concedió la libertad condicional por buena conducta en mayo de 2018 o después de que un tribunal ordenó su excarcelación en noviembre pasado.
En declaraciones a Reuters en 2014, Barbara Leininger dijo que su hijo tenía “algunos problemas psicológicos” y había admitido que había disparado a un hombre en defensa propia durante lo que describió como un “altercado”."

Abril 27,2019.- La audiencia del diputado Juan Requesens fue diferida nuevamente este viernes en horas de la tarde y la nueva fecha será para el próximo lunes.
El abogado del parlamentario, Joel García, explicó el nuevo motivo de prolongar la sesión para otro día.
“El acto fue diferido para el lunes 29 a las 10:00 am. Hoy no pudimos ver a la juez Carol Padilla, no sabemos si fue por el tema de las sanciones. La razón de la postergación fue porque había ausencia de defensa de uno de los imputados”, comentó.
García indicó que los familiares de los imputados siguen angustiados y molestos por tanto tiempo de espera de la audiencia. “Los familiares están angustiados y molestos porque no se termina de decidir una audiencia que empezó en octubre y vamos ya cerrando abril, esto es una burla”, señaló
El abogado explicó que pese a los problemas del juicio Juan Requesens se mantiene fuerte a la espera de la decisión. “A pesar de ocho meses presos y tantos retardos con el juicio, el se mantiene moralmente muy fuerte. Él está convencido de su inocencia y está seguro que la libertad de Venezuela llegará pronto”, cerró."

Abril 27,2019.- Quedamos en encontrarnos a las 12 del mediodía en el Parque Mercedes, en el centro de Cúcuta, la ciudad colombiana más cercana a la frontera con Venezuela.
Llegué unos minutos tarde y la vi hablando con un hombre. Parecían tener un secreto.
Pero me había dicho que iba a ir a nuestra cita sola, así que me pareció extraño.
Empezó a caminar alejándose del parque. A poca distancia, el hombre la seguía.
Le envié un mensaje a través de WhatsApp para avisarle que la estaba esperando y preguntarle si todo estaba bien.
“Deme 10 minutos, que me llegó un cliente”, respondió Francesca (**) de inmediato.
Poco después entró en un local y la perdí de vista. El hombre iba detrás.
Entonces entendí. Y me hundí en el asiento del vehículo en el que la esperaba, pensando en su mensaje.
Ella propuso esa hora porque era el único momento del día (y la noche) en el que podía hacer una pausa para que conversáramos.
Pero de la nada apareció un cliente y no podía darse el lujo de rechazarlo.
El Parque Mercedes es un lugar conocido en la ciudad porque allí ofrecen sus servicios trabajadores sexuales."

Abril 27,2019.- “Íbamos demasiadas personas”, relató este viernes una mujer que sobrevivió al naufragio de una embarcación que trasladaba clandestinamente a migrantes venezolanos hacia Trinidad y Tobago, con saldo parcial de dos muertos y una veintena de desaparecidos.
Comerciante informal, Yusbreilys Merchán, de 22 años, narró que viajaba junto con otras 33 personas en un bote pesquero que partió el martes desde la localidad de Güiria, estado Sucre (noreste).
“Desde que salimos, uno de los motores estaba fallando, pero nosotras insistimos y seguimos el viaje. Cuando estábamos llegando por la Isla de Patos (a unos ocho km de la costa venezolana) se apagó un motor y empezó a entrar agua”, contó la joven en un audio difundido por su madre, Dalia Pino.
Rescatada por su esposo, quien no viajaba con ella, Merchán es una de las nueve personas que según el parlamentario Robert Alcalá han sido encontradas con vida desde el jueves.
Un video divulgado por la familia muestra cuando la joven, exhausta y envuelta en una cobija, es trasladada en una pequeña lancha de motor hacia Venezuela.
Según Merchán, cuando el peñero estaba a media hora de Trinidad y Tobago el capitán decidió volver a la Isla de Patos, donde ocurrió el accidente.
El barco se desplazaba con una carga mayor a la que podía soportar, según algunos testimonios.
“Se le empezó a meter agua por el peso. Eso era ola y ola que se le metía al bote”, rememoró. De acuerdo con su testimonio, en el barco había “maletas, bolsos y pimpinas (bidones) de gasolina”.
Fuentes oficiales han denunciado actividades de contrabando de combustible (prácticamente gratuito en Venezuela) y oro hacia Trinidad y Tobago. Organizaciones de derechos humanos también señalan casos de tráfico de personas.
– “Desesperación” –
Dos cadáveres han sido rescatados, informó este viernes Alcalá, diputado por el estado Sucre, a la AFP. Las víctimas son una joven de 16 años y un hombre adulto.
Según el legislador, los supervivientes fueron sacados del mar por pescadores que colaboran con las labores de búsqueda, en las que toman parte las guardias costeras de Venezuela y Trinidad y Tobago."

Abril 27,2019.- Cinco personas fueron asesinadas en diferentes sucesos acaecidos entre la noche del jueves y la madrugada de este viernes en la vecinas poblaciones venezolanas Ureña y La Fría, estado Táchira; hechos que además dejaron a un colombiano herido de bala. Así lo reseña laopinion.com.co
Según reportes policiales, en Ureña tres mujeres y un joven resultaron muertos por disparos. Se presume se trató de una acción coordinada por miembros del Ejército Popular de Liberación (Epl), también conocidos en la zona como los ‘Botas de caucho’, grupo al que las autoridades colombianas llaman Los Pelusos.
Al parecer, estos homicidios estarían relacionados con la venta de combustible de contrabando y el control territorial que este grupo pretende imponer en la zona. Dos de las féminas laboraban en una estación de gasolina.
La primera víctima fue identificada como Marcela Andrea Rodríguez Ríos, venezolana de 34 años, quien fue asesinada en el interior de su vivienda, en la calle principal del sector Las Comunas. Se conoció que dos sujetos llegaron a bordo de una motocicleta, el acompañante tocó a su puerta y solicitó la presencia Rodríguez, disparándole en reiteradas oportunidades.
Posteriormente se reportó el crimen de un joven, quien para el momento no portaba identificación, aunque extraoficialmente se pudo establecer que era conocido como Alex ‘El Paisa’.
Según información aportada por fuentes policiales, el fallecido fue perseguido por dos sujetos a bordo de una moto e intentó escapar escabulléndose al interior del Liceo Víctor Manuel Olivares del sector Plaza Vieja, de Ureña, pero fue alcanzado por sus agresores, quienes le dispararon sin mediar palabra, causándole la muerte de forma instantánea. En el lugar fueron recabados como evidencia diez cartuchos percutidos calibre 9 milímetros.
Noraima Yaneth Contreras Rodriguez, venezolana de 42 años y de profesión mototaxista, resultó asesinada en la calle 2 del Barrio La Pesa, también en Ureña, mientras se movilizaba por la zona a bordo de su vehículo de dos ruedas.
La mujer fue interceptada por sujetos en auto Aveo, de color plateado, del cual descendió uno de ellos y le disparó en varias oportunidades. Noraima Contreras era conocida como ‘La Grilla’ y gozaba del aprecio de la comunidad.
En esta población venezolana que limita con Cúcuta murió la noche del jueves Saida Yasmith Laguado Suarez, colombiana de 34 años, quien residía en la calle principal del sector San Martín, donde se encontraba en compañía de su bebé de dos años, cuando dos sujetos portando armas de fuego ingresaron a la vivienda y la obligaron a salir. Una vez en la calle le propinaron dos disparos que acabaron con su vida.
Enfrentamiento en La Fría
En medio de un presunto enfrentamiento con una comisión de la Guardia Nacional Bolivariana (GNB), en el sector Guarumito del municipio Ayacucho, zona norte del estado Táchira, perdió la vida la venezolana Karla Yuraima Fagundez González y resultó herido el colombiano Álvaro Rivera Quintero, de quienes se desconocen más datos.
Versiones extraoficiales apuntan que estas personas intentaban pasar un contrabando de carne de res hacia Colombia a través de una trocha, cuando fueron sorprendidos por los uniformados, produciéndose un intercambio de disparos.
El Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas (CICPC) realizó las correspondientes actuaciones técnicas en cada uno de los casos y dispuso el levantamiento de los cuerpos, que fueron trasladados hasta la Morgue del Hospital Central de San Cristóbal para la autopsia de ley."

Why did Jesus have Long Hair?,defendingthetruth.com,pensacola niceman (invalid@example.com),04-28-2019,2019,4,https://defendingthetruth.com/threads/why-did-jesus-have-long-hair.17683/,"pensacola niceman said: Fortunately, there are perfectly rational reasons for why the earliest known photographs of Jesus show him with girlishly elongated hairs. First, what you must understand is that after Jesus accepted himself as Lord and Savior, and became the first Christian - what do you think was the first thing he did? I'll give you a hint - it is the first thing the Holy Ghost whispers into your ear, the minute you get saved. That's right, Jesus got a haircut . The reason you see so many pictures of Jesus with long hair is because those pictures were drawn by unsaved people. Most of them were drawn by hell-bound, pasta-slurping , Mary-worshipping, hell-bound Catholics . Jesus had short hair . And He was always clean-shaven for the last three years of His life here on Earth. Can you imagine how painful it must have been for Him to pluck His nose hairs with a wooden tweezers? He did it for you. He did it because He loves you, not the way a homosexual loves another man, but the way a Father loves his son. And you must follow His example. If the false images of Jesus with long hair are a stumbling block for you, then just tear them out of your Bible. Not only as how a man could love another man in a 'sexual' relationship nor of how a man could love another woman in a 'sexual' relationship but how any could love another in a 'non sexual' relationship. Even including how a homosexual or a heterosexual could love another in a 'non sexual' relationship. The love 'shared' between those involved in a 'sexual' relationship is a different 'kind' of love that does not need too much clarification or examples as to why or how that love is different than the love shared between any in a 'non sexual' relationship. For some or many, the idea that 'love' can exist apart from sexual intimacy is an easy concept to grasp and to some or even many, the idea of how 'love' can exist apart from 'sexual' intimacy is a more difficult concept to grasp. However regardless of where in The World such places might be, there usually is always some 'holy/sacred' Scriptures to help the person understand. India has their 'holy/sacred' Scriptures. Arab countries has theirs. Asian countries has there. But there usually is some type of 'holy/sacred' Scripture in any and every 'land' where there is a 'people of a certain race/ethnicity/language', etc... But even without such 'Scriptures' being read and/or understood, 'parents' have a different kind of 'love' to their children than to their 'intimate Spouse'."

Thornberry's statements came on Friday after he announced his decision to withdraw U.S. support for the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.
“Donald Trump's statement on the Arms Trade Treaty is the final confirmation that he is not the Leader of the Free World, he never has been, and he does not deserve the honour of a State Visit to Britain,” Thornberry said in a tweet on Friday afternoon, referring to the president’s scheduled three-day visit to the country in June.
“He is nothing but a disgrace to his office and a threat to our world order,” she continued.

Trump said he would “never” ratify the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty while speaking at a National Rifle Association (NRA) convention in Indianapolis earlier on Friday.
“Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone,” Trump said at the time. “We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedoms.” ADVERTISEMENT
The president then held up a paperwork that instructed the Senate to halt the ratification process before the cheering audience members.
“I hope you’re happy,” Trump told the guns rights advocates. The NRA has long opposed the international arms-trade treaty, which was signed by former President Obama in 2013."

It has long been tradition for championship winning teams to meet with the president at the White House. Under Donald Trump, however, that tradition has changed. The 2017 Golden State Warriors were the first team to refuse to visit with the president.

The University of Virginia captured the Men’s NCAA basketball championship in March of 2019. The Cavaliers announced on Friday that they will be the latest championship team to refuse an invitation from President Trump.
Coach Tony Bennett wrote on the UVA Twitter feed, “We have received inquiries about a visit to the White House. With several players either pursuing pro opportunities or moving on from UVA, it would be difficult, if not impossible to get everyone back together. We would have to respectfully decline an invitation.”
Other members of the Cavaliers basketball team were not quite as diplomatic as Coach Bennett. According to Politico, future NBA lottery pick, De’Andre Hunter tweeted, “No thanks Trump.”
While the University of Virginia declining the invitation may sting Trump, it certainly isn’t as harsh as the Warriors rejection. When Golden State came to Washington DC to play the Wizards, they met with Barack Obama rather than the current president.
Warrior’s superstar Stephen Curry said of Trump in a 2017 essay, “If there’s anything I’ve learned this year, it’s that all the noise we keep hearing—it’s not an accident. We’re hearing that noise because there are real people out there, facing real issues, and real inequalities, some in ways like never before. In 2017, in America, silence is no longer an option.”

This was going to be a column on what looks to me like softening Republican support for Donald Trump. Instead it’s going to be about an aspect of one of the reasons Trump should be impeached. I will write that other column, but not today.
Trump stokes hatred toward most Americans. He has transformed hate crimes to domestic acts of terrorism and therefore is derelict in his duties. That is impeachable.
Many of us, me included, have focused on the Trump campaign’s willingness to take help from a hostile foreign power to cheat its way to the White House. This past week, there was reporting that former Secretary of Homeland security was ordered not to mention Russia’s cyber-attack on our democracy because that reality would hurt Donald Trump’s fragile ego.
And if we’re going to talk about snowflakes, let’s talk about the privileged white male in the White House who equates constructive criticism, questions or simple difference of opinion with hate of him. For the record, I don’t hate you, as a human being. I hate the ideas you defend. There is a volume of difference between hating the act and hating the person, as I’m certain any preacher of any religion will explain to you.
No, Mr. Trump hate is when you grab your gun, go to a place of worship and kill people in prayer. Hate is when you weaponize a car to strike silent a women because she had the courage to condemn the ideas that caused a World War. Hate is what makes it possible to back a serial adulterer while telling the monagomous gay man to repent. Hate is what makes it possible to throw rolls of paper towels at survivors of natural disaster in one part of the country, while assuring survivors of natural disaster in a maga part of the country they’ll get all the help and support they need.
You are the personification of hate and you have used it as a weapon against Americans, with help from the one person you consistently praise: Vladimir Putin.
The fact that, finally, after the many hate crimes inspired by your rhetoric, even you recognize that the Poway Synagogue shooting was a hate crime, doesn’t absolve you from the role you had in making that crime possible.
Guess what. I don’t give a damn if Trump’s ego is too fragile to handle the deadly reality that his presidency is pandering to white supremacists, neo-Nazis and anti-Semites.
Mr. Trump, you whine about how people are out to get you! Bullsh*t! Jews know what living under siege is really like because we are the first to be scapegoated by demagogues like you. We’re the targets in 50% of all the hate crimes inspired by the ideas you defend.
The Palestinian people who are treated by Israel’s Netanyahu similarly to the way you treat: Americans who are black, brown, Muslim, opponents of hate, members of the free press, Democrats, women who think and don’t need to make themselves look Aryan to feel good about themselves and pretty much anyone who disagrees with you.
Mr. Trump, you chose to use the presidency to defend, to DEFEND, the ideas people that make mass shootings at Synagogues more frequent. This is the second one this year! Hate crimes have soared since you started your moronic maga campaign and Jews were the targets in 50% of those hate crimes. And no, it’s not going to be normalized! Not while I’m breathing!
No, the answer is NOT more guns! It is re-funding the organizations that monitor hate, and who help people who hate return to sanity. It’s about recognizing that a president who promotes hatred is a threat to our national security – and especially a threat to innocents who are routinely targeted by those “very fine people” Mr. Trump actively, passionately, and frequently defends.
This is why 2020 is a national identity election. Those who celebrate the latest mass shooting at a Synagogue will undoubtedly vote for Mr. Trump. Most of us will be looking for someone who embraces the idea that a president must be president to everyone in America. Adalia Woodbury

"Tough times ahead in flood-stricken Quebec, premier warns",www.nationalnewswatch.com,The Canadian Press,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/27/more-rain-forecast-for-flood-weary-communities-in-ontario-quebec-n-b/,"By The Canadian Press — Apr 27 2019
MONTREAL — Quebec's premier warned Saturday of tough times ahead in parts of the flood-stricken province even as waters began to recede in some regions.
The water levels in the corridor along the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers between Montreal and the boundary with Ontario aren't expected to peak before Monday or Tuesday, Francois Legault told reporters after being briefed by officials with the province's hydro utility.
""What I would tell flood victims is have courage,"" Legault said. ""We have another few days that will be difficult. Another few days and we'll get there.""
By Saturday afternoon, 3,085 homes across the province were flooded, 2,783 houses were surrounded by water and 2,003 people had been forced from their homes, according to Quebec officials.
Legault said the swollen rivers south of Quebec City that flooded the Beauce region in mid-April are receding.
Montreal, Ottawa and many smaller communities across the expansive flood zone have declared states of emergency, prompting the federal government to deploy hundreds of soldiers to help with sandbagging and other relief operations.
There were roughly 1,000 soldiers in Quebec on Saturday. Legault said he spoke with about seven mayors of hard-hit areas who told him, ""for now we have enough arms.""
Quebec's Public Security Minister Genevieve Guilbault said Saturday about 50 landslides have been reported across the province.
Rising river levels around the Montreal area prompted authorities to indefinitely close the busy Galipeault Bridge linking the city's western tip with Ile-Perrot. Heavy rain also forced the closure of two smaller bridges in the Montreal region.
Across the river off Montreal's north shore is Ile-Bizard, where city authorities parked three snowblowers by the water's edge. Instead of grinding snow and ice, the machines are sucking in water that's leaked through the sandbagged wall and are blowing it back into the river.
Gerald Chouinard, whose house is located a few feet from the river, said the city has been doing a great job this year.
""They put up a wall of sandbags that stretches almost a kilometre,"" he said, pointing down the road.
Chouinard boarded up his basement windows and stacked sandbags around the doors to the home. The river has nearly reached 2017 levels, he said, when more than 100 centimetres of water surrounded the house.
Chouinard said he expects the water to rise more Saturday night and continue rising over the weekend.
""We are preparing for the worst,"" he said. ""Worse than the worst.""
A close eye is also being kept on a hydroelectric dam on a tributary of the Ottawa River between Ottawa and Montreal that's at risk of failing. Water at the Chute-Bell dam has reached levels expected to occur every 1,000 years, but Hydro-Quebec said it's confident the structure is solid.
Legault said the situation at the dam ""is critical"" but added that Hydro-Quebec believes the structure will hold.
As well, water levels around the capital are expected to rise half-a-metre higher than they did during a 2017 flood that was thought to have been a once-in-a-century event.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau picked up a shovel Saturday to lend a hand with sandbagging efforts, as he and his two sons visited a west-end Ottawa community hit hard by rising floodwaters.
Trudeau was briefed by officials in charge of the fight against the flood at a community centre before filling sandbags and thanking those who came to the aid of local residents.
Officials in Ottawa, where the military has stationed several hundred troops, were calling Saturday for more volunteers to help in flood zones, and warned that dealing with the water's damage would soon become a long-term project.
""We need people to sustain our efforts for multiple weeks,"" said city manager Steve Kanellakos. ""It just doesn't end when the water peaks.""
A morning report from the board that monitors levels in the Ottawa River said that near Constance Bay, water levels were just shy of their 2017 peak and are forecast to rise another 47 centimetres.
At a measuring spot near Parliament Hill later in the afternoon, where paths and parking lots along the river were already underwater, the waters inched above their levels in 2017 with the board forecasting a rise of another 75 centimetres before water levels peak on May 1.
On Saturday, after being flooded out in 2017, Don Haines and friends were sandbagging his small home beside the Ottawa River again, and emptying its contents in anticipation of further flooding. Haines said regardless of whether he is flooded out again this year he will likely rebuild the home where he has lived for 20 years.
""My long-term plan is probably going to be to knock it flat and rebuild — higher,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the mayor of a small town in central Ontario's cottage country said the late-season snow is a welcome sight as it acts as a ""sponge"" for rising floodwaters that now mark a ""historical event.""
Mayor Graydon Smith said in a news conference Saturday that water levels in several areas of Bracebridge were up slightly due to rain Friday, but snow may help slow the flow into lakes, rivers and streams.
In southern New Brunswick, a bit of relief is in sight for flood-weary residents, with the latest forecast calling for waters to slowly recede in most areas over the next five days.
Geoffrey Downey, a spokesman for New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization, said while it rained across much of the province Saturday, officials aren't expecting a lot of precipitation.
He said the five-day flood forecast is for the Saint John River to be below flood stage in Fredericton, and down to flood stage in Maugerville, Oak Point and Saint John, by Thursday.

As I stood in the wing of the world-famous, historic Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York, warming up my ankles and trying to ease the thumping of my electrified heartbeat, it struck me that after more than 20 years of performing — and this was my third time on the Apollo stage — I still experienced an intense, thrilling rush of pre-performance anxiety. It was a day shy of New Year’s Eve and the sixth day of Kwanzaa, known as Kuumba (creativity). I felt the entirety of the legacy of the magical theater and the groundbreaking artists and entertainers who had graced its legendary stage before me. Six other dancers and I were opening the show with a dance created almost 10 years earlier, in honor of the inauguration of America’s first black president. That dance had taken on new meaning for me, one year into Donald Trump’s presidency.
When the music began, I waited two counts of eight, took one final deep breath and glided onto the stage for my first entrance. I’m not sure if I was aware at that moment that this would be my final performance as a professional dancer. But I remember, with my mom in the audience — I always danced better knowing she was there watching — that I performed with passion, with gratitude and, for the first time, with a sense of total liberation in my movement and in my body, just as it was. Advertisement:
Becoming a professional dancer meant fulfilling a dream I had worked for since early childhood. Dance consumed my life for 25 years. I started training at age three in a studio in Boston around the corner from my home, and it took me at least 10 years to get any good. Around that time, I also began to hear that while I was talented, my body would not be welcomed in the “real dance world.”
“Just lose a little weight here,” a dance director would say while digging fingers into the fullness of my hips.
“It’s really just your thighs that are the problem.”
“I need you to come down in your weight.”
“We’re concerned that you’re not going to be able to fit into the costume.”
“You will not be taken seriously looking like this.”
This unrelenting scrutiny of my body and my passion for dance have always coexisted. Throughout the years, colleagues, teachers, professors, directors, and choreographers found innovative ways — never subtle and always public — to tell me why my curvy, thick frame was far from ideal for the career I had chosen. Advertisement:
What do you when the thing you love most doesn’t love you back? If dance loathed my body so vocally, it often felt like it loathed me, too. How do you even begin to disentangle the rejection of your body from your being?
For many years, though, I believed I could push through the criticism and break the prescribed mold of what a dancer should look like. I even felt it was my duty to do so, because I did not believe in that myth. I wasn’t a ballerina, though I was a concert dancer, and the idea that dancers had to be exclusively tall and thin always felt like an antiquated concept of gatekeeping that was built around western ideals of beauty.
It was my mom who taught me early on to love my body; that the “tree trunk legs” we inherited were part of our family lore, stemming back to my Great Grandmother, after whom I was named, and who on her first day in the United States — after fleeing Eastern Europe for political reasons — and speaking not a word of English, attended a demonstration to protest the wrongful conviction of two radicals. As the daughter of activists, educators and union organizers, I was reminded, especially when the scrutiny of my body become unbearable, that our tree trunk legs allowed us to stand strong and grounded against injustice.
My parents were also intentional from the beginning about putting me in dance spaces that were accessible and multiracial. I wasn’t enrolled at Boston Ballet, Boston’s premier ballet school. I attended a local studio, Uptown Dance Center. I performed for several years in a production called “Urban Nutcracker,” which reimagined the traditional ballet with a diverse cast and dance styles. I attended a public performing arts high school as a dance major, where the dance education centered on pioneers like Arthur Mitchell, Carmen de Lavallade, Katherine Dunham and Alvin Ailey, all of whom transformed and diversified the dance world. For me, dance became more than just a passion and an outlet for expression — it became a lens through which I examined history and inequality. Advertisement:
When it came time to audition for college dance programs, I knew I had to be thoughtful about where I applied because of my body. The top conservatories were out. I instead opted for state schools and liberal arts colleges that I thought might be more accepting of my frame. While I did get into some amazing programs and ultimately had a wonderful experience as a dance major, the disparagement around my body only intensified in college.
Several weeks into my first semester, my dance professor set up meetings with students to discuss their participation and progress in his class. This professor embodied the tough love stereotype of dance teachers, and walked a fine line between being critical and straight up nasty. But I was used to that teaching method; besides, I Iiked him and his class. Once inside his small office, he confirmed that I was excelling. Many of my classmates had come from ballet backgrounds or competition dance schools and this was their first exposure to traditional modern dance, a technique that I had been immersed in for four years in high school. So I was confident in the fundamentals. But our conversation did not stay positive for long. He segued within minutes to the roadblock of my body, suggesting that after three hours of dance class every morning I should spend some time in the gym. “Dance class is not enough for some of us,” he cautioned me.
In college, every diet I had ever heard of (and some I hadn’t) was suggested to me under the guise of “health.” The “Special K diet,” where you eat only Special K products — which, of course, is definitely not a ploy by the brand to sell cereal in bulk — was especially popular among the dancers; another was the rumor that you could survive solely off of popcorn and red wine. Suggestions like these were offered to me unsolicited, as if I wasn’t already dancing between three and nine hours every day, at least five days a week; because my thighs resembled ice cream cones as opposed to dainty champagne flutes, that must mean I wasn’t healthy or in shape. I know that when I left the studio, my body was allowed to be invisible in ways many others' are not. Back then, however, the lines between the dance world and the rest of my life were barely discernible, if they existed at all. Advertisement:
In my senior year, I auditioned for a prominent dance company in Colorado and was admitted to its second company — it’s like an internship or fellowship — where a dancer typically proves their work ethic and skills for a year. But I was fortunate to perform with the main company often, until eventually I was promoted to apprentice, which allowed me to work with them exclusively.
But the “real dance world” proved to be much worse than anything I had endured before. When I think back to that time in Colorado, dancing professionally with one of the foremost modern dance companies in the country, more than anything I remember how my body was degraded. When it came to the critiques, the facade of health was abandoned; in general, it felt like unhealthy eating habits or outright disordered eating were even celebrated. A dancer’s discipline — to be able to skip lunch, or eat nothing but a grapefruit — was considered admirable, even brag-worthy. Dancers also wore the skimpiest dance clothes I had ever seen to class, sometimes sporting only undergarments or swimwear. In a room surrounded by mirrors, it seemed that every curve and indentation of their protruding bones were hypervisible, as was the softness of my body. When I came down with the flu and missed several crucial days of the season, the rehearsal director beamed at my return, marveling loudly, “You look skinnier!” This was the highest compliment.
One of the most humiliating moments for me — a memory that is permanently cemented into my consciousness — happened while preparing for our annual holiday show. A company employee sat in the center of the room handing out costumes for the different roles. When I asked for mine — for a role that I had been told I was in the running for — she declared, an entire packed room listening in, that the dance director thought I was too big to fit into the costume. It was so brazen, so unprofessional, I felt like her intention was to finally break me down. I was stunned, trying to ignore the stares of pity from my colleagues. Advertisement:
When I met with the dance director to express my horror at my public shaming, I remember asserting to her, through tears — my hands resting on my tree trunk thighs — that “I don’t see what you see when I look in the mirror.” She was not moved.
The issue of costume fitting had already been established as a defining theme for me at that company. Before one of my first major performances, the costume I was meant to wear turned out to be unbelievably skimpy — designed to cover private areas and nothing else. Again I was cast tentatively, pending how I would look in the costume. I fit into it fine and even felt confident in how I looked in it. I still wasn’t thin, but my body was toned and strong like any other professional dancer’s. (I was dancing around eight hours a day, between five and six days a week at this point.) I modeled the costume first for the company veteran who often ran rehearsals, and then he summoned the official rehearsal director, who then called the company director over to offer a third round of approval, all of whose permission I apparently needed to secure before I was allowed to appear on stage. And I was supposed to be grateful to them for even giving me a shot. After all, I had been to auditions before where directors wouldn’t even allow me to dance, dismissing me immediately and suggesting I lose weight if I hoped to ever be considered.
When I moved to New York City to attend graduate school, I joined a new dance company. Things did improve, in no small part because I suffered an even greater trauma than the trauma of daring to dance in the wrong body and had, as a byproduct of the healing process, lost some weight. It didn’t register to me then that the weight loss is why I was initially so welcomed into the new company. I actually believed that I had finally found a dance home that accepted me. I remember feeling swindled once I returned to my normal, healthy weight and so did the familiar critiques. After more than 15 years of hearing I was all wrong for the stage, I began to finally reach my limit.
The moments of public shame I endured in order to dance began to feel as frequent as the moments of joy . I started to question the hour and a half train rides I took several nights a week to get to rehearsals, as feelings of anger, frustration and stress began to crowd out any enjoyment. Advertisement:
“What makes thick thighs less beautiful? What makes fuller arms less graceful cutting through space?” I wanted to scream at my dance director, who would scan my body up and down with such deep-seated disappointment. In some ways, I am still searching for those answers.
I may not have known then that the December night at the Apollo would be my final performance, but I did know that this dance company would be my last. I knew I could not bring myself to suffer through any more auditions or one more scrutinizing gaze as some stranger assessed my body’s worth according to its relative thinness. Somewhere along the way I lost the desire to fight; or perhaps, every squeeze of my thighs and hips and triceps without my consent, a palpable reminder of the weight I carried, had chipped it away over the years, little by little.
By refusing to conform to the dance world's body standards, sometimes I feel like I put myself in another cage. How far could I have gone if I had listened to what every teacher and choreographer had warned me about since I was 12? That’s something I have to live with for the rest of my life. To this day, I still can’t figure out if I feel more free when my body is not constantly policed or when I’m dancing. It pains me to know that I was forced to choose between the two.
Days ago I uncovered my performance bag from deep underneath my bed. It still held dancer essentials: an extra pair of false eyelashes and heavy stage makeup, skin-toned undergarments, a pair of black shorts, a leotard, and my ballet slippers. I rubbed my fingers over the canvas of the light brown shoe, soft and familiar. I discarded everything else, but those I kept, just in case. Advertisement:
These days I confine my dancing to the kitchen, where I’ll sometimes do an expedited ballet barre while I’m heating lunch in the microwave or test out a pirouette on my way to the fridge. I haven’t been able to bring myself to take a formal dance class again. Not yet; I'm still in mourning. But what level is right for a former professional dancer whose foot calluses are almost completely faded, who is witnessing the slow evaporation of her flexibility like ice cubes in a glass on a hot day?
I’m still trying to figure out who I am if I am not a dancer. The hardest thing for me to grapple with is the fact that there are friends and coworkers who’ve come into my life in the last year and who know nothing about my former life, what had felt like my entire identity.
Writing has been able to fill the self-expression void for me, but my body still craves movement. On the rare occasions when I do go out dancing with friends, I’ll sometimes get that feeling — that swell in my chest and fluttering in my abdomen when the tempo of the music and my internal rhythm collide — that sense of liberation and catharsis that I’ve only ever experienced in motion.
One day, soon, I hope to find the strength to return to the studio. I want to feel again the smoothness of the marley floor beneath my bare feet. When I take my place and look at myself in the mirror, and see my tree trunk legs reflecting back at me, I will be reminded only of my resilience and power. Advertisement:"

The New Lovers series is devoted to publishing new works of erotica that explore the complexities bedevilling contemporary life, culture, and art today. Reprinted with permission from Badlands. On the night of her 30th birthday, Lucy's best friend Nicholas gives her just what she's always wanted — the chance to watch him and his handsome boyfriend James get it on in the flesh. But what happens when Nicholas' gift merely whets her appetite? When a feast for the eyes leaves her heart and body famished, how far will Lucy go to satisfy her hunger? And what will it mean for their friendship? <br> Nicholas was the only gay man I’d ever fallen in love with. The beginning of our friendship was simple and random. I’d left my apartment one morning after running out of coffee the previous day and gone down to the cafe on the corner for my morning fix. The wait was long and every table was full, but there was one empty chair opposite an attractive young man in the corner. I shuffled through, careful not to spill the boiling hot beverage on myself, before I stood bleary-eyed at the edge of his table.
“Would you mind?” I asked while pulling back the chair, inadvertently releasing a high pitched squeal as it scraped across the tile floor.
He looked up briefly, a small, quick smile on his full lips. “No, not at all,” he said pleasantly before he went back to his book, leaving me to sit in peace.
We were twenty-three then; and now, seven years later, I was waiting at home for him and his boyfriend, James, to arrive. It was my thirtieth birthday and they had promised a night of dinner and dancing at our favorite club. “A night of debauchery and hedonism” had been Nicholas’s exact words, and I was particularly look...

Anti-Gunners Call For Gun Control Laws Following Poway Synagogue Shooting But This Is What They're Getting Wrong,townhall.com,Beth Baumann,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bethbaumann/2019/04/27/anti-gunners-call-for-gun-control-laws-following-poway-synagogue-shooting-but-thi-n2545498,"Anti-Gunners Call For Gun Control Laws Following Poway Synagogue Shooting But This Is What They're Getting Wrong Share Share Tweet Source: AP Photo/Denis Poroy
Every time some sort of mass shooting occurs, anti-gunners rush to call for stricter gun control laws. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department and the FBI are still investigating the shooting that took place earlier today at the Chabad of Poway Synagogue, just outside of San Diego. We don't even know all of the facts yet, but from what we do know, gun control laws anti-gunners want to push are either already on the books or would have made no difference.
Here are some of the gun control calls (so far): The Poway mayor said today’s shooting at a synagogue was a hate crime. Hatred and lax gun laws are a deadly combination. Ending gun violence in America - like in Pittsburgh and Poway - will take more than empty words: we need action. pic.twitter.com/4t4NoF0Di8 — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) April 27, 2019 Another horrific shooting at a place of worship, today at the Poway Synagogue in San Diego County. We must work every day to eradicate all forms of hatred and bigotry, and take serious action to protect Americans from gun violence. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 27, 2019 Yet again a place of worship is the target of senseless gun violence and hate. Anti-Semitism is real in this country and we must not be silent - enough is enough. My heart aches for the Chabad of Poway synagogue and the Jewish community. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) April 27, 2019 Houses of worship are supposed to be safe havens in our communities. However, with unrestricted weaponry in America, they are no longer. Mourning those lost today in Poway, CA and praying for those who have been injured. We will honor them with action. — Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) April 27, 2019 We have a hate problem in America. We have a gun problem in America. It’s time to look ourselves in the mirror and fix both. https://t.co/tQLszrKW7I — Seth Moulton (@sethmoulton) April 27, 2019 Heartbroken to hear of the San Diego synagogue shooting, particularly so on this final day of Passover.We have a responsibility to love + protect our neighbors.The longer the Senate delays holding a vote on #HR8 , the more we put Americans at risk. https://t.co/ef9FURMFQ5 — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 27, 2019
This is what we know, as of now:
The gunman is 19-years-old and he used an AR-15 style platform. We have no idea how many rounds he used, how many rounds his rifle held or how he obtained the firearm.
Former California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) last year signed a bill that raised the age to purchase a long gun from 18 to 21. The gunman is 19, meaning he obtained the firearm illegally. Remember: the situation is fluid and we still don't know if he stole the gun, bought it off the black market or if it was a straw purchase.
The bill Ocasio-Cortez references, HR 8, would establish ""universal background checks,"" meaning every firearm transaction would require a background check. Private party transfers (PPTs), which typically takes place between family and friends, would also require that background check. The gunman would not be allowed to legally have this long gun because he is under 21, even if he obtained it through a PPT. The only exception California makes for 18 to 20-year-olds to own firearms is if he or she is in the Armed Forces or a member of law enforcement. Recommended On Reparations: Part I John C. Goodman
Others continue to say an AR-15 is an ""assault rifle,"" which is not the case. AR stands for ""Armalite Rifle,"" the company that originally made the firearm. An ""assault rifle"" is a firearm that is fully automatic, meaning it can fire every round in the magazine with a single trigger pull. An AR-15 is a semi-automatic, meaning one round fires for every pull of the trigger.
Definitions matter here.
Fully automatic firearms are illegal. Semi-autos are not.
California has some of the most stringent gun control laws on the books and this attack still happened, just like the attack in San Bernardino took place. What does that tell you about things? Those with hate in their heart and the desire to commit a heinous crime don't care if something is illegal. "
The real reason NRA leaders are suddenly eating each other alive - Palmer Report,www.palmerreport.com,Bill Palmer,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/nra-eating-alive-leaders/17617/,"The real reason NRA leaders are suddenly eating each other alive Bill Palmer | 8:08 pm EDT April 27, 2019 Line
Yesterday, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre publicly claimed that NRA President Oliver North and NRA leaders were attempting to force him out of the organization. This came even as North and others asserted that they’d caught LaPierre wasting excessive amounts of NRA money on things like clothing. Today, North announced that he won’t be seeking reelection, due to LaPierre. This kind of brinksmanship is surreal, but there’s good reason for it.
It’s not that Oliver North suddenly cares if Wayne LaPierre is dipping into the NRA’s till. North is a notorious criminal in his own right, and the NRA is one big con game aimed at dishonestly scaring people into buying more guns. No one who cares about ethics joins the leadership of a group like the NRA. But there are two huge storylines playing out right now with regard to the NRA’s fate.
This week we finally saw Russian spy Maria Butina sentenced to prison. This means that the bulk of her cooperation work with the government is complete, including whatever she gave up on the NRA’s financial ties to Russia, or the NRA’s crimes in general. This means the NRA has to worry that the FBI could crack down on it at any time. And even if corrupt Attorney General William Barr manages to stop that federal probe, NBC News reported yesterday that the New York Attorney General is preparing to investigate the NRA for being a phony nonprofit – and there’s nothing that Barr or Donald Trump can do to stand in the way of that probe.
It’s clear that someone or something is going down here. Maybe the entire NRA will be forced to go under. Perhaps all of its current leaders will end up being taken down. Or maybe just one NRA leader will end up taking the criminal rap for the organization’s antics. The likes of Oliver North and Wayne LaPierre each appear to believe that if they can expose the other guy’s crimes, it’ll be the other guy who takes the fall when the authorities move in. That’s not really how things work, of course, but these folks are desperate enough to try taking each other down as a last ditch effort to save themselves. "
Over 1000 Quarantined As Measles Spreads Across LA Universities | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-27/over-1000-quarantined-measles-spreads-across-la-universities,"0 SHARES
The number of measles cases registered four months into 2019 has surpassed the count of cases from last decade , according to new numbers from the CDC. Already 2019 is the highest year for measles since 2000 when the disease was eradicated domestically. All new cases since the eradication declaration have come from foreign travelers. The number of measles cases in the U.S. has climbed to nearly 700 this year, including five in Los Angeles County and 38 altogether in California.
You will find more infographics at Statista
As Statista's Sarah Feldman notes , 2014 was a particularly bad year for measles in the U.S. when the anti-vaccine movement combined with air travel to create a surge in measles cases domestically. An Amish missionary who visited the Philippines caused nearly half of the registered cases in that year to spread throughout the mostly unvaccinated community. Another significant outbreak at Disneyland in California that same year pushed the number of cases up even higher. This year many measles outbreaks across the country are occurring in unvaccinated communities.
Additionally Statista's Martin Armstrong reports that in what the chief of the UK's National Health Service has described as a “growing public health time-bomb” , new figures from UNICEF reveal that over the last eight years, more than half a million children in the UK are at risk of measles due to not receiving their first dose of the free vaccine. As this infographic shows, the UK has the third highest number among high-income countries. France is in second place with 608,000 and the U.S., currently experiencing a measles resurgence , is in first place with over 2.5 million unvaccinated children.

Health officials at a news conference repeatedly urged people who haven’t been exposed to measles to get vaccinated, saying the vaccine is safe and effective.
“Ninety percent of people who are not immunized or haven’t had measles before, when they’re exposed to measles are likely to get measles,” LA county’s public health director, Dr. Barbara Ferrer said.
And the situation is escalating with AP now reporting that more than 1,000 students and staff members at two Los Angeles universities were quarantined on campus or sent home this week in one of the most sweeping efforts yet by public health authorities to contain the spread of measles in the U.S., where cases have reached a 25-year high .
The action at the University of University of California, Los Angeles, and California State University, Los Angeles - which together have more than 65,000 students - reflected the seriousness with which public health officials are taking the nation’s outbreak.
“Measles actually kills people, so we have to take that really seriously,” said Dr. Armand Dorian, chief medical officer at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital.
Those under the quarantine were instructed to stay at home and avoid contact with others. They also were barred from traveling by public transportation, including planes, trains, buses or taxis. If they must travel for an emergency, they were told to notify public health officials first.
“This is a legally binding order,” the county’s public health director, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, told reporters.
Anyone who violates it could be prosecuted, she said, but added that it appears everyone is cooperating so far. She didn’t describe what penalties those who don’t could face but we note that New York City has slapped 12 people with civil summonses who it says were not complying with a mandatory measles vaccination order
Those covered by the quarantine were singled out based on their possible exposure to either an infected UCLA student who had attended classes in two buildings on three days earlier this month, or a person with measles who visited a Cal State-LA library on April 11, officials said.
Those possibly exposed at Cal State-LA were located by tracking the records of people working in the library and those who logged on to its computers during the four hours the infected student was there.
On Friday, President Donald Trump urged everyone to get vaccinated. Tags "

The New York Times is one of the the many Liberal Media Hate Supremacist News Groups.
Of course the Left support Anti-Semistism because they despise the Jewish religion just like they do with Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and others. These religions Scriptures condemn abortion, transgender, and others.
While the Left, despises Muslims due to their strong views against LGBT etc Community, Abortion, Leftist Feminism, and other Liberal Agendas, Ideas, and Lifestyles. The Left keeps quiet about that because they fear the Muslims would murder or injure them if they spoke out and protest against Muslims for their strong opposition against liberal agendas, ideas, and lifestyle that goes against Islam and Muslim practices.
Notice the New York Times does not have cartoons mocking Prophet Mohammed and Islam because they know Muslims would attack back doing terrorism against them."

නොයෙක් ප්‍රදේශ වලින් පුපුරන ද්‍රව්‍ය සොයා ගන්නා විට දැනෙන්නේ බියකි. මෙය තවමත් ඉවර නැත. නිවසින් එලියට යන්නට බයෙන් සිටිමි. ඒ අතර මුස්ලිම් ප්‍රජාව නොයෙක් හිංසා පීඩා වලට ලක්වී ඇති සැටි අසන දකින විට, අද්නාන්ට හෝ හුසෙයිෆාට කරදරයක් වෙයි යැයි හිතෙද්දී දැනෙන්නේ ඊට වඩා බියකි.
ඉස්ලාම් දහම සහ ත්‍රස්තවාදය අතර සත්‍ය සම්බන්ධයක් නැති බව අප පළමුවෙන්ම පිළිගත යුතුය. ගිය මාසයේ පර්යේෂණයකට අම්පාරට ගිය විය එහිදී හමුවුන සිංහල ප්‍රජාව, යුධ සමය සිහි කරමින් අපට කීවේ ඒ කාලයේ සිතුවේ කොටි කියන්නේ දමිල බවත් දමිල කියන්නේ කොටි බවත්, වෙනස දැනගත්තේ මෑතකදී බවත්ය. වයසක ආච්චිලාගේ සීයලාගේ මුවග තවමත් වචන දෙක පැටලේ. මෙවරත් අප ඉස්ලාම් දහම සහ ත්‍රස්තවාදය පටලවා ගත්තොත්, මුස්ලිම්, ක්‍රිස්තියානි, බෞද්ධ අප සැමම පරාජිතයන් වන්නේය.
මේ ත්‍රස්තවාදයෙන් ගැලවීමට නම් අපට දීර්ඝකාලීන ප්‍රතිපත්ති සහ වැඩ පිළිවෙලක් අවශ්‍ය ය. ආගම්, ජාති හෝ ලිංගය මත වර්ග කල අධ්‍යාපනය අවසන් කිරීමට කාලය පැමිණ ඇත. අම්පාරේ පරීක්ෂණය කරන විට පෙනුණේ මිශ්‍ර ගම්මාන වල ජාතිවාදය, ආගම්වාදය, මෙන්ම අන්තවාදය ද නැති බවයි. සංහිඳියාව සඳහා ප්‍රතිපත්ති පමණක් සෑහෙන්නේ නැත. විවිධ වූ පසුබිම් වලින් පැමිණෙන දරුවන්ට සෙල්ලම් කිරීමට අවස්ථාව සකසා දීම ඒ සඳහා අත්‍යාවශ වේ. අවිඥා අඳුරේ වැඩුන වැඩිහිටියන්ට සංහිඳියාව ඉගැන්වීම කිසිවෙක්ට කළ නොහැක්කකි.
සමානාත්මතාවය මූලික කර ගත ආණ්ඩුක්‍රම ව්‍යවස්ථාවක් අපට අවශ්‍ය වන්නේය. ආණ්ඩුක්‍රම ව්‍යවස්ථාවේ 16 වන වගන්තිය හරහා බල ගැන්වී ඇති මුස්ලිම් නීතිය නිසා මුස්ලිම් කාන්තාවන්ට සිදු වන අසාධාරණය ඉදිරියේ අප අහක බලන්නේ අප හිත ඇතුලෙන් ඔවුන් වෙනස්කොට සලකන නිසා නොවේ ද?
ඉන්ධන මුදලින් වැජඹෙන සවුදි ග්‍රහණයෙන් මිදීමට නම් සූර්ය බලයෙන් විදුලිය උත්පාදනය කිරීමත්, විදුලිබලයෙන් දුවන වාහන මිලදීගැනීමට ජනතාව පෙළඹවීමත් අවශ්‍ය නොවන්නේ ද?
කල්පනාකාරීව තීරණ ගත යුතු කාලයක් එළැඹ ඇත. මේ විපත හරහා හිස ඔසවන ඒකාධිපතිවාදය, නැගී එන ජාතිවාදයට, ආගම්වාදයට මෙන්ම අන්තවාදයට ද විසඳුමක් නොවනවා ඇති බව නම් නොඅනුමානය.
