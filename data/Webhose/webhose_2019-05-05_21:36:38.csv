US military admits two civilian deaths in Somalia airstrikes,thehill.com,rkheel@thehill.com (Rebecca Kheel),04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/437558-us-military-admits-two-civilian-deaths-in-somalia-airstrikes,"US military admits two civilian deaths in Somalia airstrikes By Rebecca Kheel - 04/05/19 11:26 AM EDT
U.S. Africa Command (Africom) is acknowledging for the first time its airstrikes in Somalia have killed civilians.
In a Friday statement, Africom said two civilians were killed in an April 1, 2018, airstrike.
“Credibility, transparency and accountability are fundamental to military operations,"" Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, commander of Africom, said in a statement. ""It is critically important that people understand we adhere to exacting standards and when we fall short, we acknowledge shortcomings and take appropriate action."" ADVERTISEMENT
Until Friday, Africom had insisted its airstrikes in Somalia have killed no civilians. The military conducted 28 airstrikes in Somalia so far this year, 47 in 2018 and 35 in 2017.
The military doubled down on its assertion of no civilian casualties as recently as last month after Amnesty International released a report alleging 14 civilians have been killed over the last two years.
But on Friday, Africom said a commander-ordered review of airstrikes since 2017 discovered the two previously unreported deaths.
The strike at issue was not one of the ones Amnesty International flagged, the statement said.
The April 2018 airstrike happened near El Burr, Somalia, and also killed four militants from the al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabaab, according to the statement.
Africom said an internal review the same month of the strike found credible evidence that two civilians were killed. But according to Friday’s statement, that information was never properly reported to Africom headquarters, leading to commanders repeatedly erroneously telling lawmakers and the media that there have been zero civilian casualties in U.S. military operations in Africa.
Africom said it believes the civilian deaths were an “isolated occurrence,” but that the reporting issue is being addressed.
""Airstrike assessments are a critical and continuous component of operations,"" Maj. Gen. Gregg Olson, Africom director of operations, said in a statement. ""Trust and credibility are central to our operations. If an innocent loss of life occurs, we are committed to being transparent and learning from this regrettable incident to prevent future occurrences.""
In its own statement, Amnesty International called Friday’s acknowledgement an “important step forward.”
“But this is only a first step,” Daphne Eviatar, director of security with human rights at Amnesty International USA, continued. “We still need new investigation procedures and all cases of civilian casualties we have documented re-investigated. The family and community members of victims of these and other strikes who have had neither communication nor support from Africom will find little solace in this initial response.” Most Popular"
Lawmakers urge Trump not to veto Yemen resolution,thehill.com,rkheel@thehill.com (Rebecca Kheel),04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/437541-lawmakers-urge-trump-not-to-veto-yemen-resolution,"Lawmakers urge Trump not to veto Yemen resolution By Rebecca Kheel - 04/05/19 10:17 AM EDT
A bipartisan group of lawmakers in both the House and Senate are requesting a meeting with President Trump Donald John Trump Sanders set for five-state Midwestern swing Tax refunds through March down billion from last year Tariffs on 'Mexican cars' are just taxes on American consumers MORE to urge him not to veto their bill cutting off U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s civil war.
“We believe that by signing this historic legislation to terminate an unconstitutional war that predates your presidency, you will set a new precedent for cooperation with both chambers of Congress to overcome such entrenched opposition to foreign-policy restraint,” the nine lawmakers wrote to Trump in a letter released Friday. ADVERTISEMENT
“We respectfully ask for a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss this legislation and the promising opportunities that can emerge from its passage.”
The letter was organized by Rep. Ro Khanna Randal (Rand) Howard Paul Trump: I have not read Mueller report, 'though I have every right to do so' Former Democratic aide pleads guilty to doxing GOP senators attending Kavanaugh hearing GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump MORE (Ky.).
The letter, which is dated Thursday, comes after the House sent Trump the resolution in a 247-175 vote.
The resolution would require Trump to withdraw U.S. troops in or “affecting” Yemen unless they are fighting al Qaeda or associated forces.
The White House threatened to veto the resolution, saying in a statement that it raises “serious constitutional concerns” and is based on an “erroneous premise.”
Neither chamber of Congress passed the measure with enough support to override a veto.
But supporters are still holding out hope Trump will sign the resolution.
In the letter, the lawmakers appeal to Trump’s distaste for U.S. military entanglements abroad, saying they hope the resolution can be a “springboard to achieve our shared interest in responsibly drawing down needless conflicts throughout the world, such as ongoing U.S. military interventions in Afghanistan and Syria.”
“Both during your campaign and presidency, you have spoken out against a bipartisan tendency to be drawn into costly and never-ending conflicts across the globe and its devastating impacts for American service members and taxpayers,” they wrote. “You have also expressed public frustration over the resistance by some of your subordinates within the Executive Branch to your efforts to challenge this consensus.”
The letter also appears to appeal to Trump’s desire to deviate from former President Obama's policies, making several references to the fact that U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign began during the Obama administration.
And the lawmakers note the resolution would have “no bearing on U.S. weapons sales to the Saudi kingdom.” Trump has touted a $110 billion arms deal with the Saudis as a signature achievement."
New York lawmakers introduce bill to end religious vaccine exemptions amid measles outbreak,thehill.com,Morgan Gstalter,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/437683-new-york-lawmakers-measles-religious-exemption,"New York lawmakers introduce bill to end religious vaccine exemptions amid measles outbreak By Morgan Gstalter - 04/06/19 09:03 AM EDT New York lawmakers on Thursday called to end non-medical exemptions vaccinations for school-aged children amid an ongoing measles outbreak. The proposed legislation is backed by a group of Democratic lawmakers who say they want to close the “personal belief loophole” which advocates for religious vaccine exemptions, The Journal News reported.
""The goal here is to push legislation to remove all non-medical exemptions for vaccination for children to go to school in New York state,"" State Sen. David Carlucci (D) said. ""We've seen the spread of measles really spread like wildfire in communities where the vaccination rates are not high."" ADVERTISEMENT
Carlucci added that religious groups he'd spoken to do not bar people from receiving vaccines.
""The religious communities that I've spoken to in no way prevent people from getting vaccinated,"" he said. ""This (bill) would take any of that misconception out of the puzzle."" State Sen. Brad Hoylman echoed Carlucci, stating that there is no major religious group that advocates against vaccinations as part of its official doctrine.
""New York’s religious belief exemption is a personal belief loophole,"" Hoylman said. ""According to experts, no major religious group advocates against vaccinations as a matter of official doctrine."" The lawmakers said only medical exemptions from vaccinations should be allowed. Hoylman criticized the modern anti-vaccine movement, which has persisted despite scientific research debunking the myth that measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism. The bill is currently in committee in both the state Senate and Assembly, the newspaper noted. If the legislation is signed into law, New York would become the fourth state that allows only medical exemptions for vaccinations. California passed a similar law in 2015 when a measles outbreak hit California. Mississippi and West Virginia also only allow medical exemptions for vaccinations. There have been more than 387 confirmed cases of measles in 15 different states between January 1 and March 28 of this year, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) . It is the second largest number of cases reported since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000. There have been 259 confirmed cases of measles located in New York City as of April 3, according to the state. There have been additional cases confirmed in Rockland County, which declared a state of emergency over the outbreak in March. According to The Journal News, there have been 425 confirmed measles cases in Brooklyn, Queens and Rockland County."
Is ‘Mayor Pete’ too good to be true?,thinkprogress.org,Addy Baird,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thinkprogress.org/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-residents-ecd35757e514/,"Share Pete Buttigieg has become a real contender in the Democratic primary. South Bend residents are thrilled. CREDIT: Allison Zaucha for The Washington Post via Getty Images
His fundraising numbers are impressive; his boyish charm, infectious. Somewhat improbably, Pete Buttigieg is making believers out of many Americans who once considered his White House run fanciful at best.
As he looks more each day like a genuine presidential contender, Democrats have begun to wonder what it would be like to actually have “Mayor Pete”— President Pete — at the helm.
It’s a question perhaps best posed to his constituents in South Bend, Indiana, who know what it’s like to have Buttigieg upgrade their city’s computer systems and oversee plowing of its snow-covered streets.
And w hile it can be more than a little disruptive to have a mayor who’s away campaigning much of the time, South Bend residents say they’re thrilled to see him making a race of it, as he runs for the highest office in the land. Advertisement
“There’s a lot of energy and excitement and light. I think it’s great he’s running,” said lifelong resident Regina Williams-Preston.
O ne unexpected dividend of having a mayor run for president, she said, is the additional revenue that comes to town with the surge in national interest. Buttigieg’s time in the limelight has benefited South Bend, allowing the city to compete for grants and vie for business it otherwise might not have gotten. All the best policy ideas in the world won't matter if they can be vetoed by Mitch McConnell or Neil Gorsuch.
“People are interested in pouring money because they’re impressed by Pete,” Williams-Preston said. “It’s brought a lot of dollars into our community. So that’s all good.”
At 37, Buttigieg is barely old enough to run for the White House (the Constitution sets a minimum age of 35 to be elected president). He is the first openly gay person to run for the Democratic party nomination, and one of the youngest people ever to run for president. Advertisement
Buttigieg won’t break the youngest nominee record: In 1896, the Democratic convention nominated William Jennings Bryan, aged 36, making him the youngest major party presidential nominee in U.S. history.
Residents of South Bend describe Buttigieg as lively and engaged, brilliant yet approachable, data-driven and laser-focused. He is credited with helping revitalize the rust-belt town, once an automotive manufacturing hub. Buttigieg said during his “State of the City” speech last year that one downtown initiative helped attract $90 million in investment to the area.
Despite his achievements and accolades, Buttigieg is punching well above his weight as he tries to vault from mayor of a small, Midwestern city (population 102,000) to the White House.
South Bend residents were surprised — but not displeased — when he announced in January that he was planning to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Jacob Titus, 26, was almost rhapsodic when speaking about Buttigieg’s qualities. He’s a local photographer who got the coveted gig of shooting the cover for the mayor’s best-selling memoir, Shortest Way Home .
Titus said he is most struck by Buttigieg’s inquisitive mind. “He’s incredibly curious,” he said, adding that most of their time during the photo shoot “ was spent with him asking questions about what’s going on around town, recognizing that he has kind of a limited view, particularly that we kind of operate in different worlds.” Advertisement
Titus added: “He’s always looking for the kind of unexpected or underground things that a mayor probably shouldn’t know about.” The South Bend mayor would be the first millennial — and openly gay — president of the United States.
On the strength of Buttigieg’s $7 million first-quarter fundraising performance, the millennial mayor has gone from affable outsider to serious presidential contender in the eyes of some political observers.
Once viewed as a dark horse, he not only has been hauling in a hefty number of donations, but garnering glowing media coverage and defying expectations in the polls as well.
Buttigieg trails some better known Democratic candidates in the polls, but he saw the largest jump in favorability ratings of any Democratic presidential candidate over the past two months, one survey found. A Morning Consult poll earlier this week found Buttigieg’s favorability rating jumped by 11 percentage points since the poll began tracking the popularity of 2020 Democrats in early February.
Adam DeBeck has met the mayor several times at local luncheons and at an event at Holy Cross, the college where DeBeck works as an alumni-relations director. “As a mayor, Mayor Pete has been someone who is consistently approachable…It’s weird to make eye contact with your local mayor and feel like you’re talking to your favorite musician or rock star,” DeBeck, 34, said with a laugh.
Buttigieg was able to bring “civic pride” back to South Bend by spearheading an effort to revitalize downtown, DeBeck said, attracting new development and beautifying the cityscape. Buttigieg’s campaign did not comment for this story.
For some however, admiration of Buttigieg is tempered with criticism. The mayor’s laser-focused approach to development resulted in him steamrolling over some of the city’s less fortunate inhabitants and residents of color, she said.
In late 2011, Williams-Preston, who is African American, and her husband decided to buy some local properties, a move they saw as an exciting investment in the neighborhood in which she had grown up. Not long after, her husband fell seriously ill, plunging the family into financial distress.
Before they knew it, they were also facing tens of thousands of dollars in code-violation fines from the city, which had just embarked on its “1,000 homes in 1,000 days” project — an initiative championed by Buttigieg to end the blight of abandoned homes. The effort was criticized for overly aggressive code enforcement that disproportionately impacted less wealthy neighborhoods and those with large minority communities.
“It’s not like there’s this nefarious plot to destroy people of color and move them out… but when we move forward with development, we often start displacing poor people and people of color,” said Williams-Preston, a teacher who’s now a South Bend City Council member, and is also making a run to succeed Buttigieg as mayor.
“I found it wasn’t just happening to me, it was happening to a lot of my neighbors in this community,” Williams-Preston said.
“Mayor Pete” is beginning to feel the first inklings of negative press after weeks of glowing media coverage. Stories this week zeroed in on a controversy early in his administration, when he fired the city’s black police chief — a move he now says he regrets.
Some African Americans, including Williams-Preston, suggest he might not always have been as sensitive as he should be to the needs and concerns of South Bend’s black residents.
Recent news reports faulted Buttigieg for his use of the term “All Lives Matter” during a speech a few years ago, rankling members of the local African-American community, for whom the term “Black Lives Matter” has become a rallying cry in the fight against racial injustice.
On Thursday, he told a gathering at the National Action Network in New York, that he now realizes that his remarks “actually wound up being used to devalue what the Black Lives Matter movement was telling us.”
Buttigieg added: “That is the contribution of Black Lives Matter and it’s a reason why, since learning about how that phrase was being used to push back on that activism, I’ve stopped using it in that context.”
But even his hometown detractors — including African Americans in South Bend like Williams-Preston — expressed admiration for his work there and for his trajectory since announcing his presidential bid.
Williams-Preston said she even predicted his ascent. “I said, ‘You know what, you could literally be the president of the United States someday,” she recalled, recounting a conversation with the mayor.
Being on the stump in early caucus and primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, means Buttigieg spends less time at home in South Bend, but many residents say that’s okay.
“I would love to see how he does when it gets down to the primaries. I think he can get that far. He’s definitely someone that I’m supporting,” said Michelle Aranowski, a 41-year-old insurance specialist in South Bend.
“He’s making all this headway. He’s kind of like a celebrity now. It’s really weird. He’s like everywhere you turn.”
“I’m just proud of it, you know?” Aranowski gushed. “That’s my mayor.”
UPDATED: This corrects an earlier version of the story which stated that William Jennings Bryan was the youngest president to assume office. He was the youngest nominee."

Yes, there are limits on the presidents powers, but the list of established limits on the pardon power are very few (there are only two).
1. The President can only pardon someone for Federal crimes. A presidential pardon would not apply against state charges.
2. The President can not pardon anyone for future acts.
As to whether or not a President can pardon himself, there have been few occasions to even contemplate the issue. The House of Representatives has only issued articles of impeachment against two presidents (and both failed in the Senate), and only two more Presidents have faced serious treat of impeachment.
Since Clinton maintained he had done nothing wrong, Nixon was the last President who would have had cause to even contemplate self pardon, so the fact that Nixon was the last President to suggest self pardon as a possibility says absolutely nothing about the validity or lack there of to claims that a sitting President can pardon himself.
If a sitting president does ever issue a self pardon, it will be an uphill battle to even get the courts to consider it's validiity, as the courts have largely considered pardons to be non-reviewable."

Many people within the Trump administration could soon be found in “ Contempt of Congress ” and thus find themselves subject to arrest.
House Democrats have been busy since taking control in January. They’ve already issued several subpoenas, and they’ve written a lot of letters which could soon turn into even more subpoenas if they don’t get the information they want.
Trump, his lawyers, his attorney general, and other associates of the president appear to be ready to openly flout the requests coming from various House committees.
So that naturally leads to the question: What can House Democrats do about it?
Actually federal law is very clear : If a witness refuses to comply with a subpoena to either produce documents or testify, Congress can then use criminal statutes to enforce compliance.
The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized congressional subpoena power, and it has always upheld the enforcement power of contempt.
Even Trump’s cabinet members aren’t immune from being arrested for being in contempt of Congress. If Attorney General William Barr ignores a subpoena to produce Mueller’s documents, he could be arrested for contempt. If Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin ignores a subpoena to product Donald Trump’s tax returns , he could be arrested for contempt.
It’s likely if these things happened that the Department of Justice (under control of the president) would intervene and the conflict would end up in court.
But it would take an extraordinary set of circumstances for the federal courts — including the Supreme Court — to disregard federal law and allow Trump’s people to avoid complying with congressional subpoenas.
The tax laws are very clear with respect to providing Trump’s tax returns: the statute says they must be given to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee after he requests them, which he has done. There is no wiggle room here.
Still, yesterday, Trump had his lawyers publicly pronounce that they would not comply and would not allow the Treasury Department to turn over Trump’s tax returns to Democrats in the House.
At this point subpoenas have not been issued for either the Mueller report or for Trump’s tax returns. House Democrats have asked nicely, hoping they will receive what they want voluntarily. But if subpoenas are soon issued, and if they are ignored, then Donald Trump and his people will soon find out that the U.S. Congress is an equal branch of government, and should not be ignored.
They may also soon find out that House Democrats have the power to arrest Donald Trump’s people, and throw them jail."

Yesterday Donald Trump made a rare visit to the Golden State to try to garner support for his controversial border wall with Mexico . While there Trump took time out to attend a fundraiser at a Beverly Hills home, and it was a total bust.
In fact, so few people wanted to meet the president that he was humiliated and completely embarrassed.
According to a new report from the Daily Beast , tickets for the event at the home of health-care executive and GOP donor Lee Samson started at $15,000 and went as high as $150,000, but very few took advantage of the opportunity to shake hands with Trump.
What’s worse (from the Southern California perspective) is that there were no celebrities in attendance. This was confirmed by a rabbi who attended the event, as well as by the valets who worked the flop fundraiser.
For Donald Trump, being in Beverly Hills and shunned by Hollywood celebrities was a massive blow to his ego. He loves rubbing shoulders with famous people, even if they are they type of C-list people who performed at his Republican National Convention in 2016 and who he gets to perform at the White House.
According to the Daily Beast, the goal of the meet and greet was to raise $5 million for the Republican Party but they came up way short due to so few people bothering to interrupt their Friday night plans to come see the President of the United States.
Event organizers had estimated that 90 donors would be in attendance, but did not disclose the invite list. Based on information obtained from multiple sources, it appears that attendance at the event was less than half of what was expected.
“The event, whose location was leaked to TMZ, drew a tiny crowd, with four flag-clad supporters in MAGA hats, and 10 protesters holding a banner that read ‘TRUMP AND PENCE MUST GO.’ More than one passing driver blared YG and Nipsey Hussle’s ‘F*ck Donald Trump’,” the Daily Beast reported.
One interesting piece of information leaked about the fundraiser said that during his remarks, Trump made an attempt at humor. He reportedly told the crowd that he expects to win California’s 55 electoral votes in the 2020 election. That comment, along with the man who made it, is a total joke."

PINKERTON 6 Apr 2019 First of a series.
On March 25 , we learned that the Trump administration would be supporting a lawsuit aimed at overturning the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Sensing an opportunity to stand up for their treasured healthcare law, Democrats pounced. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, also now a presidential hopeful, tweeted later that day: If it’s a fight for healthcare this administration wants, it’s a fight they’ll get—and we will win.
Not surprisingly, in response, President Trump chose to double down; he tweeted : The Republican Party will become “The Party of Healthcare!”
The next day, Democrat Sen. Bob Casey, freshly reelected in a state that Trump carried in 2016, jumped in with a counter-tweet : It’s now the official position of @realDonaldTrump’s administration that they want to rip health care coverage away from the 30 million Americans that receive theirs under the ACA marketplace and Medicaid expansion.
And then Casey added : It’s now the official position of @realDonaldTrump’s administration that we should no longer protect people with preexisting conditions.
Tough stuff. In fact, even as Democrats were advancing, most Republicans were retreating. Notably, congressional GOPers evinced no desire to reopen the healthcare debate, which in 2017 proved to be such a disappointing slog; at that time, I compared it to World War One trench warfare.
In fact, the repeal effort two years ago only served to raise the salience of the healthcare issue—and that was a boost to the Democrats. In 2018, the Democrats hammered the GOP on healthcare; according to the exit polls , a full 41 percent of voters said that it was their top concern. And so the Democrats flipped the House.
To be sure, plenty of people will argue that other issues, cumulatively, were more important last year, and some might even argue that the ’18 midterm results weren’t so bad—although the 295 GOP state legislators across the country who lost their seats might disagree.
In any case, top dogs of Capitol Hill soon put a stop to the thought of any new Republican “repeal and replace” health plan. Both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, in effect, No way on another go at Obamacare; we’ve got stronger platform planks on which to run in ’20, including the economy, the resurgent Right to Life issue, and, of course, opposing socialism.
For a day or two, Trump argued for a healthcare focus. On April 2, Breitbart News headlined a piece, “Donald Trump Torches Republicans for Running Away from Health Care.” As the President told a House GOP fundraiser:
We have to win, we have to take back the House. What really lost it and really helped us lose it was health care because we didn’t have an alternative. You got to confront it! Republicans should not run away from health care, you can’t do it, you’re going to be clobbered.
Without a doubt, Democrats look forward to running on healthcare, again, in 2020. And from their point of view, why shouldn’t they? According to a poll from PPP , a Democrat firm that is, nevertheless, taken seriously on both sides of the aisle:
The Affordable Care Act continues to enjoy the newfound popularity it’s had since Trump took office. 49% of voters support it to just 30% now who are opposed. There’s strong opposition to the Justice Department’s recently expressed support for striking down the Affordable Care Act—just 34% of voters agree with them on that to 53% who disagree.
Yes, a 19-point margin in support of Obamacare is something for Republicans to ponder. (Other polls show lesser levels of support, albeit still healthy margins in favor of the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation , for example, shows an 11-point advantage.)
In the meantime, yet another poll, from Politico , found that 59 percent of Americans “don’t have much trust or any trust at all in Trump on health care.”
No wonder Republicans want to change the subject to something else. In the stern words of Joseph Antos and James Capretta , health experts at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative, establishmentarian, D.C. think tank:
By backing a flimsy, state-initiated lawsuit to throw out the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, President Trump has made himself and Republican candidates in 2020 vulnerable to attacks that they want to take health insurance away from millions of people.
Soon, Trump indicated that he had been misunderstood. In a pair of tweets on April 3, he said:
I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare…
…This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!
Okay, so it was all a big misunderstanding. Now Republicans have 18 months, till the ’20 election, to tee up a plan for Making American Healthcare Great Again. (Unless, of course, that anti-Obamacare lawsuit prevails in the courts; if so, the need for a replacement plan could come sooner.) We’ll consider some possible MAHGA items in future installments.
Interestingly, it will include, according to Trump’s tweets, a guarantee of health insurance to those with preexisting medical conditions. That is, of course, a big change from the Republican position of a decade ago.
In fact, there have been quite a few changes in Republican thinking in the last few years. We’ll take a look at those in the next installment.
Next: What a difference a decade makes.

Attempting to access his Twitter account earlier today, Darby received a message informing him that he would have to delete his tweet containing a link to the Breitbart News story.
Commenting on the Twitter lockout, Darby said that Silicon Valley has too much power over news.
“There are maybe three or four Silicon Valley executives who get to decide what news or images can be posted on social media. That’s too much power in the hands of an unaccountable elite.”
“At the very least, Twitter should allow journalists to tag individual posts for graphic content so that users are warned in advance — many of our stories at Breitbart Texas do contain graphic imagery, because brutal violence is the reality of life for Northern Mexicans who live under cartel tyranny.”
Twitter has rules against posting graphic content. Users are allowed to post pictures featuring graphic content, but only if they choose to label all their posts as “sensitive,” forcing their followers to click through to view any of their tweets — even tweets that don’t contain graphic content.
However, these rules on sensitive content don’t appear to apply in some cases. Pictures of maimed or wounded children in conflicts like Syria are allowed to spread on the platform without the requirement for a “sensitive content” interstitial.
A source familiar with the situation said that Darby’s tweet was deemed to have violated the platform’s “gratuitous gore” policy, although the policy itself states that limited exceptions will be made if the rule-violating media “relates to a newsworthy event.”
A Twitter spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the company is “exploring ways to provide additional context around tweets that violate our rules but are newsworthy and in the legitimate public interest.”

‘Our Country Is Full’: Trump Doubles Down On ‘Emergency’ At Southern Border – Talking Points Memo,talkingpointsmemo.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/our-country-is-full-trump-doubles-down-emergency-southern-border,"‘Our Country Is Full’: Trump Doubles Down On ‘Emergency’ At Southern Border Jacquelyn Martin/AP By Zeke Miller and By Jonathan Lemire April 6, 2019 9:28 am
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Declaring “our country is full,” President Donald Trump on Friday insisted the U.S. immigration system was overburdened and illegal crossings must be stopped as he inspected a refurbished section of fencing at the Mexican border.
Trump, making a renewed push for border security as a central campaign issue for his 2020 re-election, participated in a briefing on immigration and border security in Calexico before viewing a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) see-through steel-slat barrier that was a long-planned replacement for an older barrier — and not new wall.
“There is indeed an emergency on our southern border,” Trump said at the briefing, adding that there has been a sharp uptick in illegal crossings. “It’s a colossal surge and it’s overwhelming our immigration system, and we can’t let that happen. … We can’t take you anymore. We can’t take you. Our country is full.”
As Air Force One touched down in the state, California and 19 other states that are suing Trump over his emergency declaration to build a border wall requested a court order to stop money from being diverted to fund the project. But Trump, who ratcheted up his hard-line immigration rhetoric in recent weeks, declared that his move, which included vetoing a congressional vote, was necessary.
Also on Friday, House Democrats filed a lawsuit preventing Trump from spending more money than Congress has approved to erect barriers along the southwestern border. Congress approved just under $1.4 billion for work on border barricades. Trump has asserted he can use his powers as chief executive to transfer an additional $6.7 billion to wall construction.
Trump, who earlier in the week threatened to shut down the border over the high numbers of migrants trying to enter the U.S., appeared to walk back his comments Thursday. He said Friday that it was because Mexico had gotten tougher in stopping an influx of immigrants from moving north.
“Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days,” the president said as he left the White House. “I never changed my mind at all. I may shut it down at some point.”
The president’s visit came a day after he withdrew his nominee to lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Longtime border official Ron Vitiello appeared to be cruising toward confirmation, but Trump said Friday that he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.”
Trump, as he so often does, mixed fact with fiction when warning of the threat at the border. When complaining about the Flores legal settlement that governs treatment of migrant children and families, he blamed “Judge Flores, whoever you may be.” But Flores was an unaccompanied 15-year-old girl from El Salvador.
He also downplayed the claims of people seeking asylum at the border, declaring without evidence that many are gang members while comparing some of their efforts to find safety in the U.S. to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections.
“It’s a scam, it’s a hoax,” Trump said. “I know about hoaxes. I just went through a hoax.”
As the president showed off the renovated section of the barrier to reporters, a balloon depicting Trump as a baby floated further down the border. And as Trump landed in California, the state’s governor ripped the president’s push for Congress to pass legislation that would tighten asylum rules to make it harder for people to qualify.
“Since our founding, this country has been a place of refuge — a safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression and violence. His words show a total disregard of the Constitution, our justice system, and what it means to be an American,” said Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Trump has been increasingly exasperated at his inability to halt the swelling number of migrants entering the U.S., including thousands who have been released after arriving because border officials have no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months, and border agents were on track to make 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children, who require extra care.
The southern border is nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) long and already has about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) of different types of barriers, including short vehicle barricades and tall steel fences that go up to 30 feet (9 meters) high. Most of the fencing was built during George W. Bush’s administration, and there have been updates and maintenance throughout other administrations.
Trump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border, though he declared Friday that at least 400 miles (650 kilometers) of the border barrier would be erected over the next two years. His administration so far has only replaced existing fencing. Construction for that small chunk of fencing cost about $18 million, began in February 2018 and was completed in October. Plans to replace that fence date back to 2009, during President Barack Obama’s tenure.
Administration officials had been studying ways to minimize the economic impact of a potential border closure in case Trump went through with his threat, including keeping trucking lanes open or closing only certain ports.
But even absent that extraordinary step, delays at border stations have been mounting after some 2,000 border officers were reassigned from checking vehicles to deal with migrant crowds.
After the border visit, Trump traveled to Los Angeles for a pair of fundraisers in the deeply liberal city. He then traveled to Las Vegas for another re-election fundraiser and an address to the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is backed by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.

Howard Schultz seems to believe that America's problem of ever-widening income inequality can be solved by balancing the Federal budget. Like the current occupant in the White House, Schultz is just another conman pretending to be a savior. Instead of the nativism and racism that Trump is peddling though, this one is trying to sell the idea that all problems will be magically solved if only we could balance the budget by getting leaders of both parties together in a room and holding hands, making nice together while they figure out how to further erode the social safety net
Ali Velshi, a senior business correspondent on MSNBC and former host of CNN's Your Money knows a thing or two about economics and started rolling his eyes at this simplistic nonsense that really only serves to distract from the underlying social problems of inequity and fairness, and asked Schultz if the real ""bifurcation"" in America wasn't between Democrats and Republicans, but the rich (who own everything and make laws for themselves) and the rest of us who have to deal with this imbalance of power. Or as Velshi put it:
“It’s not actually about Democrats and Republican. It’s about rich people who don’t pay taxes, who don’t understand that it’s not about charity. It’s actually about wealth distribution.” Bingo.
Source: The Contemptor
Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is still toying with an independent run for the presidency for some reason. If he goes all in on the idea, he’s going to need to do a lot more homework. Specifically, he’s going to have to learn something about economic policy so that he won’t sound, as he did in an MSNBC interview on Friday, like a wind-up toy for deficit hawks who still mourn the failure of the Simpson-Bowles plan from the early Obama years.
Schultz sat down with Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle for what turned out to be a contentious discussion. Velshi went at him hard on not just his vague policy ideas, but also on his eighth-grade-civics level of understanding of the current political moment in America. ↓ Story continues below ↓
Velshi seemed annoyed at Schultz’s diagnosis of a “bifurcation” in American society. Not only because Schultz is wrong that it’s a Democratic-Republican split instead of a rich-poor one, but because “a lot of Americans knew this a long time before you really rich guys started talking about how bifurcated America is and that’s where we are today. Do you get why some people don’t think you have all the answers?”
Schultz then tried to pitch his diagnosis of that bifurcation’s cause, which in his mind comes from “a lack of leadership and government of two sides, Democrats and Republicans, who are unwilling to face the issues and solve America’s problem.”
Blah, blah, f*cking blah.
It's precisely these type of rich assholes you do not want in positions of power, because they do as they always do and have done. Reward themselves and their friends, while screwing everyone else.
The reviews were less than kind to Schultz. Like Jamie Dimon and @RayDalio , @HowardSchultz displays either a remarkable lack of understanding or a willful ignorance about why our economy is bifurcated. https://t.co/gfHkiYz0pz

Then the inner child will come out, and seek revenge on what they perceive is ""the society that has kept them down"".
Then the buss stabbings and vehicle jihads really start. When they are all clamoring to seek favour in the eyes of alla after a life of western food and trinkets."

Hemp Industry on Fire - Reason.com,reason.com,Valerie Vande Panne,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2004/09/24/hemp-industry-on-fire,"Few Americans typically give much thought to the $200 million hemp industry: a market that includes such wide-ranging products as bread, clothing and soap. But this week hemp producers are getting a powerful marketing boost from an unlikely source—the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ).
RELATED ARTICLES U.S. Attorney for Seattle Threatens To Block Supervised Injection Facility Mike Riggs | 4.05.19
Michigan's Legal Marijuana Market Will Be Uncompetitive With Illegal Dealers J.D. Tuccille | 3.26.19
Philadelphia Finds Potential Home for a Safe Injection Facility Scott Shackford | 3.22.19
Drug Policy History Nearly two and a half years ago, the DEA put a chill into the hemp marketplace by interpreting the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act to include hemp food products. Their logic was that ingestible hemp contained THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and therefore was a Schedule 1 controlled substance, just like marijuana.
Never mind that hemp is explicitly exempted from the Controlled Substances Act. Never mind that hemp contains only trace amounts of THC, much like the minuscule amounts of opium found in poppy seeds or the trace amounts of alcohol found in orange juice. Never mind that hemp seed is the most complete source of amino acids and essential fatty acids found in nature. Never mind that you cannot ""get high"" eating hemp bread. And never mind that it is not possible to eat enough hemp seed to make one test positive for marijuana. After the DEA action, manufacturers and retailers pulled the products from their shelves, with the threat of customs seizures or criminal sentences looming on the horizon.
But not all hemp entrepreneurs were ready to comply. The Hemp Industries Association ( HIA ) took the DEA to court, and on February 6, 2004 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in favor of the HIA. The Reagan-appointed Judge Alex Kozinski ruled in favor of the hemp industry, and expressed concern for a common breakfast food to DEA attorney Daniel Dormont during the trial: ""Can you tell me how you are going to save the [poppy seed] bagel?""
After filing for two extensions, and trying to get the case reheard in the Ninth Circuit, the Department of Justice now has a decision to make, and they must make it by Monday: Either they appeal their loss in HIA v. DEA to the Supreme Court, or they let the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stand, effectively protecting hemp foods in the US. Considering the unlikelihood that the Ninth Circuit's decision will be overturned, hemp producers see themselves in the catbird seat.
""Our thinking is that we're in a can't loose position,"" David Bronner, president of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps and primary funder of the HIA's legal efforts, tells Reason. ""If the government does appeal, it's highly unlikely the Supreme Court will hear the case. If they do take it, it's that much more free publicity for hemp food. If they don't take it, we can focus on marketing and promoting hemp seed and fiber products. Every scenario plays in our favor.""
The hemp marketplace is already reflecting the publicity garnered by the lawsuit. ""In the last year sales have been explosive,"" Bronner continues, pointing to $10 million in year-to-date sales for the hemp food industry, nearly double what they were in 2003. And what's the market outlook for 2005? ""Sales will double again. It's smokin'. People are hot for it.""
As the Food and Drug Administration warns pregnant and nursing mothers about high levels of mercury in fish and fish oil, hemp seed oil products are expanding, easily replacing fish as one of few significant sources of essential fatty acids.
""The awareness of the health benefits of hemp are increasing,"" says Bronner. ""People want a safe source for omega fatty acids. Traditionally, that source has been fish, but fish has mercury, which is chronically toxic. Hemp seed is not toxic. Yet the government is trying to ban hemp seed, not fish.""
But it's not just about healthy hemp, nor is this simply a crunchy hippie industry. It's big business, and recent growth demonstrates the entrepreneurial power behind it.
Mike Fata, North American sales manager for the Canadian-based company Manitoba Harvest (producer of hemp oil, seed, butter and protein powder) confirms recent growth trends. ""We've done about a million dollars in sales this year, and since February 6, it's been growing every day.""
""We are a vertically integrated company,"" Fata continues. ""We own a 6,000 square foot facility. We have 25 farmers that are shareholders in the company. Hemp goes right from the farm to our facility where we process and package it right there. All of our products are third party tested, THC-free. Our facility is certified organic and certified kosher. All products are grown without herbicides and pesticides. We do not use GMOs, and we have the rights to the seed variety we grow.""
This type of consciousness runs throughout the hemp industry. ""Our business philosophy is to take our money and promote social justice and environmental sustainability,"" says Bronner. ""Hemp plays into that mission. The real environmental motivation is for the seed markets, so that hemp fiber will become a viable, sustainable option to wood pulp, cotton and fiberglass."" After all, he asserts, hemp makes the finest cigarette and bible paper, and is even used in the door panels of popular Ford and Chrysler vehicles.
Hemp, however, is currently illegal to grow in the US without a specific license, and even then, as with the Lakota Indian Reservation, the DEA frequently destroys the crops, claiming they can't differentiate between the hemp plant (which is tall and stalky) and the smokeable marijuana plant (which is short, shrub-like, and has ""buds"".)
""The last place someone would want to cultivate marijuana would be in a hemp field, as the cross-pollination would ruin the potency of the drug crop,"" says Bronner. Hemp is currently legal to cultivate in more than 30 countries, including Canada, Russia, England, France, and China.
While tackling domestic hemp cultivation laws is on the horizon, the current issue is protecting hemp foods, and the outcome of HIA v. DEA will be decided next week.
DEA Public Affairs Specialist Bill Grant told Reason, ""The issue has been handed over to the Office of Chief Counsel,"" and had no further comment.
""I don't know if the Solicitor General will appeal the case,"" Civil Specialist for the Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs Charles Miller tells Reason. ""I won't know until a) we file [for appeal] or b) we let the deadline pass. I can promise that if we do appeal, it will be very close to the deadline."""

Dozens of whistleblowers inside Trump administration reported working with Democrats,www.salon.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/06/dozens-of-whistleblowers-inside-trump-administration-reported-working-with-democrats/,"Elijah Cummings, (D-MD) (AP/Patrick Semansky) Dozens of whistleblowers inside Trump administration reported working with Democrats Rep.

Dozens of whistleblowers who currently or previously worked in the Trump administration are reportedly cooperating in secret with House Democrats investigating the president.
The number of whistleblowers who have come forward to Congress has grown to the “dozens,” a senior House Oversight Committee aide told The Atlantic . That committee is now chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who became at least a momentary TV celebrity for his calm, measured manner during Michael Cohen's Capitol Hill testimony. Longtime committee aides told the Atlantic that the number of whistleblowers who have come forward to the panel have increased dramatically since Trump took office compared to previous administrations.

One whistle-blower, Tricia Newbold, told Cummings' committee earlier this week that more than two dozen denials of security clearances for officials like Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were overturned by Trump political appointee Carl Kline . After her testimony, Newbold simply went back to her desk at the White House Personnel Security Office, the New York Times reported. Newbold, who has a rare form of dwarfism, previously filed a complaint accusing Kline of retaliating against her by intentionally moving office files to a shelf that was deliberately out of her reach and suspending her for two weeks.
Newbold is just one of a “small army” of career officials inside the federal government who has secretly been working with the Oversight Committee to report alleged misconduct inside Trump administration, according to committee aides.
“The biggest difference wasn’t necessarily us switching to the majority; the biggest difference was Donald Trump being elected president,” a Democratic aide told the Atlantic, adding that whistle-blowers began coming forward right after Trump took office, beginning with allegations that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was texting his business partner about a plan to work with Russia to build nuclear reactors in the Middle East during Trump’s inauguration.
Unlike Newbold, other whistleblowers have come forward on the condition that they can remain anonymous. A “handful” of them have been people who work directly inside the White House, aides said.
“Committee staff have spoken with other whistle-blowers who corroborated Ms. Newbold’s account, but they were too afraid about the risk to their careers to come forward publicly,” the Oversight Committee said in a memo after Newbold’s testimony.
According to committee aides, the number of tips to the panel has increased from three to four per week prior to the midterm elections to around five and as many as 15 per week since Democrats won back the House. Advertisement:
“I’ve never seen this many whistle-blowers reporting waste, fraud, and abuse, and just general concern,” an aide told the Atlantic. “On the flip side of that, I’ve also never seen whistle-blowers so afraid of what could happen to them if somebody finds out who they are.”
Newbold confirmed to the committee that she was “terrified” of going back to work after coming forward.
“I’m terrified of going back. I know that this will not be perceived in favor of my intentions, which is to bring back the integrity of the office,” she said.
Cummings on Tuesday praised Newbold for coming forward and vowed to protect those who come forward from retaliation. Advertisement:
“She’s scared. She’s small in stature and she’s already seen what is going on in the White House. She was scared to death. And she was afraid, sadly, of our Republican colleagues,’ Cummings said, adding, “I will protect whistle-blowers. Period.”
