"In Historic Election, Chicago’s New Mayor is Black, Female and Gay",www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/03/in-historic-election-chicagos-new-mayor-is-black-female-and-gay.html,"In Historic Election, Chicago’s New Mayor is Black, Female and Gay 587 Subscribe Print Flipboard
Lori Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, was elected as Chicago’s first black female mayor last night, in an historic first. She will also become the city’s first openly gay mayor.
She won a commanding victory after a long and grueling campaign that saw her defeat more than a dozen challengers as she won her first elected office.
Lightfoot, 56, will become the leader of the nation’s third-largest city as it grapples with devastating gun violence, public corruption, attempts to reform the police force and an unprecedented exodus of black residents leaving the city.
Last night she won the runoff election, beating another black woman, Toni Preckwinkle, who is president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Lightfoot will succeed outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel who decided not to seek a third term.
The size of Lightfoot’s victory was somewhat surprising as she beat Preckwinkle 74 percent to 26 percent.
In her victory speech, Lightfoot said she was committed to ending the broken political culture of Chicago.
“We can and we will break this city’s endless cycle of corruption,” she said, raising her fist in the air. “And never again, never ever, allow politicians to profit from elected positions.”
Lightfoot thanked the city and those who blazed the trail for her victory, saying:
“We may be strangers but in this room, in this city we are all neighbors.”
“Now that it’s over I know that we will work together for the city that we both love. Today you did more than make history, you created a movement for change.”
The significance of the moment was not lost on the crowd at the Hilton hotel where Lightfoot’s election party took place.
“I did not think I would see this in my lifetime,” said Leslie Page-Piper, 60, who volunteered for the Lightfoot campaign. “And it happened just like that,” he said, snapping his fingers. “I’m overwhelmed.”
Lightfoot, had previously led Chicago’s civilian board handling police discipline cases and worked for the law firm Mayer Brown. She had been an underdog during the mayoral race and was a relative unknown as well as a newcomer to politics. Lightfoot describes herself as “an out and proud black lesbian.” When she takes office, she will be the first Chicago mayor who identifies as a lesbian. “Out there tonight a lot of little girls and boys are watching. They’re watching us. And they’re seeing the beginning of something, well, a little bit different,” Lightfoot told her excited crowd on Tuesday with a smile. “They’re seeing a city reborn. A city where it doesn’t matter what color you are,” she continued. “Where it doesn’t matter who you love, just as long as you love with all your heart.”"
Chinese Woman Breached Mar-a-Lago With Hard Drives And Malware | Crooks and Liars,crooksandliars.com,Aliza Worthington,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/chinese-woman-breached-mar-lago-hard,"Image from: Wikimedia Commons
In yet another grave security breach of this shameless administration, where the criminally grifting ""president"" has ""friends"" who sell access to him and his family, a Chinese woman was arrested for illegally entering Mar-a-Lago with a suitcase filled with electronics. This included four cell phones, one laptop, one external hard-drive, and a thumb drive that had malware on it.
According to The Miami Herald , the woman, Yujing Zhang, managed to make it past Mar-a-Lago's gate, saying she was a member (she isn't) and wanted to use the pool. She made it into the reception area, where she changed her story, saying she was there for an event which the receptionist knew to be cancelled. When Secret Service questioned her, she said she was there for a different event, which the receptionist and Secret Service also knew been cancelled. Try to recover from the shock of my telling you these cancelled events were promoted by Li ""Cindy"" Yang - the owner of a string of massage parlors, and a great friend of Trump's.
She's been arrested, and is being charged with two federal crimes: making false statements to a federal officer and entering restricted property.
From the Herald,
Whatever the reason for Zhang’s presence, her arrest raises further questions about the degree to which private citizens — and potentially foreign rivals — can access Mar-a-Lago.
“What we’ve seen so far are the theoretical security risks that come from the ease at which people can get proximity to the president and his family based on the semi-public nature of this club,” said Jeffrey Prescott, a former National Security Council aide under President Obama and a senior fellow at the Penn Biden Center. “Now, the potential security risk may be an actual security risk.”
Prescott said it’s too early to tell what Zhang intended to do at the president’s estate, but if it was an effort to leave behind an electronic presence in order to record activities at Mar-a-Lago, “that’s a significant development.” ... David Kris, an assistant attorney general for national security in the Obama administration and founder of consulting firm Culper Partners, said Zhang “does not sound like some casual visitor.” ↓ Story continues below ↓
The amount of equipment she carried suggests the malware might not have been an accident, Kris said.
“It sounds very much like someone who is equipped to go to work once they breached the perimeter,” he said.
All this from the man whose main rallying cry against his 2016 opponent was that she, Hillary Clinton, of all people, was not to be trusted with national security. Tags:"
Murphy Undoes A Pair of Executive Orders Issued by Christie,www.njspotlight.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/02/murphy-undoes-a-pair-of-executive-orders-issued-by-christie/,"Tom Johnson | April 3, 2019 Democrat offers new framework of principles governing economic growth and protecting the health, welfare and environment of residents Former Gov. Chris Christie, left, and Gov. Phil Murphy
Gov. Phil Murphy yesterday rescinded a pair of executive orders issued by his predecessor, steps that critics had argued were undermining some of the state’s environmental and public-health safeguards.
Murphy quashed the orders, announced the day former Gov. Chris Christie took office in his first term, by issuing his own order overhauling principles in developing new rules to foster economic growth and to protect the health, welfare and environment of residents and communities.
Christie’s executive orders had frozen pending regulations for 90 days and made it more difficult to enact environmental rules more stringent than federal standards. The orders formed the rationale behind a number of actions taken by the Republican’s administration over its eight years to roll back regulations it claimed hindered economic growth.
They also led the state Department of Environmental Protection to issue new regulations that waived certain environmental rules in limited cases where the standards were deemed to be unduly burdensome. Governor cites ‘progressive values’
Murphy’s own executive order was issued after months of gathering input from state agencies and stakeholders on what principles should guide officials in formulating new regulations going forward.
“Common-sense regulations have an essential role to play in building a stronger and fairer economy and promoting New Jersey’s progressive values, such as our commitment to environmental protection,’’ the first-term Democrat said in a statement released by his press office.
“These principles include an instruction to state agencies to evaluate action that can be taken when the federal government rolls back prior protections, a directive to agencies to move permitting processes online where practicable, and a requirement that agencies provide plain-language summaries of their rules that are readable and understandable by the public.’’
Some of the principles outlined in the order already are embraced in a bill (A-5033) sponsored by Assemblywoman Nancy Pinkin (D-Middlesex), which aims to blunt the effects of the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental protections by enshrining those safeguards into state law. Cheers from environmentalists
Environmentalists welcomed Murphy’s action, saying the prior administration’s orders were designed to block and roll back critical environmental rules in the state.
“These executive orders were a one-two punch by Christie to promote his national career at the expense of the New Jersey environment,’’ said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, referring to the former governor’s failed bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. “These rules were used to block drinking water standards for PFOAs and roll back protections for clean air, clean water and groundwater.’’
Just this week, the DEP proposed new drinking water standards for PFOAs and PFOS, pollutants linked to various health problems, years after recommendations from the state’s Drinking Water Quality Institute.
Amy Goldmith, state director for Clean Water Action, argued New Jersey needs stronger protections than federal law given its pollution legacy and population density. “Stronger stands like this make states bolder to act together as the Trump administration continues to go in reverse,’’ she said. Business groups offer qualified support
For the most part, business groups also endorsed Murphy’s executive order, although they said they are still reviewing its impact on the regulatory process.
New Jersey already has some of the strictest environmental laws and regulatory programs combined with the most stringent environmental standards, noted Dennis Hart, executive director of the Chemistry Council of New Jersey. He was encouraged by a commitment to look at why the regulatory process is so long and costs so much more than other states.
“If this new executive order leads to discussions and positive impacts on streamlining the regulatory and permit program and reducing the fees and costs of doing business in New Jersey, we fully support it and are ready to start working on those issues right now,’’ he said.
Upon first glance, Ray Cantor, vice president at the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, said the group was pleased by a promise of extensive stakeholder outreach and consideration of cumulative impacts as part of the new regulatory principles.
“But we still want to ensure the order is protective of business interests,’’ Cantor said. “The language could lead one to believe business protections are being watered down, given the de-emphasis of the impacts on New Jersey’s businesses.’’ Read more in Energy & Environment Sponsors"
"Amid Lingering Concerns, State Report on Bail Reform Notes Successes",www.njspotlight.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/02/amid-lingering-concerns-state-report-on-bail-reform-notes-successes/,"Colleen O'Dea | April 3, 2019 A report by the state judiciary shows that fears of ‘chaos’ and ‘mayhem’ have failed to come to fruition
New Jersey’s criminal-justice reform that all but eliminated money bail gets relatively high marks in a new state report on its first two years, with little change in the proportion of those released pending trial either re-offending or not showing up for trial.
Still, there are some concerns and outstanding questions in the judiciary’s 2018 report to Gov. Phil Murphy and the Legislature. The number of defendants being held pending trial rose by 7.8 percent from 2017, the first full year of the reform, to 2018. Black males continue to make up the majority of the overall jail population and the question of whether black defendants are detained pending trial at a higher rate than whites remains unanswered.
And the courts expect to not have enough money to fully pay for the system as soon as next year.
“New Jersey’s criminal justice system has begun to remove inequities created by the heavy reliance on monetary bail,” said state Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner in a statement Tuesday. “Criminal Justice Reform has reduced the unnecessary detention of low-risk defendants, ensured community safety, upheld constitutional principles, and preserved the integrity of the criminal justice system.”
The report found a slight increase in the percent of defendants released pending trial charged with an indictable crime in 2017, compared to 2014, when money bail was the primary mechanism for release from jail before a trial — 13.7 percent in 2017 versus 12.7 percent in 2014. There was also a rise in the percent of those charged with a disorderly persons offense after release — 13.2 percent in 2017 versus 11.5 percent three years earlier.
In addition, the percentage of defendants released pending trial who showed up for pretrial court appearances declined last year to 89.4 percent, from 92.7 percent in 2014. Advocates hail decline in overall jail population
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth), who was among the sponsors of the reform legislation, said those patterns are not necessarily troubling and could indicate a natural fluctuation in offender actions, but they are something the state needs to keep monitoring.
“If re-offenses and failure to show had gone down, that would be a pretty definitive indication of success,” he said. “The fact they went up marginally is something we have to continue to pay attention to … The bail industry had predicted chaos and mayhem and that is not the case.”
Meanwhile, reform advocates point to the successes of the program. For instance, the overall jail population has declined by 6,000 from October 2012 to October 2018. The number of days a defendant was held before initial pretrial release dropped by half from 7.4 in 2014 to 3.7 in 2017 and the time all defendants were held in jail prior to trial declined by 40 percent, from 62.4 days to 37.2 days. Click to expand/close
“This report shows that New Jersey’s historic bail reform law has been a resounding success,” said Roseanne Scotti, New Jersey State Director of the Drug Policy Alliance. “We have seen a 44 percent decrease in the pretrial jail population and, at the same time, no meaningful increases in failures to appear in court or new offenses committed by people who are released pretrial ... The end of money bail in New Jersey has increased both social justice and public safety in our state.”
Until January 1, 2017, when someone was arraigned on a significant crime in New Jersey, a judge determined whether to release the accused or set a bail amount. In 2014, voters overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment to end the guarantee of money bail and change how the courts decide where the accused awaits trial. Now, money bail typically is imposed only when a defendant fails to appear in court or otherwise violates the conditions of his pretrial release. Before reform, many were unable to post bail
The Drug Policy Alliance was key to reforming the bail system, releasing a report in 2013 that found almost 40 percent of the state’s jail population in October 2012 was incarcerated because of an inability to post bail, with 12 percent of those in jail unable to pay a bail of $2,500 or less. Last October, just 4.6 percent of defendants, 390, were in jail on a bail of $2,500 or less and most of those — 61 percent — were in jail on municipal-court warrants and were therefore ineligible for release under criminal justice reform.
With the new reform process, information about a defendant is put through an algorithm that calculates what danger the defendant might pose to others and the likelihood of their appearing for trial. Based on the score returned by the assessment, several options are possible: a person may be released with no conditions; they may be required to check in by phone or in person with a pretrial services officer; they can be required to wear an ankle bracelet and be limited as to when they can leave home, or they can be held in jail until trial.
Another aspect of the reform is the greater use of complaint summonses, rather than arrest warrants, for low-risk defendants. A person issued a summons to appear in court by law enforcement is not processed through a jail, while those arrested are placed in jail until a judge determines whether to release or detain them pending trial. In 2014, 54 percent of defendants received a summons. In 2017, the first full year of reform, that had increased to 71 percent of defendants not having to be processed through jail.
“Two years of comprehensive data leaves little debate that criminal justice reform is greatly improving the lives and rights of New Jerseyans,” said Alexander Shalom, the ACLU-NJ’s senior supervising attorney. “What’s more, thousands of low-risk defendants are now being diverted from the jail intake process altogether, instead receiving summonses that minimally disrupt their lives while the accusations against them are adjudicated. That’s a clear victory for civil rights, and a benefit of reform that hasn’t been talked about enough.”
Jeff Clayton, executive director of the American Bail Coalition, said the increased use of summonses is the real reason for a drop in the number of people in jail and the state could have instituted that change without upending the system.
“That’s 29,000 fewer people they are arresting, that’s what’s driving the reduction in the jail population,” said Clayton, whose organization opposed the ending of bail as a requirement for release from jail. “They’re just not arresting as many people … I would not consider that great a victory.” Reform as a social justice issue
Regardless of how it was achieved, advocates who had pushed for the reform as a social-justice issue cheered the reduction in the jail population, particularly as it has meant that 3,000 fewer blacks and 1,300 fewer Hispanics, as well as 1,500 whites, were held last October than six years earlier.
“Thousands of individuals, mostly people of color, have been able to remain free pending trial,” Scotti said. “They have been able to stay with their families and communities. They have been able to keep their jobs and their housing.”
On the other hand, a section of the report that looked at the overall jail population and not just those awaiting trial shows that the racial and ethnic makeup of the overall jail population remained disproportionately black, with no change from 2012 to 2018: 54 percent of all those in prison were African-Americans. Blacks make up about 15 percent of the state population.
The court’s report notes this, stating, “the Judiciary recognizes the need to continue to examine the effect of CJR on racial disparity in the criminal justice system and to ensure that all defendants are treated equally by the courts.”
“It is certainly problematic,” Shalom said. “It is not good enough that things have not gotten worse. There exist many drivers of disparities; our system of pretrial justice should look to address and eliminate them wherever it can.”
One question not answered by the report is whether blacks and Hispanics accused of a crime are detained pending trial at a greater rate than whites. That could contribute to the continuing large proportion of people of color in jail and it is something about which advocates have been concerned.
Shalom praised the state for including data about race and ethnicity in its report, but added, “More data would be useful on this point.”
Another report finding of potential concern is the increase from 2017 to 2018 in the percentage of arrested defendants who are detained in jail while awaiting court proceedings. Jails held more than 600 additional defendants last year than in the first year of bail reform. (There is essentially no more cash bail so these are people denied release because the algorithm determined they were either a risk to public safety or a flight risk.) The detention rate for those charged on a warrant rose from 18.1 percent in 2017 to 19.5 percent last year. It’s unclear whether that may have been because of changes in guidance from the courts or the attorney general about when to seek or approve detention or for other reasons. Prosecutors also filed more requests to detain defendants — from 43.7 percent of cases in 2017 to 49 percent last year.
“Any increase in detention rates raises red flags,” Shalom said. “Our system succeeds when it prioritizes liberty; we’ve made tremendous strides in changing the culture of pretrial justice to one that has release as a default, but there is more work to be done.” Money, other concerns for the future
The report raises other concerns, as well, stating that there are “insufficient resources” to provide needed treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues for those released pending trial. There is also a lack of housing assistance.
For the second year in a row , the report also states that there is “an impending funding crisis” for the program that monitors those defendants who are released until the final disposition of their cases. The intensity of the monitoring depends on the level the court orders, ranging from a monthly phone call to responding to alerts that a defendant on electronic monitoring has left home or tampered with an electronic bracelet. Click to expand/close
The pretrial services program added 30 employees last year and has a total staff of 297, in addition to the judges who hear cases. It costs $4.19 per defendant per day for electronic monitoring.
“There is a continuing critical need to identify and implement a sustainable means to fund the program,” the report states. “The current method — which relies on annual court filing fees — is not a workable approach. As predicted at the outset of CJR, the model in place has a built-in structural deficit, and within the next year, will result in an actual funding deficit.”
The amount collected in court filing fees has been dropping since the 2016 fiscal year. In the last fiscal year, the judiciary collected $40.5 million and collections for FY2019 are so far 1 percent below where they were at the same time last year.
Shalom said the state needs to come up with a stable source of adequate funding to keep the program going.
“The time has come to fund the program from the state budget rather than from filing fees,” he said. “The opportunity for long-term financial savings due to a sharply diminished New Jersey jail population is real; regardless, the gains — a fairer system, families that aren’t disrupted, and stronger communities — are worth every penny of our investment in this system.” County jails need more time to measure impact
John Donnadio, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, said the counties need more time to determine how much they might be able to save in jail costs.
“With respect to operating county jails, we will need another year or so to determine if the reduction in the overall jail population will result in any cost savings,” he said, adding that the jails are continuing to process defendants. “Over time, county jails should realize cost savings through attrition and the retirement of correction officers, but it’s still too early to make that determination.”
However, he added, county governments spent between $45 million and $50 million hiring additional prosecutors to implement another component of the reform — setting time limits for court proceedings to ensure that a defendant who is kept in custody does not have to wait overly long for his case to be decided. For instance, a person cannot be held more than 90 days before an indictment, or more than 180 days after an indictment, with some exceptions.
While the report does not go into detail about the state’s performance on keeping to those deadlines, courts spokesman Peter McAleer said that trials have been proceeding according to those timeframes.
“We only know of a very small number of instances, like one or two, where we missed the deadline,” he said."
Resistance to Murphy’s Tax on Millionaires Out in Open at Budget Hearing,www.njspotlight.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/02/resistance-to-murphys-millionaires-tax-out-in-open-at-budget-hearing/,"John Reitmeyer | April 3, 2019 In second day of hearings concerning governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2020, lawmakers underline their aversion to tax hikes, including on high earners Credit: NJTV News State Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio responds to questions on a proposed millionaire's tax.
Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle took aim yesterday at Gov. Phil Murphy’s proposal to establish a true millionaire’s tax, suggesting it could make New Jersey even more susceptible to big revenue losses in the event of a recession.
The concerns about revenue volatility were raised during a second day of budget hearings in Trenton as lawmakers questioned state Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio about specific elements of Murphy’s overall $38.6 billion spending plan for fiscal year 2020.
They also came as the Murphy administration and lawmakers are still waiting to find out whether income-tax collections for the current fiscal year will come in strong enough this month to avoid last-minute spending cuts. Revenue growth had failed to meet expectations through the first half of FY2019, but Treasury is predicting a big rebound this month.
The governor’s FY2020 budget plan relies on nearly $450 million in additional income-tax revenue from a proposed hike of the state’s marginal rate on earnings over $1 million. But that policy change can only be enacted with support from lawmakers. So far, only a few have signaled they are on board.
Some lawmakers said yesterday that the revenue stream is already too reliant on income-tax collections, which are subject to big swings depending on the health of the economy. Others said they want to see more emphasis placed on savings initiatives instead of tax hikes. But no lawmaker came forward yesterday with a complete and detailed plan to generate the same tax dollars that Murphy is counting on getting from the millionaire’s tax, meaning a deeper discussion about how best to balance the budget was pushed off to another time. Counting on New Jersey’s millionaires
In all, Murphy’s budget plan for FY2020 is counting on $558 million in new revenue being generated from a host of proposed tax-policy changes, including the millionaire’s tax. It also counts on another $1.1 billion in planned spending cuts, including from proposed changes to public-employee healthcare coverage and requested departmental cutbacks. While some of those savings are coming from a new contract with the Communications Workers of America union, others are based on projections, adding some risk to the bottom line.
The Murphy administration is also counting on state income-tax collections picking up in the final months of FY2019, including this month as taxpayers submit their tax returns by the April 15 filing deadline. A carry-over of those expected income-tax gains into the next fiscal year is also expected.
Given the uncertainty over the final FY2019 revenue figures, lawmakers yesterday suggested that income tax may be the wrong place for the Murphy administration to look for new revenue in FY2020, particularly from top earners. That’s because their income is typically linked to the health of the overall economy, including Wall Street gains and corporate bonuses.
“The gross-income tax is sometimes very volatile at the high end because of Wall Street, and if we go into some type of a recession, is the millionaire’s tax really a sustainable revenue?” asked Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee chair Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) during yesterday’s hearing.
“There is a degree of volatility in the GIT,” Muoio said in response, referring to gross income tax. But she also noted the size of the budget surplus that’s used to hedge against revenue shortfalls is set to rise in FY2020. And she also circled back to Murphy’s plan to generate more than $1 billion in proposed spending cuts. Looking for balance
“We need, as I say, a balance of sustainable revenues and savings. That is what this budget is proposing, and it proposes an increased surplus so we can get through times when we experience volatility,” Muoio said. Credit: NJTV News Sen. Declan O'Scanlon (R-Monouth)
Later, Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) and other Republicans questioned whether Murphy has put too much of an emphasis on tax hikes. Last year, the governor and lawmakers agreed to raise the top-end rate on earnings over $5 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Under Murphy’s latest proposal, the 10.75 percent rate would start on earnings over $1 million.
“What this means is that the vast majority of millionaires will pay roughly two cents more on every dollar over $1 million,” Muoio said. “As the governor has repeatedly said, this is about tax fairness (and) asking a little more from those among us who have realized the greatest financial rewards from all that our state has to offer.”
But O’Scanlon countered that the “fair share” argument has been used for decades whenever the state has raised taxes on high earners. He suggested this latest hike could be the one that forces many of them to transfer their official residency to a place like Florida that levies no income tax at all.
“My question is, when do we reach that point?” O’Scanlon asked. “They can go from whatever our number is to zero in Florida.” ‘We are a state that creates wealth’
In response, Muoio suggested New Jersey will still have a lot to offer high earners even if they are asked to contribute some more of their sizable income in taxes. She also said the state added to its millionaire population following a 2004 income-tax hike and cited a recent study that placed New Jersey first in the country for millionaires per capita .
“We are a state that creates wealth,” she said. “We have an extraordinary location here in the Northeast corridor. We have a very well-educated workforce.”
As an alternative to tax hikes, some lawmakers have suggested they will be able to come up with savings of their own using proposals floated last summer by a group of fiscal policy experts impaneled by Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester). They could include changes to public-worker health and pension benefits. So far, no legislation has been crafted that clearly defines what those savings may be.
Muoio said yesterday that “savings alone” are not going to cover the increasing costs of the public-employee pension system and K-12 education. But she added that the administration remains open to finding new savings under the right conditions.
After the hearing ended, Sarlo credited Muoio for keeping an open mind even if she didn’t back off her stance on the millionaire’s tax. He also repeated his own position that new taxes should be a “last resort.”
“We need to ensure that we look at other alternatives (and) cost-saving measures,” he said."
"Newark Schools Fell Back in 2018, Halting Years of Progress",www.njspotlight.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/02/newark-schools-backtracked-in-2018-on-several-measures-halting-years-of-progress/,"Patrick Wall | Chalkbeat | April 3, 2019 While experts caution that too much should not be read into test scores, the results provide fodder for critics of district’s previous aggressive changes Credit: City of Newark Press Office
After years of progress, Newark Public Schools backtracked on a number of key performance measures last school year, including the district’s graduation rate , absenteeism rate, and college-readiness scores, according to state data released this month.
The city’s traditional schools did make modest gains on last year’s state tests, and former officials note that the district’s test scores and graduation rate had grown steadily for several years before last year’s dip. Experts also caution that one-year changes have little bearing on the district’s long-term trajectory, adding that the declines may not be statistically significant.
Still, the signs of stalled progress provide fodder for critics of the district’s previous aggressive changes, and complicate efforts by the architects of that overhaul to claim victory . The new data points could even become darts that U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, the former Newark mayor now running for president , will have to dodge as he highlights his education record on the campaign trail. ‘We need to do a far better job’
For now, the numbers give a boost to Roger León, who became superintendent in July. While León has mostly refrained from directly criticizing his predecessors, last year’s disappointing numbers bolster his argument that “dramatic changes” are needed, especially in student attendance and high school performance.
“All I have to do is look at our student attendance from last year — 86 percent — look at our student achievement data across our schools, to know that there’s a lot of work that needs to be done,” León said at a school board meeting last Tuesday, where he vowed to eventually “redefine and redesign” the district. “We need to do a far better job at educating and preparing our students,” he said.
The data, which the state published this month in its school performance reports , show that Newark’s traditional schools slipped from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018 on several benchmarks. The city’s charter schools, which educate about a third of students, saw their graduation rates and test scores rise last year.
Looking at district high schools, a slightly smaller share of students graduated, immediately enrolled in college, and passed Advanced Placement or ACT exams, which are used in college admissions. (SAT and PSAT scores also fell, but state officials said changes in how they were calculated could have affected last year’s rates.) Click to expand/close
In the lower grades, the district’s scores declined in both English and math on a metric that compares student growth to that of peers across the state with similar past scores. But while their relative growth slowed, the share of Newark Public Schools students who met expectations on the state PARCC exams last year increased by about 3 percentage points in English and 1 point in math. Problem of absenteeism
Across the district, a larger share of students also missed 10 percent or more of school days last year, qualifying them as “chronically absent.” Click to expand/close
Mark Weber, a lecturer at Rutgers University and an education policy analyst, cautioned against reading too much into the district’s relatively slight backsliding last year.
“Small changes from one year to the next are almost always due to statistical noise,” he said in an email, “and not indicative of the success or failure of particular policies and programs.”
Former district officials, who declined to speak on the record, offered some context they said could help explain the declines. For example, they noted that far more students took the ACT last year, which tends to depress scores. They also said that as Newark students’ test scores rise, the state compares their annual growth to that of higher-performing — and often more affluent — peers across the state, effectively raising the bar each year. And they pointed out that more of the students who did enroll in college last fall chose four-year schools, which have higher completion rates than two-year colleges. Trying to shift blame
The former officials have also tried to shift the blame for last year’s graduation drop onto the new superintendent, by suggesting that his administration may have failed to remove former students from the rolls or help seniors make up missing credits over the summer — both of which could have dragged down the final graduation rate that was calculated last fall.
León, who could settle that debate, has declined to be interviewed; his spokeswoman did not respond to a request to comment for this story. But León referred obliquely to the former officials’ theory at last week’s board meeting, saying last year’s graduation rate did not go down “because somebody in the new administration didn’t do what they were supposed to do.”
“In fact, my administration does know what it’s supposed to do,” he added, before suggesting that unspecified people under the previous administration were unqualified for their positions. “Ultimately, one of the issues we had is a serious problem in this school district where people were providing guidance without having the necessary certification to actually provide guidance.”
The question of who owns last year’s academic results — both the good and the bad — is complicated by a series of district leadership changes.
Newark’s state-appointed superintendent, Christopher Cerf, stepped down in February last year when the state ended its decades-long takeover of the district. An interim superintendent filled in for the remainder of the school year, after which León became the district’s first locally chosen superintendent in nearly 23 years. Booker’s efforts
Meanwhile, a years-long debate has raged over the impact of the district overhaul led by Cerf and his state-selected predecessor, Cami Anderson, and promoted by former Mayor Booker and wealthy donors he enlisted. The overhaul, which began in 2010 and included school closures and new charter schools, outraged many educators and families and ushered in a temporary decline in test scores.
Scores eventually rebounded , largely driven by the expansion of the city’s high-performing charter school networks. But the city’s traditional schools have also made clear gains: Scores have improved each year since the PARCC tests began in 2015, the graduation rate has increased by more than 14 percentage points since 2011, and students’ annual test-score growth remains well above 2012 levels even with last year’s decline.
Critics including Weber have questioned whether the recent improvements can be linked to the reforms, noting that similar districts saw test score and graduation rate gains during the same period. Whatever has driven Newark’s performance, its long-term trajectory has been “unquestionably upward,” said Jesse Margolis, an education analyst previously contracted by Cerf to study the overhaul.
“Despite modest declines on several measures last year, over the longer term, NPS has shown meaningful increases in test score performance, test score growth, and the graduation rate,” Margolis said in an email, adding that the city’s charter schools continued to show “substantial gains” last year.

Could L Train Fix Be A Model for Hudson River Tunnel?,www.njspotlight.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/02/could-l-train-fix-be-a-model-for-hudson-river-tunnel/,"Brenda Flanagan | NJTV News | April 3, 2019 Officials are exploring process known as ‘racking’ to buy time on the delayed Gateway project
Gateway project officials are talking about “racking” the cables in the Hudson River train tunnel. It’s the same cutting-edge method New York will use to rehabilitate corroded electrical conduits in its battered Canarsie Tunnel, all while keeping the L subway line in service. But could that work in the century-old Hudson River train tunnel?
“Racking sounds interesting, and it definitely warrants exploration. And we are doing that, frankly, as we speak,” said Jerry Zaro, chair of the Gateway Development Corporation.
“We have an obligation to make sure those tunnels are serviceable as long as possible. Would it create durability that would last for a decade? All of those things we just don’t know. But it’s worth exploring,” said Amtrak chair and Gateway Development Corporation vice chair Anthony Coscia.
While Gateway primarily promotes building a new Hudson train tunnel, it might use racking to buy some time and prolong the old tunnel’s life span. Currently, vulnerable 12,000-volt electrical cables run through eroded concrete bench walls. Instead of ripping out concrete to replace cables, workers would string up new ones along the tunnel wall and avoid lengthy train service interruption. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo consulted with engineers at Columbia and Cornell universities on the Canarsie Tunnel project.
“It is a design that has not been used in the United States before, to the best of our knowledge,” said Cuomo in January. “It has never been implemented in a tunnel restoration project.”
“We are in fact talking to the academic deans that the governor sort of solicited for input when he was working on the Canarsie Tunnel and we’ve got an active discussion with them, engaging them and getting their insights on it,” said Coscia. “We also have multiple engineering firms that are looking at it, including some of the engineering firms that worked on developing the options available for the Canarsie Tunnel.” Cable repairs done ‘eight years sooner’
Gateway officials say the Hudson Tunnel’s cable alignment is unique, with lines coming in from transfer stations on either end and reconnecting to the catenary. But one transit watchdog says it’s a fix worth pursuing now.
“It can be done eight years sooner than they plan to repair the tunnels, and it solves the problem of power and signals … maybe once a month, there’s a problem with that in the tunnels. So I would say fixing something eight to 10 years sooner is a great idea,” said Joseph Clift, former planning director for the Long Island Rail Road.
Officials stressed racking cables in the old tunnel would not obviate the need for a new tunnel — that’s still priority one. It’s all about timing.
“No one is saying the tunnel is going to collapse. That’s not the issue. The question really is the usability day to day of a tunnel that we already, on certainly monthly basis, are experiencing problems with,” said Gateway Development Corporation Trustee Steve Cohen. “And if the answer is that racking won’t really allow these tunnels to be used efficiently and effectively, then we’re going to have to revert back to the plan that was originally proposed.”
Officials are talking to experts now about the options for racking cables in the tunnel. No word on when they might announce an update."
Is NJ Transit Ready for Mass-Transit Armageddon?,www.njspotlight.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/02/is-nj-transit-ready-for-mass-transit-armageddon/,"David Cruz | NJTV News | April 3, 2019 Lawmaker worries about impacts of having to shut down trans-Hudson train tunnel
NJ Transit’s transportation system, a network of buses and trains that moves almost a million people a day around the state and across the river, is critical to the region’s economic and social health. But it’s a fragile system — its functionality often at the mercy of weather, labor relations and a creaky, century-old infrastructure, including the Hudson River tunnels.
“In 2016, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said we’re really living on borrowed time when it comes to the tunnels,” said Janna Chernetz, the director of NJ Policy for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. “He said one of those tunnels is going to need to be taken out of service, whether it’s 15 years from now, 15 months, 15 weeks or even 15 minutes.”
So, a contingency plan is probably a good idea. The agency, supposedly on the mend after years of decline, is focusing on just that, issuing a request for proposals last month for an outside vendor “to provide services in the development and assessment of potential near-term incremental contingency strategies and improvement projects to address existing and future travel needs for the Trans-Hudson Network and Contingency Planning Strategy.”
That is transit-agency speak for worst-case scenario.
“We are kidding ourselves that we’re not heading towards some sort of an Armageddon here if those tunnels close down — if, God forbid, we have another Sandy and another flood there,” added Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen). “It’s still almost beyond my comprehension that the people in Washington don’t recognize this as what should be the major infrastructure program in the United States of America.” ‘…alternatives and contingency plans’
Lawmakers like Weinberg and commuter advocates like Chernetz have been calling for a contingency plan for years. Their ideas center on the expansion of bus service, including getting a new Port Authority Bus Terminal built in New York, more ferry service and extension of PATH capacity, more cars on longer platforms.
The last time NJ Transit had to do some real thinking about this was in 2016 when it almost had a strike. The agency says it is working with the Port Authority, Amtrak, buses, PATH and ferries all would be on the table in a contingency plan.
“We look forward to working with them on this process,” said Amtrak spokesperson Craig Schulz. “We would be doing a disservice to ourselves and to the region, to the nation as a whole, if we did not think about alternatives and contingency plans.”
But none of this is going to be easy. PATH service into Manhattan is at capacity. For NJ Transit, it’s pretty much the same. Ferries? At $9 a trip, they are expensive for most commuters. Outside-the-box — and outside-the-state — thinking will be necessary.
“This is a regional problem, so we need somebody to convene all of the players and to come up with a plan because it doesn’t only affect New Jersey, it affects New York and it affects the entire region should something like this happen,” said Chernetz.
And, said Weinberg, until the agency gets back to its glory days of in-house Doomsday-type expertise, it’s going to need to find that expertise outside.
NJ Transit said it has an up-to-date contingency plan. NJTV News asked to get a look at it, but, citing security concerns, NJ Transit told us to file a request through the Open Public Records Act."
Op-Ed: Opposition to the PennEast Gas Pipeline Is Not Going Away,www.njspotlight.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/02/op-ed-opposition-to-the-penneast-gas-pipeline-is-not-going-away/,"Michael Heffler | April 3, 2019 Opponents of controversial project say their resistance is rooted in a commitment to protecting communities, properties and property rights Michael Heffler
When PennEast filed its application to build a 120-mile-long pipeline through Pennsylvania and New Jersey, every New Jersey township it touches passed a resolution in opposition.
Fifteen hundred people moved to intervene — a record-breaking number. Most of them are regular citizens: homeowners, farmers, single moms, retired couples, and small-business owners. Even though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has conditionally approved the project, and even though land is being taken through eminent domain, they are not giving up.
Why all the fuss?
Here is a glimpse of why so many are so committed to stopping this pipeline: 1. The gas is not needed
A paramount question is whether this pipeline is even needed. Despite PennEast’s misleading claims, industry experts report that there is no public need for it. On the coldest winter days in 2018, there were 1.7 billion cubic feet of excess gas flowing out of New Jersey. With such an oversupply of gas, households will not save money by paying for a new billion-dollar pipeline. 2. It’s a money grab for PennEast’s owners
This is not a money-saver for consumers, but a cash cow for the pipeline owners, such as New Jersey Resources and South Jersey Industries. FERC guarantees them a whopping 14 percent return on investment. And it is the regular people who would be paying them — year after year. That’s why the New Jersey Rate Counsel, the state’s consumer watchdog agency, says this project is tantamount to offering a windfall of money to private enterprises while the consumers unfairly foot the bill. 3. Myth of new job opportunities
Building another pipeline disrupts Gov. Phil Murphy’s commitment to clean energy and the economic growth it brings. Nationally, jobs in clean energy are exceeding coal and gas by a five to one ratio. If PennEast is built, there would be months of temporary employment for mostly out-of-state construction workers, but virtually no permanent jobs in New Jersey, according to a study performed by experts at the Goodman Group. 4. Damage to environmentally sensitive, culturally rich region
In densely populated New Jersey, the two counties affected — Hunterdon and Mercer — are rural havens. The pipeline would affect many farms, conserved land, fruit orchards, and forests. Historic districts, endangered species, and some of the cleanest streams in the state are threatened by the construction and operation of this pipeline. In addition, the seizure of over 4,300 acres of preserved open space will undermine the integrity of the State Land Preservation Program. That’s why the state of New Jersey is suing. 5. Taking property for a project that may never be built
The U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment says private property should only be taken for a public need. PennEast is a project where the public doesn’t benefit nor has the project even been approved to be built. FERC has conditionally approved it, but many other agencies have not. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the Delaware River Basin Commission, and other federal agencies have the power to deny required permits. Once FERC grants a certificate to a project, courts typically grant the right of eminent domain. However, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal is appealing the seizure of state lands and is joined by homeowners, the New Jersey Rate Counsel and conservation groups in challenging FERC’s flawed certificate for PennEast. 6. Gas is not a clean fuel and pipelines are not safe
Over the past seven years, the nation’s natural-gas transportation network leaked 17.55 billion cubic feet of mostly methane gas. The Union of Concerned Scientists says that methane is 86 times stronger than CO2 at trapping heat. The PennEast pipeline also endangers our water by crossing 38 C-1 streams, hundreds of acres of wetlands and the Delaware River. Geologists say this region has bedrock which will likely release arsenic into our ground water and drinking water. According to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, over 11,500 clear-cut U.S. pipeline-related incidents occurred since 2000.
Polished rhetoric and PR materials from the project developers and its advocates won’t sway informed consumers. People will continue to passionately oppose a project that is unneeded, unwanted, and harmful to their communities, homes and planet.

In the decade between 2007 and 2017, New Jersey made considerable progress in reducing the number of children in foster care who were placed in group homes; the number went from 1,739 (19 percent) to 332 (6 percent). A report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows that 94 percent of children in foster care in the Garden State were placed with families rather than in group placements by 2017. That was up from 80 percent in 2007. Nationwide, care systems placed 86 percent of the children with families in 2017, compared with 81 percent in 2007.
“Given the progress New Jersey has already made in reducing reliance on group home or institution care, we can focus on other aspects of the Family First Act such as supportive services to keep children safely at home and services to support successful reunification when children do need to enter foster care,” said Mary Coogan, vice president of Advocates for Children of New Jersey.
Nationwide, the report indicates, there has been little progress getting teenagers out of group placements and into family settings; more than one-third of youngsters in child welfare systems, age 13 and older, lived in group placements in 2017, the same proportion as in 2007.
The number of children in foster care in New Jersey in 2017 was 5,946. Read more in Daily Number Sponsors"

One thing not mentioned in your report was this: In most technology advancements, job loss occurs. With the EMR, a whole new labor force developed beyond the software people needed to install and maintain the system. They are called “Scribes.” Does it make sense that with the modern EMR we have actually had to add jobs to achieve efficiency?</p> <p>— Dr. Gregory L. Sheehy, Madison, Wis.</p> <p>This is a very thorough article but, tellingly, there are no EHR screenshots demonstrating how thoroughly wacked the average EHR UI is.</p> <p>— David Mann (@manndmd) <a href=""https://twitter.com/manndmd/status/1107847557139578880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">March 19, 2019</a></p> <p></p> <p>— Dr. David Mann, Parker, Colo.</p> <p>My criticism of your <a href=""https://californiahealthline.org/news/death-by-a-thousand-clicks/"">“Death By 1,000 Clicks”</a> article is generally not about what it says but what it doesn’t say and its tone. The article emphasizes the undeniable fact that EHRs cause new sources of medical error that can damage patients. It devotes a lot of ink to documenting cases in dramatic terms. With hundreds of vendors and thousands of hospitals, the quality of EHR software and how it is implemented is highly variable. Among the major weaknesses of some EHRs are awkward user interfaces that can lead to errors.</p> <p>However, the article fails to note the ways EHRs can, if properly used, help prevent errors. It briefly mentions that around 60% of physicians using EHRs feel they improve care quality. But it fails to discuss new, exciting technologies to improve EHR usability, data-sharing and patient access to their digital records (patient-facing APIs, SMART FHIR apps). Studies suggest that EHRs even improve physician-patient communications.</p> <p>A substantial part of the tremendous increase in physician documentation is not caused by EHRs but by the need to obtain more data on why expensive tests and procedures are being ordered in an attempt to rein in out-of-control health care costs and to support new “value-based” reimbursement of care. Clearly, EHRs could be better designed to help with these burdensome new requirements and work is ongoing to do that, but the article gives the impression that EHRs are the sole cause of physician burnout. Simply not true.</p> <p>Yes, the health care system has huge issues with patient safety, but it had them before EHRs and there is no evidence I am aware of that they have, all together, made the problem worse. Unlike paper records, digital health care records can and actually are being shared. The data they contain is becoming the platform for innovation to fix EHRs, engage patients and help address many of the other structural problems in our massively complex, error-prone and expensive U.S. health care system.</p> <p>— Dr. Mark L. Braunstein, Atlanta</p> <p>Editor’s note: Dr. Braunstein developed one of the first electronic medical record systems in the early 1970s.

However, based on my own research in the area of eHealth adoption and implementation, I disagree with the authors’ conclusions.</p> <p>The article relies heavily on individual stories but does not address the overall rate of error. The stories are horrifying, and the suffering of the individuals affected should not be diminished. But it matters if they represent a 5% or 0.005% error rate. It also matters what the error rate is compared with pre-EHR implementation. In the organizations I have observed and data I have seen, the evidence clearly suggests that the EHR error rate is lower. The article also ignores the possibilities created by EHRs for clinical decision-making by gathering millions of treatment records. We are just starting to use the data collected to support evidence-based care, but that capability is another counterpoint to the arguments in the article.</p> <p>The article suggests that the problems reflect (yet another) failure of the federal government. However, research evidence does not bear this out. EHR deployment and information sharing have been challenges in virtually every nation, regardless of the level of government involvement. The government will always be involved because health care is a public good, but the challenge is not because it is a government operation; it is because it is incredibly complex.</p> <p>The struggle has never been just about technology — it is about the need to move from highly individualized, disconnected processes to much more structured and connected processes. These processes are fraught with difficulties making progress seem slow. But branding them a failure because they have not yet fully evolved is inaccurate in the face of the benefits they have demonstrated, and unhelpful because it perpetuates a view of how they should be managed that may undermine their progress.</p> <p>— Deborah Compeau, senior associate dean of faculty affairs and research at the Washington State University Carson College of Business, Pullman, Wash.</p> <p>Actually we have a lot to show for it, little of which is positive.

But you neglected to highlight that the Obama administration incentive was both a carrot and a stick. You correctly described the amount of money promised if a physician practice implemented an EHR but neglected to mention that the cost of that implementation often equaled or exceeded the government subsidy. Furthermore, if a practice did not comply with the implementation within five years, they would be subject to a fine of their Medicare billing, which increased every year. If the fine had not been present, few physicians or institutions would have changed.</p> <p>My 19-person orthopedic practice had had a limited EHR for record keeping for more than a decade. Simple functions that you take for granted in your word-processing program, like being able to undo a mistakenly checked template, do not exist and you have to go back through the entire note to delete erroneous entries. We are not Luddites, but technologically savvy individuals. EHRs were not adopted by the medical community because they did not and still do not work efficiently.</p> <p>Additionally, you noted that the proprietary nature of EHRs is because of the desire of doctors and health systems to maintain patient control. Wrong. Patients do not choose doctors based on their EHRs. You have put the saddle on the wrong horse. EHRs are motivated to keep their systems individual because they do not want doctors and their institutions to change to a better EHR. When we went with our current EHR, our accounts receivable went from under 30 days to over double that amount, and the individual doctors exhausted themselves learning and setting up the system after they had put in full days taking care of people. A new system would have little in common with our current one and learning a new system is not a headache that we wish to take on, unless there was a clear advantage. EHR companies would have little motivation to agreeing to industry standards that would make the systems have more in common for fear that their customers indeed might change.</p> <p>— Dr. F. Ray Nickel, Ventura, Calif.</p> <p>Why Knee Braces Can Cost An Arm And A Leg</p> <p>I am an internist. Most primary care offices do not mark up durable medical equipment by 200% to 400%, as your story suggests (“<a href=""https://californiahealthline.org/news/knee-brace-with-big-markup-bill-of-the-month/"">Price Of A Brace Brings Soccer Player To His Knees</a>,” March 26). My office is required by contract to purchase such devices through our vendor for medical supplies and they price-gouge us. I know what we have to charge our patients to avoid losing money and tell them what we have to charge versus what they can buy it for online or at the pharmacy, and they decide. Sometimes to treat an acute injury, having the ability to dispense and be sure they receive the proper item that fits correctly trumps the extra cost. I applaud your story calling out clinics that do extreme markups but do not appreciate the blame being placed on the medical profession. One more little stab in our death by a thousand cuts.</p> <p>— Dr. Janis Howatt, Portland, Ore.</p> <p>Same happened to me but with a $150 wrist brace that was $40 online. The <a href=""https://twitter.com/Swedish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Swedish</a> clinic that prescribed it never returned my calls and the supplier said tough luck, the return period is up (I wasn't billed until weeks after that return window closed). Great system.</p> <p>— Josh ""Thanks Zags"" Belzman (@JoshEdits) <a href=""https://twitter.com/JoshEdits/status/1110543928724324354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">March 26, 2019</a></p> <p></p> <p>— Josh Belzman, Seattle</p> <p>I am an orthopedic surgeon and a strong proponent of greater transparency and cost accountability in medicine. Do not forget that cost does not equal value. The price for durable medical equipment (DME), like a brace, includes all the overhead — the cost of acquisition, storage and dispensing — to provide that brace in a responsible manner. A trained tech assures the proper size and educates on the correct application and wear. These services are not available online or at a drugstore, and the employee’s salary and benefits must be paid. In the spirit of a balanced comment, a minor MCL sprain can and probably should be treated with a simpler brace with a much lower cost.</p> <p>Insurance copays for DMEs can range from 15% to 85%, not a routine 20% anymore. This segues to my main point: medical billing. The U.S. health insurance system is shifting more of the cost to the patient in ever-increasing copays and deductibles while extorting higher and higher discounts from physicians, who then increase their chargemaster to offset the discounts. If the physician attempts to waive the copay or sell the DME directly (rather than go through insurance), he can face civil or criminal penalties.</p> <p>The entire system is also designed to use cost shifting from commercial insurance to offset lower reimbursement from government payers like Medicaid, Medicare, the Indian Health Service and Tricare. In many cases, Medicaid reimbursement is not high enough to cover the bare overhead of a practice. This is driving more physicians into employed positions with hospitals and health care systems, which results in much higher health care costs overall as well as less access to care.</p> <p>I am in favor of more transparent billing (which this soccer-playing patient admits he received but did not read). Where the emphasis should be is in more transparent contracting and reimbursement by insurances, simpler insurance coverage for enrollees, clearer explanation of benefits and more transparent billing from hospitals.</p> <p>— Dr. William Ritchie, Albuquerque, N.M.</p> <p>A Texas tweeter tossed out general praise for the “<a href=""https://khn.org/news/tag/bill-of-the-month/"">Bill of the Month” feature</a>, a crowdsourced investigative partnership between KHN and NPR.</p> <p>Are you familiar with <a href=""https://twitter.com/KHNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@KHNews</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/billofthemonth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#billofthemonth</a> ?

I’m an MFT in Washington, and this means that Washington’s number of insurance-reimbursable psychotherapists would be cut by more than half (from about 20,000 to about 9,000).

Barr overstepped his authority and undermined the integrity of the Mueller investigation On their own initiative, and with no apparent authority in the regulations, Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined that the evidence that the special counsel provided was not sufficient to establish that President Donald Trump committed an obstruction of justice offense. ...the damage has been done: Barr's March 24 ""no obstruction"" finding has allowed the President to argue to the American public ( albeit falsely ) that Mueller, rather than Barr and Rosenstein, concluded that Trump did not commit obstruction of justice. In turn, this has provided the President and his allies with the political basis for declaring a complete victory, for further attacking the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and for laying the groundwork for an attack on congressional inquiries. So much for the bull**** the Right has been pumping out over the past week. If I voted for Trump, I would hang my head in shame. Re: Barr overstepped his authority And further Barr's action, however, appears to be in direct contravention of the letter and spirit of the special counsel regulations -- that is, to have a special counsel who is not a political appointee and who is independent of the Department of Justice make the decision whether to charge a crime. This independence is especially important, where, as here, the attorney general appears to have had a predetermined point of view on whether Trump's actions could amount to obstruction of justice. (Barr, as a private citizen, wrote a memorandum to Justice Department officials in June 2018, saying that Mueller's obstruction inquiry was ""fatally misconceived."") Re: Barr overstepped his authority Originally Posted by calamity So much for the bull**** the Right has been pumping out over the past week. What part of Mueller's decision is bull****? What you're spinning isn't real. First, this is an opinion piece, second...from the opinion piece: Mueller's decision that he lacked sufficient evidence to make a criminal charging decision, however, is a decision. There is nothing in the special counsel regulations that would appear to authorize the attorney general to make another decision. The appropriate course of action would have been for Barr not to have made a determination about whether Trump could or would be prosecuted for obstruction. How Barr interprets or spins his own bias does not change the fact that Mueller made the decision that there lacked sufficient evidence. Instead, Barr should have transmitted Mueller's full report to Congress for Congress to consider the next step -- whether the evidence that Mueller assembled may be worthy of evaluation in a potential impeachment investigation. Lack of a determination of criminal liability does not resolve the question whether the President's conduct and intentions constituted an impeachable abuse of the powers of his office. Me not responding means it's a waste of my time and/or I don't play stupid games. I read it, eye-rolled, and moved on."
Popular Weed Killer’s Alleged Link To Cancer Spreads Concern,californiahealthline.org,Marla Cone,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://californiahealthline.org/news/popular-weed-killers-alleged-link-to-cancer-spreads-concern/," Popular Weed Killer’s Alleged Link To Cancer Spreads Concern By Marla Cone April 3, 2019 <h1>Popular Weed Killer’s Alleged Link To Cancer Spreads Concern</h1> //californiahealthline.org/news/author/marla-cone/""><strong>Marla Cone</strong></a> </span> <p>Clumps of dandelions have popped up in your yard, so you reach for a bottle of Roundup, the popular weed killer. It is known for being very effective, but its main ingredient, glyphosate, is getting a lot of attention because of lawsuits alleging links to cancer.</p> <p>Last week, a federal jury ordered Monsanto, the maker of Roundup, to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/us/monstanto-roundup-california-verdict.html"">pay $80 million</a> to a <a href=""https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Edward-Hardeman-1st-amended-complaint-Feb.-2016.pdf"">70-year-old man</a> with cancer who had used it for three decades on his 56 acres in Sonoma County, Calif. The jury found that Roundup was a “substantial factor” in his illness.</p> <p>Bayer AG, which bought Monsanto last year, said it would appeal the decision.</p> <p>Last year, a California superior court jury in San Francisco reached a similar verdict against Monsanto in favor of a <a href=""https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trial-preference-aug-2017.pdf"">groundskeeper</a> with the same disease — non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a potentially fatal cancer of the immune system. Monsanto also appealed that decision.</p> <p>Glyphosate is by far the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044953/"">most widely used herbicide</a> in the United States, and probably worldwide. It is used on <a href=""https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption.aspx"">nearly every acre</a> of corn, cotton and soybeans grown in the U.S. You may have sprayed it on your lawn or garden.</p> <p>But many jurisdictions, in more than <a href=""https://www.baumhedlundlaw.com/toxic-tort-law/monsanto-roundup-lawsuit/where-is-glyphosate-banned/"">two dozen countries</a>, have banned or restricted its use. Among the latest: Los Angeles County announced last month that it <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-03-22/los-angeles-county-bans-use-of-roundup-weed-killer"">was suspending use of glyphosate</a> on county property until more is known about its health effects.</p> <p>Bayer says on its <a href=""https://www.bayer.com/en/glyphosate-impact-on-human-health-and-safety.aspx"">website</a> that the weed killer has been thoroughly tested, and “an extensive body of research” shows that products containing it “can be used safely and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.”</p> <p>Cynthia Curl, an environmental health scientist at Boise State University in Idaho who studies the chemical, said, “many assumptions have been made about the safety of glyphosate that are now being actively questioned. We will see an explosion of information about glyphosate, and it’s about time. We’re really playing catch-up on this one.”</p> <p>Let’s try to provide a few answers:</p> <p>Q: What is glyphosate, and what is it used for? </p> <p>First sold commercially by Monsanto in 1974 under the name Roundup, glyphosate kills weeds by blocking enzymes that regulate plant growth.</p> <p>Over the four decades after its launch, use of Roundup increased a hundredfold. Monsanto genetically engineered crops to tolerate glyphosate in 1996, and these <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/demoscience/Monsanto/about.html"">“Roundup Ready”</a> seeds paved the way for the weed killer to be used on farm fields around the world.</p> <p>Q: Roundup isn’t the only weed killer with glyphosate, right?</p> <p>Right. <a href=""http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/glyphogen.html#products"">Over 750</a> glyphosate-containing products are sold in the United States, either in solid or liquid form. In addition to Roundup, common ones include Ortho GroundClear, DowDuPont’s Rodeo, Compare-N-Save Concentrate Grass and Weed Killer, RM43 Total Vegetation Control and Ranger Pro Herbicide, also made by Monsanto. If you don’t know whether a weed killer contains glyphosate, read the label. It would be listed under active ingredients.</p> <p>Q: How extensive is human exposure to glyphosate? </p> <p>Because of its widespread use, glyphosate is in water, food and dust, so it’s likely almost everyone has been exposed. And human exposure, through food and water, will probably increase in tandem with growing use of the weed killer, according to a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044953/"">2016 study</a> published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe.</p> <p>But little is known about the magnitude of human exposure, because food and water are not regularly tested for glyphosate residue. However, a few years ago, researchers <a href=""https://cehn-healthykids.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/APAMT-Poster-Gerona.pdf"">tested</a> the urine of a small group of people across the United States and found glyphosate residue in 93% of them.</p> <p>Curl said she is launching a project that will compare the exposure of pregnant women who live in farm areas and non-farm areas, then introduce organic diets to try to tease out how much of the glyphosate comes from food.</p> <p>Q: What do we really know about the human health risks of glyphosate? </p> <p>For decades, it was thought that glyphosate posed a risk only to plants, not people. That’s because it inhibits an enzyme that humans don’t even have.</p> <p>Its possible link to cancer has prompted a blizzard of claims and counterclaims over the past several years, and major public health agencies disagree about it. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer has called glyphosate a “probable human carcinogen,” and in 2017, the state of California added it to its <a href=""https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/crnr/glyphosate-listed-effective-july-7-2017-known-state-california-cause-cancer"">list of cancer-causing chemicals</a>.</p> <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, however, decided in late 2017 that glyphosate was <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/epa-releases-draft-risk-assessments-glyphosate"">“not likely”</a> to cause cancer in humans.</p> <p>But evidence is mounting that people who are heavily exposed to it — farmworkers and landscapers, for example — have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p> <p>A <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574218300887"">review</a> led by University of Washington scientists published in February found that agricultural workers who used a lot of glyphosate had a 41% higher risk of contracting non-Hodgkin lymphoma over their lifetimes than people who used it infrequently or not at all.</p> <p>On average, about 2 out of every 100 Americans develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For people who are highly exposed to glyphosate, the disease rate jumps to 2.8 per 100.

I thought of Raybould's response in a casual street interview before she was kicked out. She said, ""I want to know what the rules are for removing an MP out of caucus."" What a strange thing to say. How can she not know of the rules? To me, that sounded more like a challenge. How can she be removed for just doing her job, as she is required - by law? That's basically what she said more than a couple of times. She also kept saying she wanted to stay in the Liberal party. There's also that letter to all Liberal caucus (which is also meant for the public). She is establishing something here - making it very clear, without any doubt, where she stood. All these statements could be useful in the near future? I wouldn't be surprised if she challenge her removal in court. Could it be she's still getting legal advice from the former Supreme Court judge? I don't think she'd have stayed in the caucus (despite the nastiness directed at her, and also, with everyone including pundits saying she should leave, or be booted out)... just because! She must have Plan B! Or, the scenario is folding out exactly as she directs it she's still the one very much in control. That, the Liberal Party did what she actually wanted them to do - remove her against her will. Think about it. If this goes to court we'll most likely hear from all the actors mentioned in that soap opera. I think there are 11 of them that are named. They won't just be giving their sides of the story. There will be cross-examinations. Lol....could it be all Trudeau had seen so far from Raybould, are simply fireworks precursors to the shelling and the grenades? Could she be singing this song?

Nigel Adams MP, who was a junior minister in the Wales Office and a government whip, handed in his resignation Wednesday morning. The move against the prime minister which followed a marathon seven hours of senior Cabinet meetings on Tuesday intended to break the “logjam” over Brexit came with a harsh criticism of May handing power to hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who he called a “calamity”.

Yet, instead of moving to deliver Brexit as voted for by the British people, in the language of Adams’ Parliamentary colleagues, the prime minister is now “subcontracting” the business of Brexit to the “known Marxist” leader of the Opposition.
Leaving the door open to an even softer Brexit than the prime minister had even arranged for, May said if she could not find agreement with Corbyn, she would leave it open to the Remain-dominated Parliament to set the way forward, and that she would follow.
Writing to the prime minister, Adams said of the latest Brexit developments and their impact on his willingness to continue serving: “I believe we have two great challenges. We must deliver the Brexit the people voted for. And we must prevent the calamity of a Corbyn government.
“Sadly, I fear that we are now at risk of simultaneously failing in both.”
Following yesterday’s cabinet, this morning I’ve been to Downing Street & resigned my position as UK Govt Minister for Wales & Govt Whip.

In British Parliamentary parlance, whips are charged with the important task of enforcing discipline among back-bench Members of Parliament, to ensure they vote with the will of the government. If even the whips are unable to support the government’s position it would, therefore, point to seriously deteriorating morale levels within the governing Conservative Party.
Adams is not the first whip May has lost over Brexit. Brexiteer Gareth Johnson quit in January so he could oppose Theresa May’s so-called “worst deal in history” EU Withdrawal Agreement in Parliament votes. He said at the time: “This agreement prevents us from taking back control and instead could leave us perpetually constrained by the European Union… I have decided the time has come to place my loyalty to my country above my loyalty to the government.”
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn himself has emerged as a deeply divisive figure in British politics, not just for his hard-left views but also for the surge in antisemitism across his party that seems to have coincided with his leadership. Breitbart’s London and Jerusalem offices have followed these developments, including the several ex-Labour MPs who have been pushed to leaving the party altogether over the scourge.
