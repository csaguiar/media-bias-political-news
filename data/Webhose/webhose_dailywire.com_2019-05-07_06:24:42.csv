Beto O'Rourke Makes 5 Misleading Claims In Less Than 1-Minute | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45651/beto-orourke-makes-5-misleading-claims-less-1-ryan-saavedra,"Beto O'Rourke Makes 5 Misleading Claims In Less Than 1-Minute Ethan Miller/Getty Images April 6, 2019 views
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke made five false statements in an attack on President Donald Trump this week when he was confronted over why he compared the president to the Third Reich.
""I compared the rhetoric that the president has employed to the rhetoric that you might have heard during the Third Reich,"" O'Rourke said. ""Calling human beings an 'infestation' is something we might have expected to hear in Nazi Germany.""
""Describing immigrants who have a track record of committing violent crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans as 'rapists and criminals,'"" O'Rourke continued. ""Seeking to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion, what other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing or in our history or in the history of the western world?""
""Putting kids in cages,"" O'Rourke added. ""Saying that neo-Nazis and Klansman, and white supremacists are 'very fine people.'""
WATCH: Democrat Beto O'Rourke lies a lot right here: -Trump said “we have an 'infestation' of MS-13 gangs in certain parts of our country” -The travel ban is not a Muslim ban -Trump never said neo-Nazis and KKK members were ""very fine people"" -The remaining comments need more context pic.twitter.com/vwhSlw2IlG — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 6, 2019
O'Rourke's claim that Trump called ""human beings an 'infestation'"" is highly misleading.
On July 3, 2018, Trump slammed the notoriously hyper-violent MS-13 street gang in a tweet, writing: ""When we have an 'infestation' of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal (elements) that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do!"" When we have an “infestation” of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018
Here are just some of the crimes that MS-13 gang members have been implicated in:"

The campaign consultants behind Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) meteoric rise to national prominence want to extend their ""progressive primary"" crusade to every Democratic House race in the country, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is standing in their way.
But Justice Democrats, the controversial operation behind Ocasio-Cortez's win -- the same group that has now been hit with several FEC complaints over how it mixed its money with Cortez's campaign coffers -- is fighting back, and threatening to declare open war within the Democratic party if they aren't allowed to take on existing, moderate candidates.
This week, Roll Call reports , the DCCC voted to ""freeze out"" Justice Democrats from getting lucrative contracts with Democratic House contenders across the country. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the D.C. based outlet says, has a ""newly stated policy that it will not grant contracts to pollsters, strategists and communications specialists working with primary challengers.""
""Still, the new policy moves millions of expenditures by the DCCC off the table for firms that work with candidates who challenge Democratic incumbents,"" Roll Call adds.
Justice Democrats exists largely to primary moderate and, in many cases, older Democrats who they feel are standing in the way of real progressive progress. Initially, before Ocasio-Cortez won office, they seemed like an outlier company, standing behind a number of campaigns that all, inevitably, lost. But with Ocasio-Cortez's success, the Justice Democrats are in demand (aside from their teeny-tiny issues with the Federal Election Commission, of course).
In response, the Justice Democrats have created the ""DCCC Blacklist ,"" a website that chronicles all of the progressive-owned ""pollsters, strategists and communications specialists"" as well as ""political vendors, political action committees, and advocacy groups"" who are willing to provide their services to specifically progressive candidates, including those looking to launch primary challenges to other Democrats.
The DCCC Blacklist is apparently bankrolled by the Indivisible Project, the most recent, ""resistance""-based spinoff of MoveOn.org, financed almost exclusively by progressive billionaire George Soros.
Indivisible's political director, Maria Urbina made the official announcement for the DCCC Blacklist.
“We reject the DCCC’s attempt to hoard power, which will only serve to keep that talent pool — and Congress itself — disproportionately white and male,”she told media in a statement. “Incumbents who engage fully with their constituents shouldn’t fear primaries and shouldn’t rely on the national institutions like the DCCC to suppress challenges before voters ever have a say.”
If all this seems to demonstrate that the coalition between leftist and moderate Democrats is cracking at the seams, that's because it is. Aside from the obvious -- that any Democrat engaged in a House or Senate race in 2020 needs to watch their back, lest they be ousted in a primary by a progressive candidate -- it's clear Soros and other major leftist donors are not waiting around for the Democratic establishment to welcome far-left progressive with open arms.
They're simply going to force recognition of progressive candidates themselves, and bankroll progressive campaigns without regard for traditional Democratic institutions.
There is one flaw in the DCCC Blacklist, and that is constituents. Although Ocasio-Cortez is much beloved by the national far-left, isn't beloved at home in her own district , where her constituents are convinced they've been left behind by a Representative seeking a national -- not a local -- stage."

She didn't grow up in the Bronx, and that's not how people in the Bronx speak. DON EMMERT / Getty April 8, 2019 views
During an appearance last Friday at Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the latest Democrat politician to don blackface, in her case with an exaggerated drawl rather than shoe polish. Before a predominantly black audience, Ocasio-Cortez declaimed, “This is what organizing looks liiike! This is what building power looks liiike! This is what changing the country loooks liiike!” As her speech progressed, the stereotypically southern and black affectation grew even more pronounced.
“Y’know, Reverend, you bring up a funny anecdooote,” she drawled. “I’m proud to be a bar-ten-derrr. Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that! There’s nothing wrong with working retaaail, folding clothes for other people to buyyy! There is nothing wronnng with preparing the fooood that your neighbors will eat.” The incident quickly drew comparisons to Hillary Clinton’s infamous caricature of a black accent during a 2007 campaign stop in Selma, Alabama, when the then-candidate declared, “I don’t feeel no ways t red.” Ocasio-Cortez speaks in an accent that she never uses while telling a room of predominately black people that there is nothing wrong with them folding clothes, cooking, and driving other people around on a bus for a living. pic.twitter.com/FIbIAPokt0 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 5, 2019
Ocasio-Cortez blamed the jarring incident on her allegedly hardscrabble upbringing. She was merely “code-switching,” she insisted—that is, reverting from her polished public cadence to her authentic, personal accent. “As much as the right [sic] wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home,” Ocasio-Cortez distorted and deflected.
CNN’s Don Lemon defended her excuse. “She’s from the Bronx. If you are from the Bronx, you have hung out with black people, and that is not the first time she has used that accent.”
In truth, and despite repeated claims to the contrary, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did not grow up in the Bronx. And she ordinarily does not speak with a Bronx accent, as countless hours of her public speaking demonstrates. And even if she had grown up in the Bronx and did speak with a Bronx accent, the cartoonish drawl that AOC affected before the National Action Network is not how people in the Bronx actually speak.
By the age of five, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s family had left the Bronx and moved to Yorktown Heights, a ritzy suburb in northern Westchester. She attended the estimable Yorktown High School before attending Boston University, a private college in Massachusetts that costs over $70,000 per year. According to Westchester County land records , Alexandria returned to Yorktown Heights after college and lived with her mother and brother until 2016.
I can empathize with AOC’s upbringing. After my family left Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, in my early years, I grew up in Bedford Hills, the less affluent, more ethnically diverse, also well-to-do town directly across the New Croton Reservoir from Yorktown Heights. The median household income in Yorktown Heights is $99,382; in Bedford Hills it's $68,848. An estimated 0.99 - 2.7% of Yorktown Heights residents are black, and 82.5-90.98% are white. By comparison, an estimated 4.5% of Bedford Hills residents are black, and 54.9% are white. In neither town do residents tend to speak in the accent AOC affected onstage with Al Sharpton.
During the 2018 midterm campaign, Ocasio-Cortez pretended to have commuted to high school from the Bronx. Her campaign website insisted, “She ended up attending public school 40 minutes north in Yorktown, and much of her life was defined by the 40-minute commute between school and her family in the Bronx.” The tall tale fell apart when political observers noticed that students in New York are not permitted to commute from the city to their preferred public school upstate. Ocasio-Cortez eventually deleted the obvious lie.
Perhaps AOC picked up her spontaneous drawl on weekend visits to the Bronx. Here too, personal experience suggests otherwise. Each weekend as a teenager I traveled to the Bronx to shop for groceries and see friends. At no point did the day trips transform me into a black preacher.
In reality, Ocasio-Cortez simply adopted what she imagined to be the preferred vocal style of her audience at the National Action Network. She may not even have realized she was doing it. Politicians engage in such linguistic stunts all the time because, like actors, their profession requires that they develop a keen, even unconscious empathy.
A popular conspiracy theory holds that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not really a politician at all but rather an actress cast to play one on TV. Friday’s performance reinforces the conspiracists’ theories. Similarities abound between show business and politics. But while actors react to imaginary circumstances, politicians are supposed to live in reality.
If Ocasio-Cortez must “code-switch,” she ought to trade her charade for authenticity. In any case, she might at least put on a more convincing show. "

Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) came up with a new excuse for the accent she used while addressing a black audience on Friday, suggesting that she had to ""code switch"" it because there would be ""costs"" associated with not doing it.
Ocasio-Cortez, who was condemned by many African-Americans for using the accent, initially claimed that those who were calling her out for the accent were trying to ""distort"" and ""deflect"" and that it was all a conspiracy theory.
The 29-year-old congresswoman — who regularly refers to those on the political Right as racists, white supremacists, and xenophobes — added that it was ""so hurtful"" that people would criticize her for using an accent. As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home. It is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 5, 2019
Ocasio-Cortez's claims that she used the voice during a speech about then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and at a speech at the Women's March were quickly debunked .
On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez quickly adopted an excuse that some of her supporters used in their defense of her, claiming that she was ""code-switching.""
After initially claiming that the Right was trying to ""distort"" and ""deflect,"" Ocasio-Cortez did just that in adopting her new explanation for her behavior, as she tried to change the topic by presenting herself as a victim while talking about her hair.
""Next time you‘re told straight hair is 'unprofessional' & that speaking like your parents do is 'uneducated,' then you can complain about code-switching,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""Code switching is a tool communities learn when they’re told their voice, appearance, & mannerisms are 'unprofessional.'"" Next time you‘re told straight hair is “unprofessional” & that speaking like your parents do is “uneducated,” then you can complain about code-switching. Code switching is a tool communities learn when they’re told their voice, appearance, & mannerisms are “unprofessional.” https://t.co/tKPTneEncO — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 7, 2019
Ocasio-Cortez then suggested that there were ""costs"" associated with not ""code-switching.""
""We see the perceived 'costs' to not code-switching all the time. Can’t tell you how many young people in our community don’t have the confidence they should bc they didn’t grow up learning secondary speech,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Their talents get stifled by 'respectability,' despite enormous gifts.""
""The good news is that we can improve this easily w/ honest reflection,"" Ocasio-Cortez added. ""For ex, are certain hairstyles discouraged in your workplace? Why? Can you think of someone who didn’t advance bc of how they spoke? Why? Examine what’s deemed 'unprofessional' around you & adapt it to 2019."" The good news is that we can improve this easily w/ honest reflection. For ex, are certain hairstyles discouraged in your workplace?Why?

Remember, Ocasio-Cortez never claimed that she was ""code-switching"" in her initial explanation, and while some did buy into her second explanation, many did not.
Stefan Grant tweeted: ""shut the f*** up. I don’t know which one of these newly-woke rented Black folks told you that bullshit was ok, but it wasn’t.

The United Kingdom has been stingy with its state visits since Donald Trump became president, but it seems Queen Elizabeth II is willing to make an exception, even amid the Brexit crisis, to welcome Trump for the 75th anniversary of D-Day on June 6th.
People Magazine reports that ""after much back and forth,"" the Queen has settled on welcoming the president, now more than two years into his term, to mark the success of Operation Overlord, and the massive joint invasion that started the Allies down the path to victory in World War II.
Donald Trump may even get to ride in a carriage down London's mall to Buckingham Palace accompanied by members of the Queen's Household Cavalry to mark the occasion. He may also get a gun salute and an invitation to an official State dinner at the palace, held in the ballroom, per Metro .
The White House and Buckingham Palace are still ironing out the details, but a formal announcement is expected later this week. Trump is expected to follow up that visit with a jaunt to the northern coast of France, where he will take part in the official D-Day 75 festivities.
This will be the first official state visit to the UK for President Trump, but not his first visit. That came in 2018, when Trump traveled to London on a series of official engagements with UK lawmakers and trade representatives. On that visit, Trump and his wife, Melania, were welcomed to Buckingham Palace for tea with the Queen but did not take part in any banquets.
His visit was mostly marked by protests, including the underwhelming debut of a ""Baby Trump"" air balloon.
This time, Trump will visit again with the UK's Prime Minister Theresa May, but will also spend a few days meeting with other members of the British government, including controversial Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is not a fan of the Trump administration.
If the visit with one of the United States' most treasured allies seems late in coming, that's because it is. Trump has been scheduled to make an official state visit to the United Kingdom since he was elected in 2016, but plans for the meetup were repeatedly shelved, and not just by U.K. leaders.
When he first took office, Theresa May offered Trump a state visit immediately and Trump accepted, but the Trump White House later pulled out of the meeting over ""safety concerns."" the Metro reports. It's not clear what prompted the ""concerns"" but at least two million U.K. residents signed a petition begging May to call off the engagement out of fear that Trump could cause embarrassment to the Queen.
""Trump had also been expected to open the new US Embassy in London last February, but the plan was also abandoned because he was so unimpressed with the building’s ‘off location’ and the ‘bad deal’ behind it,"" Metro continues.
Neither the White House or Whitehall, the house in charge of solidifying the plans, would comment on the upcoming state visit, but Trump has spoken highly of Queen Elizabeth in previous interviews. Town & Country reports that Trump holds the monarch in high esteem.
""I think she represents her country so well,"" Trump told media last year . ""If you think of it, for so many years she has represented her country, she has really never made a mistake. You don’t see, like, anything embarrassing. She is just an incredible woman."""
Cory Booker Introduces Slavery Reparations Bill To Senate | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45697/cory-booker-introduces-slavery-reparations-bill-paul-bois,"Cory Booker Introduces Slavery Reparations Bill To Senate ""This bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism"" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / Contributor / Getty Images April 8, 2019 views
In an effort to differentiate himself from the pack by moving as far to the left as he can on the political spectrum, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) has now introduced a bill to the Senate that would study the payment of slavery reparations, reports Fox News .
On Monday, the senator said that the bill will study whether or not slavery reparations will help to alleviate past racial injustice in the United States.
""This bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white supremacy, and implicit racial bias in our country,"" said Booker. ""It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed.""
Booker added that slavery in this country fueled a subsequent system of white supremacy designed to keep black Americans from competing economically.
""Since slavery in this country, we have had overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed African-Americans economically for generations,"" Booker added. ""Many of our bedrock domestic policies that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class have systematically excluded blacks through practices like 'G.I. Bill' discrimination and redlining.""
As The Daily Wire argued back in 2016, slavery reparations are not only an impractical solution — but are also an economically impossible one.
""The reason reparations advocates struggle to make a case is because there is no possible way to do it,"" Aaron Bandler wrote for The Daily Wire at the time. ""There are numerous immigrants who have entered the U.S. who were not a part of enslaving blacks, and there were also blacks that owned slaves during that era . How would the government be able to have the resources to determine every single person who had slaveowner ancestors as well as ancestors who were slaves? What about those of mixed race? It's impossible.""
Veteran economist Thomas Sowell has also argued that a majority of white people did not own slaves during slavery's heyday. ""Even during the era of slavery, most white people owned no slaves,"" Sowell has written. ""Are their descendants supposed to pay for the descendants of those who did?""
On top of that, Sowell also noted that even if slavery reparations were economically feasible, they would still fail to bring about the goal of helping black Americans. For instance, according to Sowell, reparations proponents claim that white supremacy created the black underclass while failing to address the fact that black Americans were largely rising economically prior to Lyndon Johnson's anti-poverty programs kicked in during the 1960s:
But the poverty rate among blacks fell by half between 1940 and 1960, before any of the major federal civil rights legislation or the vast expansion of the welfare state under President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs.
Between 1940 and 1960, black males' number of years of schooling doubled. How surprising is it that doubling your education raises your income? In short, most blacks raised themselves out of poverty, but their leaders robbed them of this achievement and the respect it deserved — in the eyes of blacks and whites alike — by making it seem like a concession from the government and a product of agitation.
Slavery reparations have also been endorsed by other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Most recently, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg said he is open to the idea. ""The country as a whole is effectively segregated by race and the resources are different. There is a direct connection between exclusion in the past and exclusion in the present,"" he said ."
Arkansas Congressman French Hill Provides A Great Example Of What Civics Education Can Look Like | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45716/arkansas-congressman-french-hill-provides-great-josh-hammer,"Arkansas Congressman French Hill Provides A Great Example Of What Civics Education Can Look Like DanielBendjy via Getty Images April 8, 2019 views
In a Daily Wire op-ed and appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" last week, I argued that America's crisis of civics — perhaps best encapsulated by the scandalously low percentage of Americans who can even name a single branch of the federal government — poses an acute concern for the preservation of the republic. The Constitution's Bill of Rights is also important, but, as I argued on Fox, it is constitutional structure that is paramount:
Every Constitution Day I hear all sorts of paeans, people talking about the Bill of Rights and how the Bill of Rights is the anchor of all that we are great. And look, I love the First Amendment; I love freedom of speech, freedom of religion. I love the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms. I even love the Third Amendment’s prohibition against quartering of soldiers in the homes, okay?
But what famously makes America great is actually not the Bill of Rights. Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative icon on the court for decades, was fond of saying how every tinpot dictator could have a Bill of Rights. And sure enough, the Stalinist constitution in the Soviet Union in 1936, purported to have a bill of rights. But as Scalia said, it’s actually structure that dictates destiny. And insofar as we’re not even naming the three branches of government, it is the separation powers of those three branches that secure liberty by diffusing power. It is our federalist system of dual spheres of sovereignty between the states and federal government that secure power.
We risk losing a basic knowledge of — and, more meaningfully, an appreciation of — that constitutional structure at our own profound peril.
One such civics education program that ought to serve as a model for others is the "" Future Leaders Council ,"" which was started by Rep. French Hill (R-AR) in 2018. Hill, who represents a Little Rock-area congressional district, appears to be a rare federal legislator — similar to Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) — who appreciates the indispensable nature of civics education to the preservation of the American experiment. According to the congressman's Future Leaders Council press release from one year ago:
During the inaugural class of the Future Leaders Council, the students worked closely with Rep. Hill during quarterly meetings between July 2017 and March 2018. The discussion featured topics including the U.S. Constitution, federalism, checks and balances, and how a bill becomes a law. The students heard from guest speakers, including Arkansas State Representative Doug House and Member of Parliament Rehman Chishti from the United Kingdom. The students also held a ""mock congress,"" in which they debated bill ideas and drafted legislation. Their bills, the Stronger Teachers Act of 2018 and the Fair Pay for the Armed Services in the Republic (FAIR) Act, demonstrated their commitment to quality education and their appreciation for our servicemen and servicewomen.
The Daily Wire spoke today with Steven Smith, Rep. Hill's communications director, and Chloe Maxwell, a staffer based out of the congressman's Little Rock office who was instrumental in the initial formation of the Future Leaders Council. According to Maxwell, the Future Leaders Council meets four times a year during participants' fifth grade year. Classes are held on Saturday mornings in Little Rock, and each participating fifth grader is given a copy of the Constitution. Students are expected to read the actual constitutional provisions relevant to the discussion topic of the week, and are also exposed to historical campaign posters and other ancillary materials that serve a pedagogical function. For the most recent year, the Future Leaders Council had about 35-40 total applicants, and Hill's office finalized a group of 15 precocious participants. They break into mock congressional committees and draft bills that they would like to see enacted into law.
According to Maxwell, there does not appear to be a similar program that any other U.S. congressman currently sponsors in his/her home district.
Reached for comment by The Daily Wire, Rep. Hill said the following:
Our founding fathers believed that an educated population was essential to ensuring the survival of our Republic. My Future Leaders Council was created in this spirit to introduce young students to a deeper understanding of our Constitution and the values and principles that it supports.
As a father of two children, I know that fifth graders are at the point in their lives where they begin to pay attention to the world of politics. The Future Leaders Council helps provide a road map for young students in central Arkansas to navigate important ideas like checks and balances, federalism, and the rule of law.

"Harry Reid Loses Battle Against TheraBand, Accused Of Struggling To Tell The Truth | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45718/harry-reid-loses-battle-against-theraband-accused-emily-zanotti,"Harry Reid Loses Battle Against TheraBand, Accused Of Struggling To Tell The Truth Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images April 8, 2019 views
Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) lost his battle against a medical device manufacturer this week, and failed to recover from injuries he says he sustained when an exercise band snapped back at him during a workout.
The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that it took jurors only an hour to decide that Reid didn't deserve the $50,000 he was demanding from Ohio-based Hygenic Intangible Property Holding Co., The Hygenic Corp. and Performance Health LLC, who make the ""TheraBand,"" a large, physical therapy rubber band used, in Reid's case, to strengthen arm muscles.
The Daily Wire reported on the case last month. Reid was claiming that he was using the band as directed, looped around a doorknob in his bathroom, when the band slipped from his grasp and he fell on a marble floor, sustaining ""a concussion, broken orbital bones, severe disfigurement to his face, bruising and lacerations on his face, hand injuries, scarring and broken ribs.""
The accident left him nearly blind in his right eye, and, according to Reid, was the impetus behind his retirement from the Senate at age 75.
But Reid's case wasn't even out of opening statements before things started to turn sour for the career Democrat. Opposing counsel repeatedly reiterated that Reid had been instructed by congressional physical trainers to ""improve his foot stance, balance and technique while using the resistance bands at his doctors’ recommendation,"" but hadn't followed orders, and that Reid had thrown out the band that had snapped, so he couldn't even be sure it was TheraBand brand.
But the real trouble for Reid seemed to be, as the defendant's attorney put it, that he couldn't keep his stories straight, even under oath: “The one thing we do know,"" she said, ""is he struggles with telling the truth.”
There were two problems with Reid's story, it seems. One, that he blamed the injuries he sustained from the broken band for ending his career in the Senate, and two, that he told two different stories about how he was using the band when it snapped.
The Associated Press reports that the defendant's attorney hammered home the part about the Senate.
""Reid testified last week his injuries were 'the main factor' why he decided not to seek a sixth Senate term in 2016. [The defense attorney], however, showed the jury a 2015 video news release in which Reid said his decision not to run had 'absolutely nothing to do with my injury,'"" the outlet reported.
Reid was 75 years old when he retired from the Senate in 2015, and, at the time, there was no guarantee that he would emerge victorious from another campaign. Democrats were seeking fresh blood in the Senate and, at the time, it was largely considered a safe seat for the Democratic Party, so Reid retired to his home in Searchlight, Nevada. Since then, he's been mostly absent from politics, except for the occasional comment on the current state of Democratic leadership.
Reid also, according to the AP, couldn't quite remember whether he'd hooked the band to a metal hook in his bathroom, or through the handle of his shower door, and testified to both.
""He noted that Reid at first said the band broke, not that it slipped his grasp, and that it had been attached to a metal hook in the wall of the bathroom in his suburban Las Vegas home,"" the AP said. ""On the witness stand, Reid testified he looped a band through a shower door handle, not a hook, and that he spun around and fell face-first against hard-edged bathroom cabinets."""
HAMMER: America Needs To Re-Think Its Global Alliances. Here Is How. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45699/hammer-america-needs-re-think-its-global-alliances-josh-hammer,"April 8, 2019 views
When Donald Trump first launched his presidential campaign, many feared that his Charles Lindbergh-esque calls for an ""America first"" foreign policy might serve as a proxy for Ron Paul-style isolationism — and, some of Trump's most zealous detractors speculated, potentially something much more nefarious .
Those fears have not come to pass . Trump has been fairly trigger-happy in bombing some of Bashar al-Assad's military assets in Syria, has ( incorrectly , in my view) recommitted to a prolonged U.S. military presence in Afghanistan , has been consistently defiant in his hardline opposition to the genocidal mullocracy of Tehran, and has generally been substantively hawkish in dealing with both Russia and China alike. To the extent Trump's National Security Strategy has promulgated — and to the extent he has acted upon — a foreign policy doctrine that is at odds with the past two to three decades of the bipartisan Wilsonian/neoliberal D.C. Smart Set™️ consensus, Trump has merely placed a greater emphasis on prizing nation-state sovereignty over the interests of sovereignty-undermining inherently leftist transnational institutions. And for that, Trump ought to be praised .
Over the weekend, Yoram Hazony and Ofir Haivry of the Jersualem, Israel-based Herzl Institute think tank, published a deeply incisive op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that builds upon the Trump presidency to-date and articulates what a forward-looking American foreign policy doctrine — which properly and solely prioritizes America's national security interest above all else — ought to look like. Here is the crux of the authors' argument:
On paper, America has defense alliances with dozens of countries. But these are the ghosts of a rivalry with the Soviet Union that ended three decades ago, or the result of often reckless policies adopted after 9/11. These so-called allies include Turkey and Pakistan, which share neither America’s values nor its interests, and cooperate with the U.S. only when it serves their purposes. Other ""allies"" refuse to develop a significant capacity for self-defense, and are thus more accurately regarded as American dependencies or protectorates. ...
An American strategic posture aimed at minimizing the danger from rival powers needs to focus [instead] on deterring Russia and China from wars of expansion; weakening China relative to the U.S. and thereby preventing it from attaining dominance over the world economy; and keeping smaller hostile powers such as North Korea and Iran from obtaining the capacity to attack America or other democracies. ...
Rather than carelessly accumulate dependencies, the U.S. must ask where it can develop real allies — countries that share its commitment to a world of independent nations, pursue democratic self-determination (although not necessarily liberalism) at home, and are willing to pay the price for freedom by taking primary responsibility for their own defense...
As Hazony and Haivry argue, it is long past time for the bipartisan U.S. foreign policy ruling class to rethink shibboleths to which it has been recalcitrantly tethered. Turkey, which the authors properly highlight, is a prime example of an ""ally"" gone awry. Turkey was founded as a secular state out of the post-World War I ashes of the Ottoman Empire, and during the Cold War served as a NATO member (which it, unfathomably , still is) and key strategic linchpin against aspirational Soviet hegemony. But under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has become an irredeemably totalitarian, Islamist dictatorship that jails more journalists than any nation in the world and — along with Qatar — has long surpassed the (largely reformed, at least from an Islamist exportation perspective) Saudi monarchy as a top international funder of extremist Sunni madrasas abroad.
Is Turkey an ""ally"" because it is nominally still a part of NATO, or is it a geopolitical foe because it shills for Hamas, al-Qaeda, and even Islamic State — all whilst generally aligning with the Iran-Qatar-Muslim Brotherhood axis that wreaks destabilizing havoc all throughout the Middle East? The question ought to answer itself.
Rather than be dragged down by inherently Western Europe-centric transnational institutions such as NATO and the United Nations, U.S. foreign policy hands must wake up to the reality that, as Hazony and Haivry put it, ""China, Russia and hostile Islamist groups"" serve as the three largest threats for America this century. In a short tweet thread yesterday, I elaborated on the proper way to assess would-be U.S. alliances, under this analytical framework. America’s three big geopolitical threats this century are China, Russia, and Islamism—and it is time for our foreign policy elites to start formulating strategy, accordingly. — Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) April 7, 2019 A prime example of a country that many view as an “ally,” but which is really not an ally under this premise, is Germany. China has recently been Germany’s biggest trading partner. Germany is Putin's main energy export outlet. And Germany is infamously cozy with Iran/Hezbollah. — Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) April 7, 2019 Similarly, two prime examples of countries that many would not view as natural “allies,” but are under this premise, are Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Saudis and Emiratis are key U.S. partners in the fight against the Iran-Qatar-Turkey-Muslim Brotherhood axis of Islamism. — Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) April 7, 2019
Above all else, conservatives must articulate a hard-headed foreign policy that, if need be, subordinates amorphous ""values""-based concerns in favor of much more tangible — and much more legitimate — concerns about prioritizing and maximizing America's national security. And in so doing, American foreign policy hands ought not to elevate the interests and clout of unaccountable transnational institutions. Nor should America needlessly prolong the deleterious status quo of making satrapies of derelict nations too stingy or otherwise careless to provide for their own defense.
Rather, America ought to ally with self-sufficient nation-states who care about their sovereignty and share our core national security interests in deterring Russian hegemony, Chinese ambitions, and/or Islamist aggression. In Europe, that means focusing more on nations like Viktor Orban's Hungary than it does on nations like Angela Merkel's Germany or on institutions like NATO. In Asia, that means focusing more on nations like India and Japan than it does on institutions like the U.N. — and potentially even the exceedingly dovish current government of historic U.S. ally South Korea. And in the Islamic world, that means focusing more on nations like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates than it does on Islamist-exporting, Muslim Brotherhood-cozy states like Turkey and Qatar.
Hazony and Haivry have outlined a brilliant forward-looking foreign policy doctrine for the United States. With any luck, our bipartisan elites will follow their lead."
'Smallville' Actress Allison Mack Pleads Guilty To Charges In 'Sex Slave Cult' Case | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45703/breaking-smallville-actress-allison-mack-pleads-amanda-prestigiacomo,"'Smallville' Actress Allison Mack Pleads Guilty To Charges In 'Sex Slave Cult' Case Getty Images April 8, 2019 views
TV star Allison Mack pleaded guilty on Monday to charges concerning her involvement with a “sex slave cult” known as NXIVM. Mack, an alleged victim-turned-victimizer of the cult, pleaded guilty to manipulating women into becoming sex slaves for leader Keith Raniere. Allison Mack just left federal court in Brooklyn. She entered a plea to racketeering charges in connection to an alleged sex cult called NXIVM. She’s accused of recruiting sex slaves for its spiritual leader, Keith Raniere. pic.twitter.com/hI5xR387xf — Kevin Rincon (@KevRincon) April 8, 2019
“I believed Keith Raniere’s intentions were to help people ... and I was wrong,” Mack told a judge at a federal court in Brooklyn, according to the Associated Press.
“I know I can and will be a better person,” the actress added.
Mack claimed Raniere had her obtain “compromising information and images” of two women, who have not been named, and threaten them with leaking the sensitive information if they did not perform “acts of love” with Raniere.
“Court papers allege NXIVM formed a secret society of women who were branded with Raniere’s initials and forced to have sex with him. Defense attorneys have insisted any relationship between Raniere and the alleged victims, including an unidentified actress and other women expected to testify against him at trial, was consensual,” the AP report said.
Mack, who will now avoid trial with Raniere, is set for sentencing on September 11.
As reported by The Daily Wire last April, Mack was rumored to be one of the cult’s top recruiters. Past tweets from the actress, directed at high-profile Hollywood figures like actress Emma Watson and singer Kelly Clarkson, seemingly reveal some of her recruitment tactics.
For example, Mack tweeted messages to Watson on two occasions in 2016, appealing to the “Harry Potter” star’s noted feminist sensibilities.
""I'm a fellow actress like yourself & involved in an amazing women's movement I think you'd dig. I'd love to chat if you're open,"" posted Mack.
Another tweet from the actress directed at Watson read, ""I participate in a unique human development & women's movement I'd love to tell you about. As a fellow actress I can relate so well to your vision and what you want to see in the world. I think we could work together. Let me know if you're willing to chat.”
Addressing Clarkson in 2013, Mack tweeted, ""I heard through the grapevine that you're a fan of Smallville. I'm a fan of yours as well! I'd love to chat sometime.”
Another actress and former member of the alleged sex cult, Sarah Edmondson, recalled having to “bow” to Raniere, whom she and others refered to as “Vanguard.""
“You know that's a red flag,” wrote Edmondson in a piece for VICE Canada, “but it was easily explainable: Everyone has titles—doctors have titles, and sensei has a title. We refer to people based on what they've earned. Vanguard's earned this title, and it means leader of a philosophical movement. Nothing weird about that. We wear sashes. But sashes are just like in martial arts. Nothing weird about that. So everything that I had an issue with was easily explained away.”
“I thought this was the key to success and happiness,” she recalled feeling early on. “But there was also this nugget that they left you with—that there was this problem with you that you had to resolve, and of course, that required more trainings. So even though I felt empowered there was always this recognition that I had to evolve this thing within myself to be fully happy. It almost created a dependency.”"

On Monday, after President Trump designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps a “foreign terrorist organization,” the theocratic regime on Iran, Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, retaliated by naming U.S. Central Command a terrorist group, according to Iran's Fars News Agency .
The Hill reported, “The council, headed by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, added that Trump’s move poses a 'major threat to regional and international peace and security and grossly violates the rules of international law.'"" That move was apparently prompted by a request to do so in a letter from Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to Rouhani.
Trump had stated, “This action will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism.” The Wall Street Journal reported, “The designation also allows the U.S. to subject IRGC officials and those who provide support to the organization to travel restrictions and lets U.S. prosecutors bring charges against those who provide ‘material support’ to the IRGC.”
Prior to the announcement from the Trump administration, IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafa huffed, “If the Americans do such stupidity and put our national security at risk, the U.S. Army and security forces in the West Asia region will not enjoy today’s peace.” The Journal noted that on Sunday, 255 out of 290 Iranian parliamentarians threatened, “We will answer any action taken against this force with a reciprocal action. So the leaders of America, who themselves are the creators and supporters of terrorists in the region, will regret this inappropriate and idiotic action.”
The history of the IRGC is replete with connections to terrorism; Nathan Sales, the State Department’s coordinator for counterterrorism, warned that engaging with the IRGC could trigger a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
The State Department has written of the Quds Force, which is part of the IRGC:
The Qods Force, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC; aka Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps), provides material support to the Taliban, Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC).
The Qods Force is the Iranian regime’s primary instrument for providing lethal support to the Taliban. The Qods Force provides weapons and financial support to the Taliban to support anti-U.S. and anti-Coalition activity in Afghanistan. Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged frequent shipments of small arms and associated ammunition, rocket propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107mm rockets, plastic explosives, and probably man-portable defense systems to the Taliban. This support contravenes Chapter VII UN Security Council obligations. UN Security Council resolution 1267 established sanctions against the Taliban and UN Security Council resolutions 1333 and 1735 imposed arms embargoes against the Taliban. Through Qods Force material support to the Taliban, we believe Iran is seeking to inflict casualties on U.S. and NATO forces.
The Qods Force has had a long history of supporting Hizballah’s military, paramilitary, and terrorist activities, providing it with guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and logistical support. The Qods Force operates training camps for Hizballah in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley and has reportedly trained more than 3,000 Hizballah fighters at IRGC training facilities in Iran. The Qods Force provides roughly $100 to $200 million in funding a year to Hizballah and has assisted Hizballah in rearming in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701.
In addition, the Qods Force provides lethal support in the form of weapons, training, funding, and guidance to select groups of Iraqi Shi’a militants who target and kill Coalition and Iraqi forces and innocent Iraqi civilians.
In August 2017, Brig. Gen. Ismail Ghaani, the deputy commander of the Quds Force, bragged that his operatives had killed more Americans than U.S. troops had killed Iranian fighters."
"Former Auburn Football Coach Announces Senate Run, #MAGA Support | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45675/former-auburn-football-coach-announces-senate-run-james-barrett,"Former Auburn Football Coach Announces Senate Run, #MAGA Support Kevin C. Cox/WireImage April 8, 2019 views
On Saturday, Tommy Tuberville — who became a national name during his ten-year highly successful run as the head football coach at Auburn University, during which time his team pulled off a perfect season but was famously left out of the BCS National Championship Game — announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate to represent Alabama in 2020. The seat is currently filled by Democrat Doug Jones, who narrowly edged out scandal-plagued Republican Roy Moore in the 2017 special election to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions after President Trump named him attorney general.
""After more than a year of listening to Alabama’s citizens, I have heard your concerns and hopes for a better tomorrow. I am humbled to announce the next step — I will be a @GOP candidate for US Senate. I invite you to join my team,"" Tuberville announced on Twitter Saturday, notably including the MAGA hashtag at the end of the tweet: ""#TeamTommy #ALSen #MAGA."" After more than a year of listening to Alabama’s citizens, I have heard your concerns and hopes for a better tomorrow. I am humbled to announce the next step -- I will be a @GOP candidate for US Senate. I invite you to join my team. https://t.co/jlW8VdXpoq #TeamTommy #ALSen #MAGA — Tommy Tuberville (@TTuberville) April 6, 2019
The tweet links to his campaign site, TommyForSenate , which reiterates the announcement and invites supporters to sign up and volunteer.
After making his head coaching debut at Ole Miss, where he coached for four seasons (1995-98) and went 25-20 (.556), Tuberville was named head coach of Auburn, where he spent nearly half of his 21-year coaching career and won at the highest percentage of his career. He took over as head coach of Auburn in 1999 and stayed through the 2008 season, during which time he went 85-40 (.680) and led the team to eight straight winning seasons, including one undefeated season in 2004 (undefeated USC and undefeated Oklahama played for the BCS National Championship that year; Auburn ended up ranked 2nd after winning its bowl game). Tuberville went on to be the head coach of Texas Tech for three years (2010-2012) and Cincinnati for four (2013-16). Over the entirety of his head coaching career, he won at a rate of just over 60%, 159-99 (.616).
Should he win the primary, Tuberville's Democratic opponent would be incumbent Doug Jones, who only managed to defeat embattled Republican Roy Moore by a margin of 1.5% (49.9-48.4) despite Moore's disastrous campaign that was characterized by a series of deeply damaging accusations which prompted a massive rift among Republicans.
While the 2017 contest was a special election that included a divisive Republican candidate, the 2020 presidential election will inevitably draw more voters, which will likely benefit Republicans, as there is strong support among Alabama voters for Trump — in fact, the state has consistently been among the strongest in Trump support in the nation.
Tuberville will be facing off against Republican Congressman Bradley Byrne , who announced his candidacy for the seat two months ago. Byrne currently represents Alabama's first congressional district.
Byrne, a former Democrat, made clear when he announced in February that he supports President Trump. ""So far, I don’t know of anything where he and I fundamentally disagree,"" he said of the president, though he did express concern about some of his trade policies. Doug Jones, however, he said, ""is against building the wall."" Byrne also stressed his pro-life and pro-gun record, contrasting that with Jones. "
"Beto...Over? After A Stellar Start, O'Rourke Campaign Fumbles | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45735/betoover-after-stellar-start-orourke-campaign-emily-zanotti,"Beto...Over? After A Stellar Start, O'Rourke Campaign Fumbles Scott Eisen/Getty Images April 8, 2019 views
Beto O'Rourke's campaign to be president started out well enough, but things haven't exactly taken off as expected for the former Member of Congress and once-failed Senate candidate from Texas.
O'Rourke's fundraising began with a bang; the candidate, who had never before launched a national campaign, raised $6.1 million in under 24 hours, besting a previous record set by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). But unlike Sanders, O'Rourke's numbers haven't gone up since he announced his interest in the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and according to Politico , he's mired in the middle of the pack, competing against only second-string candidates.
Sanders is ""far ahead"" in both polling and fundraising (though he's still running several points behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't even entered the race yet), and O'Rourke is now trailing South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who quickly supplanted O'Rourke as the young upstart Democratic ""golden child,"" raising an impressive $7 million in just a few days on the stump, and drawing much larger crowds and much more media attention.
Beto's also having a tough time drawing audiences in early primary states like Iowa. According to Washington Examiner reporter Joe Simonson, who has been following both O'Rourke's and Sanders' campaigns around Iowa, there's no question who voters are more interested in. beto had a hard time filling the room, my latest from iowa city https://t.co/a6nWovkfNi pic.twitter.com/DYa6etGgq6 — Joe Gabriel Simonson (@SaysSimonson) April 8, 2019
""O'Rourke, 46, a former Texas congressman, started 30 minutes late, and the University of Iowa student union ballroom remained less than half filled as the candidate gave his pitch to fewer than 120 students, families, and retirees before taking questions. Many of those were not committed to O'Rourke,"" the Examiner reported.
That also might be an inflated number. According to the report, several students were there to get extra credit for college classes. One student who spoke to Simonson told him that he actually preferred former tech executive Andrew Yang for the Democratic nomination.
The media presence surrounding O'Rourke, the Examiner says, is also dwindling, but O'Rourke, at least, has a rosy outlook on things.
“I’m learning, I’m becoming a better candidate,” O’Rourke told reporters following his speech.“There are fewer members of the media as we’re leaving these events. I like that the ratio has changed a little bit as we have moved on, but I’m really struck by how kind people are, how seriously they take their responsibility to themselves and the rest of the country.”
One clear indication that O'Rourke is having difficulty distancing himself from other Democratic candidates is his recent rhetoric. The normally soft-spoken Texan, who prefers standing on countertops to talk with everyday Americans in coffee shops and breakfast-only diners, and who campaigned for Senate on his ""common sense"" progressive approach, has taken to parroting talking points that put him far left of the 2020 field.
Over the weekend, Fox News reports , O'Rourke took aim at President Donald Trump, but instead of sticking to tried-and-true critiques, he embraced a faulty meme circling social media that accused the president of calling asylum seekers at the United States-Mexican border, ""animals."" The video, from a year ago, showed Trump answering a question about the violent Mexican and Central American street gang, MS-13, and was cut for maximum impact.
O'Rourke also compared Trump's administration to the Third Reich — Nazi Germany — a comparison he drew heat for from Holocaust preservation groups (and historians).
Beto still has a national donor list left over from his previous Senate campaign, and he says his operation is ""maturing."" He even turned down an offer to accompany an Iowa student to prom. "

Laura Ingraham Slams ‘Sanctimonious And Self-Righteous’ Pete Buttigieg | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45763/laura-ingraham-slams-sanctimonious-and-self-paul-bois,"Laura Ingraham Slams ‘Sanctimonious And Self-Righteous’ Pete Buttigieg ""Comes off as more sanctimonious and self-righteous than most Evangelical Christians"" Alex Wong / Staff / Getty Images April 9, 2019 views
Fox News host Laura Ingraham is having none of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Peter Buttigieg's apparently self-righteous attitude toward Christians and called him out for it on social media.
""Mayor Pete comes off as more sanctimonious and self-righteous here than most Evangelical Christians I've met,"" Ingraham tweeted. Mayor Pete comes off as more sanctimonious and self-righteous here than most Evangelical Christians I've met: ""Buttigieg to Pence: 'Your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator'"" @CNNPolitics https://t.co/wrm13pRdtE — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) April 8, 2019
The media has been gaga over Buttigieg as a potential 2020 contender despite the fact he made the political faux-pas of insulting voters, accusing Evangelical Christians of hypocrisy for supporting President Trump.
""It's something that really frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable,"" Buttigieg said on "" Meet The Press ."" ""Here you have somebody who not only acts in a way that is not consistent with anything that I hear in scripture in church.""
Shortly thereafter, Buttigieg gave a speech at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington where he called out ""the Mike Pences of the world"" for believing homosexual actions were sinful.
""If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,"" Buttigieg said. “And that’s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me ― your quarrel, Sir, is with my creator.""
What is most odd about Buttigieg getting so aggressive toward Christians for having a biblical worldview on sexuality is that he recently took a more moderate stance on identity politics when speaking about his love for the fast food empire Chick-fil-a.
""I do not approve of their politics, but I kind of approve of their chicken,"" Buttigieg said on an interview with the Breakfast Club . ""So maybe if nothing else, I can build that bridge. Maybe I’ll become in a position to broker that peace deal.""
In the same interview, Buttigieg said that identities should not be a wall that pushes people away and should be used as a means of empathy.
""We’ve got to find a way to use our identities to reach other people,"" he said. ""To me, there are two things that can happen when you are conscious of your identity. One is it turns into all these ways we separate ourselves from each other, and it just turns into one big 'You don’t know me.' But the other way we can do it is to say, 'Okay, I’ve got this experience, you’ve got that experience, what can we talk about that brings us together?'""
Buttigieg added that nobody knows what it's like to walk in another's shoes and how we would do better to learn that. ""I have no clue what it’s like to walk in the shoes of so many other people,"" he said. ""But I can talk about some of the pieces of what I carry with me, and see if it rhymes with their life experience. And I think good art has that, good music has that, good literature has that.""
So why the sudden pivot? According to The Daily Wire's Michael Knowles, Buttigieg has no choice but to play the victim card if he wants to stand out among the 2020 contenders.
""To stand a chance in 2020, the elite young mayor must somehow portray himself as an aggrieved victim,"" Knowles said. ""That leaves Buttigieg only one option at the moment: to make his sexuality the central issue of his campaign, and to make his case in bad faith."""
Former Obama Official Defends Previous Administration’s Family Separations: ‘It Was For Their Protection’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45813/former-obama-official-defends-previous-ashe-schow,"April 10, 2019 views
Whenever the media screeches about President Donald Trump “putting kids in cages,” one can be sure the screecher is not fully familiar with the situation and does not actually care about the situation outside of politics.
When the news of family separations first “broke,” journalists were using a photo and an article showing children locked in chain-linked cages, like one would see at an animal shelter. The only problem, as many on the Right pointed out , is that the photo and article were from 2014, when Barack Obama was president, not Donald Trump.
The media has since shown outrage over the separations of families at the border due to the Trump administration’s previous “zero-tolerance” policy for crossing the border. But as Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro wrote last year , the media’s facts are wrong:
“Trump isn’t forcing children away from parents. He’s enforcing the law on the books. The legislature can fix that law at any time. The facilities he’s using are the same facilities Obama used. Pretending that this is Japanese internment (as Laura Bush suggested) or the Holocaust (as General Michael Hayden suggested) is ridiculous. This policy ought to be fixed. But lying about it isn’t designed to fix it. It’s designed to prevent a fix by allowing Democrats to play political football with children, believing they’re winning a victory by holding Trump’s feet to the fire with pictures of crying children.”
But the media continues to handle the issue irresponsibly. On CNN Tuesday night, host Wolf Blitzer allowed a former Obama official (without designating her as such) to defend family separations under Obama as somehow benevolent, instead of Trump’s allegedly evil reasons. Sam Vinograd, a national security analyst for CNN who previously worked for Obama’s National Security Council claimed that when Obama separated children, he did so “for their protection.”
“When President Obama separated children from their families, Wolf, or from adults, Wolf, it was for their protection. It was if there was a risk of trafficking or other kind of harm that might have been incurred,” Vinograd said during a discussion of family separations. “But even if he did do that, why is Donald Trump saying that two wrongs make a right? Again, Obama wasn’t wrong, but so he’s saying that because something happened under President Obama, he’s repeating it and upping the ante. That’s an incredibly poor excuse. He’s systemized that inhumane treatment that, again, Obama was doing to protect the children.”
There is zero evidence that absolutely every separation under Obama was to get children away from traffickers and absolutely every separation under Trump was done for whatever racist intentions the media impugns onto Trump. In fact, a Senate report from January 2016, while Obama was still president, found that the Department of Health and Human Services had actually given more than a dozen immigrant children to human traffickers because it failed to adequately conduct background checks. The New York Times even reported on the situation.
And even if children were separated “for their protection,” why were they put in cages, as photos from the Obama years show?
Families were being separated under the Trump administration while adult family members – or the adult accompanying the child – was held in jail for illegally crossing the border. The Left’s argument against the separation essentially amounts to either not arresting people for breaking the law if they bring children along with them or putting kids in jail along with the adults who committed a crime.
There are many issues with the situation, but lies and distortions help no one. "
Staff Quit U.K. National Health Service Over Transgender Experiment On Children | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45812/staff-quit-uk-national-health-service-over-paul-bois,"Staff Quit U.K. National Health Service Over Transgender Experiment On Children ""There was a huge number of children in danger."" NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty Images April 10, 2019 views
A scientifically unproven experiment on children suffering from gender dysphoria at a NHS gender clinic in the U.K. has led to as many as 18 resignations from clinicians.
""They believe that some gay children struggling with their sexuality are being wrongly diagnosed as 'transgender' by the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) clinic,"" reports The Times of London . ""All five former staff were responsible for deciding which trans-identifying youngsters should be given hormone blockers to halt their sexual development. The vast majority of those who begin blockers go on to irreversible cross-sex hormones once they reach 16.""
Over the past decade, the number of children referred to the clinic has skyrocketed from just 94 in 2010 to a whopping 2,519 just last year. At the clinic, treatment can begin at an age as young as three. Often, the children are subjected to the experiment without proper assessment from an expert as to the nature of their gender confusion, according to some NHS specialists.
""I felt for the last two years what kept me in the job was the sense there was a huge number of children in danger. I was there to protect children from being damaged,"" one clinician told The Times.
""This experimental treatment is being done on not only children, but [on] very vulnerable children,"" said another.
The five clinicians that spoke with The Times pointed the blame at transgender advocacy charities like ""Mermaids"" for making the false claim that gender transitioning in children will suddenly cure them of their dysphoria and concomitant emotional distress. For reasons political, not medical, the clinicians claim they were often put under intense pressure to subject children to the experiment — despite the lack of a proper medical assessment.
""The specialists expressed concern that many children decided they wanted to change gender after suffering homophobic bullying,"" reports The Times. ""Yet these young people were still referred down the route of hormone treatment, they claimed, without clinicians always exploring the possibility they may simply be gay. One clinician said that she feared the use of hormone therapy for such children could result in a scandal.""
Children who have already started puberty can be given hormone blockers, which completely stops the body's development in its tracks. Though the blockers can be reversed, little is known on the effect they have on the brain.
The GIDS clinic has denied all accusations, saying their service respects each and every individual case.
In the United States, Dr. Michelle Cretella, M.D., F.C.P., president of the American College of Pediatricians, has denounced gender transitioning in children as child abuse.
""When it comes to what is causing rising numbers of people to identify as transgender, all teenagers go through a phase known as ‘gender formation,"" Cretella said at a talk in Rhode Island last year. ""During this time, she says, a certain number are susceptible to 'marketing' that they are 'trapped in the wrong body.'""
Cretella has also written that biological sex goes all the way back to a human being's conception and that sexuality is an unchangeable binary.
""Biological sex is not assigned,"" she wrote. ""Sex is determined at conception by our DNA and is stamped into every cell of our bodies. Human sexuality is binary. You either have a normal Y chromosome, and develop into a male, or you don’t, and you will develop into a female. There are at least 6,500 genetic differences between men and women. Hormones and surgery cannot change this."""
REPORT: ‘Leaving Neverland’ Discrepancy Found In Key Part Of Film Denouncing Michael Jackson | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Jeffrey Cawood,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45819/report-leaving-neverland-discrepancy-found-key-jeffrey-cawood,"
A British journalist said he found a significant discrepancy in HBO’s “Leaving Neverland” documentary, raising questions about the film’s credibility and its graphic molestation allegations against the late international entertainment icon, Michael Jackson.
Since its release a month ago, several tabloids in the United Kingdom have published a series of critiques based on the research of reporter Mike Smallcombe, who also authored a biography on the King of Pop. He says his most damning discovery focuses on a claim made by James Safechuck, who has repeatedly said that he was sexually abused by Jackson from 1988 to 1992, ending when he was 14 years old.
In what The New York Times described as “one of the most uncomfortable sequences in the film,” Safechuck recounted multiple locations on Jackson’s California Neverland Valley Ranch where he said inappropriate interactions took place.
“At the train station, there was a room upstairs, and we would have sex up there too,” Safechuck alleged . NEW: James Safechuck's story of being abused by Michael Jackson in Neverland's train station has been derailed https://t.co/bEzq0Lyc7u — Mike Smallcombe (@mikesmallcombe1) March 30, 2019
However, Smallcombe obtained building permits last week that he says discredit Safechuck’s story.
“Construction on Neverland’s train station didn’t start until the latter part of 1993, and it didn’t open until the first part of 1994, when Safechuck was 16,” Smallcombe told The Mirror Online.
“So abuse in the train station wasn’t possible if the abuse stopped in 1992, as he claims in his testimony, as it didn’t even exist then.”
“Between February 1994 and December 1994, Jackson was living in Trump Tower in New York recording his HIStory album,” Smallcombe added.
“By the time Jackson was at Neverland and the train station was actually open, it was early 1995, three years after Safechuck said the abuse stopped,” he continued. “And by then Safechuck was 17, and on the cusp of adulthood.” Yeah there seems to be no doubt about the station date. The date they have wrong is the end of the abuse. — Dan Reed (@danreed1000) March 31, 2019
“Leaving Neverland” director Dan Reed acknowledged that Safechuck’s timeline of events was flawed but continued to defend his accusations, tweeting : “Yeah there seems to be no doubt about the station date. The date they have wrong is the end of the abuse.” So @danreed1000 is now saying because the story has been debunked, suddenly the end of Safechuck’s abuse was when he was 16/17 rather than 14. It’s a three year discrepancy. Just hold your hands up, don’t change the story. This is what happens when you don’t investigate properly. https://t.co/EydUEztVJJ — Mike Smallcombe (@mikesmallcombe1) March 31, 2019
Reed went on to state that “Safechuck was at Neverland both before and after the construction of the train station there,” suggesting sexual encounters might have continued into his postpubescent years. “Leaving Neverland” critics say Reed’s elaboration conflicts with a central theme of his documentary.
“A huge part of the movie’s narrative is that Jackson lost sexual interest in these boys when they reached the age of 14, supposedly because that is when puberty hit,” explained John Ziegler, a senior columnist for Mediaite. Nope. No u-turn. No clash of dates. James was present at Neverland before and after the train station was built. In fact he took photos of the completed station which we included in the doc. And his sexual contact with Michael lasted into his teens. That’s all in the film. — Dan Reed (@danreed1000) April 2, 2019
On Monday, The Mirror reported that “the story has taken another turn as it’s emerged that two Jackson biographers both wrote about another train station on the grounds of the estate, which was there in 1990.”
Those accounts were dismissed by Smallcombe on Tuesday morning. He referenced “source notes” in one of the cited books which he claimed clarified that the author’s “description of what Neverland might have looked like to visitors in 1990 was in fact based on a 2003 sheriff’s department video.” Smallcombe said the other publication “did not say the train station was there” in 1990 and was penned by a ghostwriter collaborating with two bodyguards who “did not start working for Jackson until the mid-2000s.” I'm inundated with messages about a couple of mock-up tabloid stories regarding the Neverland train station - again. Here is a statement which should address those false stories. The bottom line is, Neverland's one and only train station opened in 1994. pic.twitter.com/UkO70qYbfn — Mike Smallcombe (@mikesmallcombe1) April 9, 2019 This is a photo of the Neverland Ranch taken on August 25, 1993 by photographer Steven D Starr. On Getty. There is no train station, only a floral clock (top of image). pic.twitter.com/2dwmt3DsgZ — Mike Smallcombe (@mikesmallcombe1) April 9, 2019
Safechuck, now 41, along with “Leaving Neverland’s” other accuser, Wade Robson, 36, defended Jackson’s honor when the singer was alive but filed lawsuits against his estate asking for millions of dollars after his death. The cases were dismissed and are currently under appeal, according to a lawyer who represents both Safechuck and Robson.
“Safechuck’s train station fiction is one of several lies in this film which shows that neither the director or HBO ever bothered to verify the claims made by these accusers,” said Howard Weitzman, an attorney for the Jackson estate, in a statement .
“I believe for the accusers, the director and HBO this has always been about the money and ratings,” Weitzman continued.
The Jackson estate filed a lawsuit against HBO earlier this year saying the cable network violated a non-disparagement agreement with the late pop star. According to the court filing, damages could exceed $100 million.

Devout Catholic Farmers Barred From Farmer's Market Fight City In Michigan | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45840/devout-catholic-farmers-barred-farmers-market-hank-berrien,"Devout Catholic Farmers Barred From Farmer's Market Fight City In Michigan Barred because they wouldn't host same-sex wedding Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/UIG via Getty Images April 10, 2019 views
In 2016, a devoutly Catholic couple in East Lansing, Michigan, who are both military veterans and own their own organic farm, were kicked out of the local farmer’s market after they refused to host a same-sex wedding on their farm. In 2017, a court issued a preliminary order to permit Steve and Bridget Tennes, owners of Country Mill Farms, to return to the farmer’s market; on Friday, Steve Tennes will join the Alliance Defending Freedom in federal court to request a permanent order forcing the city of East Lansing to allow them to participate in the farmer’s market.
ADF Senior Counsel and Vice President of Appellate Advocacy John Bursch, former solicitor general of Michigan, asserted, “Courts have rightfully and repeatedly rejected this type of religious hostility, as recently as the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case . That is why we are asking the district court to issue an order that permanently prevents East Lansing from unconstitutionally targeting Steve on the basis of his beliefs. The city’s response to Steve’s beliefs reeks of anti-religious discrimination.”
In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 in favor of Colorado cake artist Jack Phillips in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission . ADF represented Phillips; Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Kristen Waggoner, who argued the case, stated , “Jack serves all customers; he simply declines to express messages or celebrate events that violate his deeply held beliefs. Creative professionals who serve all people should be free to create art consistent with their convictions without the threat of government punishment.”
ADF Senior Counsel Kate Anderson stated, “All Americans should be free to live and speak according to their deeply held religious beliefs without fear of government punishment. Yet East Lansing officials changed their market policy to shut out Steve Tennes because they don’t like his Catholic beliefs regarding marriage. That unconstitutional discrimination is what led to the court’s temporary order in favor of Steve in 2017.”
The sequence of events went like this: prior to 2016, the Tennes family, which employs a diversified group of people including some who are LGBT, had attended the farmer’s market for seven years. But in 2016, the couple was asked on Facebook if they would host a same-sex wedding. Tennes said on Facebook that he believed in biblical marriage between one man and one woman, precipitating the city's action. Yet the Tennes farm is 22 miles from East Lansing, outside the city’s boundaries and beyond its jurisdiction.
ADF noted that during a public debate, a city council member said Tennes’ Catholic beliefs were “ridiculous, horrible, [and] hateful things.” ADF added that the mayor of East Lansing criticized Tennes for translating his “Catholic view on marriage” into a business practice.
ADF pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Obergefell and again in Masterpiece that the government must respect the belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. ADF also noted that only weeks prior to the city’s efforts to ban the Tennes family farm from the farmer’s market, the city publicly praised Country Mill Farms, posting, “We love The Country Mill!” on its farmer’s market Facebook page."
"Three Naked Women Stand Outside Rest Stop To 'Air Dry,' Trooper Shows Up, Then Things Get Really Out Of Control | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45896/three-naked-women-stand-outside-rest-stop-air-dry-james-barrett,"Three Naked Women Stand Outside Rest Stop To 'Air Dry,' Trooper Shows Up, Then Things Get Really Out Of Control Brian Blanco/Getty Images April 12, 2019 views
What started off with three women's poor decision to ""air dry"" after taking a shower at a rest stop quickly escalated into a multi-phase car chase, threats against a trooper with a baseball bat, an attempt to run over an officer, all three women getting tased, and drug and alcohol charges.
In a wild media alert issued by the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) on Wednesday, Public Affairs Officer Sgt. Steve Gaskins details a rest stop incident that quickly devolved from bizarre to potentially deadly.
""On Wednesday April 10, 2019, at approximately 11:15 AM, FHP units in Pasco county were dispatched to a suspicious persons call at the northbound I-75 rest area, south of State Road 54,"" the alert reads. ""Trooper Danielle Poulin arrived on the scene and observed three black females naked, who stated that they had showered and were 'air drying.'""
According to one witness, the women were all standing out in the nude and applying suntan lotion, The Smoking Gun notes. While the three naked women responded to Officer Poulin's initial question, they suddenly bolted.
""As Trooper Poulin attempted to gather information, the three subjects ran and got into a white 2009 Nissan Sentra and fled through the northbound rest area entrance (heading southbound) before turning back northbound,"" Gaskins explains. ""They then traveled north on I-75 toward State Road 52. Trooper Poulin initiated a pursuit; however, was canceled due to the pursuit not fitting FHP criteria.""
Though Poulin stopped pursuing, a citizen soon called in a ""347"" to report reckless driving, prompting another trooper, Christopher Brando, to respond. Seeing the Sentra ""driving in the wrong direction briefly,"" Trooper Brando initiated pursuit eastbound on State Road 52. Deploying StarChase projectiles (a tagging system that allows police to track a vehicle), Brando backed off and troopers were able to track the vehicle to a convenience store parking lot on the road.
They found the Sentra empty, the three women having entered the store (and apparently having put on clothes by this point). The situation got even more intense at this point.
""As the three females exited the store and got into the car, Trooper Ronald Paulin attempted to take one of the females into custody who had not made it back into the vehicle,"" the alert reads. ""While Trooper Paulin was attempting to arrest that subect, the driver purposely drove directly at Trooper Paulin who had to disengage and jump back to avoid being struck by the car.""
""The other passenger exited the vehicle with a metal bat in an effort to assault Trooper Paulin,"" Gaskins continues. ""Sgt. Dennis Rich, seeing that Trooper Paulin was in imminent danger, rammed the suspect vehicle with his marked patrol vehicle, and the vehicle fled again, eastbound on State Road 52.""
Now in the second phase of the high-speed pursuit, the Dade City Police Department came to help the troopers, deploying stop sticks, which deflated the Sentra's right-side tires. ""Due to the aggravated assault charges and the totality of the circumstance,"" Gaskins underscores, Brando was then given approval to use his vehicle to nudge the Sentra enough to make it spend to a stop.
Trooper Brando's actions successfully brought the chase to an end, but the women weren't done resisting arrest, refusing to exit the vehicle. With the women refusing to get out, Paulin used his baton to ""break out the vehicle windows."" But they still wouldn't comply, having ""interlocked their arms together in the vehicle.""
""As a result, all three were tasered, taken into custody, and transported to the Pasco County Jail,"" the alert states.
The women have been charged with ""fleeing to elude, resisting arrest, aggravated assault, indecent exposure, and marijuana possession,"" The Smoking Gun reports. One of the women was also charged with a DUI."
WATCH: Maxine Waters Chairs The Financial Services Committee. This Embarrassing Clip Is Evidence She Shouldn't. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45898/watch-maxine-waters-chairs-financial-services-amanda-prestigiacomo,"April 12, 2019 views
Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), who has been a member of the House Financial Services Committee since 1991, was named chair of the committee in December. But a recent clip of Ms. Waters showcasing her ignorance with regard to student loans might make one question whether she is qualified for such a leadership position.
On Wednesday, the Democrat grilled the CEOs of various big banks about what they are doing to help with the student loan debt crisis. In an embarrassing exchange for Waters, the CEOs, one by one, informed the congresswoman that the Obama administration had actually ""cut out the middle man"" in 2010 so that the federal government now directly issues such loans, as noted by The Blaze.
In other words: Banks aren’t issuing federally guaranteed loans anymore, and haven’t been doing so for nearly a decade. This was clearly news to Ms. Waters on Wednesday — not exactly comforting.
After the Democrat grilled the bank CEOs about — you guessed it — Russia, she inquired: ""What are you guys doing to help us with the student loan debt?""
""Who would like to answer first? Mr. [Brian] Monahan, big bank?"" Waters asked.
Monahan, the CEO of Bank of America, answered, ""We stopped making student loans in 2007 or so.""
Waters then moved on to Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat, who replied, ""We exited student lending in 2009.""
Undeterred, the California Democrat asked JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon the same question. ""When the government took over student lending in 2010 or so, we stopped doing all student lending,"" Dimon explained.
The lightbulb finally turned on for Waters, and she moved on to her next question.
Waters’ embarrassing behavior also manifested in another exchange on Wednesday, when the chair refused to formally dismiss Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin from a hearing in which he had been testifying for over three and a half hours so that he could attend an important meeting with a foreign official. Ms. Waters acknowledged that she knew about the meeting in advance, but she was still obstinate and uncooperative.
""I’ve sat here for over three hours and 15 minutes. I’ve told you I’ll come back. I just don’t believe we’re sitting here negotiating when I come back. We’ll follow up with your office. How long would you like me to come back for next time? I told you I would accommodate you,"" protested Secretary Mnuchin to Waters.
""This is a new way. And it's a new day. And it's a new chair. And I have the gavel at this point. If you wish to leave you may,"" she responded.
""Can you clarify that for me?"" the secretary asked.
""Yes, 'clarify' is this: If you wish to leave, you may,"" Waters repeated.
""So, we’re dismissed? Is that correct?"" Mnuchin again asked.
""If you wish to leave, you may leave,"" a defiant Waters said again.
Mnuchin ended up leaving the hearing without Mr. Waters’ formal dismissal and clarified that he would not be coming back for further questioning on the issue, due to his treatment.
Waters, who was once named one of the most corrupt members in Congress by an ethics committee, has become a #Resistance hero for her incessant calls to impeach President Donald Trump. She is affectionally referred to by some on the Left as ""Auntie Maxine.""

NY Press Club Announces 'Truth To Power' Award Winner: Acosta | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45929/ny-press-club-announces-truth-power-award-winner-hank-berrien,"NY Press Club Announces 'Truth To Power' Award Winner: Acosta Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images
On Friday, The New York Press Club announced the recipient of their “Truth to Power” award: CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta. The award honors “an individual whose body of work challenges the power establishment and/or defends journalists,” as The Wrap reported.
In the press release accompanying the announcement, Jane Tillman Irving, president of the Press Club, stated, “We are proud to honor a man such as Jim Acosta, who has proven himself throughout his storied, decades-long career to be a journalist of the utmost integrity. For his unwavering commitment to fact and journalism, we are pleased to add to Jim’s many accolades with the Gabe Pressman 'Truth to Power' award."" CNN promoted Acosta to chief White House correspondent in January 2018.
Acosta has relished his role in trumpeting his antagonism to President Trump for at least the last year-and-a-half; in June 2017, he tweeted, “Does this feel like America? Where the White House takes q's from conservatives, then openly trashes the news media in the briefing room.” Does this feel like America? Where the White House takes q's from conservatives, then openly trashes the news media in the briefing room. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 27, 2017
After Acosta badgered presidential adviser Stephen Miller when Miller was outlining the key elements of Sens. Tom Cotton and David Perdue’s immigration bill, called the RAISE Act, author David Limbaugh wrote , “Acosta was particularly hostile and rude, making pointed statements masked as questions, refusing to allow Miller the courtesy of responding and repeatedly interrupting him. It was as if Acosta imagined himself on the CNN debate show ‘Crossfire,’ forgot to do his homework and assumed he would be declared the winner if he monopolized the exchange with rudeness, arrogance, volume and ignorance.”
In January 2018, The Daily Wire listed Acosta’s five worst moments with the White House, including melting down when White Press Secretary Sean Spicer wouldn’t turn the cameras on, blasting what he called President Trump’s ""Fake News"" press conference by using fake news himself, chastising Trump for not revealing publicly how many troops the U.S. had deployed, and getting embarrassed by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders not once, but twice.
Other noteworthy moments from Acosta: throwing a hissy fit when Secret Service Agents asked to see his media credentials in May 2018; yelling at Trump during a White House tax bill event in June 2018; “fact-checking” Trump only to get “fact-checked” himself in October 2018; infamously having his mic taken away after he would not stop asking questions, thus preventing others from doing so; having his “hard pass” taken away by the Secret Service; reportedly having other CNN reporters say privately , “This isn’t the Jim F*ing Acosta Show. We all hate him. He’s an asshole and he actually is disrespectful to the president”; getting slammed indirectly by CBS News’ Major Garrett for his obnoxious behavior, and finally, unsurprisingly, revealing that he was writing his own book about the Trump administration and its battles with the news media.
Most recently, Acosta complained in March after he was not called on by Trump during a press conference with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, adding, ""The president has, you know, a gazillion Twitter followers. He has a massive presence on Instagram, has a massive presence on Fakebook — Facebook. So do lots of other conservative figures here in the U.S. and so, you know, the president — he likes to talk about how there's this media collusion game that is stacked against him when he has one of the most powerful social media voices throughout. And so I think that just has to be said as well, it has to be put on the record that he is sort of, you know, pulling a three card monty in terms of, you know, how he's describing the situation."""
MALKIN: False Accuser Shaun King's Record Of Harm | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Michelle Malkin,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45937/malkin-false-accuser-shaun-kings-record-harm-michelle-malkin,"April 13, 2019 views
This week, ""journalist, activist and humanitarian"" Shaun King will give a keynote speech at the annual Innocence Network conference in Atlanta, Georgia. The theme of the event, whose attendees work to prevent and undo wrongful convictions, is ""The Presumption of Innocence.""
I've covered many flabbergasting things over the course of 25 years as a columnist, author, blogger and documentary host, but this one takes the cake.
It was just three months ago that King recklessly exploited the shooting death of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes in Houston, Texas, to stoke racial fear and hatred. The little girl and her family, who are black, got caught in crossfire at a Walmart parking lot. The Black Lives Matter activist and columnist for the Intercept immediately pounced — using his huge Twitter platform, followed by 1.1 million people, to cast the incident as a racial hate crime. King splashed a photo of Robert Cantrell, a white man who had been arrested for robbery the same day as the Barnes shooting, all over social media.
""We've had 20 people call or email us and say he is a racist, violent a—hole and always has been. Just tell me everything you know,"" Social Justice Detective King incited on Twitter. Cantrell's family members faced vitriol and death threats online as a result of the irresponsible gossip-mongering. After two black men were arrested for the murder, King sputtered to save his reputation — first by claiming credit for passing on a tip that led to the arrests (which he kept quiet about while stoking anti-white hatred), and then by doubling down with a fake-but-accurate defense.
""We live in a time where somebody could do something like this based purely on hate or race,"" he smugly argued. ""And that it turned out to not be the case I don't think changes the devastating conclusion that people had thought something like that was possible.""
There's nothing ""humanitarian"" or exemplary about such an attitude. This is race-hustling cynicism at its worst. It's par for the twisted course for King, who is a serial apologist for treating people as guilty until proven innocent and for threatening those who call him out (including critics within the progressive left who have alleged he has ripped off the movement).
In May 2018, the Lying King led the witch hunt against innocent white Texas state trooper Daniel Hubbard by spreading the false claims of a black woman who lied about Hubbard raping her during a traffic stop. That admitted liar, Sherita Dixon-Cole, escaped prosecution based on a technicality. King's reward? Moving up from the New York Daily News to a coveted position at the Harvard-affiliated Fair Punishment Project, which in part conducts research to prevent more wrongful convictions.
In 2014, King promoted the anti-cop ""hands up, don't shoot"" lie debunked by none other than the Obama Justice Department, yet he still doesn't care about the truth. ""I'm not going to parse evidence or make some complex technical argument that Michael Brown did or didn't have his hands up,"" he defiantly retorted. ""To me, it doesn't matter if he did or he didn't. It never has.""
As former New York City Police detective Sergeant John Paolucci, who is on the board of Uncuff the Innocent, which advocates for wrongfully convicted police officers, told me: ""When the agenda is to instill in people a fear of the police, one creates an environment conducive to more deadly confrontations. ... Having worked the most high-profile police involved cases in the media, I'm well aware that the whole truth is never reported in these investigations and the probative value of evidence that favors the police is diminished or omitted entirely when it hits the news.""
In 2015, King gloried in the wrongful rape convictions of former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, whose flawed case and forensic errors led six internationally renowned scientists to call for a retrial. He has failed to follow up because, of course, the truth doesn't fit his narrative.
The ""journalist"" also maintained the same obstinate stance after his disgraceful sliming of football star Peyton Manning in 2016, when he attempted to ride the #MeToo publicity wave by recycling — and woefully misinterpreting — a 13-year-old court filing regarding a settlement with a female trainer who had claimed she was sexually harassed, and then changed her story seven years later. Instead of admitting error, he played victim.
It's disturbing enough that King is being honored at the Innocence Conference, where many lawyers, activists, scientists and exonerees I admire will attend. Even worse, King heads up a publication called ""The North Star,"" which purports to ""speak truth to power"" and is aimed at young people of color.
Wrongfully convicted Marine Tim Wright and his wife, Danielle, wonder: ""How can an individual with a reputation of making countless false accusations against white men, racially profiling whites and stirring up racial discourse in America be trusted with the hearts and minds of future generations of minority children?""
Or anyone, for that matter? This malicious individual who has repeatedly profited from undermining the presumption of innocence has no place pretending to defend it. That's speaking truth to power.

ERICKSON: Progressive 'Christian' Hypocrites | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Erick Erickson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45939/erickson-progressive-christian-hypocrites-erick-erickson,"April 13, 2019 views
Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one of the many Democrats running for President, keeps trying to play a Christian on television, and it's been going badly for him. Buttigieg recently said of Donald Trump, ""It is hard to look at his actions and believe they are the actions of somebody who believes in God."" On ""Meet the Press,"" Chuck Todd asked Buttigieg about that.
Buttigieg said he thought evangelicals backing President Trump were hypocritical because when Buttigieg goes to church, he hears about taking care of the poor and refugees. Trump, Buttigieg says, does not do that. Buttigieg went on to draw a distinction: In his professional conduct, Trump does not take care of the poor and refugees as scripture commands. Buttigieg continued that in Trump's personal life, as well, he falls short of Christian behavior. (He is right on that part, too, by the way. But then, we are all sinners.)
Buttigieg thinks the President does not behave as one who believes in God because, as President, Trump is not following scriptural commands. Then, Todd asked Buttigieg about his position on abortion, and Buttigieg's response was that abortion is a moral issue and we cannot legislate morality. In fact, Buttigieg tried to wave away the clear science on the issue of when life begins so he could argue about governing based on our morality.
This is why progressive Christianity is so corrupt and flawed. As much as Buttigieg makes a valid critique on the President's behavior and some evangelicals excusing that behavior, Buttigieg wants to reject the inconvenient parts of faith he does not like. He is a gay man who got married; he does not think homosexuality is a sin despite express statements in scripture. And he thinks abortion is a moral issue. He would, he says, avoid governing using his morality.
Buttigieg is trying to have it both ways and, in reality, is showing he is no better a Christian than Trump. What is particularly bothersome here is that Buttigieg claims to be governed by some moral code and he claims he will lead as a more moral President than Trump. At the same time, he claims elected officials should not govern based on their morality.
Everyone has a moral code, and we all conduct our actions by our moral code. Buttigieg just wants a pass on his moral code, which is all about not taking inconvenient stands on parts of scripture that might make his life a bit uncomfortable. He will wield scripture against the President and abdicate when it comes to himself.
Frankly, Buttigieg makes a valid criticism of evangelicals who give the President a pass on his bad behavior. There are too many evangelicals unwilling to call the President to account for his failures to repent, his doubling down on bad behavior, etc. Buttigieg, however, is not making the point that Christians should vote for Democrats. He is making the case that they should stay home. Therein lies the rub. He does not think anyone should legislate their morality, so why should anyone vote their morality?
Ultimately, however, Christians can be Christians and Americans. They must put their faith first, something Buttigieg himself is unwilling to do except when it is convenient. Given the choices of a bunch of terribly flawed candidates, it is understandable that Christians are willing to side with the one who will protect their right to exercise their religion in their daily lives rather than the ones who offer platitudes with persecution.
Lastly, note that as Democrats make science their god, Buttigieg does his best to avoid the science of when life begins. He knows he cannot argue that point, so he refuses to even accept it as part of the debate. That is what trips him up. The science amplifies the moral case against Buttigieg's position. Undoubtedly, however, Buttigieg will make the moral case for accepting transgenderism and demand we legislate on it. It is just the children in the womb he is OK discarding. The same God that commands we take care of the widows, the poor and the refugees commands us to take care of children, too, Pete.

"South Korean Court Argues That Because ‘Embryos’ Depend On A Mother For Survival, They Do Not Have A ‘Right To Life’ | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45947/south-korean-court-argues-because-embryos-depend-frank-camp,"South Korean Court Argues That Because ‘Embryos’ Depend On A Mother For Survival, They Do Not Have A ‘Right To Life’ FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images April 13, 2019 views
On Thursday, South Korea’s Constitutional Court reversed the nation’s nearly 66-year ban on abortions.
As The Daily Wire’s Paul Bois previously reported , the 1953 law ""effectively banned the procedure in all cases except for rape, incest, and the life of the mother ... [and] also permitted punishments for both women and doctors who procured abortions. Women were also required to have spousal approval in the rare exceptions where abortions were permitted.""
The South Korean law regarding abortion states in part:
A woman who procures her own miscarriage through the use of drugs or other means shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year or by a fine not exceeding two million won...
A doctor, herb doctor, midwife, pharmacist, or druggist who procures the miscarriage of a woman upon her request or with her consent, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years.
The exceptions can be read here .
The Constitutional Court’s 7-2 ruling on Thursday was the result of a case in which a doctor was ""charged with conducting 69 illegal abortions,"" according to Reuters .
Some of the reasoning behind the court’s decision is appallingly illogical.
In the ruling, the court stated : ""Embryos completely depend on the mother’s body for their survival and development, so it cannot be concluded that they are separate, independent living beings entitled to right to life.""
Let’s follow the trajectory of the court’s opinion to its logical end. If an embryo is not an independent human being because it relies on its mother in order to develop and survive, what else is not a human being?
A 1-year-old infant must be fed, changed, and cared for. It depends on its mother or caretaker in order to develop and survive. A child or adult with a moderate to severe disability requires round-the-clock care in order to develop and survive. An individual who has fallen into a coma will often require the support of machines in order to survive.
Are the aforementioned people inhuman simply because they need assistance to stay healthy and alive? Of course not, and no rational person would come to such a conclusion. These people are just as human as any mentally and physically independent adult, and therefore just as intrinsically valuable.
However, if one wants to be intellectually consistent and agree with the Korean court, which argues that because embryos are dependent on their mothers for a period of between six to nine months, they are not to be considered ""separate, independent living beings entitled to right to life,"" one must continue to walk the logical path set up by the court, and admit that newborns, small children, the disabled, and the comatose are also not ""independent living beings entitled to right to life.""
It may seem obvious that our intrinsic value must not be determined by our stage of development or on the amount of assistance we may need due to physical or mental disadvantages, but there are those who believe in this arbitrary standard.
The Korean court has added its name to the list of people and institutions that, due to logical incoherence, have opened a back door for any who seek to devalue various forms of human life. "

President Donald Trump said on Saturday night that the United States has the legal right to have illegal aliens detained at the border transferred to sanctuary cities and that he wants them sent to California.

Trump's most recent tweet came after White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said Saturday night on Fox News:
They are telling us you cannot keep family units who come here illegally and unlawfully at the southern border. You can’t keep them at detention facilities. You can’t deport them. The only thing you can do is as an administration is release them into American communities…So, the president said listen, there are sanctuary cities out there where Democrats have said we welcome any and all whether they criminals, whether they are here illegally, seeking asylum, regardless. Anybody who disagrees with us is racist. So the president said fine, I’ve got a great idea. We’d love to work with you guys to figure out exactly the best way to transport these people were here illegally and unlawfully and into your communities and your districts and your states.
On Thursday, The Washington Post reported that the White House ""have tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities to release detainees onto the streets of ""sanctuary cities.'""
""The White House told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that the plan was intended to alleviate a shortage of detention space but also served to send a message to Democrats,"" the Post added.
Trump's plan was not well received by all Democrats as Democrat presidential candidate Julian Castro said on Thursday that Trump's plan to send the apprehended illegal aliens to sanctuary cities was ""cruel.""

"Rashida Tlaib Accuses Dem Leadership Of Racism, Says Pelosi Uses Minority Members As ‘Tokens Of Diversity’ | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45950/rashida-tlaib-accuses-dem-leadership-racism-says-emily-zanotti,"Rashida Tlaib Accuses Dem Leadership Of Racism, Says Pelosi Uses Minority Members As ‘Tokens Of Diversity’ Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images
Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) lashed out at Democrats -- not Republicans -- yesterday, in the wake of crticism leveled at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for minimizing the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, accusing Dem leadership, including Speaker of the Houes Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), of racism, and using Congressional colleagues of color as ""tokens of diversity.""
Fox News reports that Tlaib ""claimed in a Twitter message Saturday that she and other minority members of the party have been used as tokens whenever the party wants to project an image of inclusiveness.""
She joined a number of Islamic activists on Twitter who were accusing Pelosi, who Tweeted that 9/11 was ""sacred ground,"" of not doing enough to defend Omar against what they felt were unfair attacks over comments she made that ""some people did something"" on September 11th.
Omar's comments were, it seems, meant to allege that Muslims across the globe have been discriminated against and mistreated in the wake of the September 11th attacks -- a point she was trying to use to justify her opposition to what she calls President Donald Trump's ""Muslim ban,"" a travel restriction that prevents travelers from countries that actively sponsor and bankroll terrorist organizations from obtaining even temporary visas to visit the United States.
The ban itself has been altered several times. The final version, which bans residents of 9 countries, 7 of which are majority Muslim, has held up under legal scrutiny (so far).
Tlaib pointed out that several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called comments criticizing Omar ""incitement to violence"" -- a legal exception to the First Amendment's right to freedom of speech, and a punishable crime -- but that Pelosi has chosen instead to ask Trump and others to simply tone down their rhetoric.
That's because, Tlaib, says, Pelosi and others in Democratic leadership are actively racist.
""They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,” Tlaib wrote on social media. “However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.”
Tlaib also retweeted a post from Omar, essentially accusing Pelosi of the same, as well as a post from a ""human rights activist,"" who doubled down.
“More and more we're realizing that POC [people of color] are used as props by @TheDemocrats,” Tlaib's retweeted missive read. “When we run, we're told to wait our turn. When we speak about our struggles, we're told we're angry. When we ask them to stand up for us, they say we're being divisive.”
Pelosi's comments on Saturday, indeed, did not defend Omar. Instead she merely asked the President not to use images of 9/11 in ""political attacks,"" tweeting, ""The memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence. The President shouldn’t use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack.""
This isn't the first time Pelosi has failed to rush to the defense of her more vocal, progressive colleagues. She has chastized Omar before for using anti-Semitic tropes in speeches, and accusing fellow Democrats of having ""dual loyalty"" to both Israel and the United States (Tlaib has also unleashed that particular smear on occasion). Pelosi also spearheaded an effort to censure Omar, which ultimately turned into a weaselly blanket condemnation of ""all hate.""
Just last week. Pelosi appeared to take aim at Tlaib's and Omar's sister-in-arms, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), complaining that real policy cannot be made on Twitter.
This is a battle Pelosi is likely to lose."

Last year, Pelosi endorsed ""collateral damage"" against Americans who do not share her views and the views of the Democratic Party.
""We have to have total clarity about what we do when it comes to everything — a woman’s right to choose, gay marriage ... whether it’s about immigration, whether it’s about gun safety, whether it’s about climate ..."" Pelosi said . ""I think that we owe the American people to be there for them, for their financial security, respecting the dignity and worth of every person in our country, and if there’s some collateral damage for some others who do not share our view, well, so be it, but it shouldn't be our original purpose.""

Disgraced New Yorker Fact-Checker: ‘When Did The Memory Of 9/11 Become Sacred?’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45949/disgraced-new-yorker-fact-checker-when-did-memory-emily-zanotti,"April 14, 2019 views
Back in July of last year, Talia Lavin was fired from her job as a fact-checker for the New Yorker after she misidentified a wounded Marine's elbow tattoo as a Nazi ""Iron Cross,"" and convinced much of the left that the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency had hired an actual white supremacist to work on their abuse task force.
Saturday, she was at it again. The self-described ""expert"" on white supremacy, in an effort to defend Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who flippantly referred to the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in a speech as ""some people did something,"" Lavin asked whether we're supposed to believe that 9/11 is ""sacred."" when did the memory of 9/11 become “sacred”? in what way? and to whom? — Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) April 14, 2019
The tweet was a reaction to, of all people, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who referred to September 11 as ""sacred ground,"" taking both Omar and President Donald Trump — who posted video of the attacks as a way of reminding Omar why 9/11 commands so much respect — to task.
Lavin, who now works as a reporter for Media Matters tracking ""white nationalism,"" and will teach a course on journalism this summer at New York University, doubled down. i meant this as a genuine question. it was indisputably tragic, world-changing, evil and despicable, and a turning point of history. but “sacred” is a particular word with its own religious meanings, and i wanted to pinpoint what it means to call such a day “sacred” specifically. — Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) April 14, 2019
The answer to her question is, of couse, that 9/11 became sacred on September 11, 2001, when terrorists flew two planes into the Twin Towers in New York City, one into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and one into a field in Pennsylvania. The attacks, of course, killed thousands of Americans — the most killed in an attack on American soil since December 7, 1941, when the United States was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.
Thankfully, a number of Twitter users filled her in on the details.

There have been plenty of odd statements made in defense of Omar's words, not the least that any criticism of Omar is de facto ""incitement to violence"" and that critics of Omar have blood on their hands were something to happen to her. But few Democrats and left-leaning activists have gone so far as to question whether the September 11, 2001 attacks are themselves worthy of commemoration.
But Lavin isn't new to controversy; as noted above, last year she started a meme on Twitter accusing ICE of hiring an actual member of the Nazi party after seeing a photo of a double amputee manning one of ICE's intelligence stations. The man, a former Marine, had a cross tattooed on his elbow, which Lavin called an ""Iron Cross"" — a historical symbol of both the Nazi party itself and white supremacy.
After the photo and the accusation went viral, ICE stepped in to correct the record, noting that the man in question was not, in fact, a Nazi, and that the tattoo on his arm was the symbol of his platoon in Afghanistan, not an ""Iron Cross.""
Lavin and The New Yorker parted ways shortly after the tweet, but she was picked up less than a month later by Media Matters, who hired her as a researcher on ""far-right extremism"" — despite her only claim of expertise on that account was the mistaken identification of a tattoo.
Lavin, journalism expert as she is, will be teaching a class at NYU this summer on — what else? — identifying and researching elements of the ""far right."" "
Jake Tapper To Dem Rep. Eric Swalwell: ‘Vast Majority Of Gun-Related Deaths’ Are Not From Semi-Automatic Rifles | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45952/jake-tapper-dem-rep-eric-swalwell-vast-majority-frank-camp,"April 14, 2019 views
On Sunday, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), who recently declared his candidacy for president, appeared on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" During the segment, host Jake Tapper asked Swalwell about his signature issue — gun control.
TAPPER: So, gun control is the central plank in your campaign. You wrote last year: ""We should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons. We should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law. And we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.""
Criminal prosecution for keeping assault weapons. What's the punishment for people who don't hand in their guns? Do they go to jail?
SWALWELL: Well, Jake, they would, but I also offer an alternative, which would be to keep them at a hunting club or a shooting range.
And the reason I have proposed this is because these weapons are so devastating. I have seen this as a prosecutor in the cases that I have prosecuted. We have seen these in the school shootings, from Sandy Hook to Parkland...
But it's not just the violence that they have caused. It's the fear, the immeasurable fear, that our children live in, because they are still on our streets. I want to get rid of that fear. I want to do what Australia did and New Zealand just recently did. I think this issue just needs some bold leadership to do it.
Tapper then noted that the majority of shooting deaths do not involve semi-automatic rifles.
TAPPER: I know you know this, but the vast majority of gun-related deaths in this country are not related to these semiautomatic assault weapons — whatever you want to call them — and the vast majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens who have purchased these weapons legally and use them safely.
One of the most frequent attacks on this issue from President Trump and the Republicans is that Democrats want to take away your guns. But isn't it fair to say you actually do want to take away people's guns?
SWALWELL: You know, keep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns. I want the most dangerous weapons, these weapons of war, out of the hands of the most dangerous people. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate @RepSwalwell vows to focus on gun control: “It’s not just the violence that they’ve caused, it’s the fear, the immeasurable fear that our children live in because they’re still on our streets. I want to get rid of that fear.” #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/mZfJVHh4Dq — CNN (@CNN) April 14, 2019
Tapper is correct when he states that ""the vast majority of gun-related deaths in this country are not related to these semiautomatic assault weapons.""
According to Uniform Crime Reporting data from the FBI, between 2010 and 2014, there were approximately 43,002 murders in the United States in which firearms were the weapon of choice. 70% (30,114) of the firearms used were handguns, while 3.6% (1,530) were rifles.
Even if one takes the 21.5% (9,228) of gun deaths that were committed using unclassified firearms, assumes that half of them were rifles (a very generous assumption given the statistics), and adds that to the 3.6% of gun deaths in which rifles were identified as the weapon used, that still amounts to just over a quarter (25.1%) of total firearm murders in the United States.
For context, 5.3 times as many people (8,109) are murdered in the United States with ""knives or cutting instruments"" than with rifles, and 2.3 times as many people (3,574) are murdered in the United States with ""hands, fists, [and] feet"" than with rifles, according to FBI data . "
"Heckler Interrupts Clinton Book Tour: ‘Bill, This Is Boring!’ | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45954/watch-heckler-interrupts-clinton-book-tour-bill-emily-zanotti,"April 14, 2019 views
The Clinton Book Tour has officially resumed, and it appears that it is destined for as much success in its second half as it enjoyed in its first — that is, none — and now it's attracted hecklers.
Thursday evening, Bll and Hillary Clinton appeared for the fist time in the second leg of their joint tour, in a ""conversation with Paul Begala"" at the Beacon Theater on New York City's Upper West Side. They've been on hiatus since calling off their series of joint story-tellng events late last year, officially because of the death of former President George H. W. Bush and an ensuing illness, but more likely because ticket sales had tanked, seats were being left empty, and the events were paling in comparison to those in a parallel book tour hosted for former First Lady Michelle Obama.
The second leg is starting out as badly as the first. The Huffington Post reports that the event at the Beacon Theater had seats that ""remained noticeably empty throughout the night,"" despite the event's cut-rate price of only $100 for the cheap seats. The New York Post snagged their balcony seat for $210 , much more than the same seats were selling on resale sites the day of.
The night featured a lot of softball questions, reportedly, but no mention of President Donald Trump or the disastrous 2016 presidential election. But if the crowd was bored by discussing issues from the mid-1990s, they were quickly energized by a heckler, who pointed out that the Clintons had long lost their shine .
""Bill, this is boring!” the heckler yelled. “Why don’t you talk about....""
Hillary quickly cut him off, with an odd comment about “important political conversations” and called the heckler an “agent provocateur.”
The rest of the audience heard, however. The heckler asked Clinton to talk about ""Jeffrey Epstein.""
Epstein is, of course, the man accused of sexually abusing ""dozens of underage girls,"" according to Rolling Stone, many on his private plane, at his Palm Beach home, and on his private island.
The Miami Herald reported at the time:
For years, Epstein lured an endless stream of teenage girls to his Palm Beach mansion, offering to pay them for massages. Instead, police say, for years he coerced middle and high school girls into engaging in sex acts with him and others.
As evidence emerged that there were victims and witnesses outside of Palm Beach, the FBI began an investigation in 2006 into whether Epstein and others employed by him were involved in underage sex trafficking.
Bill Clinton was a frequent guest of Epstein's (as was President Donald Trump but to a far lesser extent). Epstein also gave generously to Clinton's campaign for president. Epstein is in the final stages of what appears to be a plea deal in New York, and has never revealed the extent to which Clinton participated in his reported jaunts. Clinton, likewise, has remained mum on his involvement with Epstein, though it does seem he took frequent trips with Epstein on his private plane.
The heckler can't be good news for the Clintons, who are now desperately hoping to stay relevant in an increasingly anti-Clinton world. At this point, the joint book tour is the only money-making venture they have left, particularly given that most of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls are running far left of Hillary Clinton and the man she defeated for the 2016 nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), is running at the head of the pack.
The Clintons have six more appearances scheduled for the spring, from now until May 4. On May 5, they will make up the one missed event from last year, a joint appearance at the Park MGM Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Tickets are about the same price as they were for the handful of previous engagements. For the pair's appearance next week at Washington, D.C.'s DAR Constitution Hall — where the Clintons should be a draw — you can snag tickets for as little as $19 . Tickets for some later dates, including an appearance in Los Angeles, California, are a little pricier. A seat in L.A. will cost you $32 . "
"Omar Accuses Trump Of Encouraging Extremists, Suggests Trump Supporters Responsible For Hate Crimes | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45957/omar-accuses-trump-encouraging-extremists-attacks-ryan-saavedra,"Omar Accuses Trump Of Encouraging Extremists, Suggests Trump Supporters Responsible For Hate Crimes Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images April 15, 2019 views
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) accused President Donald Trump of encouraging ""right-wing extremists"" to commit ""violent crimes and other acts of hate"" in response to the video that the president released on Friday afternoon that showed Omar trivializing the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Trump tweeted a video on Friday that showed Omar describing the 9/11 terrorist attacks as ""some people did something"" while she gave a speech at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR is a designated terrorist organization in the UAE and has been accused of being a front group for HAMAS, which is a designated terrorist organization in the United States. WE WILL NEVER FORGET! pic.twitter.com/VxrGFRFeJM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019
Omar claimed that the video that Trump released resulted in a spike of threats against her and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanded that Trump delete the tweet.
Omar released a statement on Sunday in response to Trump's video where she again failed to apologize for trivializing the 9/11 terrorist attacks:
Since the President's tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life — many directly referencing or replying to the President's video. I thank the Capitol Police, the FBI, the House Sergeant at Arms, and the Speaker of the House for their attention to these threats.
Violent crimes and other acts of hate by right-wing extremists and white nationalists are on the rise in this country and around the world. We can no longer ignore that they are being encouraged by the occupant of the highest office in the land. Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226 percent increase in hate crimes in the months following a rally. And assaults increase when cities host Trump rallies. This is particularly concerning given the president's visit to my home state of Minnesota on Monday.
Violent rhetoric and all forms of hate speech have no place in our society, much less from our country’s Commander in Chief.
We are all Americans. This is endangering lives. It has to stop.
Omar conveniently did not include that fact that the analysis of the alleged hate crimes noted that ""the researchers do not suggest that Trump directly caused any of these crimes,"" Vox reported.
Furthermore, the study conducted by The Washington Post used ""reported hate crimes"" in its analysis but did not indicate whether those ""reported hate crimes"" resulted in criminal charges or if they were merely allegations that went unsolved. It is also worth noting that there have been multiple examples of fake crimes that have been blamed on Trump supporters and recent research has found more than 400 examples of fake hate crimes reported throughout the U.S. in recent years. We are all Americans. This is endangering lives. It has to stop. pic.twitter.com/gwB2kDUIRp — Rep. Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) April 15, 2019
In 2016, Omar advocated for compassion and leniency in the sentencing of a group of men who were accused of trying to join ISIS.
Earlier this month, Omar called on the Trump administration from her congressional account to help secure the release of a senior Muslim Brotherhood member from prison in Egypt.
In 2017, Omar was one of only two Minnesota state representatives who voted against a bill that allowed insurance companies to deny life insurance payments to the families of terrorists."
WATCH: Sarah Sanders Drags Democrats Over Trump's Tax Returns ~ Full Magazine,www.dailywire.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45971/watch-sarah-sanders-drags-democrats-over-trumps-james-barrett,"April 15, 2019 views
With the ""collusion"" and ""obstruction"" narratives largely derailed since Attorney General William Barr issued his summary of the special counsel's final report, Democrats have been putting more focus on another years-long line of attack on President Trump: his tax returns. On Saturday, Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, chair of the Democrat-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, sent a letter to the IRS giving an April 23 deadline for the production of Trump's thus-far-evasive returns. But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders thinks that's problematic for a few big reasons.
""I don't think Congress — particularly not this group of congressmen and women — are smart enough to look through the thousands of pages I would assume that President Trump's taxes will be,"" Sanders told Fox News Sunday (partial transcript via RCP ). Along with doubting their intelligence, Sanders warned the Democrats against going down a ""dangerous road"" based on pure ""political partisanship"" that would potentially put any tax-paying citizen at risk.
Asked by host Chris Wallace if Trump will ""demand that the IRS not turn over his tax returns"" or allow for ""whatever the IRS decided,"" Sanders said, ""The president has been clear from the beginning: As long as his taxes are under audit, he's not going to release them. He's also filled out hundreds of pages and financial disclosures. ""
""Will he tell the IRS not to release them though?"" asked Wallace, trying to get a more direct answer.
""We'll have to see what happens on that front,"" she said. ""But the president has been clear. This issue has even been litigated; we went through it in 2016. But one of the biggest things that I think people aren't seeing is the fact that the only reason that the Oversight Committee has the ability to request someone's taxes are for the purpose of determining policy. This has nothing to do with whether or not they're going to determine policy. This is all about political partisanship.""
""This is a dangerous, dangerous road and frankly, Chris, I don't think Congress — particularly not this group of congressmen and women — are smart enough to look through the thousands of pages that I would assume that President Trump's taxes will be,"" she continued. ""My guess is most of them don't do their own taxes, and I certainly don't trust them to look through the decades of success that the president has and determine anything. He has filled out hundreds of pages in a financial disclosure form.""
The move, she said, is a ""disgusting overreach"" that ""puts every American who has filled out tax reform or tax forms in the past [at risk].""

As The Daily Mail reported, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Neal issued his demand to the IRS Saturday that the agency produce Trump's tax returns by 5 p.m. on April 23, maintaining that Congress has the right to see them. The Trump administration has been asking for delays in order to consider Democrats' request."
"Lori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli Plead ‘Not Guilty’ In College Admissions Bribery Scam | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45978/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-plead-not-guilty-paul-bois,"Lori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli Plead ‘Not Guilty’ In College Admissions Bribery Scam ""She refused to accept any jail time"" Paul Archuleta / Contributor / Getty Images April 15, 2019 views
Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, have pleaded ""not guilty"" against charges of mail fraud and money laundering conspiracy in the college bribery scam.
According to The Hollywood Reporter , Loughlin and her husband waived their right to appear in court for an arraignment and simply pled not guilty. Last week, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston announced the famous couple were being charged ""in a second superseding indictment with conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering in connection with a scheme to use bribery to cheat on college entrance exams and to facilitate their children’s admission to selective colleges and universities as purported athletic recruits."" Other prominent parents were indicted on similar charges.
Loughlin and Giannulli allegedly worked in concert with William ""Rick"" Singer to bribe college officials and rig the entrance exams so that their children could be accepted into elite universities. USA Today reported last week that prosecutors say the new indictments resulted from the defendants allegedly ""conspiring to launder bribes and other payments in furtherance of the fraud by funneling them through Singer’s purported charity and his for-profit corporation, as well as by transferring money into the United States, from outside the United States, for the purpose of promoting the fraud scheme.""
Lori Loughlin's ""not guilty"" plea stands in stark contrast with that of actress Felicity Huffman — she entered a guilty plea last week, apologizing for her behavior while begging the American public for forgiveness.
""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" Huffman said in the statement . ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them. I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.""
Last week, a source told E! News that Loughlin is now reportedly ""freaking out"" over the prospect of being sentenced to jail, where she allegedly could be headed for as long as 40 years. Unlike Felicity Huffman, Loughlin apparently thought the district attorney was ""bluffing.""
""Firm in her beliefs that surely she wouldn't see the inside of a prison cell, a source tells E! News, she neglected to join the 13 parents (including fellow actress Felicity Huffman) and one university athletic coach who agreed to plead guilty to the charges of mail fraud and honest services mail fraud,"" the outlet reported.
The source confirmed to E! News that Loughlin has been in ""complete denial"" over the seriousness of her situation. ""She has been in complete denial and thought maybe she could skate by,"" the source said. ""She refused to accept any jail time and thought the prosecutor was bluffing. She was adamant she wouldn't do any jail time. Lori is finally realizing just how serious this is. She is seeing the light that she will do jail time and is freaking out.""
Loughlin has been dropped from both the Hallmark Channel and the Netflix series ""Fuller House."""
Trump: 'INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45960/trump-investigate-investigators-joseph-curl,"April 15, 2019 views
With the Mueller report due out this week, President Trump is doubling down on his criticism of the special counsel's probe into alleged campaign collusion with Russia and blasting Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and ""dirty cops.""
Attorney General William Barr said last Wednesday that Robert Mueller's report would be redacted by Justice Department officials and released ""within a week."" In an effort to get ahead of what will surely be a feeding frenzy for the mainstream media, Trump on Monday demanded that someone ""investigate the investigators.""
""Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction. These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!"" Trump wrote on Twitter in an early morning post.

These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019
Trump also ripped the U.S. intelligence community, saying: ""THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN (We will never forget)!"" THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN (We will never forget)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019
The attorney general testified last week that intelligence agencies spied on the Trump campaign in 2016. ""I think spying did occur,"" Barr told lawmakers. ""But the question is whether it was adequately predicated and I’m not suggesting it wasn’t adequately predicated, but I need to explore that."" Barr did not say who did the spying or who was spied on.
The ""predicate"" Barr referred to is a warrant from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, which hears classified testimony collected by U.S. intelligence agencies and then decides whether to take action. A Justice Department inspector general investigation is currently investigating the issuance of several warrants that involved surveilling members of the Trump campaign, or officials tangentially connected with the campaign.
""I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance,"" Barr testified.
Trump has repeatedly quoted the attorney general, saying his claim is ""absolutely true."" ""There was absolutely spying into my campaign,"" Trump said at the White House last week. ""I’ll go a step further and say it was illegal spying. Unprecedented spying.""
While the full Mueller report, said to be some 400 pages, has not yet been released, Barr did send a four-page summary of the special counsel's findings to Congress. In his letter, Barr wrote ""that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""
Trump also said Monday that no matter what the Mueller report says, Democrats won't be ""satisfied."" ""The Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. They will always Resist and Obstruct!"" The Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. They will always Resist and Obstruct! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019
Appearing last Wednesday before the House Appropriations Committee for a hearing on the Justice Department's budget, Barr said the redacted report will be released ""within a week."" Barr added that his redactions will be broken down into four categories so readers can see why the information was omitted.
""First is grand jury information,"" Barr told lawmakers. ""The second is information that the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods. The third are information in the report that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions. You’ll recall that the special counsel did spin off a number of cases that are still being pursued. And we want to make sure that none of the information in the report would impinge upon either the ability of the prosecutors to prosecute the cases, or the fairness to the defendants.""
""And finally, we intend to redact information that implicated the privacy or reputational interest of peripheral players where there is a decision not to charge them,"" Barr said."

Get accused of sexual assault these days, no matter how old, thin, or conveniently timed the allegations were, and there will be activists determined to see that you are never free to surface on planet Earth.
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct just after President Donald Trump nominated him last summer. The allegation didn’t surface until just before he was supposed to be confirmed, delaying confirmation to allow time for a contrived hearing of the original allegations and for more “accusers” to come forward. Naturally, more did, yet their stories were even more unbelieveable than the first. One woman couldn’t remember if Kavanaugh was the man who harassed her, yet media outlets printed her allegation. Two other women came forward as clients of disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti. He and one of the clients have been referred for criminal investigation over the allegations.
Kavanaugh was confirmed, yet those who insist we believe every woman who makes an accusation (especially against a Republican) still believe he is, in fact, a sexual abuser even though no evidence exists to prove that claim. The people the accusers said could corroborate their stories could not do so.
Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court Justice, was offered a summer teaching job at George Mason University. Activists quickly spun into action to get him fired, and a liberal “dark money” group stepped in to help.
Demand Justice, the “dark money” group, is led by former Hillary Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon and has been buying Facebook ads targeted at George Mason students, faculty, staff, and alumni, and calling on them to sign a petition initiated by students which currently has nearly 5,000 signatures, according to Fox News .
The Huffington Post reported that the ads also request those affiliated with George Mason sign a separate petition calling for congressional Democrats to investigate Kavanaugh, even though he had already gone through several FBI background checks and an additional week-long investigation prior to his confirmation.
The Washington Examiner (my former employer) reported that the student group is calling itself Mason for Survivors and has been circulating the petition for the past month. It calls for George Mason to “Terminate AND void ALL contracts and affiliation with Brett Kavanaugh.” It also demands the university apologize for hiring him in the first place and provide more funding for sexual assault victims.
So far the university has not kowtowed to student demands. George Mason president Angel Cabrera released a statement saying, he “respect[s] the views of people who disagreed with Justice Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation due to questions raised about his sexual conduct in high school,” but added that “he was confirmed and is now a sitting justice.”
In a news release, former Clinton aide Fallon said Kavanaugh “has been credibly accused of sexual assault by multiple women whose allegations have not been thoroughly investigated.”
As stated earlier in this article, this is simply not true. One woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, seemed credible as she spoke before Congress, but her story was not backed up by her supposed witnesses, including one of her best friends. The other allegations lacked any corroboration whatsoever, even after multiple media outlets (The New Yorker, The New York Times, NBC) tried desperately to find evidence. They, of course, printed the stories anyway, breaking journalistic ethics."

The United States isn't the only country with border problems caused by endless migrant caravans from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Mexico is struggling to contain members of these caravans who are jumping their borders and ravaging southern Mexican border towns.
On Friday, Mexican authorities say more than 350 illegal immigrants from Guatemala and Honduras ""broke the locks on a gate at the Guatemalan border Friday and forced their way into southern Mexico to join a larger group of migrants trying to make their way toward the United States,"" according to KTLA .
Mexican authorities found the migrants to be ""hostile"" and ""aggressive,"" it seems, and law enforcement's difficulties didn't stop once the migrants had managed to breach the border fence. KTLA reports they attacked local police in border villages in their attempt to join up with a 2,000-person caravan headed, of course, for the United States-Mexican border.
President Donald Trump noted, just a week ago, that Mexican authorities have stepped up their interdiction efforts and are cooperating with United States' demands to improve their own border patrol efforts, intercepting and turning back migrant caravans before they ever reach the U.S. border. Migrants joining up with the caravans now report increased difficulty in moving through Mexico, longer waits for papers and visas, and less help from residents of towns along the way.
Mexico, Reuters reports , has clamped down on issuing so-called ""humanitarian visas"" to caravan members, and Mexico, while denying reports that it has changed policy on the visas, says that it is now preserving such allowances for ""priority"" migrants only, including unaccompanied minors and the elderly. To all others, they are offering free rides back home.
The denials have caused a stir, and late last week, migrants attacked immigration authorities and broke windows on immigration buildings in Mapastepec, one of the first official caravan stops, where migrants typically expect to receive humanitarian visas.
Some migrants pledged to continue northward through Mexico even without the visas, leaving members of the caravans subject to deportation — something Mexican officials have also stepped up.
USA Today reports that Mexican authorities have already sent at least 204 immigrants back to Honduras, citing ""irregularities"" in their visa applications. The group was ""from southeastern Mexican state of Veracruz to San Pedro Sula, Honduras."" From December of last year through February of this year, Mexico has deported 19,360 migrants — a lot, but not nearly enough to make a dent in the number of migrants making a beeline for the United States.
A senior White House official told Reuters that they expect the Mexican government to step up efforts even further, and that, currently, threats of trade disruptions are working to motivate Mexico to take a stronger hand on immigration. Mexico, it seems, wants desperately to avoid a border shutdown, which Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says is in ""nobody's interest.""
Meanwhile, at the United States southern border, the situation continues to be out of hand. Over the weekend, President Trump responded to allegations that his administration had considered bussing illegal immigrants from border patrol facilities into so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" implying that the policy is not off the table and that sanctuary city mayors should be prepared for a possible influx of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers."

Chambers works as the organization’s executive director of its ""Advocacy for Children"" program, and has been a pro-life supporter for 20 years.
She described New York’s Reproductive Health Act , passed in late January, as a “line in the sand” that motivated Focus’ launch of a 12-week, pro-life campaign called “See Life Clearly.”
The grand finale for the campaign is scheduled for May 4.
In addition to the live ultrasound, the “ Alive From New York ” event will include musical entertainment and speakers.
To safeguard the mother’s identity, the scan will take place in a mobile medical unit. It will be performed by a physician with a registered diagnostic medical sonographer assisting the physician.
Jake Roberson, a social media manager for Focus on the Family, hatched the brainchild for live-broadcasting an ultrasound about a year ago, and the idea grew legs when New York passed legislation in January permitting abortion up to the moment of birth in some cases.
“When you see a [4D] ultrasound, it’s very, very hard not to say ‘that’s not a clump of tissue. That’s a real baby.’”
“It’s a way for us to show the humanness and the dignity of that baby,” Chambers explained.
Chambers’ hope for the outcome of the event is to see a change in hearts and minds on the issue of abortion, yet she harbors no unrealistic expectation that New York’s egregious law will be instantly overturned.
Contrary to legacy media’s incessant portrayal to the contrary, pro-life advocates’ focus is not solely on the baby — nor is it solely on outlawing abortion.
“We are stepping into this for that woman and her child — not just for that baby,” said Chambers, who expressed her desire for women to embrace their true worth.
For Chambers and her organization, effective pro-life advocacy is two-pronged. It is something of a carrot-and-stick approach.
One prong involves legislative efforts to protect the preborn by codifying punitive measures related to abortion — that’s the stick.
The second involves providing loving, practical support for women facing a challenging pregnancy — that’s the carrot.
“We have to do more than just talk about this. We really have to put feet to this and come alongside [pregnant women] and say ‘I’ll walk through that pregnancy with you.’”
“Walking alongside” means providing physical, tangible support to women grappling with the decision to carry a child to term.
It often includes tending to financial and practical matters, such as arranging for accommodations, providing transportation to doctor’s visits, or helping to make an adoption plan.
As Chambers puts it, pro-life advocates must “start putting our feet to our faith.”
For Focus’ “Alive From New York” event, this means planning and conducting the event in a “winsome way.”
“It can’t be in-your-face. It can’t be aggressive,” said Chambers, in describing what she means by using a “winsome” approach.
Focus’ thoughtful approach includes anticipating the needs of men and women who may be impacted by seeing a live depiction of a third-trimester baby splashed across screens in the heart of the Big Apple.
“There are going to be men and women in Times Square that have made an abortion decision in the past, and we don’t want this to be a way they feel shame or condemnation,” said Chambers.
“This is a way just to show, again, the beauty of life, and we will have people standing by to help if there is the grief that comes from that ... We know that this is going to be tough for some folks ... and we’ll have people there to [help them] walk through what it means to find healing from that decision from the past,” said Chambers, who explained that Focus is working with churches and pregnancy centers to make that happen.
“We’re trying to be really grace-filled and loving when we’re showing this,” she added. “We want it to be a time of celebration. We’re celebrating life,” said Chambers.
Chambers is well aware that the event may meet with some angry responses from those in the pro-choice camp.
“We have to be ok with that,” said Chambers. “We have to be ok with not matching emotion-for-emotion when there’s anger. We have to be ok with taking a step back and responding in love and responding in grace and mercy.”
“Every year, the pro-life movement has been accused of not caring about the mom — that it’s all about the baby,” said Chambers. “[Focus on the Family] has always spoken out for that young mom, that young woman who finds herself in that situation. Our hearts are connected with her and we want to see her given the best information she can to make the best decision for herself and her child.”
For Chambers, it’s personal.
“I have two grandchildren alive today because of a local pregnancy center.”
“The pregnancy centers are on the front lines every single day. That’s how they operate day in and day out with that love,” said Chambers, who calls those who work at the centers “the true heroes.”
Chambers is working closely with pregnancy centers in New York and added that she wants the centers to know that Focus is “in it for the long haul,” including helping them with updated ultrasound machines and grants for nurses’ training, via their Option Ultrasound program.
“First and foremost, our goal is to reach men and women, change hearts, change minds, and to see the dignity and the humanness of that baby,” said Chambers.
“We’re not trying to start a fight. We’re not trying to be aggressive. We just want that woman to know there is a better option for her and her child.”
The Alive From NY event is crafted to visually demonstrate, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the preborn are undeniably human and to render rationalizing the snuffing out their lives ostensibly based on respecting a woman’s right to “choose” patently unthinkable.
Winning the battle to protect preborn babies’ lives requires both the carrot and the stick. Absent either, pro-life advocates will lose — and such a loss is too far-reaching and too profound to risk failure."
ZANOTTI: We Must Rebuild Notre Dame. It Could Save The Catholic Church. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45991/zanotti-we-must-rebuild-notre-dame-it-could-save-emily-zanotti,"April 15, 2019 views
For a very short while, I lived just down the street from Notre Dame Cathedral, and I didn't always like it.
It was old. Dark. Crowded. The kind of place that tourists throng through on rainy days, traipsing Parisian mud over hundreds of years of art and architecture. I almost never went. But it was there, an immovable, nearly immortal vision at the end of my block that reminded me not just of my temporary home's history, but of man's capacity for beauty. In all the ugliness of our world, Notre Dame stood as a testament that man could do something good; that in our short human lives, we could create timeless beauty even as we are passing away.
I have stood in some of the greatest structures in the world. One fall, I sang in the choir at the Vatican, and crawled through the quiet places of St. Peter's Basilica — the secret archives, the music room, the sacristy, even the broom closests (home to the tombs of a few poor, forgotten Popes) — but nothing ever made me feel quite the way Notre Dame did, especially when the sun broke through the monstrous Rose Window, an unmistakeable reminder of heaven even when God's voice in my life wasn't particularly clear.
When I watched the video of the spire falling this morning, I could feel it breaking my heart into a million pieces inside me. That reminder was gone.
And that's why Notre Dame must be rebuilt.
Because now, more than ever, we need a reminder that art, that beauty, and most of all, that faith , transcend human error. At a time when the Catholic Church needs unity, rebuilding one of our great structures — the historical home of the Crown of Thorns, and the site of so much of our history — may be the one way that we can recommit to facing the trials at present and ahead together.
Make no mistake, the Church is under attack, both from within and without. All Christianity is. All people of good faith are. The Catholic Church is struggling with fractures that threaten to rip the Church apart.
Across the globe, Catholics are trying to process the betrayals of Church leaders who abused members of their flocks. In the United States, we're struggling to understand how our Cardinals could abuse seminiarians — young priests — for decades without facing consequences. Just last week, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI issued a letter laying bare how the Church's own hierarchy had failed to protect its members, and had encouraged, and in some cases even fostered, a culture among its clergy that put the faithful in direct danger.
We can't agree on anything. Not on how to move forward. Not on how to address the past. But broken and at odds with each other over trivial, human matters, people of faith become vulnerable to the forces of evil. The Devil sneaks in and foments our anger toward each other. It makes us weaker as people and the Church weaker as a protective core of civilization and ethics. We need strong religious organizations, and strong religions, to withstand the challenges of the modern world, to preserve what's right and to oppose what's wrong.
Without faith, the whims of the culture erode us. We can see it happening all around us.
Whatever caused the fire at Notre Dame — and we will likely find out in the coming days — it happened at the beginning of Holy Week, one of the most sacred weeks in our calendar, and the yearly celebration of Christ's death and His resurrection, and it should be a reminder that those of us who profess faith are never truly safe from the forces that would undo us, but regardless, we need to continue to stand tall against them.
Rebuild. Rebuild Notre Dame, to show that our lives and our faith are more than just temporary. Rebuild to show that we will continue to withstand the destructive forces that threaten to tear us apart, even when they drive us to our knees and burn us to the ground. Show that we may only have a few decades of life, but that our legacy, our strength, and our beauty live on.
St. Joan of Arc may not have said it about Notre Dame, but she still said it best in her final words: ""Hold the Cross high, that I may see it through the flames."""
Pete Buttigieg Insists Electoral College Overruled Popular Vote ‘Twice In My Lifetime’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45986/pete-buttigieg-insists-electoral-college-overruled-ashe-schow,"Pete Buttigieg Insists Electoral College Overruled Popular Vote ‘Twice In My Lifetime’ Scott Olson/Getty Images April 15, 2019 views
Democrats running for 2020 either don’t know how the Electoral College works, or they think Americans are too stupid to understand it and are therefore playing on incorrect assumptions.
As I’ve written more times than I should have had to, America does not vote by a national popular vote. There are actually 51 individual popular votes (each state plus the District of Columbia). The Electoral College has existed since the Constitution was written and it allows more states the chance to decide who is president, instead of a few large cities getting to decide for everyone else.
Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but a national popular vote is even more unfair, because a few large cities in a few large states (California, Texas, New York, Illinois, and Florida) would otherwise get to decide how the rest of us are governed — and we know how corrupt and mismanaged large cities are.
Anyway, multiple Democrat candidates — still mad that this election system didn’t benefit them in 2016 like it had in 2008 and 2012 — are actually running to alter the Constitution to change the rules to make sure Democrats will always win (or so they think).
The latest candidate to bring up the issue is South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who said on Sunday that the Electoral College “has overruled the American people.”
“We can’t say it’s much of a democracy when twice in my lifetime the Electoral College has overruled the American people,"" Buttigieg said during a rally in his hometown, according to the Hill .
""Why should our vote in Indiana only count once or twice in a century? Or your vote in Wyoming or New York?” he added.
He was, of course, referring to the 2016 election of President Donald Trump and the 2000 election of George W. Bush. Bush would go on to win the popular vote and the Electoral College in 2004.
As stated earlier in this article, ending the Electoral College would actually take away Indiana’s vote, and Wyoming’s vote, unless Buttigieg believes those two states would vote Democrat every time if not for the Electoral College. In reality, those two states consistently vote Republican. Wyoming has voted for the Republican presidential candidate every four years since 1968 . Indiana has voted for the Republican candidate every four years (except for 2008) since 1968 as well . To say that individuals in that state are not having their votes counted is absolutely absurd. The majority of voters in that state want a Republican in office. Removing the Electoral College would ensure that large liberal cities get to decide who is president instead of the states.
Also, despite what Democrats may think, there's no guarantee they would automatically win every national popular vote. Republicans haven't attempted to run to win that vote — they focus on winning as many individual states as possible.
Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke have also indicated they would remove the Electoral College if elected.
This leads to another bit of irony. Convinced the Electoral College is broken, the potential Democrat nominee wants to end the election system after winning using that same election system. They can’t be this dumb, can they?"
Criticism Is Not Violence | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Michael J. Knowles,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45996/criticism-not-violence-michael-j-knowles,"April 15, 2019 views
On campus, leftist violence against conservatives has become the rule rather than the exception. Two years ago, a mob of left-wing students injured Middlebury College professor Allison Stanger, herself a Democrat, for engaging in a discussion with conservative scholar Charles Murray. Last month, an attacker punched conservative student Hayden Williams in the face at UC Berkeley. Last Thursday, a masked assailant sprayed me with an unknown chemical substance during a speech titled “Men Are Not Women” at the University of Missouri Kansas City.
Ironically, just moments before Williams endured his attack at Berkeley, another student accused him of “encouraging violence.” The Kansas City Star accused me of having “inflamed students.” In one article, the Star suggested that by accepting the invitation and articulating an opinion that contradicted modern leftist ideology, I somehow bore responsibility for my assault.
Speech is not violence. The Left conflates the two in order to justify its own violent reactions to differing points of view. Hence students who wish to avoid opinions that contradict their own seek out “safe spaces.” They don’t refer to these playpens of censorship as “ideologically homogenous zones” or “no disagreement centers.” They call them “safe spaces” in order to create the impression that certain opinions constitute actual violence from which students must seek refuge.
Leftists at the national level have adopted the same cynical strategy. Freshman congresswoman Ilhan Omar has repeatedly defended terrorists and downplayed the gravity of terrorist attacks. She described the September 11 terrorist attack as “some people did something.” On another occasion, she giggled as she pronounced “al-Qaeda” and “Hezbollah” before wondering why people would discuss those terrorist organizations differently than they would “American,” “England,” or “the Army.” Yet when President Trump and Congressman Dan Crenshaw cited her own words, Omar accused them of “endangering lives,” and Senator Elizabeth Warren accused the president of “inciting violence.” According to this absurd standard, not only does criticism constitute violence, but even citing someone’s own words qualifies as incitement.
Criticism does not constitute violence. In democratic republics such as ours, citizens rely on public criticism of ideas and people to determine national policy. If self-governing citizens cannot speak to one another, they must inevitably resort to violence to achieve their political ends. The great military theorist Carl von Clausewitz famously observed, “War is merely a continuation of politics by other means.” Either instrument will suffice to decide our politics. We must choose between speech and violence. Increasingly, the Left would deny the dichotomy to conceal the choice it has already made. "

On Sunday, Cher freaked out over President Trump’s plan to send illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities , and true to limousine liberal traditions, she sounded like a yuppie practicing NIMBY (not in my own backyard) philosophy, tweeting, “I Understand Helping struggling Immigrants, but MY CITY (Los Angeles) ISNT TAKING CARE OF ITS OWN.WHAT ABOUT THE 50,000+Citizens WHO LIVE ON THE STREETS.PPL WHO LIVE BELOW POVERTY LINE HUNGRY?

As The Daily Wire reported in early January, Cher, a fervent Trump-hater for years, surprisingly tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should give Trump the border wall funding he wanted so government workers could return to their jobs, but followed by maligning Trump yet again, tweeting, “trump HAD 2 YRS 2 LIE WOLF, ALL BRANCHES Of GOV,& TOTAL CORRUPT POWER WHERE WAS HIS CRISIS THEN.

Cher’s fervent hostility toward Trump goes back years; in June 2016, at a ""She's With Us"" concert held in honor of Hillary Clinton, Cher snapped , “When I see Trump talking, I just want to blow my brains out, well maybe not my brains but I'm just like 'What are you talking about, Jesus!'

The Democrats Raised A Lot Of Money In The First Months Of The 2020 Campaign. President Trump Outraised ALL Of Them. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45969/democrats-raised-lot-money-first-months-2020-emily-zanotti,"The Democrats Raised A Lot Of Money In The First Months Of The 2020 Campaign. President Trump Outraised ALL Of Them. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images April 15, 2019 views
Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have hauled in record sums of money in the first fundraising quarter of the 2020 election cycle, but none of them can hold a candle to President Donald Trump, who took in a whopping $30 million, according to The Washington Post .
The sum ""far outpaces"" any of the Democratic contenders, the WaPo reports, and dwarfs the candidate with the next highest fundraising totals, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who pulled in around $18 million .
Monday is the last day that Federal Election Commission reports, which should have been filed at the beginning of April, can be turned in for candidates who declared their intent to run for president in the first quarter of 2019.
Among the Democrats, Sanders easily leads the way, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) following far behind at $11 million, according to a CNN live feed of the FEC ""reveals."" Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), expected to be the next strongest fundraiser after Sanders, has not yet reported her earnings (she's expected to have earned around $12 million).
Democrats competing for the presidency must be at least 1% in the polls or have grabbed cash from at least 65,000 separate donors to demonstrate a base of support. If a candidate falls below either of those thresholds, they will not be allowed to take the stage in the first primary debate, scheduled for late May or early June.
But the real shock isn't how much Democrats have raked in, but rather how much Republicans have.
""President Trump’s reelection campaign raised more than $30 million in the first three months of the year, far outpacing each of the top Democratic contenders who seek to oust him from office,"" WaPo reports, and even that pales in comparison to what the Republican National Committee has collected in the same time frame.
""The AP reported that the Republican National Committee brought in $45.8 million in the first quarter, bringing the joint pro-Trump effort’s cash on hand to $82 million.""
That's nearly double the combined total for all Democratic candidates, and neither Trump nor the RNC has begun fundraising in earnest for the 2020 presidential campaign. Trump has held a few rallies, but they've largely been to push supporters to back specific programs, or to demonstrate his popularity, not to rake in funds for his fledgling re-election campaign.
Trump is also doing very well among small-dollar supporters — nearing Bernie Sanders, who is considered to be one of the best small-dollar fundraisers in presidential history. A shocking ""98.79% of first quarter contributions to the Campaign and the joint committees came from 'low-dollar' contributions, defined as $200 or less,"" according to The Washington Post and Associated Press, and the ""RNC and the joint fundraising committees have already enlisted 100,000 new small donors in 2019 and have acquired more than one million new small donors since Inauguration Day.""
The average donation to both coffers was around $35, per the FEC report.
That all bodes very well for the president, as does the news that his first quarter fundraising outpaces both Hillary Clinton's in 2016 and Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, which, at this point in his presidency, had only about $2 million in its war chest ."
Hypocrite Much? Kamala Harris Admits To Owning A Gun For Personal Safety. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46000/hypocrite-much-kamala-harris-admits-owning-gun-josh-hammer,"Hypocrite Much? Kamala Harris Admits To Owning A Gun For Personal Safety. Drew Angerer/Getty Images April 15, 2019 views
While campaigning in Iowa last week, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) made a confession that would have been seen as unremarkable in previous decades, but which now strikes us as perhaps unusual for the increasingly far-left modern Democratic Party.
It turns out that Kamala Harris is...wait for it...drumroll please...a gun owner. Gasp!
Nate Madden of Conservative Review reports :
At a campaign stop in Iowa, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris stated that she owns a gun for protection.
""I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason that a lot of people do: for personal safety,"" Harris told a group reporters. She cited her past as a career prosecutor.
She went on to try to distance herself from far-left proposals to confiscate firearms while promoting other forms of gun control.
""In terms of gun policy, though, I think that for too long and still today, we are being offered a false choice,"" she said, ""which suggests you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away."" . @KamalaHarris on gun policy: “I am a gun owner ... We are being offered a false choice, which suggests you’re either in favor of the 2nd Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away.” #IACaucus pic.twitter.com/qAmPpTRHY7 — Iowa Starting Line (@IAStartingLine) April 11, 2019
But political observers might be forgiven for thinking that Harris's paean to the benefits of gun ownership — such as increased personal safety — might come across as more than a little hypocritical.
As The Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra tweeted in January, Harris has fully endorsed the banning of the cosmetically amorphous and technically undefinable faux class of firearms commonly referred to as ""assault weapons"": Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) calls for banning semi-automatic weapons, says they have no place “in a civil society” pic.twitter.com/KR6VRtGjbu — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) January 29, 2019
One problem with this, as I argued in a Daily Wire op-ed in January, is that Harris's logic could — and, if truly followed to its natural conclusion, would — lead to a ban on all semi-automatic firearms:
[T]he logic here is inescapable. Semi-automatic weapons are defined by their automatically reloading one new round into the firing chamber upon the discharge of a round. There is literally no intellectually defensible and mechanically relevant line to draw between much-maligned ""assault weapons"" and the run-of-the-mill semi-automatic handguns that tens of millions of Americans (including yours truly) carry daily. None. Zilch. A Sig Sauer or Glock semi-automatic handgun is, mechanically speaking, only distinct from an AR-style semi-automatic sporting rifle in terms of such technical specifics as muzzle velocity. But these are mere differences in degree — not categorical differences in kind.
Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro concurred at the time, writing that ""Harris embraced a full-scale ban on semi-automatic weapons.""
It is therefore difficult to interpret Harris's recent Iowa campaign trail touting of gun ownership as anything other than sheer hypocrisy.
Although Harris apparently highly values her personal safety, she may not have always highly valued her lungs. In a somewhat amusing incident in February, as The Daily Wire also reported , Harris was chastised by her Jamaican father for her facetious jesting about personal marijuana use:
As The Washington Times reports, Mr. Donald Harris — a professor of economics at Stanford University — is none too happy with his daughter's casual joking about her Jamaican background in invoking her previous marijuana use.
""My dear departed grandmother ... as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family’s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics,"" Mr. Harris told Jamaica Global Online. ""[As a family,] we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty,"" he added.
The prediction market website PredictIt currently pegs Harris as the fourth leading contender for the Democrats' 2020 presidential nomination, after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg."

On Monday, British Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn provoked fury when he insisted Shamima Begum, who allegedly worked with the terrorist group ISIS and is being stripped of her British citizenship, is still a British national and should be allowed to apply for legal aid to challenge that decision.
The Daily Mail reported that Corbyn said: “She is a British national and, therefore, she has that right, like any of us do, to apply for legal aid if she has a problem. She has legal rights, just like anybody else does. We cannot and should not judge outside of a court. A court must make that decision and every person in front of a court, whatever they're accused of doing, how heinous or bad the crime is, is entitled to that representation.” He called Home Secretary Sajid Javid's decision to strip the citizenship “very questionable.”
Tory MP Andrew Bridgen fired back, asserting it was “no surprise” Corbyn reacted the way he did, telling MailOnline: “It will come as no surprise that Jeremy Corbyn is supporting someone who was stitching suicide vests onto bombers a few months ago. People would not expect anything different from Jeremy Corbyn who has consistently supported terrorists and terrorist sympathizers, particularly if they are acting against our country.”
Tory MP David TC Davies pointed out that evidence had been found suggesting Begum sewed suicide bombers into explosive vests. He told Mail Online, “Given that evidence we need to do everything possible to ensure she does not come back into the UK. It’s staggering that we are now picking up legal bills for a bunch of lawyers who are going to work to get her back. Jeremy Corbyn needs to work out whose side he is on. Is he on the side of the British people, or people who worked to carry out acts [of] mayhem within our borders?’
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt supported Corbyn, saying, “On a personal level, it makes me very uncomfortable because she made a series of choices and she knew the choices she was making, so I think we made decisions about her future based on those choices. However, we are a country that believes that people with limited means should have access to the resources of the state if they want to challenge the decisions the state has made about them and, for obvious reasons, those decisions are made independent from politicians. The decision to deprive her of her citizenship was taken by a politician. Obviously the decision about whether she accesses legal aid or not has to be done independently.”
The Telegraph reported over the weekend that despite Begum’s claims that she was never involved in any brutal behavior, but rather simply served as an ISIS fighter’s wife, “She was allowed to carry a Kalashnikov rifle and earned a reputation as a strict ‘enforcer’ of Isil’s laws, such as dress codes for women, sources claimed.”
A law passed in Great Britain last week, called the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, makes it a criminal offense to enter or remain in terror hot-spots overseas. Javid stated, “These new laws give the police the ­powers they need to disrupt terrorist plots earlier and ensure that those who seek to do us harm face just punishment.”"

A female Democrat state representative from Ohio, Rep. Janine Boyd, drafted an amendment last week seeking to have black babies exempted from pro-life legislation dubbed the ""heartbeat bill,"" which bars babies with detectable heartbeats (around six weeks gestation) from being killed via abortion.
As reported by LifeNews, Boyd's bill ""would have given an exemption to African American women to abort their unborn babies for any reason up to the state’s current abortion limit, 20 weeks.”
Ironically, Boyd ""likened restrictions on abortion to slavery as she urged her fellow lawmakers to support the measure,"" the outlet noted.
“Black slaves were once treated like cattle and put out to stud in order to create generations of more slaves,” argued the Democrat. “Our country is not far enough beyond our history to legislate as if it is.”
Thankfully, Amendment 0291 failed, and the heartbeat bill was signed by Republican Governor Mike DeWine on Friday.
Former Planned Parenthood executive turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson ripped Boyd's targeted amendment, snarking that ""apparently a 38% national abortion rate in the African-American community isn’t enough.""
""A female, African-American democratic state representative from Ohio presented this amendment to the Ohio Heartbeat bill. This amendment would have made an exception for African-American babies...because apparently a 38% national abortion rate in the African-American community isn’t enough,"" posted Johnson to Facebook. ""The amendment was struck down 11-7.""
“To reference owning humans as a defense of dismembering them is moral myopia. If it is wrong to own humans, it is also wrong to intentionally kill them,” said pro-life group Created Equal president Mark Harrington, according to LifeNews.
“Referencing abortion to avoid consigning children to slavery, she seems to suggest black children today should likewise not be born—which is exactly the purpose of her amendment,” Harrington continued. “Every human being is valuable regardless of the color of his or her skin. To suggest that only black babies should be killed in Ohio is shocking racism not befitting of a representative of the Ohio House.”
Black babies are disproportionately victimized by abortion in the United States. As noted by Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley, “black women terminate pregnancies at far higher rates than other women,” nationally. “In 2014, 36% of all abortions were performed on black women, who are just 13% of the female population,” said Riley.
“The little discussed flip side of ‘reproductive freedom’ is that abortion deaths far exceed those via cancer, violent crime, heart disease, AIDS and accidents,"" he explained. ""Racism, poverty and lack of access to health care are the typical explanations for these disparities. But black women have much higher abortion rates even after you control for income. Moreover, other low-income ethnic minorities who experience discrimination, such as Hispanics, abort at rates much closer to white women than black women.""
Additionally, looking at the reality that most Planned Parenthood clinics are located in urban areas, and Boyd’s amendment as examples, one could surmise that black babies in the womb are being targeted. "
"Bernie Sanders Releases Tax Returns, Is Immediately Called Out For Stinginess | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46012/bernie-hank-berrien,"Bernie Sanders Releases Tax Returns, Is Immediately Called Out For Stinginess Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images April 16, 2019 views
Bernie Sanders, who incessantly preaches about the greediness of the upper class, has an interesting history; in the last ten years, as his income has risen, he has only once (barely) given more than 4% of his income to charity, twice given a little more than 3%, twice given roughly 2.5 %, and five times given less than 2% of his income to charity. — Andrew Kerr (@AndrewKerrNC) April 15, 2019
In fact, in 2016, he made over $1,062, 626 and gave slightly more than $10,600, which just so happens to amount to 1%. He got called out: Is that what they mean by the 1%? https://t.co/bmELZgfLIZ — Luke Rosiak (@lukerosiak) April 16, 2019 That's not even ONE PERCENT of his income! He wants to jack up your taxes for welfare, but didn't kick in anything to help the folks he allegedly cares SO much for. https://t.co/cWBzsawiNq — Andrew Follett (@AndrewCFollett) April 15, 2019 Couple points: 1. He is under no obligation to give away his money. 2. That said, why didn't he give it away...if he thinks its not really his money...but community property? 3. It does show he is more charitable with other people's money than he is with his own. https://t.co/h54SMxzFn5 — Pradheep J. Shanker (@Neoavatara) April 16, 2019
Considering how stingy Sanders is when it comes to charity, let’s review what he has said about people who make a lot of money and greedily hold on to it: Writing in the Burlington Free Press in May, 2011, Sanders stated, ""As Vermont's senator and a member of the Budget Committee, I will not support a plan to reduce the deficit that does not call for shared sacrifice … At a time when the top one percent earns more income than the bottom 50 percent, we must ask the wealthiest people in this country to start paying their fair share of taxes … Every segment of our society, including those who have money and power, must contribute and must sacrifice.""
The New York Times reported in 1981 that Sanders was hostile to charities:
For the kickoff of the 40th annual Chittenden County United Way fund-raising drive in Burlington, Vt., the sponsors considered themselves fortunate to have as guests Mayor Bernard Sanders of Burlington and Gov. Richard Snelling of Vermont. But the charity workers heard the sort of things they wanted to hear from only one of their guests. ''I don't believe in charities,'' said Mayor Sanders, bringing a shocked silence to a packed hotel banquet room. The Mayor, who is a Socialist, went on to question the ''fundamental concepts on which charities are based'' and contended that government, rather than charity organizations, should take over responsibility for social programs.
But Sanders’ stinginess predates the last ten years; as the independent newspaper Seven Days reported in 1996:
According to his 1995 tax return, Ol' Bernardo still doesn't believe in charity. Vermont's most prominent bald eagle raked in $133,000. About $8000 was deferred income. His 1040 reports ""total income"" of $125,842. According to the Bern's return (prepared by Progressive City Councilor Martha Abbott of Underhill, who runs Independent Tax Service, Inc.), Sanders paid $19,563 in federal taxes. Not bad. Sounds like Ms. Abbott really knows her stuff … And our beloved congressperson deducted a grand total of $1,369 for ""Gifts to Charity."" That's all of 1 percent of his impressive income going to charity.
For Sanders, apparently, charity begins at home. Vanity Fair reported in 2016, referencing a story in The Washington Free Beacon about Sanders’ wife Jane O’Meara Sanders and her daughter Carina Driscoll:
… the Free Beacon’s revelations about Sanders’s wife’s tenure as the president of Burlington College will certainly raise eyebrows. During her time there, the college paid nearly $500,000 to the Vermont Woodworking School, run by Driscoll, for classes, according to the Free Beacon. The college also reportedly paid tens of thousands of dollars to an all-inclusive Caribbean resort run by Jonathan Leopold, the son of a family friend, for a study-abroad program. Between 2009 and 2011, when O’Meara Sanders stepped down, Burlington College paid around $68,000 to the resort. The Free Beacon reports that payments to both the woodworking school and the resort stopped soon after she left.
But he does seem to have an obsession with millionaires (of which he is one) and billionaires: Recommended For You"
Two Men Allegedly Attack Trump Fan Wearing MAGA Hat Who Originally Came From West Africa | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46013/two-men-allegedly-attack-trump-fan-wearing-maga-hank-berrien,"Two Men Allegedly Attack Trump Fan Wearing MAGA Hat Who Originally Came From West Africa Montgomery County Police Department April 16, 2019 views
On Saturday, two men allegedly attacked a man wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat in Germantown, Maryland, roughly 30 miles from Washington, D.C.
The alleged victim, Atsu Nable, told FOX 5 that the two men approached him, indicating they did not like his hat and telling him to take it off. He claimed one man struck him from behind. He recalled, “I was like, ‘Why are you doing that? You know? We don’t have to do this.’” Nable said they answered, “No, no, no, no, that hat is not any good.” He continued, “ .. and then they started punching me on my head.”
Nable told Fox 5 that he informed them that he was free to have his own perspective and attempted to walk away but they kept striking him until he fell. He said they smashed his headphones; he claimed he tried to retrieve his cell phone and photograph them as they fled, prompting them to return and try to grab his cell phone, but he successfully fought them off.
Fox 5 reported, “Witnesses called 911 and Montgomery County police say officers canvassing the area found the two suspects at a nearby basketball court attempting to hide among the children playing.” The suspects, Scott Roberson, 25, and Jovan Crawford, 27, have been charged with robbery and second-degree assault.
Nable, who is an American citizen, said he legally emigrated from Togo in West Africa in 2007 and has been a fan of the Republican Party and President Trump since Trump started his candidacy. He said he went to Trump’s campaign events and volunteered to help when Trump was inaugurated.
There have been other recent incidents where people wearing MAGA hats have been attacked; in Late February, an 18-year-old Oklahoma high school student who encountered another student wearing a MAGA hat and a Trump 2020 flag like a cape, blocked the other student from passing him , and snapped, “Take it off or I'll rip it off … do you want me to rip it off?” and ""You going to rip it off or am I going to burn it?"" before knocking off the hat and ripping the flag away so he could throw it on the ground.
In mid-February, a woman at the Casa Vallarta Mexican restaurant near Falmouth, Massachusetts, allegedly assaulted a young man wearing a MAGA hat and got herself arrested ; it turned out that she was in the United States illegally. Also in mid-February, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, a man from Tennessee allegedly pulled a gun on a man wearing a Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat, stuck the gun in the MAGA-hat-wearing man’s face and reportedly threatened , “It’s a good day for you to die.”
Last November, a female Harvard University graduate student who had a MAGA hat and legally-owned guns in her room was asked by her apartment owner to move out after her roommates reportedly searched through her room and found the guns.

EXCLUSIVE: Actor Raymond Cruz Discusses His Upcoming Film ‘The Curse Of La Llorona’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Jacob Airey,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46017/exclusive-actor-raymond-cruz-discusses-his-jacob-airey,"EXCLUSIVE: Actor Raymond Cruz Discusses His Upcoming Film 'The Curse Of La Llorona' ""It’s a vicious cycle that goes on forever."" Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images for Warner Bros. April 16, 2019 views
Raymond Cruz is a Hollywood star who has had a prolific career, appearing on television's ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Major Crimes,"" as well as movies like ""From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money,"" ""Training Day,"" and ""Collateral Damage."" He recently spoke with The Daily Wire about his upcoming horror film, ""The Curse of La Llorona,"" which hits theaters on April 19 .
Q: For those unfamiliar, tell us what the ""The Curse of La Llorona"" is about?
Cruz: It’s a horror film based on a folk tale that goes back hundreds of years. It is very popular with the Latin community. It’s based on a dark entity that roams the earth in search of children to replace the one that she lost. Originally, La Llorona was a married woman who discovered her husband was having an affair and she ended up drowning their kids in a fit of rage. She took her own life after that and is now roaming the earth in search of children to replace the ones she lost — a void that can never be filled. It’s a vicious cycle that goes on forever.
Q: What role do you play in the film?
Cruz: I play Rafael, an ex-priest who left the church because he felt that they weren’t doing enough to help people struggling with these supernatural occurrences. He goes out on his own and becomes basically a shaman — a mystic. He’s essentially a witch doctor who balances his faith with his knowledge of shamanism to help combat these supernatural entities.
Q: What makes it different from horror films?
Cruz: It’s different because of the cultural connection. It’s a Latin phenomenon that is being shared with the rest of the world. In my opinion, the best horror movies are the ones based on these plausible entities and not some made-up CGI monster.
Q: This is Michael Chaves' directorial debut of a major motion picture. What was it like working with him?
Cruz: It was great working with him! He’s so enthusiastic. He was going a hundred miles a minute and I was like, ""We have four to six weeks of shooting."" He has good energy, a love of the subject matter, and with him, you can’t wait to put the pieces together to see the film.
Q: What was it like behind the scenes during shooting?
Cruz: It’s really hard shooting a film. People don’t realize all of the nuts and bolts of it. It can be hard, so we lightened the mood. Linda (Cardellini) was great to work with. She had a great sense of humor. We had fun scaring the children on set and I’m sure they’re scarred for life. They asked me if La Llorona is real, and I said straight-out that she was and that changed everything.
Q: You’ve done roles in several genres, including science fiction, comedy, action, on stage, film, and on television. What is an aspect of horror that you like?
Cruz: I call it the ""Frankenstein aspect."" I saw ""Frankenstein"" when I was a kid and it fascinated me — this idea of a visceral creature wandering the earth in search of something, but everyone being afraid of him. As a kid, that made me love horror films and I would watch them every chance I got. So, to grow up and be a part of a big horror film is a rewarding experience.
Q: As far as acting in genres, what are your favorites ones to star in?
Cruz: I would say the drama genre. I’ve done so many roles in that and I like the challenge of it. Like on ""Breaking Bad,"" I loved the challenge of bringing the scenes to life. Any actor who is worth his weight, it is about the challenge of communicating the story.
Q: What is next for you, as far as projects?
Cruz: I’m really focused on writing and getting my own stuff made. I’m writing a TV series and a film. I don’t want to reveal too much of the project, but it is a horror film combined with spirituality.
Q: How would you encourage audiences to go see ""The Curse of La Llorona?""
Cruz: It’s a different take on a horror film, in regard to the Latin legend. Go see it and get your thrills. There’s a ton of jump scares. We’ve had people say that they stopped breathing because they were so scared. Part of my role is also to be comedic, so on top of the terror, I release some of the tension with humor.

Late Monday afternoon, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) put out a tweet concerning the horrifying fire that engulfed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris earlier in the day — a devastation to Catholics across the globe.
""Art and architecture have a unique ability to help us connect across our differences and bring people together in important ways,"" posted Rep. Omar. ""Thinking of the people of Paris and praying for every first responder trying to save this wonder.""

The embattled Democrat's response was quickly met with criticism from voices on the right over its vague nature.
Conservative commentator and National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch responded, ""Well, the 'architecture' that the art was housed in is a cathedral. While Biblically Christ is wherever His people are, Notre Dame is a significant and storied icon of faith."" Well, the “architecture” that the art was housed in is a cathedral.

Omar found herself under fire last week over a remark she made about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that took the lives of thousands of Americans. While speaking at an event for Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in March, the Democrat referred to the atrocity as an instance where ""some people did something.""
""Here’s the truth,"" Omar said at the event, according to Marketwatch. ""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. [The Council on American-Islamic Relations] was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""

"Over 10,000 Illegals In U.S. From Terror-Sponsoring States, Report Says | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46036/over-10000-illegals-us-terror-sponsoring-states-hank-berrien,"Over 10,000 Illegals In U.S. From Terror-Sponsoring States, Report Says Photo by Image Source/GettyImages April 16, 2019 views
According to a report from an organization that focuses on the problems with immigration, both legal and illegal, more than 10,000 illegal immigrants in the United States come from nations designated as terror sponsors.
As The Washington Examiner reports, “The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) revealed Friday that it has received documents under the Freedom of Information Act that show that the illegals have either been ordered deported or have pending final orders of removal, but are still in the U.S.”
IRLI reported , “In response to an IRLI Freedom of Information Act request, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) provided records that showed that as of June 2018, there were over 10,000 non-detained illegal aliens on ICE’s National Docket from Iran, Syria, Sudan, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Iran led the pack with over 6,000 or 61 percent of their citizens with removal orders followed by Syria with 20 percent, Sudan with 18 percent, and North Korea with less than a percent.”
The report quoted ICE Director Thomas Homan expressing his concern, asserting, “My biggest concern isn't how many terrorists have been arrested entering the country illegally, but how many got through? How many did Border Patrol not catch? That's what Americans should be thinking about.”
IRLI’s director, Dale L. Wilcox, added:
It’s simply unacceptable that we also have more than 10,000 aliens here from terrorist states that are sworn enemies of America. We saw on 9/11 the damage that only 19 sleeper cell terrorists could cause. This is just the latest example of the disaster of sanctuary laws, which force ICE agents to operate with one hand tied behind their backs while making our communities inherently more dangerous.
PJ Media noted, “State and local law enforcement agencies once coordinated with ICE to remove people on the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) list who were wanted on an administrative warrant for removal from the U.S., but sanctuary laws prevent such coordination. ICE has still removed an average of about 44 known or suspected terrorists per year in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, IRLI reported.”
The Washington Free Beacon reported in April 2018, “Iranian agents tied to the terror group Hezbollah have already been discovered in the United States plotting attacks.” The Beacon quoted various intelligence officials and former White House insiders saying Iran could use Hezbollah agents in America to mount a strike. Michael Pregent, a former intelligence officer, said, ""They are as good or better at explosive devices than ISIS, they are better at assassinations and developing assassination cells. They're better at targeting, better at looking at things … Hezbollah is smart. They're very good at keeping their communications secure, keeping their operational security secure, and, again, from a high profile attack perspective, they'd be good at improvised explosive devices.""
Emanuele Ottolenghi, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, added, “The answer is absolutely. We do face a threat. Their networks are present in the Untied States … It doesn't take many of them to penetrate this country and be a major threat. They can pose a major threat to our homeland."" He concluded, ""Iran's proxy terror networks in Latin America are run by Tehran's wholly owned Lebanese franchise Hezbollah. These networks are equal part crime and terror and have the ability to provide funding and logistics to militant fighters. Their presence in Latin America must be viewed as a forward operating base against America's interest in the region and the homeland itself.” "
"Federal Judge Unseals Criminal Complaint Against Julian Assange, But Is It Enough For Conspiracy? | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46028/federal-judge-unseals-criminal-complaint-against-emily-zanotti,"Federal Judge Unseals Criminal Complaint Against Julian Assange, But Is It Enough For Conspiracy? Jack Taylor / Stringer / Getty Images April 16, 2019 views
A federal judge ordered a 2017 criminal complaint lodged by federal investigators against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange unsealed on Monday, giving Americans their first glimpse at the evidence the United States will likely bring to an early June hearing in the U.K. demanding Assange's extradition.
The Hill reports that the ""original affidavit and criminal complaint were made public in a Virginia federal court for the first time since they were filed in 2017, and they include chat logs between Assange and former U.S. intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.""
It is on these chats that investigators are basing their indictment, claiming that Assange's communications with Manning amounted to a conspiracy between the two to hack classified documents belonging to the United States military. Manning was eventually convicted of espionage because of his actions, locating, cracking and downloading thousands of intelligence cables, audio and video files, and passing them to Wikileaks for publishing.
The United States is alleging that once Assange had received the first batch of files from Manning, that he worked directly with Manning to obtain more classified information, instructing and counseling Manning on how to crack passwords and download secret files.
The documents certainly claim to show collaboration. The government's complaint and an accompanying affidavit are full of snippets from chat logs obtained from Manning's computer, showing Manning communicating with an individual who appears, from clues dropped in the conversations, to be Julian Assange.
The ""individual,"" the government claims ""appeared to have extensive knowledge of WikiLeaks' day-to-day operations, including knowledge of submissions of information to the organization, as well as of financial matters,"" making it highly likely Manning was communicating directly with Julian Assange. At some point in a follow up interview, Manning also seems to have admitted that ""the person i was communicating was in fact assange.""
But even as the documents might establish Assange and Manning as collaborators in an effort to hack secret military files about airstrikes in Iraq, which Manning claims killed thousands of civilians, in order to prove that the pair were engaged in a ""conspiracy,"" the government must prove that there was a known outcome of their discussions.
In the chat logs, contained in the affidavit, Assange certainly appears to be passing on his code-cracking expertise to Manning, and passing on advice on how to break into secure networks, like the one Manning was scanning for evidence that the U.S. military was actively harming the Iraqi people. But the affadavit doesn't show that Manning and Assange had a specific target in mind — or, at least, the chat logs don't list one, and it's unknown whether Manning eventually used Assange's advice to successfully crack a secure network.
The complaint says that ""it remains unknown whether Manning and Assange were successful in cracking the password,"" but Manning was, indeed, eventually convicted on several counts under the Espionage Act for obtaining and disseminating classified material.
Whether this is enough to extradite Assange will be up to a court in the United Kingdom, which will entertain evidence that Assange should be shipped back to the United States to stand trial sometime in early June. It's likely the court will also consider a competing request for extradition from Sweden, where Assange is wanted on sexual assault charges."
"WALSH: Modern Churches Are Hideous. After Notre Dame, Let’s Start Building Beautiful Churches Again. | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46027/walsh-modern-churches-are-hideous-after-notre-dame-matt-walsh,"April 16, 2019 views
My wife and I once walked into a mall in Kentucky only to discover that it was not a mall, but was actually a megachurch. The building looked in every way like a mall and there was, at the time, no religious paraphernalia on the exterior that would have disabused us of this notion. Once inside the structure, the only thing that gave away the game was a young woman in a neon green T-shirt handing out programs. We accepted one politely and promptly left as soon as she turned away.
I thought about that incident yesterday as I watched the Notre Dame Cathedral burn. Nobody would ever mistake Notre Dame for anything but a building constructed to worship and glorify God. To gaze upon it, even now after the fire, is to have a religious experience. Its beauty brings your mind almost unwittingly to higher things. It focuses your sights upward, both physically and spiritually. It is, in a word, beautiful.
Not every church can look like that ancient cathedral. Perhaps no church ever will. Even Notre Dame may never again look like Notre Dame. But churches are still being built and lots of money is spent on building them. They could be made beautiful — not Notre Dame Cathedral-level beautiful, but beautiful — yet they are not. It is not that we nowadays try to make beautiful churches and fail. Rather, we try very hard to make unbeautiful, bland, ugly, profane churches and we succeed. Our houses of worship look like shopping malls or prisons or basketball stadiums on purpose. Whereas Notre Dame stands out gloriously amid the Paris skyline, modern churches shrink away from your gaze and blend in with their surrounding environs like the shy kid at the homecoming dance.
Even the names of the churches are specifically devised to be as un-churchy as possible — ""Crosspoint"" or ""New Horizons"" or some such thing. Is it a church or a rehab center for wealthy drug offenders? I guess we are meant to remain in the dark — and the sermons offered at these places rarely clarify matters. The modern church experience is designed so that you might actually walk into the place, sit through a whole service, and never be quite sure that you attended church at all. It is similar to how modern art museums seem like they are trying to trick you into thinking that you've accidentally wandered into an abandoned warehouse where a homeless lunatic spends his days trying to communicate with space aliens.
The church I attended as a child was newly built and fascinating to behold because it seemed that every architectural choice was made in order to maximize its ugliness to the greatest degree. Old Catholic churches were designed so that everyone inside (including the priest) would at all times be facing the cross and the tabernacle. Lots of time and care was put into making this focal point as magnificent as possible. But the focal point of this new church was the chair in which the priest sat — and behind him were the humongous decorative organ pipes. The tabernacle was tucked safely off to the side, out of view. No stained glass. Few crosses. Little in the way of artwork. The architect tried at every turn to avoid beauty at all costs (and what a cost it was), and no one can deny that he completed his mission.
I have no problem with simple churches. I quite like the unassuming little old church houses that you find when you travel across Pennsylvania or New Hampshire or Virginia — the kind where invariably there will be no air conditioning, and no cushions on the pews, and no cry room for fussy babies, but always an unmistakable charm and feeling of connection to the past that you’ll never experience in the comfortable, temperature-controlled confines of a place like Elevation Church or one of its cousins.
Simple does not equate to ugly. Mountains are simple. Oak trees are simple. Infants are simple. Tiny colonial-era churches are simple. All are simple in different ways, yet are beautiful in different ways. Modern churches are not simple and they are not cheap. But all of the money and care and complexity is devoted to keeping the hearts and minds of the congregation pointed towards earthly things, and especially towards the guy up on the pulpit (or stage, I suppose) delivering his vaguely theological opinions. He wouldn’t want any pesky artwork distracting you from the solemn business of listening to him ramble.
That’s the worst part about the modern trend of intentionally making our churches ugly: It cloaks itself in the guise of self-abdicating humility, when really the situation is exactly the opposite. Michelangelo showed humility when he spent four years on his back painting the story of the Bible onto the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Modern churches show extraordinary self-conceit when they expend their energy building elaborate but hideous sets for the band and pastor to occupy.
There would be no weeping throngs taking to the streets if one of these modernist behemoths burned to the ground, so long as nobody was inside at the time. It would be a matter for the insurance companies to handle, and within a few weeks nobody would remember what the big dumb thing looked like. People wept over Notre Dame for the same reason that a patriotic American would weep if Fort McHenry — the fortress whose star-spangled banners inspired our national anthem during the War of 1812 — burned to the ground. We do not idolize the structures themselves, but we revere what they represent and what their presence and their history bring to mind. That is why the beauty of a church is so important, and why its ugliness is such a tragedy, and why I pray to God that the events of this week might inspire us to once again reach for the artistic heights our ancestors sought, and attained."
Hard Left Celebrates Notre Dame’s Destruction: ‘I’m Dying At All The White People Triggered’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46029/hard-left-celebrates-notre-dames-destruction-im-paul-bois,"April 16, 2019 views
As Christians and non-Christians alike stood in solidarity on Monday and mourned the loss of a cathedral that Pope Francis humbly labeled an ""architectural jewel of a collective memory,"" the halls of social media were occasionally disrupted by vocal minorities of hard leftists who reveled in Notre Dame's destruction.
What joy could people possibly be expressing as fires savaged an 800-year-old cathedral? According to some of these hard leftists, the destruction symbolized the Catholic Church's karma for centuries of cruelty or, at the very least, colonial France's karma for what it has allegedly done to other cultures. A thread compiled by Andy Ngo of Quillette best illustrated the collective mockery: Thread of those who are pleased to see the destruction of the #NotreDame or are using the incident to score social justice points. #Paris https://t.co/eZW08Dp3TF pic.twitter.com/bIFYINiH1K — Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) April 15, 2019
""I wonder how many art pieces and artifacts that were sitting in the Notre Dame were stolen from former colonies,"" said user Shaziya. When confronted with criticism and backlash, she doubled down: ""I’m criticizing French colonialism, if this bothers you so much then you ought to reevaluate your morals, bye.""
""I think it sucks that Notre Dame is burning but f*** imagine if we had this same energy for every historic building we carpetbombed in the Middle East,"" said another user.
Other users reveled in the fact that ""white people"" were saddened to see Notre Dame go up in flames. ""I'm dying at the white people triggered,"" said one person named Aly. ""It's a damn building that's literally used for tourism, no one died, move on.""
While Notre Dame indeed invited tourists to look upon its magnificent beauty, becoming one of France's most iconic landmarks, the cathedral still served as a home to practicing Catholics who worshiped God through the Holy Mass every Sunday — not to mention the multiple popes in recent history who have led processions there. The church hosted weddings, funerals, and consecrations. It never sacrificed its Christian mission at the altar of commercialism, as perhaps best exemplified by the priceless relics — including the crown of thorns said to have been worn by Christ — that Notre Dame housed within its walls.
""Notre Dame on fire is the most aesthetically pleasing visually I've ever seen,"" said another user.
""This one's for colonizing African countries b****,"" said another user.
""Notre Dame burning is cosmic karma for all the historical sites and artefacts [sic] France destroyed and stole when being colonialist scum,"" said the blue-checkmark ""culture writer"" Hikikomori Povich.
Showtime associate producer Muna Mire offered this take: this is probably a savage opinion to have but i really dont care about notre dame that much i stopped having feelings when they destroyed every cultural relic in iraq, syria, etc — muna (@Muna_Mire) April 15, 2019
In the chaos of the destruction, people on social media immediately jumped to conspiracy theories as to who started the attack. According to investigators on Tuesday, arson has been ruled out and the probe will focus on the construction firm hired to renovate the cathedral.
""Just a little less than 24 hours after a blaze ripped through Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris prosecutors are saying the fire was likely an accident, not arson, and that the construction company in charge of a $5.6 million renovation to the cathedral's roof and spire will be under the microscope,"" The Daily Wire's Emily Zanotti reported .
In the meantime, two French billionaires have pledged over 300 million Euro to rebuild Notre Dame, with many from across the world also offering to donate funds. As the fire calmed, French President Emmanuel Macron promised that his government and subsequent governments will ensure that the cathedral glorifies the Parisian skyline once again."
HAMMER: Duke And UNC Should Both Be Ashamed Of Their Co-Hosted Jew-Bashing Conference | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46045/hammer-duke-and-unc-should-both-be-ashamed-their-josh-hammer,"April 16, 2019 views
In late March, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) and my alma mater, Duke University, co-hosted a conference entitled, ""Conflict over Gaza: People, Politics, and Possibilities."" Specifically, the conference was co-hosted by the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies , which received a whopping $235,000 Department of Education grant last year to defray costs and help host the event.
In a truly shocking and in no way whatsoever eminently predictable turn of events, the conference ended up being a vile Israel-bashing — and, indeed, Jew-bashing — imbroglio. The conference deserves universal condemnation.
I mean, who in his right mind could have thought that a conference dedicated to the situation in the Gaza Strip — a beleaguered area from which Israel famously unilaterally withdrew in 2005 and in which local Gazans subsequently democratically elected Hamas , a Sunni sharia supremacist jihadist group, to lead them — could lead to scurrilous defaming of a pivotal American ally and bigoted howling against the most systemically persecuted group of people in recorded human history?
As it turns out, UNC and Duke received no shortage of up-front warnings from concerned citizens about the obvious nature of the conference. Beth El Synagogue, a longstanding Durham, North Carolina fixture that sits near Duke's East Campus, sent a letter to the universities noting that the ""program imbalance"" would ""fuel concern in the Jewish community ... [about] an atmosphere in which an exchange of perspectives is unwelcome and where Israel will be demonized."" And in a piece last month at The Tower, Peter Reitzes carefully highlighted the deeply troubling nature of some of the conference's participants:
For instance, providing welcoming remarks is speaker Laila El-Haddad, who has tweeted ""Israel is a terrorist state"" and is an outspoken supporter of the BDS movement. ...
El-Haddad has charged Israel with ""equating [Palestinian] children with human cannon fodder"" and with seeking the ""extermination"" of Palestinians. ...
El-Haddad has publicly supported terror tunnels burrowed from Gaza into Israel. The purpose of these tunnels is to kill and kidnap Israelis. El-Haddad tweeted, ""#ResistanceTunnels have existed in #Gaza since ancient times: they stifled Alexander the Greats attempts to conquer the city. #justsaying.""
Comparing Gaza to the Holocaust, El-Haddad wrote, ""The real genocide in Gaza cannot or will not be assessed through sheer numbers. It is not a massacre of gas chambers. No. It is a slow and calculated genocide – a Genocide through more calibrated, long-term means.""
Alas, the conference went on as expected. Far from even attempting to present a purportedly balanced perspective, Duke and UNC Hillels were explicitly barred by the very event organizers themselves from even participating — UNC Hillel would later formally condemn the event. Rapper Tamer Nafar sang a grotesquely anti-Semitic ""song"" at the event. General demonization of Israel and downplaying of Israel's legitimate security concerns were ubiquitous . In acts of facial anti-Semitism, Jewish audience members were expressly cut off from even asking questions to the biased participants. Here is how Reitzes finally summarized the event, after it was all over:
This conference was about Israel-bashing and was held on Shabbat, a time that excluded observant Jewish students and community members from participating. A speaker who promoted BDS against Israel at the conference refused to speak with a Jewish student from Duke. Jewish and pro-Israel audience members were told that they could ask a question only, while pro-Palestinian questioners were allowed longer periods of time to comment and set up their questions. Conference attendees were greeted with photographs glorifying terrorism against Israel and the Jewish people. Mainstream pro-Israel groups, such as the UNC and Duke Hillel student chapters, were not invited to participate.
Amy Rosenthal at Algemeiner succinctly described the affair: ""UNC and Duke University have sunk to a new low with this propaganda-fest."" And to make matters even more unspeakably abhorrent, days after the conference, the UNC library was defaced with swastikas and even outrageous fliers that urged students to ""do everything you can to fight the silent covert Jewish attempt to enslave and kill good Americans."" Because who could have possibly predicted that such an egregious conference about the Hamas-electing — and, by and large, anti-Semitic to its core — Gazan population could ever transmogrify into pure, unambiguous Judeophobia?
Why on Earth did the U.S. taxpayer, via the aforementioned Department of Education grant, underwrite this disgusting gathering transparently dedicated to Jew-hatred?
Shamefully, Duke has a long history of engaging in such disgraceful anti-Semitic antics and entertaining such horrific figures — something that, as a concerned alum, I have been personally sounding the alarm about for years . Most recently, the Haym Salomon Center's Sloan Rachmuth wrote a Daily Wire op-ed less than two months ago titled, ""Duke University Is Not A Safe Space For Jews"":
The Duke campus has been the target of numerous anti-Semitic incidents in just the past few months, including destruction of Jewish property, genocidal expression, demonizing Jews and delegitimizing the Jewish state's right to exist, according to the anti-Semitism watchdog group AMCHA Initiative.
A recent editorial in the student newspaper, The Chronicle, describes Israel as a ""murderous"" country with ""genocidal policies."" Titled, "" AIPAC And The Blockade On Critiquing Israel ,"" the piece, authored by the editorial board, defends the ""ill-conceived wording"" of Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar's recent tweet invoking the old anti-Semitic canards of Jewish power and money. ...
A member of the far-left anti-Israel group Students for Justice in Palestine posted a meme mocking Jewish Duke students who were made to feel uncomfortable by The Chronicle's article. ""Let's also not forget Israel's habit of forcibly sterilizing African/black+brown immigrants,"" posted another student.
Adding insult to injury, the mainstream media have been woefully silent in giving this misbegotten, rotten gathering of misanthropes the foul press they so richly deserve. As a modicum of sanity, local U.S. congressman Rep. George Holding (R-NC) has penned a letter to U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that urges an investigation into the hate-fest — including but hardly limited to ascertaining how such a bigoted affair received taxpayer funding, and to ensure that such an event never again receives a Department of Education grant.
The present on-campus situation for Jews and Israel at American universities is, to put it mildly , very , very bad. Jews, already (by far) the most frequent target of religious motivated hate crimes according to FBI statistics , are frequently discriminated against on university campuses under the thinly veiled guise of ""intersectional"" advocacy . Clearly, Jewish and pro-Israel intellectuals need to formulate comprehensive strategies for countering and combating the deeply pernicious strand of Jew-hatred that is increasingly ascendant among wide swaths of the pro-Islamism/pro-Palestinian progressive, activist, and on-campus Left.
But for the time being, righteous indignation is called for. Absolute, unqualified shame on each of Duke and UNC."

It is a great tragedy that the Notre Dame cathedral burned yesterday. But what is it about that church, and those like it, that we find so awe inspiring? And why don’t we build churches of that sort anymore? Today I want to talk about the need for beauty in the church, and why we should start building beautiful churches again. Also, I’m going to defend someone I don’t usually defend. And I’ll answer your emails, including one about the rapture."

On Wednesday’s episode of “The Andrew Klavan Show,” the bestselling author discusses how the burning of Notre Dame is a tragedy not just for France and Europe, but for all of Western Civilization. Transcript and video below.
Joan of Arc became a hero to the French in the 15th century during the Hundred Years War. A peasant girl who received heavenly voices and visions, she believed she had a mission to overthrow the English and put Charles VII on the throne. It is said she convinced Charles to place her at the head of his armies by revealing things to him in private only the angels could have told her. Her victories at Orleans and elsewhere gave Charles the crown he wanted. Captured by pro-English nobles and abandoned by the King, she was handed over to England and tried for witchcraft, heresy, and cross-dressing. She was convicted and burned at the stake; a death that understandably terrified her. It’s said that as she was dying, she cried out to nearby clergymen to lift up a crucifix ""hold the cross high"" she said, ""so I can see it through the flames.""
I was reminded of those words yesterday as I watched Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris burning. When Saint Joan died in 1431, she was only 19. But the cathedral had already been standing for nearly 170 years. It stood as a symbol of the nation, of its civilization, and of its God from the 13th century on. It has withstood every war and disaster that has fallen on the great city. But while its iconic towers remain and precious artwork and relics have been saved, the fire destroyed much of the interior.
The cause of the blaze is not yet known, and investigators say they have found no sign of arson and are treating it as an accident possibly connected to construction work being done at the site. But the strange silence that has fallen over the press, the sudden unwillingness to speculate, or even question authorities about their investigation and especially the self-imposed censorship of any mention of the plague of church arsons and desecration that has fallen on France during Lent this year, that silence, that censorship speaks more than words about what everyone is thinking and what everyone fears.
I couldn't watch the beautiful structure burn from within without sensing I was looking at a symbol of what has happened not just to France but to Europe and maybe to Western Civilization as a whole.
So, I’ve got to tell you about Notre Dame. I loved that cathedral. I must have been to that cathedral at least half a dozen times. Every time I go, I would climb up the towers the inside towers these weird 13th-century steps just a very claustrophobic, beautiful climb. You get to the top. It is one of the great views of Paris, you'll ever see in Paris, of course, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. ...
If I had to list one of my ten favorite scenes maybe one of my five favorite scenes the 1939 version of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" If you've never seen it, the Victor Hugo classic turned to a movie. And of course, much changed for the screen, but it had Charles Laughton giving one of his greatest performances as the bell ringer Quasimodo in Notre Dame Cathedral. It has a wonderful scene where he's in love with the gypsy girl Esmeralda played by Maureen O'Hara when she must've been just a kid. She's so beautiful in it, and they decide they're going to hang her outside the cathedral for witchcraft. And poor Quasimodo this ugly little bent over man is watching from his perch in the Tower of Notre Dame, and he swings down on a rope and he sweeps her off the scaffold where they're going to hang her and he carries her back up into the cathedral where by law they were not allowed to arrest her. He holds up her body, she's fainted, he holds up her body and shouts ""Sanctuary! Sanctuary!"" and it's just one of the great scenes in all movies.
Anyway, I was just watching this, I think all of us felt the same way: we were all appalled to see this incredible monument of Western civilization in flames."
"WATCH: Fleccas Gets In 'Disguise,' Confronts Protesters Of His Speech On Trump | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46066/watch-fleccas-gets-disguise-confronts-protesters-james-barrett,"April 17, 2019 views
As part of his ""Trump's Not That Bad"" video series, Austen Fletcher of ""Fleccas Talks"" visited the campus of Kansas State University recently to give a speech sponsored by Turning Point USA. But when a small group of protesters gathered outside the venue, Fletcher decided to get in ""disguise"" and go down to join them. What results is a revealing back and forth between Fletcher's side and the protesters on what exactly they are there to condemn.
Before the event, Fletcher stands in one of the common areas and engages in some dialog with students passing by (video below). Citing Trump's work promoting prison reform, creating five million new jobs, reducing ISIS to under a thousand fighters, and his exoneration in collusion accusations, Fletcher manages to get some students to agree that Trump's not as bad as the media has made him out to be.
One male student notes that the other state school, Kansas University, has created a new class called "" Angry White Male Studies ,"" which promises to explore ""the deeper sources of this emotional state while evaluating recent manifestations of male anger"" in the U.S. and Britain since the 1950s. ""Employing interdisciplinary perspectives this course examines how both dominant and subordinate masculinities are represented and experienced in cultures undergoing periods of rapid change connected to modernity as well as to rights-based movements of women, people of color, homosexuals and trans individuals,"" the course catalog description reads.
Even some students who weren't complimentary of Trump, agreed that the media is biased and causing more division in the country.
Soon, some students begin to gather to protest the event. While protesters are provided various posters, the protest organizer begins to lead protesters in some warm-up chants: ""The people united will never be divided!"" he says through his bullhorn. ""We want to make sure they hear us in that room!"" he reminds them.
Written on the posters are various social justice messages, including ""Racism Has No Place Here,"" ""Rights For Minorities Don't Oppress The Majority,"" and ""No Hate At K-State.""
""This is what democracy looks like,"" the protest leader chants, the protesters, who are overwhelmingly white, repeating, ""This is what democracy looks like.""
Viewing the rather small protest group from the window, Fletcher explains that he's going to get into ""disguise"" and infiltrate the protest. His disguise is, well, not the most subtle.
Fleccas quickly gives up on the whole bunny glasses thing and just talks to the protesters, saying as he looks around at the signs that he doesn't disagree with any of them, except for those protesting the presence of TPUSA.
""'Racism has no place here.' Done, I agree,"" says Fletcher. ""'No hate at K-State.' I hope not. ... 'Bigotry is not welcome.' Where do I disagree with any of this?""
Asked by one of the TPUSA members what exactly they're protesting, the protest leader says they're not protesting anything specific the Kansas State chapter has done, rather the ""rhetoric"" of the national leaders of TPUSA.
The TPUSA member and Fletcher respond by asking for specific quotes and names. ""Case by case, we'll disavow it,"" says one of the conservatives.
But the protest leader refuses to get specific, saying, ""I did not come here to do that.""
Fletcher and the other conservatives push back, noting he came armed with his cell phone that supposedly has information on it.
Fletcher then bypasses the leader and directs some comments to the other protesters. ""Whatever you think you've heard about us, let us know,"" he says. ""I don't have any hate in my heart for anybody. I'm glad you're here. First Amendment right. It's our First Amendment right, too. I don't think we disagree on a lot. I think if we do, it's from a misunderstanding. I literally hold no hate in my heart for any group of people. I would never allow it to happen around me either. I've been an advocate for a number of different groups. I think you guys are doing a great thing in being out here and getting together. I do think that maybe you were misled a little bit when it comes to who we are as people.""
Another protest leader then takes to the bullhorn, cutting off Fletcher mid-speech, saying the leaders think ""this dialog is not helpful to proving our point"" and asking the protesters to move to a different location that will better get the attention of administrators.

Kim Foxx Texted Smollett Was A 'Washed Up Celeb Who Lied To Cops' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46075/kim-foxx-texted-smollett-was-washed-celeb-who-lied-hank-berrien,"Kim Foxx Texted Smollett Was A 'Washed Up Celeb Who Lied To Cops' Photo by Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images April 17, 2019 views
Obtained through an FOIA request by the Chicago Tribune , newly-revealed texts from State’s Attorney Kim Foxx to her top deputy, Joseph Magats, that were sent roughly two weeks before charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped show her referring to him as a “washed up celeb who lied to cops.”
Although Foxx’s office permitted thousands of internal texts and emails to be obtained by the Tribune, it refused to turn over its internal files. The Tribune reported, “The office, though, denied outright requests for its internal files, saying it did so because the judge presiding over the case had agreed to seal the public court file moments after prosecutors dropped all the charges.”
Another text from Foxx showed her writing, “Sooo …… I’m recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases … 16 counts on a class 4 becomes exhibit A.” Texts messages from State’s Attorney Kim Foxx to staff about two weeks before charges were dropped on Jussie Smollett. Refers to Smollett as a “washed up celeb who lied to cops.” Texts obtained through FOIA request. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/KWPKQzLQ8h — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) April 16, 2019
Additionally, Foxx compared Smollett’s case to the case of R&B singer R. Kelly , who was about to be charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. She wrote, “Pedophile with 4 victims 10 counts. Washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16. On a case eligible for deferred prosecution I think it’s indicative of something we should be looking at generally. Just because we can charge something doesn’t mean we should.”
According to the Tribune, the prosecutors’ office apparently notified Chicago police of their decision to drop charges against Smollett just before it was announced. The Tribune noted that reporters had possibly been alerted by a publicist for Smollett’s legal team and thus were already in the courtroom. Assistant State’s Attorney Risa Lanier texted, “It appears as if Jussie’s press person may have notified the press.”
The Tribune noted that after a spokeswoman informed the prosecutorial team that she had alerted a police department spokeswoman who would inform Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the decision, Foxx spoke with Johnson, later claiming to Magats, “He seemed satisfied with the explanation.”
But that perspective counters what followed, when Johnson publicly condemned the decision.
The Tribune noted that Foxx’s texts came after she had recused herself from the case, prompting the Tribune to ask Foxx’s office for an explanation. A spokeswoman for Foxx said Foxx contacted Magats “to discuss reviewing office policies to assure consistencies in our charging and our use of appropriate charging authority.”
On March 28, The Daily Wire reported:
Foxx's office was also forced to admit another egregious error late Wednesday, after the National District Attorney's Association issued a scathing letter rebuking Foxx's office for their conduct during the Smollett affair. Among their complaints, a prosecutor who recuses herself from a case should pull her entire staff from involvement in that case and appoint a ""special prosecutor,"" or she risks tainting the entire operation with her conflict of interest.
It turns out that, although Foxx claimed to have ""recused"" herself from the Smollett case over concerns that she'd communicated with a member of Smollett's family, she never made her recusal official. The term was used ""colloquially"" rather than ""legally,"" her office told Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass . Recommended For You"
France Will Host An International Design Competition To Replace Notre Dame's Fallen Spire | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46083/france-will-host-international-design-competition-emily-zanotti,"France Will Host An International Design Competition To Replace Notre Dame's Fallen Spire Omar Havana/Getty Images April 17, 2019 views
The French government announced Wednesday that it will sponsor an international contest for architects looking to contribute to the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral by designing a new spire to replace the one that collapsed in on the building during Monday's catastrophic fire.
Although the cathedral itself was built over the course of several centuries between 1100 and 1400, the spire, which was the most notable architectural aspect to perish in Monday's blaze, was added during a massive renovation of the cathedral around the turn of the 19th century. The architect who led the renovations capped off his project with the spire as a symbol of his contribution to the evolution of Notre Dame.
“Before the 19th century, the cathedral did not have a spire. It was (the architect) Viollet-le-Duc in the 19th century who decided to build the spire that we saw destroyed on Monday,"" France's Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a statement to media issued after a Wednesday morning Cabinet meeting.
French President Emmanuel Macron has promised a swift and comprehensive restoration project that he predicts will have the cathedral back to tip-top shape in less than five years. Experts say that's too short of a timeline, especially since experts have yet to assess the cathedral's stone facade for evidence of heat and fire damage that may have weakened the building's outer stone shell.
A full restoration, Newsweek reports , could take as much as 40 years, depending on how much damage has been done to the Cathedral's interior.
Phillippe told reporters that the French government, which has already received in excess of a billion dollars in donations to rebuild the Cathedral, will move as fast as it can, but acknowledged that the project is daunting.
“This is obviously a huge challenge, a historic responsibility,” Phillippe added.
Much to the dismay of historians, both Phillippe and Macron agree that some aspects of the cathedral should not be simply rebuilt, but should reflect a more ""modern era,"" and that the new spire should be ""adapted to technologies and challenges of our times,"" according to the Architects Newspaper .
""Whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc…or if, as is often the case in the evolution of heritage, we should endow Notre-Dame with a new spire,"" he added.
The competition will be open to architecture firms and individual architects from across the globe, and it will be up to the entrants whether they want to copy Viollet-le-Duc and replace the spire with a similar model, or whether they want to ""improve"" upon the original design, in order to give the cathedral a more modern feel. Rules guiding design submissions will be released soon.
This is not the first time that France has commissioned a ""modern"" update to one of its most significant buildings. In 1983, the French government commissioned architect I. M. Pei to ""overhaul "" the entrance and courtyard to France's crown jewel museum, the Louvre. Pei added a series of glass pyramids to the Louvre's central courtyard, and refashioned the entrance way to lead guests through one of the massive glass structures, down into the museum's lower levels.
Pei's design initially caused an uproar, but is now considered much-beloved. For the most part."
Criticism Of Ilhan Omar Isn't Incitement | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ben Shapiro,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46087/criticism-ilhan-omar-isnt-incitement-ben-shapiro,"Criticism Of Ilhan Omar Isn’t Incitement Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images April 17, 2019 views
A couple of years ago, I spoke at the University of California, Berkeley. My presence was apparently so offensive to a particular group of people that hundreds of police officers were necessary to ensure the safety of the event. As I spoke inside, the protesters milled about, chanting and shouting. One of their favorite ditties: ""SPEECH IS VIOLENCE!""
This, of course, is patent nonsense. Speech is not violence — and violence is not speech. Equating the two is the hallmark of a tyrannical worldview: If I can treat your speech as violence, then I am justified in using violence to suppress your speech. And yet that obvious fallacy has become the rallying cry in defense of execrable Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.
Omar, who has been content to spout openly anti-Semitic nonsense every several weeks since her election, came under fire this week for her remarks at an event in late March, shortly after her Democratic colleagues covered for her Jew hatred by watering down a resolution of condemnation. Speaking before the historically Hamas-friendly Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Omar unleashed a barrage of lies about the maltreatment of Muslims throughout America. In the midst of that barrage, she dropped a line about September 11: ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
That minimization of 9/11 — and that's what it is — resulted in blowback from conservatives. It's not as though Omar's history of treating terrorism with kid gloves is anything new, after all. In 2013, Omar did an interview in which she chided one of her professors for treating terrorist groups with horror while failing to do the same to America, England and the military: ""The thing that was interesting in the class was every time the professor said 'Al Qaida,' his shoulders went up. ... But you know, it is that you don't say 'America' with an intensity. You don't say 'England' with the intensity. You don't say 'the Army' with the intensity.""
In 2016, Omar wrote a letter to a judge asking for lighter sentences for men accused of being Islamic State group recruits, noting that these men merely ""chose violence to combat direct marginalization"" and calling their recruitment ""a consequential mistake"" that resulted from ""systematic alienation.""
In 2017, Omar wrote for Time magazine: ""We must confront that our nation was founded by the genocide of indigenous people and on the backs of slaves, that we maintain global power with the tenor of neocolonialism. ... Our national avoidance tactic has been to shift the focus to potential international terrorism."" That's not exactly a ringing rebuke of international terrorism.
But now Omar is criticizing those who merely quote her as inciting violence. She has claimed that President Trump, who posted a video that juxtaposed footage of 9/11 with her ""some people did something"" comment, is responsible for an uptick in the number of death threats she has received. Her close friend Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., went so far as to compare Omar to a victim of the Holocaust.
This is immoral in the extreme. Omar isn't a victim because she's being criticized. And speech isn't incitement. Sen. Bernie Sanders wasn't responsible for the congressional baseball game shooting. Former President Barack Obama wasn't responsible for the Dallas police shooting. And Trump isn't responsible for those who send Omar death threats. He's responsible for criticizing her — rightly, in this case. Democrats who hide behind the charge of incitement are simply attempting to quash debate. And that's far more dangerous for the future of America than criticizing a radical politician.

On Tuesday, appearing at a town hall at the University of Virginia, former congressman and current presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke offered a typically egocentric answer when asked why he donated so little money to charity: the audience should understand the sacrifice he’s making running for president.
The Dallas Morning News reported that Maura Nakahata, a senior majoring in chemistry with a minor in government, asked O’Rourke why if he made seven times what her sister made, she gave more money to charity than O’Rourke.
As Jenna Johnson of The Washington Post reported, O’Rourke responded loftily:
I’ve served in office since 2005. I do my best to contribute to the success of my community, of my state, and now, of my country. There are ways that I do this that are measurable and there are ways that I do this that are immeasurable. There are charities that we donate to that we’ve recorded and itemized, others that we have donated to that we have not. But I will tell you, I’m doing everything that I can right now, spending time with you — not with out kiddos, not back home in El Paso — because I want to sacrifice everything to make sure that we meet this moment of truth with everything we’ve got. At a town hall at the University of Virginia tonight, a student asked Beto O’Rourke why her sister, a recent college graduate, makes much less money than he does but has donated more to charity than the amount that he reported on his 2017 tax return. His response: pic.twitter.com/yNCK58KjTD — Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) April 17, 2019
Yet at the end of March, O’Rourke pontificated about how the wealth of the country must be shared, tweeting, ""The unprecedented concentration of wealth, power and privilege in the United States must be broken apart. Opportunity must be fully shared with all. We must all have the opportunity to succeed. Together. As one country."" The unprecedented concentration of wealth, power and privilege in the United States must be broken apart. Opportunity must be fully shared with all. We must all have the opportunity to succeed. Together. As one country. — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) March 30, 2019
In addition, O’Rourke had problems with the idea of sharing the massive amount of funds he had accumulated for his Senate race with other Democratic party sentaorial candidates who were in close races. As The Daily Wire reported in mid-October:
On Monday, Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke announced that despite the alleged pleas from other Democratic senatorial candidates for him to share some of the funds he has accrued for his campaign, he has no intention to do so, even though their races may be closer than his race against Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). According to The New York Times , Democrats feel that they would have a better chance in winning close Senate races in Missouri, Florida, and Indiana if O’Rourke would share the wealth.
O’Rourke has accumulated a $38.1 million war chest, the largest in Senate history; he informed reporters he will spend it all before Election Day. He sniffed that if his donors want to offer additional support to other candidates, they can fork over more cash, according to The Washington Examiner . O’Rourke said, ""I've got to honor the commitment that those who've contributed to this campaign have made to me, and their desire that we use this to win this election. If they want to contribute to someone else, they should do so. If they want to contribute to a campaign that's going to win this historic victory for Texas and the country, then I'm grateful for the contribution and I'm going to make the most of it, so that's what we're focused on.""
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, “Former congressman Beto O’Rourke (D-Tex.) released 10 years of tax returns last night. He and his wife reported $1,166 of charitable giving from a total income of $370,412 in 2017, the most recent year for which they released a return. That’s one-third of 1 percent.”
O’Rourke came in at the bottom of the list of current presidential candidates if you compare his giving in 2017 to their 2018 charity giving as cited by the Post, although none of them gave over 6%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and her husband donated 5.5%; Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) and his wife gave roughly 4%; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and his wife gave 3.4%; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and her husband gave just less than 2%, as did Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and her husband, and Sen. Kamala Harris and her husband gave 1.4%.
The latest figures regarding former Vice President Joe Biden came from 2015, when he and his wife gave roughly 1.8%."
"HAMMER: Yes, The United States Was Right To Deny Entry To BDS Co-Founder Omar Barghouti | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46068/hammer-yes-united-states-was-right-deny-entry-bds-josh-hammer,"April 17, 2019 views
As I reported last week, the United States recently denied entry to Omar Barghouti — the co-founder and leader of the inherently anti-Semitic ""Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions"" movement that incites economic warfare and sundry other forms of ""lawfare"" against the world's only Jewish state. Barghouti, born in the Muslim Brotherhood-cozy state of Qatar and hailing from a prominent Hamas-linked Palestinian-Arab clan, was scheduled to make stops at various northeastern U.S. universities, meet with lawmakers in Washington, D.C., and also attend his daughter's wedding in Texas.
Some on the Left — buttressed by some of the usual suspects on the virtue-signaling Right — have seen fit to condemn the United States' denial of entry for Barghouti. Consider far-left New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg :
In recent years, the American right has presented itself as a champion of free expression. Conservatives are constantly bemoaning a censorious campus climate that stigmatizes their ideas; last month, Donald Trump signed an executive order on campus free speech, decrying those who would keep Americans from ""challenging rigid far-left ideology."" The president said, ""People who are confident in their beliefs do not censor others.""
If that last line is true — and, uncharacteristically for Trump, I think it is — it says something about the insecurity of Israel’s defenders.
Goldberg's right-of-center colleague Bret Stephens, who previously served as editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post, agreed with her on the allegedly illiberal nature of Barghouti's denial. I'm a right-of-center Zionist, detest what Omar Barghouti stands for, and agree with my colleague @michelleinbklyn . https://t.co/yXRsUDBWAh — Bret Stephens (@BretStephensNYT) April 16, 2019
There are a few points to make about this kerfuffle.
Let's start with a bit of law. Although neither Goldberg nor Stephens questions the president's inherent constitutional and statutorily delegated authority to deny entry to any alien whose presence he deems to be against the national interest, it is worth re-emphasizing the unambiguous nature of that authority. Consider this brief excerpt from Chief Justice John Roberts' majority opinion in last Supreme Court term's Trump v. Hawaii decision (i.e., the ""travel ban"" case):
The [Immigration and Nationality Act] establishes numerous grounds on which an alien abroad may be inadmissible to the United States and ineligible for a visa. See, e.g. , 8 U. S. C. §§ 1182(a)(1) (health-related grounds), (a)(2) (criminal history), (a)(3)(B) (terrorist activities), (a)(3)(C) (foreign policy grounds). Congress has also delegated to the President authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens in certain circumstances. The principal source of that authority, § 1182(f), enables the President to ""suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens"" whenever he ""finds"" that their entry ""would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.""
Indeed, as Roberts also writes about § 1182(f), the statute ""exudes deference to the President in every clause."" The denial of entry to an alien seeking to arrive in the United States is a discretionary judgment call for the Executive Branch.
So the United States' denial of entry for Barghouti is unquestionably legal. After all, the United States is a sovereign nation and, in the 2012 Supreme Court case of Arizona v. United States , Justice Antonin Scalia properly described ""the power to exclude from the sovereign’s territory people who have no right to be there"" as ""the defining characteristic of sovereignty.""
The only question, then, is whether the Executive Branch properly made a discretionary judgment call that Barghouti's arrival in the United States would, in the aforementioned language of § 1182(f), ""be detrimental to the interests of the United States.""
The answer to this question is, very clearly, ""yes.""
The extended Barghouti clan has engaged in serial jihadist attacks against Israel and against Israeli Jews. In December, Saleh Barghouti was killed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) after he waged a vicious jihadist attack. As is standard IDF practice, the terrorist's home was destroyed — as the case may be here, just within the past 24 hours. The IDF noted as much on Twitter today: In Dec 2018, Salih Barghouti carried out a shooting attack in Ofra Junction, killing a baby and injuring 7 others. This morning, we demolished his residence. We will continue to fight terror. pic.twitter.com/6Ev9oaWDPL — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) April 17, 2019
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs speculated at the time that the Barghouti clan was teaming up in earnest with Hamas , the Sunni jihadist group that governs the Gaza Strip and is also active throughout Judea and Samaria. And The Jerusalem Post also elaborated upon the true nature of the extended Barghouti family:
Saleh was the most recent member of the prominent Barghouti clan to be involved in terrorist attacks against Israel. ... Saleh’s father, Omar, 65, spent more than 25 years in Israeli prison for his role in terrorism. The father was first arrested by the IDF in 1978 for killing an Israeli citizen and was sentenced to life in prison. However, Omar, who is known as Abu Asef, was released seven years later in a prison exchange. Since then, he has been repeatedly held in administrative detention for several years. Omar entered Israeli prison as a member of Fatah, but later became a prominent leader of Hamas. A clan member also named Omar Barghouti is a founding member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic Boycott of Israel and co-founder of [BDS]. Omar was born in Qatar.
But not only is the broader Barghouti clan closely linked to Hamas and jihadist attacks against Israel. Omar Barghouti himself is a co-founder and leader of a facially anti-Semitic global movement, BDS. BDS is, by definition, ""anti-Zionist""; and, as I wrote last month, ""anti-Zionism"" was a ""legitimate academic debate in the half-century between Herzl's initial formulation and Ben-Gurion's ultimate declaration , but...now serves as the thinnest of all thinly veiled ruses for genocidal aspirants who want to throw all the Juden into the Mediterranean ."" Furthermore, insofar as BDS dunderheads apply a double-standard wherein they routinely condemn Israel's alleged (but falsely characterized ) ""occupation"" of Judea and Samaria but ignore (actual) clear-cut occupations such as Turkey's continual presence in Northern Cyprus, they are engaging in the very Jew-hating hypocrisy that the U.S. State Department has long deemed to be anti-Semitic in nature.
But don't take it just from me. Take it from Barghouti himself — the man has expressly and unequivocally called for Israel's destruction and has routinely apologized for Palestinian-Arab jihad waged against Israeli Jews.
In a 2014 talk at UCLA, Barghouti denied that Jews have any right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland. In a seminal 2013 speech , he could not have been more explicit about his desire to see Israel wiped off the map: ""Definitely, most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine."" He has called Zionism ""a patently racist ideology that has served to enable and justify the ethnic cleansing of most of the indigenous people of Palestine."" And during the Second Intifada, which claimed the lives of roughly 1,000 Israelis and injured thousands more, Barghouti characterized the sustained jihad as merely being ""the heroism and costs of the resistance.""
Omar Barghouti is a vile anti-Semite whose constant apologia for genocidal jihad and calls for the destruction of a core United States ally make him no friend whatsoever to the republic. It is the responsibility — indeed, the duty — of any sovereign nation to deny entry to such noxious alien miscreants. The Trump Administration was absolutely right to deny entry to Barghouti last week."
WATCH: Anti-Trump Voter Still Blasts CNN's Townhalls: They're 'All Fake' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46088/watch-anti-trump-voter-still-blasts-cnns-townhalls-hank-berrien,"WATCH: Anti-Trump Voter Still Blasts CNN's Town Halls: They're 'All Fake' Photo by Michael Laughlin/Sun Sentinel/TNS via Getty Images April 17, 2019 views
At a town hall featuring New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one attendee who is obviously not a fan of President Trump still took a hard shot at CNN for their town hall format, snapping that CNN’s town halls were “all fake; they already got people out in the audience already picked who they want to ask the questions.”
As The Washington Free Beacon reports, the man stood up at the Iowa Democratic Party Black Caucus Meeting to ask a question but prefaced it with a blast at CNN, stating:
If CNN is in this house, you need to take a lesson from her. This is what you call a real townhall meeting. All of that mess that CNN be doing is all fake; they already got people out in the audience already picked who they want to ask the questions. It ain’t going down like that here. So CNN need to take a lesson in this: All the signing in and all that little mess that y’all got to do, you got to have a ticket and all, showing your new phone, that “Hey, I’m here,” able to come in and all that old mess.
After Booker laughed and asked the man to offer his question, the man called President Donald Trump the ""so-called president"" and said he had been ""lying.""
CNN has been ripped for its town halls before, with their most notable example being the Parkland town hall after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. In mid March, after CNN trumpeted that the network had won the Walter Cronkite Award, administered by USC’s Norman Lear Center, for the Parkland town hall in which NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch was booed and even called a “murderer,” National Review’s Charles C.W. Cooke recalled of the Parkland town hall:
This wasn’t “journalism.” It wasn’t a “town hall,” either. The name of the event was “Stand Up: The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action,” which should give those of you who didn’t watch it an indication of what “advance the national conversation on gun control and violence” means in practice. This was the event at which the now-removed Sheriff Scott Israel had the temerity to play the put-upon hero. It was an event at which traumatized children were encouraged to scream at adults that they were literally trying to kill them. It was an event devoid of reflection, reason, thought, or facts. All that was missing was the pitchforks. This wasn’t a “conversation.” It was a cultural bloodletting, that, far from serving any public interest, just made everyone more angry with each other than they already were.
The Daily Wire noted in February 2018: “A 2016 piece by Michelle Malkin documented numerous examples of times in which CNN has stacked the audience and only allowed questions to go to people who are big-time Democrats"":
CNN has a long history of allowing political plants to flourish in its public forums. At the cable station’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas in 2007, moderator Wolf Blitzer introduced several citizen questioners as “ordinary people, undecided voters.” But they later turned out to include a former Arkansas Democratic director of political affairs, the president of the Islamic Society of Nevada, and a far-left anti-war activist who’d been quoted in newspapers lambasting Harry Reid for his failure to pull out of Iraq.
And of course, there was the time in 2016 when Dionna Brazile of the Democratic National Committee was rumored to have fed the Clinton campaign a question that was going to be asked at the next day's CNN town hall about the death penalty."
REPORT: Democrats Are Holding Not-So-Secret ‘Stop Bernie Sanders’ Meetings | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46090/report-democrats-are-holding-not-so-secret-stop-emily-zanotti,"April 17, 2019 views
Members of the Democratic ""establishment"" and major Democratic donors have been holding meetings in Washington, D.C., The New York Times reports , trying to formulate a strategy that could keep the 79-year-old, progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) from getting the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
The not-so-secret pow-wows are taking place in backrooms and involve a number of big names like Democratic mega-donor Bernard Schwartz, who has been leading the charge against Sanders from New York, and Democratic leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-MY) marshaling support in D.C. South Bend mayor and Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg has reportedly attended the tet-a-tets and, of course, members of the Clinton world are involved, including former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and longtime Clinton defender, David Brock.
They all seem to have their reasons; for some, they're still bitter over how Sanders refused to acknowledge and actively support Hillary Clinton as the nominee, given how much pull he commanded with grassroots Democrats. Others fear a far-left candidate could tank their chances against President Donald Trump, either because Sanders doesn't have wide appeal in significant swing states, or because a far-left candidate could open the field to a third party.
Democrats are counting on the ""uniting force"" of not liking Donald Trump to push them ahead of the current president, but they also know that, outside of social media and some urban centers where Democrats already command the vote, ""Democratic socialism"" isn't a popular concept. And to take the 2020 presidential election, Democrats will need to win in blue-collar, Rust Belt states where Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is reviled.
The Times reports that Democrats are particularly worried about what could happen if delegates are ""carved up"" among the more than a dozen 2020 contenders. The primary schedule next year is unique, and Super Tuesday — the day around 25% of all delegates are awarded — comes unusually close on the heels of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. By early March, 40% of available delegates will be decided, and the results could be so disparate, no single candidate will command a majority by the time the Democratic National Convention rolls into Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
""Unlike Republicans, who used a winner-take-all primary format, Democrats use a proportional system, so candidates only need to garner 15 percent of the vote in a primary or caucus to pick up delegates,"" the NYT reports. ""And even if a candidate fails to capture 15 percent statewide, he or she could still win delegates by meeting that vote threshold in individual congressional districts.""
And then there are the so-called ""Super-Delegates"" who can nullify all of the primaries if the nomination goes to a second vote. In 2016, by the time Bernie Sanders had won New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton had already locked up the Democratic nomination because she owned the party's Super-Delegates.
Aside from an open letter issued last week to Clinton ally and Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden, Bernie has stayed at least somewhat mum on the subject of intra-party warfare. He is raising money off The New York Times' report, however."
CURL: The Day I Got Something Wrong On Twitter And The Internet Exploded | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46063/curl-day-i-got-something-wrong-twitter-and-joseph-curl,"April 17, 2019 views
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a rising star in the Democratic Party, and she’s got a huge edge over many of her colleagues: A savvy understanding of social media.
AOC, as she is known, is prolific, sending out dozens of tweets and retweets on Twitter each day, as well as posting on Facebook and Instagram. But on Sunday, she announced that she’s quitting Facebook and plans to cut back on all the others. “Social media poses a public health risk to everybody,” she said in a “Skullduggery” podcast. “I think it has effects on everybody — increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.”
Now, I won’t say this often about AOC, but she’s absolutely right.
I don’t get much hate on social media, but all that changed Monday when the grand Notre Dame cathedral was burning in Paris. A friend sent me a picture of the inside of the stately medieval Catholic church, and — parroting what CNN was at the moment reporting — told me that everything inside was lost.
So I posted a tweet on Twitter: That same picture, with the words: “This is gone. Very sad.”
Turns out the picture was not of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, but of the Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal (to my friend I say, “no big."" Easy mistake to make, especially with sites like this on the internet). I certainly never noticed, but then, I went to the Paris tourist trap just once 36 years ago, in 1983, and the other dozen times or so I’ve been to Paris I’ve skipped the site (I visited the Montreal basilica, too, but that was in the 1990s).
Well, you would have thought I murdered Mother Teresa with a machete in cold blood right on the street. The outpouring of anger flowed heavy. When I realized my post was wrong, I decided to leave it up anyway, just to watch (and catalogue) the vicious comments that came in. After all, it was a simple sentiment: It’s sad this beautiful place is gone (turns out CNN overstated that too, but that’s a different story).
By the numbers, my post has been retweeted more than 7,500 times and more than 24,000 people have pushed the little “heart” button. Some 1,100 people took time to comment. That’s by far my most “popular” post (I’m not a big Twitterer and have just under 10,000 followers).
So here now, in no particular order, are some of the things that were said:
Kevin M. Kruse, an author, was factual: “That cathedral is in Montreal and it’s still there.” Right you are, KK. My bad.
John Harwood, the economy and national politics correspondent for CNBC, wrote in response: “thank God they were able to save it.” Very funny, John.
“Curtis Stigers,” whose Twitter page says he is the Emmy nominated writer/singer of the “Sons Of Anarchy” theme, said: “You’re a stable genius, Joe.”
“Madbreaks” wrote, “Gone, along with your credibility.” Darn it! I worked 30 years as a journalist and I threw it all away by posting a picture of the wrong Notre Dame. D’oh!
There were some really funny ones, the kind that singed but didn’t burn. Pictures of the castle at Disney World (or Disneyland) appeared often, ID’ed as Notre Dame. Ha. Someone posted a picture of the Eiffel Tower — the one in Las Vegas. Good one. Someone posted my caption — “This is gone. Very sad.” — with a shot of an old Blockbuster movie rental store. Another used the caption with a shot of an old Underwood typewriter. Pretty funny.
Some people were little mad, some people were big mad. Of course, a bunch of the responses were too graphic to post in a family newspaper. The emails, too. But “Dan Mitchell” kept it G-rated when he emailed to say: “How do you just leave that Montreal cathedral tweet up, saying it’s ‘gone’? Unlike other falsehoods, it doesn’t seem to serve any propaganda purpose, and seems like just (yet another) boneheaded mistake. I know you people have very little capacity for either shame or pride (or basic competence), but do you actually have *zero*? How are you not humiliated?”
It was a “boneheaded mistake,” Dan, but again, I left the post up on Twitter to allow the flow of hate to stream in, to see where this one tiny error in a tweet with a sweet sentiment would go.
Others deemed my erroneous tweet as shoddy “journalism.” “Lulu in Canada” wrote: “‏Nothing is gone, but also we’re all safe here in Montreal! Super ‘journalism.’ ” “C. Sabetta” wrote: “It is good to see you did an in-depth investigation and corroborated information before sharing. Top notch reporting……NOT.” “Tim of Ottawa,” who called me “dude,” said, “you’re NO sort of journalist at all.”
For the record, Twitter ain’t journalism.
Everyone seemed super-concerned about me deleting the tweet, as if my leaving it up meant that hundreds, possibly thousands, of false reports might follow declaring that Montreal’s Notre Dame had burned to the ground. “Frank Thorp V,” whose Twitter page says he’s “Producer & Off-Air Reporter covering Congress at @NBCNews,” wrote: “How long are you gonna keep this tweet up?” Later, clearly very concerned about the adverse effect my tweet was having worldwide, wrote: “Are you going to delete your incorrect tweet?”
To all of you who commented, you’ll be relieved to know that I have now deleted the tweet.
To be clear, I did get something wrong. And I’ve been doing this a long time, so I’ve got a plenty thick skin. You had a good laugh at my expense. But it was a small error — the interior of one Notre Dame instead of the other — and my sentiment was simply expressing remorse that something so beautiful might be lost.
But I’d like to give a shout out to “Cameron Campbell,” who wrote, “I feel so sorry for you.” Well, thanks CC. Yeah, it was, I’ll admit, a little embarrassing.
And to the guy who tweeted, “That’s Quebec, NOT Paris,” dude, it’s cool. Little mistake. It’ll pass. No big, brother.

D.C. Gave The Homeless The Ability To Live In High-Priced Apartments. It’s Gone As Well As You Think. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46077/dc-gave-homeless-ability-live-high-priced-ashe-schow,"D.C. Gave The Homeless The Ability To Live In High-Priced Apartments. It’s Gone As Well As You Think. FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images April 17, 2019 views
Homelessness is a huge issue in major cities, and government programs to help those suffering simply do not work very well. We as a society still don’t seem to know how best to help this forgotten population, but it seems pretty obvious that one-size-fits-all approaches do not work.
In Washington, D.C., city housing officials “increased the value of rental subsidies” in order to “give tenants who had previously clustered in impoverished, high-crime areas east of the Anacostia River a shot at living in more desirable neighborhoods,” The Washington Post reported .
While government officials no doubt spent the next two years after this change was made bragging about the number of low-income individuals now living in a better neighborhood, the policy had predictably adverse effects.
At Sedgwick Gardens, an upscale apartment complex in Cleveland Park, “Many of the new tenants are previously homeless men and women who came directly from shelters or the streets, some still struggling with severe behavioral problems,” the Post reported.
This caused issues. The Post reported that police visits to Sedgwick “have nearly quadrupled since 2016,” causing some tenants to move out. After resident complaints, social workers were dispatched to the building to handle issues at night.
There are three basic complaints from residents at Sedgwick: Those who received city vouchers to live in the complex that say they feel unwelcome by their more affluent neighbors, the affluent neighbors who support the program but insist the building’s use of the vouchers was mismanaged, and those who think the program was implemented too hastily.
“It’s not about the voucher program. It’s not about racism. It’s about people’s conduct and behavior,” Lorraine Starkes, a former homeless woman who was able to move into Sedgwick, told the Post.
Starkes told the outlet that many of her fellow voucher residents weren’t properly screened and “are trying to turn [Sedgwick] into a ghetto.”
And there is the problem with policies like this. Giving someone a better place to live doesn’t automatically improve their lives. For some, like Starkes, it can make a difference, but other people need specialized help for mental illness or other disabilities that a nice apartment can’t fix. As the Post reported:
That approach calls for placing the homeless in long-term housing without first requiring treatment for mental illness or addiction. Many experts say it is the best way to help people who have trouble helping themselves amid the chaos of homelessness.
But as housing first has emerged as a national policy consensus, some have begun to warn that it is being applied too broadly and at times with inadequate support for people who aren’t ready for the independence and responsibilities of living by themselves.
City officials, naturally, told the Post that Sedgwick was not the result of mismanagement."
Nancy Pelosi Claims Democratic Party Has ‘No Taint’ Of Anti-Semitism Right After Meeting With MP Jeremy Corbyn | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46095/nancy-pelosi-claims-democratic-party-has-no-taint-emily-zanotti,"Nancy Pelosi Claims Democratic Party Has ‘No Taint’ Of Anti-Semitism Right After Meeting With MP Jeremy Corbyn Alex Edelman/Bloomberg via Getty Images April 17, 2019 views
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi believes there is ""no taint"" of anti-Semitism on the Democratic Party in the United States, despite weeks of controversy over members of her own caucus, and is assured that anti-Semitism is under control after speaking with U.K. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Pelosi is on a diplomatic jaunt through the United Kingdom, where she's met with leaders in Ireland and Great Britain to discuss shared values, trade, and the rise of ""hate."" On Tuesday, she sat down with CNN for an interview, right after she finished chatting with the controversial Corbyn.
“We have no taint of that in the Democratic Party,” Pelosi told the network . “And just because they want to accuse somebody of that doesn’t mean we take that bait.”
She is, of course, referring to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) who was accused last week of minimizing the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in a speech, referring to them as ""some people did something"" — the latest in a number of controversial and shocking statements Omar has made since assuming office in January.
Pelosi said she was calling out extra security for Omar after President Donald Trump tweeted pointed criticism at the Minnesota Democrat, “to ensure that Capitol Police are conducting a security assessment to safeguard Congresswoman Omar, her family and her staff.”
As for who is hateful in the equation, Pelosi clearly believes it's Trump.
“The president’s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger,” Pelosi added. “President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.”
But these aren't the first comments Omar has made. On several occasions, she's made clearly anti-Semitic remarks, accusing other members of Congress, including her Democratic colleagues, of being under the financial influence of Israel. At one point, she even referred to her colleagues' ""dual loyalty"" to both Israel and the United States — a reference to an ancient, anti-Semitic smear.
On both occasions, Omar earned a swift rebuke from some members of Congress, but no official condemnation. The second time Omar expressed anti-Semitic sentiments, Pelosi and others were prepared to issue a blanket statement condemning anti-Semitism and expressing support for the Jewish people but were bullied out of it by progressive Democrats who backed Omar.
That incident, of course, makes the other meetings Pelosi attended on Tuesday downright comical.
She spoke to at least three members of the British Parliament who claimed they'd abandoned the Labour Party because of the growing force of anti-Semitism within its more progressive wings, according to The Guardian , and who warned Pelosi that they've seen signs that something similar is happening in the United States.
Pelosi told the three MPs that she understood “the importance of standing unequivocally against anti-semitism wherever it is found,"" knowing that she and others backed down from taking a stand against anti-Semitism within her own caucus — and knowing that immediately after, she would meet with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been routinely accused of espousing anti-Semitic views and acting on them.
Instead of challenging Corbyn, Pelosi backed down yet again, ""When we met the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, we said we have concerns about how the Labour Party is perceived in terms of anti-Semitism,"" she told CNN, but did not mention receiving any pushback on her concerns.
Corbyn, for his part, did not note any discussion of anti-Semitism at all in his tweet summarizing the meeting.
""Open and wide ranging meeting with US House of Representatives @SpeakerPelosi today. We discussed the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement, take action on inequality and the climate crisis, confront racism and promote peace,"" Corbyn said, in a statement that sounded largely similar to the watered-down Democratic ""condemnation"" of hate issued in place of their declaration of firm support for Israel.

What does a cathedral mean in 21st century Europe? E.J. Dickson, writing in Rolling Stone yesterday, identified the central challenge facing France in rebuilding Notre Dame. Eight centuries ago, a devout people spent 182 years building a magnificent testament to faith in an explicitly Catholic country. In 2019, the devotion that motivated the building of that great monument, to say nothing of the technical knowledge and political-religious apparatus that enabled its construction, has eroded. How can we expect a faithless people to build a cathedral that gives glory to a God in whom it no longer believes?
Patricio del Real, an architecture historian at Harvard University, celebrates the erosion of faith. “The building was so overburdened with meaning that it burning feels like an act of liberation,” Del Real observes. In a sense he’s right. The theme of liberation defines Western modernity from the Protestant Revolution all the way up through the cultural upheavals of the 1960s. Liberalism liberates. It begins by severing ties to institutions, such as the Church. It proceeds by denying the ideas that those institutions embody, such as religion itself. Then it deals the final blow by rejecting the very premises on which those ideas rest, such as our very capacity to perceive, reason, and know reality. According to this liberated culture, nothing can be known for sure, and everything must be tolerated.
Liberation tolerates no limits, be they political, cultural, religious, or even natural. Nevertheless, all that carries meaning is exclusive. A cathedral is a cathedral, at least in part, because it isn’t a mosque. England is England because it isn’t China. A man is a man because he isn’t a woman. Yet the impulse toward liberation demands we be all things to all people. It eschews the particular for the generic. It cowers from making any particular claims. Liberation from meaning leaves us skeptical of truth itself, comfortable only to acknowledge “your truth” and “my truth,” confident only in the reality of subjective feeling rather than objective fact.
“Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” as the poet John Keats observed . Beauty is particular too. Particular features make us fall in love—the texture of one’s hair, the color of one’s eyes, the shape of one’s smile. Beauty is not generic, bland, and clinical. It isn’t all things to all people. The Cathedral of Notre Dame in its endlessly intricate detail was beautiful. Modern office buildings are not.
French president Emmanuel Macron has promised to rebuild Notre Dame “even more beautifully” than before. To do so would mean to reverse the course of modernity and burden ourselves with meaning. The West will only burn and never build so long as it cannot believe."

Far-left Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) reportedly met with a terrorist supporter and extreme anti-Israel activist in her congressional office in Washington, D.C., in mid-April.
The Daily Caller's Molly Prince reported that the meeting happened during the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) Advocacy Day, which reportedly requires those attending to support the anti-Semitic ""Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to punish Israel by economically depriving the country for its alleged mistreatment of Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.""
""Tlaib spoke to AMP on April 8 where she told the group that she feels 'more Palestinian' when she is in Congress than she does elsewhere, according to The Investigative Project On Terrorism, who first reported on the meeting,"" Prince reported. ""AMP’s New Jersey chapter posted a photograph of Tlaib outside of her office with some of its members during the event, including Joe Catron, an avowed supporter of multiple Palestinian terrorist organizations.""
Prince reported that Catron praised Tlaib on Facebook following the event, saying that Tlaib ""really goes above and beyond the call of duty in welcoming every supporter of Palestine to her office, listening to what we have to say, answering our questions, and posing for endless pictures.""
Prince reported on extremist content posted to social media by Catron, adding: ""Catron is a long-time extreme anti-Israel activist and has openly supported terrorist organizations. He serves as the U.S. coordinator of Samidoun, the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network. Samidoun is an affiliate arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Palestinian Marxist–Leninist and revolutionary socialist organization. The United States designated PFLP a terrorist organization in 1997, and Australia, Japan, Canada and the European Union shortly followed suit.""
Tlaib ""embraced anti-Semite and alleged Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer Linda Sarsour"" during her first week in office, The Daily Wire reported in January.
The Daily Wire also reported that Tlaib, who is a documented anti-Semite, was photographed with ""a pro-Hezbollah activist who called Israelis 'Zionist terrorists' and believes Israel has no right to exist"" during her first days in office. Recommended For You"
Trump Tweets Out More 'Dirty' Details About FBI's Relationship With Agent Behind Democrat-Funded Dossier | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46057/trump-tweets-out-more-dirty-details-about-fbis-james-barrett,"Trump Tweets Out More 'Dirty' Details About FBI's Relationship With Agent Behind Democrat-Funded Dossier Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images April 17, 2019 views
As Attorney General William Barr prepares to release the redacted final report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, President Trump has continued to hammer the key takeaways from Barr's summary: ""No Collusion - No Obstruction!"" On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted out another ""dirty"" detail that has come to light about what led up to the ""collusion"" investigation: The former British agent who Democrats paid to compile the dossier that got the collusion narrative rolling reportedly received 11 payments from the FBI in 2016.
""Wow! FBI made 11 payments to Fake Dossier’s discredited author, Trump hater Christopher Steele,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, citing Judicial Watch and One American News Network. ""The Witch Hunt has been a total fraud on your President and the American people! It was brought to you by Dirty Cops, Crooked Hillary and the DNC."" Wow! FBI made 11 payments to Fake Dossier’s discredited author, Trump hater Christopher Steele. @OANN @JudicialWatch The Witch Hunt has been a total fraud on your President and the American people! It was brought to you by Dirty Cops, Crooked Hillary and the DNC. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2019
On Tuesday, Judicial Watch announced that it had filed a new Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Department of Justice seeking the records of the communication and payments between the FBI and former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele and his private firm, Orbis Business Intelligence. BREAKING: JW announced today that it filed a FOIA lawsuit against the DOJ for records of communications and payments between the FBI & former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and his private firm, Orbis Business Intelligence (1/3). https://t.co/OuMuIGgvpf — Judicial Watch (@JudicialWatch) April 16, 2019
In the announcement, Judicial Watch lays out some of what they've helped uncover about Steele's involvement with the FBI through previous FOIA lawsuits related to the Clinton campaign and DNC-funded dossier and how it was used in order to obtain FISA warrants to surveil Trump associates:
In a case seeking information between January 1, 2016, and March 8, 2017, Judicial Watch previously released FBI records showing that Steele was cut off as a “Confidential Human Source” in November 2016 after he disclosed his relationship to the FBI to a third party. The documents show that there were at least 11 FBI payments to Steele in 2016.
Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC, reportedly paid $168,000 in 2016 to Steele’s company, Orbis Business Intelligence.
In a related case, Judicial Watch recently released 339 pages of heavily redacted records from the DOJ revealing Bruce Ohr remained in regular contact with Steele after Steele was terminated by the FBI.
""How and why did the FBI pay Christopher Steele, who was already being funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC through Fusion GPS?"" asked Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton in the press release Tuesday. ""That we had to sue for this basic information shows the FBI may have something more to hide.""
Judicial Watch's new FOIA lawsuit requests all communications with Steele and his firm, as well as all records of payments or planned payments to Steele or Orbis, from March 9, 2017, to September 27, 2018.
Trump's declaration that Mueller found ""no collusion"" and ""no obstruction"" stems from Barr's summary of Mueller's final report, in which Barr concludes on the question of collusion: ""The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: '[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.'"" On the report's findings on obstruction of justice, Barr writes: ""After making a 'thorough factual investigation' into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards regarding prosecution and conviction but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. ... The Special Counsel’s report states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.'""
Trump has hit his ""Dirty Cops, Dems and Crooked Hillary!"" and ""No Collusion - No Obstruction!"" themes a few times this week. On Monday, the president issued a series of tweets on the topic: ""Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction. These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS! ...

The hero priest, Fr. Jean-Marc Fournier, who rushed inside a burning Notre Dame Cathedral to save the church's priceless relics, including the Crown of Thorns and consecrated hosts under lock and key, is no stranger to heroism, according to reports that have surfaced since Monday.
Fr. Fournier led first responders in a human chain to save the religious relics, according to The Guardian , as flames engulfed the building's roof — an incident started by what authorities believe was a small construction fire near the famous Notre Dame spire.
Fournier “demanded he be allowed into the cathedral with the firefighters to retrieve one of its holiest relics,"" The Guardian reported.
Fr. Fournier managed to save a number of priceless objects, including Jesus' Crown of Thorns, which He wore as He was beaten and mocked by Roman soldiers in the hours leading up to His crucifixion, and the tunic of St. Louis, one of the patron saints of France. He also rescued concescrated hosts, which Catholics believe hold the real presence of Jesus Christ, from within the church's locked tabernacle.
“Father Fournier is an absolute hero,” one firefighter told local media, according to People Magazine . “He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear.”
Altogether, Fr. Fournier and others saved more than 40 works. He was pictured speaking to reporters outside the Cathedral as firefighters were putting out the blaze within.

But Fr. Fournier is, apparently, no stranger to difficult situations.
In 2015 , Fr. Fournier, then also the chaplain of Paris' emergency services department, was part of the first wave of first responders who arrived at the Bataclan nightclub following reports of a terrorist attack. Fr. Fournier went in with police and firefighters, tended to and comforted the injured, performed the sacrament of the Annointing of the Sick for the gravely wounded, and gave the sacrament of Last Rites to the 89 victims of the attack.
""I gave collective absolution, as the Catholic Church authorizes me,"" Fr. Fournier told reporters on scene after the attack.
But it also turns out Fr. Fournier is a war hero. He served in the Diocese of the French Armed Forces for nearly a decade before becoming Paris' emergency services chaplain, and was deployed to Afghanistan where ""he survived an ambush that killed 10 of his fellow soldiers,"" according to Newsweek .
He spoke about his time in Afghanistan to media when he returned from his deployment. ""On my first trip to Afghanistan, I was seized by fear,"" he said. ""Everything I saw could potentially be dangerous, as we had learned during training courses."""
"Wow: Yuma, Arizona Mayor Declares ‘State Of Emergency’ Over Migrant Influx At Border | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46091/wow-yuma-arizona-mayor-declares-state-emergency-josh-hammer,"April 17, 2019 views
As The Daily Wire has consistently reported , the United States is experiencing a hitherto unseen migrant influx at our beleaguered southern border. The situation, as Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, recently told Conservative Review's Daniel Horowitz in an interview, is ""unprecedented"" and makes for ""uncharted waters"" for our border and homeland security apparatus. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) explained the context of the staggering March border numbers, as part of its press release that accompanied its monthly report:
In Fiscal Year 2019 to date, the U.S. Border Patrol has seen a more than 370% increase in the number of family units apprehended compared to the same time period in FY2018. Today, 60% of apprehensions along the Southwest border are family units and unaccompanied children, made up predominantly of individuals from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Additionally, through the first six months of FY19, CBP has encountered 104 large groups composed of 100 or more individuals totaling 17,242 apprehensions. In comparison, U.S. Border Patrol encountered 13 large groups in FY2018 and two in FY2017.
As The Daily Wire reported yesterday, much of the influx has to do with the systemic encouragement — from our legal, judicial, political, and media classes — of the filing of legally bogus asylum claims:
The root cause of much of the migration...is the systemic loosening of our statutory asylum law to cover many economically motivated migrants — which is in direct conflict with the legal requirement, under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) , that asylum is only properly considered for migrants who have been persecuted in their native countries for ""race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."" But, under the erroneous prevailing status quo wherein a mention of ""credible fear of persecution"" to a U.S. border agent amounts to something closely akin to magical words granting automatic entry (and often a subsequent quick release, pending a follow-up adjudication hearing for which an alien may or may not show up), asylum claims have skyrocketed. As Rachel Bovard noted at American Greatness in October, ""asylum cases more than octupled from 5,523 in 2009 to 81,864 in 2016"" — and the trend has only metastasized under President Trump.
Indeed, as The Daily Wire reported on Monday, in quoting an alien from an underlying article, ""[t]he whole world know, it's all over the news, everyone knows that if we come to the United States they'll help us.""
Suffice it to say that this is not the best way for a nation to go about protecting and securing its sovereignty. And now, the border town of Yuma, Arizona is taking purely symbolic action to do something about it. The city of Yuma has declared its own state of emergency due to the migrant influx overwhelming city resources.
CNN reports :
The mayor of Yuma, Arizona, has declared a state of emergency, saying his city doesn't have the resources to respond as the Border Patrol releases a growing number of migrants from custody. ""There's an imminent threat of having too many migrant releases into our community, and it's above our capacity as a community to sustain,"" Yuma Mayor Doug Nicholls said as he announced the measure Tuesday.
Nicholls told reporters he's looking for a ""FEMA-type response"" to help his city deal with the influx.
""FEMA shows up at disasters all the time. This isn't a natural disaster, but it is a disaster either way,"" he said. ""Their resources could come in and take care of the situation and would effectively handle that.""
It is, at best, unclear whether federal lawmakers will begin to help solve the border crisis. And sorry to disappoint the Yuma mayor, but FEMA will probably not be arriving anytime soon. But as a modicum of proffered hope, at least some federal lawmakers appear to have their eyes on the problem ."

"WATCH: Shapiro, Carlson Laugh Their Way Through Discussing Beto, Sanders, And Dems | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46111/watch-shapiro-carlson-laugh-their-way-through-daily-wire,"April 18, 2019 views
On Wednesday night, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson discussed the implosion of former Congressman Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign and the failure of any of the leading Democratic Party presidential candidates to buck the prevailing hard-left tilt of their party, and they had a grand time doing it, with plenty of laughter.
Before their discussion, Carlson set the tone for the laughter to follow, sending up O’Rourke, who had given a massively egocentric answer when questioned about the little he gives to charity by essentially saying his giving was exemplified by his own candidacy. Carlson joked that O’Rourke was such a good person that he could write himself off his taxes if he wanted to, quipping, “The IRS would have to let him; his goodness is so clearly deductible. No lawyer would contest that. But Beto doesn’t do that; he doesn't shirk his duty. He’ll pay the extra tax because he cares that much . Now that you think about it, it’s almost sad he’ll never be president.”
Carlson then introduced Shapiro, who said, “I don’t know how I kept a straight face while you did that,” prompting Carlson to reply, “I don’t know how I did,” leaving them both laughing.
After they stopped laughing, Carlson got serious, commenting, “There are so many levels here but I do believe that this is the end of the Beto O’Rourke phenomenon.”
Shapiro responded, “Yeah, I think he’s toast.”
Carlson asked, “What are the lessons that we should draw from what we just saw?”
Shapiro answered, “I think that you can run in the moderate lane as the Bobby Kennedy candidate as long as there’s not anything newer on the block. Buttigieg came along and drank his milkshake and he had some intersectional credibility. The problem for Beto is that he happened to be straight and also white, just like Bobby Kennedy was; Buttigieg is gay, therefore he takes precedence, also he speaks more languages like Norwegian which is a language that is very much in vogue with the media these days.”
Carlson started laughing.
Shapiro continued, “And he doesn’t just play guitar, he also plays piano and he does it with Ben Folds 5 and the whole deal. So, Buttigieg has basically stolen all of his momentum, and I think you’re right, I think Beto is toast here.”
Carlson commented, “Speaking Norwegian and playing the piano, and I’m being sincere, are actually impressive things to do for sure, and I’m impressed by them, but they’re not really policy prescriptions, they’re not ideas that are going to improve America, neither is who you sleep with relevant to running the country as far as I can tell, or any of these criteria meaningful, so where’s the part that we get to debate their ideas for the country?”
Shapiro replied:
Well the problem is, obviously, that there’s only one thought leader in the Democratic Party right now and that’s Bernie Sanders. And what you’re seeing is a bunch of candidates who are attempting to steer into the Bernie Sanders lane. And there’s no room in that lane. Bernie Sanders has occupied that entire lane. You talk about ideas candidates – the one candidate who keeps shouting ideas from the rooftops is of course, our native American candidate, Elizabeth Warren, who keeps spouting ideas every five minutes, “Here’s a new policy prescription. Why isn’t anyone paying attention to me.” And the answer is because you are in Bernie Sanders’ lane. He is the thought leader in this lane.
Well, in the moderate lane, there are no thought leaders – there are just a bunch of people with platitudes. Biden is presumably the thought leader, but Joe Biden doesn’t have enough thoughts to be a thought leader, so who, exactly, is going to come along and occupy that lane while still being able to win over the woke intersectional base of the Democratic Party? Whoever does that, has a possibility at the nomination. Right now Buttigieg can do that only insofar as he can speak the platitudes that sound moderate, but when he’s actually pegged down, as you’ve noted, he’s just as far left as Bernie Sanders is on all of the issues.
Carlson agreed: Here’s a guy whose telling us what a great Christian he is who’s for abortion up until birth? And for sex selection? Spare me your Christian talk, please. It’s absurd. I’m just struck though by Bernie could be the one guy — I mean I want to have a conversation about ideas ‘cuz I think it’s important, and clearly we need to make some changes with the way the country’s going — but Bernie doesn’t seem to be an ideas candidate when you listen to him, he almost never says anything — unlike Elizabeth Warren, he never says anything interesting. Why is that?
Shapiro: I think that his ideas are so radical, but they are consistent, and so everybody has followed him out to the fringe.
Carlson: Yes.
Shapiro: So, he can shout Medicare for All, and what you’ll see is every Democrat then pay homage to Medicare for All, footnote: we don’t really want Medicare for all, we want sort of a gradualistic plan that may achieve Medicare for All sometime in the future —
Carlson: Right.
Shapiro: — but everybody is trying to imitate Bernie. Bernie is the guy who is really running this race. Bernie’s almost in a position right now that Trump was in in 2016, where everybody in the Democratic Party who’s running is afraid to tick him off because they hope that eventually he’ll collapse and they’ll get his support, but he’s riding at 25 – 30% in virtually all of the polls. That support is extraordinarily durable; I don’t think that it’s going anywhere, and so he can steer that lane. He can win Iowa; he can win New Hampshire; he could do well in California and New York. There’s a reason that Democrats are running scared of Bernie, and what is puzzling to me is that they are so interested in what the journalists on Twitter say, this kind of echo chamber in the media say, but they won’t just go to where the mainstream of their own party is, which is the moderate area, right? Joe Biden is a terrible candidate — he’s actually leading in most of these polls (Carlson laughs) because he is perceived as a moderate.
Carlson: Totally true.
Shapiro: But that was true of Beto and Buttigieg, by the way, the reason that both of them were doing well for a moment there was because they are both perceived as moderate with all of the platitudes and then when you get down to policy, it turns out that they want to be more like Bernie than like Biden. Nobody in the Democratic Party actually has the stones to run as moderate inside the Democratic Party, even though it’s probably the best possible way for them to win the nomination.
Carlson: I think you’re absolutely right and your diagnosis is that they are captive of social media and that’s why.
Shapiro: I think they’re captive of social media. I think that they’re captive of the intersectional woke base. I think that they are afraid that they going to be held hostage to the dictates of The New York Times editorial board and people suggesting that they’re not woke enough if they don’t pay homage to the latest flavor, slavery reparations, or whatever it is today.
Carlson: I think the person who gives the finger to that mob, gets the support of millions.
Shapiro: I think that’s right, and then has a good shot in the general.
Carlson: Right.
Shapiro: But I don’t any of them have the actual stones to do it.
Carlson: They’d probably get my support. I mean if someone were to stand up and say, “You know what, I’m not taking orders from you. How does that sound?” I almost don’t even care what the person is for, I’d probably vote for them because I’m so desperate for that.
Shapiro: That is why, if a Democrat were actually able to do that, they would win sweeping support, but they can’t do that. But we’ve been saying this for years: All you have to do is not be crazy, and they can’t stop themselves. They just can’t.
Carlson, laughing: So good."
"Schumer, Pelosi Demand Robert Mueller Testify Before Congress | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46116/schumer-pelosi-demand-robert-mueller-testify-ashe-schow,"Schumer, Pelosi Demand Robert Mueller Testify Before Congress NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images April 18, 2019 views
Democrats didn’t get what they wanted from the Special Counsel investigation. President Donald Trump wasn’t indicted or impeached. The 2016 election wasn’t overturned due to collusion. Hillary Clinton still isn’t president.
So, what’s the party to do when it doesn’t get its way? Demand Special Counsel Robert Mueller testify before Congress.
While this wouldn’t be out of the ordinary – he conducted the investigation, so it seems right that he would be the best person to answer questions about it – the reasoning Democrat leaders gave for demanding Mueller testify is odd, to say the least.
“Attorney General [William] Barr’s regrettably partisan handling of the Mueller report, including his slanted March 24 th summary letter, his irresponsible testimony before Congress last week, and his indefensible plan to spin the report in a press conference later this morning – hours before he allows the public or Congress to see it – have resulted in a crisis of confidence in his independence and impartiality,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a statement.
“We believe the only way to begin restoring public trust in the handling of the Special Counsel’s investigation is for Special Counsel Mueller himself to provide public testimony in the House and Senate as soon as possible,” the continued. “The American people deserve to hear the truth.” — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) April 18, 2019
First, let’s take a step back and examine the first sentence in the statement. Pelosi and Schumer don’t like how Barr handled the report. They claim he wrote a “slanted March 24 th summary letter.” Did he? He did write a summary letter on March 24 th , but it simply said Mueller found no evidence of collusion and insufficient evidence to support a charge of obstruction. Barr wrote that the report “did not exonerate” Trump. How is that slanted?
Further, I’m guessing Barr’s “irresponsible testimony before Congress” was in reference to his use of the term “spying.” Democrats hyperventilated over that term, and left-wing media pundits objected to using that term over “surveillance,” as if there was much of a difference.
Finally, Pelosi and Schumer claim Barr is attempting to “spin” the report before its released by holding a press conference. Seems like a pretty poor plan to mislead people about a report that will be easily fact-checked within hours.
Pelosi and Schumer follow Russia-collusion conspiracy theorists Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) calls for Mueller to testify. Back in late February, Schiff threatened to call Mueller to testify if the Special Counsel didn’t release his final report. There was never a question about whether the report would be released in full (minus legally required redactions), but Schiff needed his name in the papers.
What happens when Mueller – who has literally been treated like a religious icon by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans the past two years – testifies before Congress and still doesn’t give them what they want? No amount of questioning or temper tantrums are going to change the fact that after a two-year investigation, not one person associated with Trump was indicted for colluding with Russia."

Attorney General William Barr announced during a press conference on Thursday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not find that members of the Trump campaign conspired, coordinated, or colluded with Russians during the election.
""As you know, one of the primary purposes of the Special Counsel’s investigation was to determine whether members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, or any individuals associated with that campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election,"" Barr said. ""As you will see, the Special Counsel’s report states that his 'investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.'""
""Thanks to the Special Counsel’s thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump campaign – or the knowing assistance of any other Americans for that matter,"" Barr continued. ""That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed.""
Speaking on the Russian Internet Research Agency, which sought to create division between Americans on social media, Barr said: ""the Special Counsel found no evidence that any Americans – including anyone associated with the Trump campaign – conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in carrying out this illegal scheme. Indeed, as the report states, '[t]he investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation.' Put another way, the Special Counsel found no 'collusion' by any Americans in the IRA’s illegal activity.""
Speaking on Russia hacking emails from Democratic officials, Barr said, ""the Special Counsel’s report did not find any evidence that members of the Trump campaign or anyone associated with the campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its hacking operations. In other words, there was no evidence of Trump campaign 'collusion' with the Russian government’s hacking.""
Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein consulted with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers in determining whether the president had committed any obstruction of justice offenses.
""After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,"" Barr said. ""In assessing the President’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates.""
""At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President’s personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the Special Counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,"" Barr continued. ""Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.""

"Mueller Investigated ‘10 Episodes’ Of Potential Trump Obstruction, Media Predictably Claim Cover Up | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46133/mueller-investigated-10-episodes-potential-trump-ashe-schow,"Mueller Investigated ‘10 Episodes’ Of Potential Trump Obstruction, Media Predictably Claim Cover Up Win McNamee/Getty Images April 18, 2019 views
During his Thursday morning press conference, Attorney General William Barr disclosed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller looked into “10 episodes” of potential obstruction by President Donald Trump.
Naturally, partisan media ran with the statement as evidence Barr protected Trump from being held accountable. Barr said during the press conference that he disagreed with Mueller on some of the obstruction claims.
""The president took no action that in fact deprived the special counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete the investigation,” Barr said.
The attorney general also explained that Trump’s alleged obstruction could also be seen as the actions of a man who thought he was falsely accused.
“In assessing the president’s actions discussed in the report it is important to bear in mind the context,” Barr explained. “There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks.”
Remember that there “10 episodes” of potential collusion. Mueller appears to have been thorough in his investigation. Democrats and their media counterparts have been screaming “obstruction!” since it became clear no one was getting indicted for collusion, the main issue of the investigation. If Mueller hadn’t looked into every stupid claim (like journalists claiming a tweet from Trump amounted to obstruction), his report could be seen as valid.
Looking into something doesn’t mean a crime was definitely committed. Somehow anti-Trump reporters, pundits, and politicians forget this.
I guess they fall back on the “where there’s smoke there’s fire” trope, but that is not always the case. Sometimes there’s just smoke. Sometimes someone turned on a smoke machine.
This didn’t stop every major media outlet from running with the “10 episodes” of potential obstruction narrative. And because there were so many, that must mean Trump actually obstructed an investigation into a crime that didn’t exist.
MSNBC, Politico, Bloomberg, The Guardian, The Washington Post, and others all wrote headlines about the investigation into obstruction, with many making sure readers know that it was Attorney General William Barr who made the determination not to indict.
Expect many more partisan wordings to come out as reporters digest the Mueller report, looking for evidence that Trump is guilty but was saved by his attorney general pick."

It pays to be the relative of a communist dictator: the granddaughter of former president and current First Secretary of the Communist Party, Raul Castro, the brother of Fidel Castro, rents out a fancy mansion in Havana that goes for a pricey $650 a night.
According to her Airbnb profile, Vilma Rodríguez, who lives in Panama, advertises the mansion as ‘Casa Vida Luxury Holidays” or “Dream Home Luxury Holidays."" The Daily Mail reports that Rodriguez describes the four-bedroom home, which boasts two master bedrooms, an outdoor jacuzzi and a private terrace along with private service, thus:
In Casa Vida, elegance, design, and tradition come together to create cheerful, spacious, and luminous spaces. Four rooms and [continuous] service provides maximum comfort and makes your stay an unforgettable experience.
The Daily Mail reported, “People on the island earn an average of just $29 a month. The country's monthly food ration system has forced people to struggle to prepare the simplest of meals that include meats, bread, eggs and other basic foods.”
As The Heritage Foundation has reported:
Cuba’s economic freedom score is 27.8, making its economy the 178th freest in the 2019 Index … Cuba is ranked 31st among 32 countries in the Americas region, and its overall score is well below the regional and world averages. State control of the economy by the nearly bankrupt Cuban government is both pervasive and economically inefficient in one of the world’s last Communist dictatorships. Liberalizing pro-market reforms were adopted nearly a decade ago to raise productivity … Without significant supplies of subsidized oil from nearly bankrupt Venezuela, Cuba’s dysfunctional economy is even more dependent on foreign exchange inflows from emigrants’ remittances and the tourism-generated foreign currency that the regime needs to survive. Low, state-dictated wages trap many workers below the poverty line.
Mark Milke noted in The Globe and Mail in 2016:
Economically, in 1958, Cuba's per-capita GDP was $2,363 ( OECD numbers in inflation-adjusted Gheary-Khamis dollars). That put it in the middle of the Latin American ""pack."" Some countries had higher per-capita incomes (Argentina at $5,698 and Venezuela at $9,816 as examples) and others lower (Brazil and the Dominican Republic at $2,111 and $1,320, respectively).
Post-1959, after a revolution where Fidel Castro promised prosperity, democracy and the restoration of Cuba's 1940 constitution – broken promises all, Cuba is now poor. In 2008, when Mr. Castro officially handed over power to his brother, Raul Castro, Cuba's per-person GDP was just $3,764. Thus, on that measurement, Cuba was in the bottom third of all Latin American countries.
Jorge Salazar-Carrillo and Andro Nodarse-Leon wrote in their 2015 book, “ Cuba: From Economic Take-Off To Collapse Under Castro ,” “The country ranks today among the poorer countries in Latin America across most socioeconomic indicators and is no longer anywhere near the far more advanced peer set that it had before the Revolution … The tragedy of Castro’s policies is that they have stunted the country’s growth; if the rate of GDP growth had been higher than 1.5% a year, then GDP today would be twice as high as it now is.” Recommended For You "
Press Left Terrified After White House Band Plays 'Edelweiss' Ahead Of Press Conference | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46154/press-left-terrified-after-white-house-band-plays-emily-zanotti,"Press Left Terrified After White House Band Plays 'Edelweiss' Ahead Of Press Conference Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/WireImage via Getty Images April 18, 2019 views
Members of the press were left reeling Thursday after the United States Marine Corps band played the song ""Edelweiss"" from the ""Sound of Music"" as reporters were being led into the White House for a presidential briefing on the Mueller report.
The band, which plays at the White House for special events was, apparently, running through a classic movie themes medley, and played ""Edelweiss"" as part of a retrospective that included ""The Sound of Music"" — the theme song from the musical — ""Over the Rainbow"" from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" from Disney's ""Cinderella.""
But it was ""Edelweiss"" that got attention. “Edelweiss” was being played as we walked into the @WhiteHouse — Nikki Schwab (@NikkiSchwab) April 18, 2019
Schwab, who is a Washington, D.C., reporter for the New York Post, pointed out that the song was being played as part of a repertoire, and that it's not clear the White House has any control over what the Marine Corps Band plays as background music. I’m not sure how much the administration dictates what the (Marine Corp?) band plays. “The Sound of Music” was also played, which is part of the same musical as “Edelweiss.” — Nikki Schwab (@NikkiSchwab) April 18, 2019
But Maggie Haberman, the White House reporter for The New York Times, apparently saw an ulterior motive. ""Does...anyone at that White House understand the significance of that song?"" she tweeted. Does...anyone at that White House understand the significance of that song? https://t.co/IK9h8fOwNj — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 18, 2019
It appears that Haberman is convinced the White House is subtly suggesting that the White House is simply overrun with Nazis, and that ""Edelweiss"" is somehow identified with Nazi Germany. What a connection!
There's just one problem: the song doesn't have much significance at all — and certainly not to the Nazi party. It was written by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein III, exclusively for the 1959 musical, ""The Sound of Music,"" and it was composed specifically to showcase the talents of Theodore Bikel, who played the show's male lead, Captain Georg von Trapp. And Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote it specifically for Theodore Bikel, who originated the role of Captain von Trapp on stage. Bikel was an Austrian Jew whose family fled Austria in 1938. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) April 18, 2019
In the stage version, ""Edelweiss"" is played only once by Captain von Trapp as a ""resistance"" type song about how he will miss the beauty of his homeland when it is annexed by the Nazis ahead of World War II. In the movie version of the musical, the song is played twice — once as a folk song by Captain von Trapp, and a second time by the full cast, led by Captain von Trapp, as a protest against Nazi officials.
A version of the song, again sung as a resistance anthem, is used as the theme for the Amazon series, ""The Man in the High Castle,"" a science fiction show where the characters move through alternate history timelines, including a main timeline where the Nazis won World War II and control much of the United States. In that show, too, it's used as a resistance anthem, and the woman singing the theme is clearly in terror.
Haberman's followers were divided between being utterly convinced that ""Edelweiss"" is a Nazi song, and being amazed that she'd never seen ""The Sound of Music."" Do tell, Maggie pic.twitter.com/IZqneXpwl6 — Eddie Zipperer (@EddieZipperer) April 18, 2019
Haberman did not let on exactly what she believed the ""significance"" of the song was, but seemed to defend her classification in a conversation with Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief, Ben Shapiro. I’m sure Trump hand picked it so everyone would quickly make the Nazi connection.

WOW: Father Of 9/11 Firefighter Killed On Fateful Day Now Smacks Ilhan Omar | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46156/wow-father-911-firefighter-killed-fateful-day-now-josh-hammer,"April 18, 2019 views
According to a new report in The Daily Caller, the father of a New York City firefighter who was tragically killed on that fateful day of jihadist attacks on America's largest city has now gone after anti-Semitic freshman congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who recently trivialized and downplayed the 9/11 attacks by referring to them as a mere episode of ""some people"" who ""did something.""
The Daily Caller reports :
Retired FDNY firefighter Jim Riches, whose son Jimmy was murdered on 9/11, blasted Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar Tuesday night for explaining the attack as ""some people did something."" He demanded an apology from the Democratic congresswoman while panning New York Democrats for defending her.
""My son Jimmy was murdered by Islamic terrorists. Three thousand people were murdered that day. And Rep. Ilhan Omar said some people did something. That’s ridiculous. It’s outrageous. It’s a disgrace. She’s in the Congress of the United States,"" Riches said at the New York State Republican Party dinner at the Grand Hyatt. ""My son and those 3000 people died a terrible death.""
The Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra had reported upon Omar's trivialization of the worst terrorist attacks in United States history:
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) trivialized the deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history in a recent speech she gave at an event for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) — which the United Arab Emirates has designated as a terrorist organization.
When speaking about the 9/11 terror attacks, which killed approximately 3,000 American citizens, Omar described the attacks as ""some people did something.""
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" Omar said.
Notably, Omar was also mistaken about the founding of CAIR. The organization, which was an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terror financing trial in U.S. Department of Justice history in 2008, was actually founded in 1994 . The 2008 terror financing trial in which CAIR was found to be an unindicted co-conspirator resulted in the unfolding of the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation, which was funneling money to Sunni supremacist jihadist group Hamas.
As The Daily Wire's Amanda Prestigiacomo also reported , President Donald Trump unloaded on Omar in a brutal tweet video that juxtaposed Omar's callous downplaying of 9/11 with searing images of that fateful day:
The video begins with a clip of Rep. Omar referring to the 9/11 atrocity as being an instance where ""some people did something"" during a speech she gave in March for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).
The video then cuts to news footage of the second plane crashing into the Twin Towers, before cutting back to Omar's ""some people did something"" remark. This sequence is repeated two more times, as the horrifying realities of that fateful day are showcased.
Per The Daily Caller , retired FDNY firefighter Jim Riches heartily supported Trump's video:
""To see Donald Trump get a video in with the planes crash into the building. He said, 'Never forget 9/11.' So many people were outraged on the Democratic side … He told like it was. That’s what happened that day,"" Riches said. "
Teen In Bangladesh Allegedly Sexually Harassed By Her Headmaster.

She's Burned To Death After Reporting It. Photo by Mamunur Rashid/NurPhoto via Getty Images April 18, 2019 views
In late March, a 19-year-old girl in Bangladesh told police that the headmaster at her madrassah had sexually harassed her, prompting his arrest. After the video of her statement was leaked to social media, she was burned to death on the roof of her school by a group of people, some of whom she identified as fellow students before she died.
As the BBC reports , Nusrat Jahan Rafi, who hailed from the small town of Feni and came from a conservative religious family, said that on March 27 she was called to the headmaster’s office. She claimed later that the headmaster, Ud Doula, had touched her in inappropriate ways, prompting her to flee. That very day, she went to the police, where she offered a statement that was videotaped by the police officer in charge.
Buzzfeed News reported, “The police officer is heard saying it's ‘not a big deal’ and telling her to ‘move your hands from the face, stop crying, nothing happened that you have to cry.’"" The video was later leaked to local media.
The headmaster was arrested that day, but then male students launched a protest demanding he be released. From there things got worse for the girl; people blamed her instead of the headmaster.
On April 6, Nusrat braved the hostility and went to school for her final exams, accompanied by her brother. He said later, ""I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn't allowed to enter. If I hadn't been stopped, something like this wouldn't have happened to my sister.”
Nusrat stated before she died that she was lured to the roof of the school by a fellow female student who claimed a friend was being assaulted. But when Nusrat reached the roof, according to the BBC, “four or five people, wearing burqas, surrounded her and allegedly pressured her to withdraw the case against the headmaster. When she refused, they drenched her with kerosene and set her on fire.” Nusrat was rescued, but too late; by the time she reached the hospital, 80% of her body was burned, a situation so severe that she was taken from the local hospital to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. En route, she recorded a statement on her brother’s phone, identifying the students who attacked her and saying, ""The teacher touched me. I will fight this crime till my last breath.”
Nusrat died on April 10; 15 people have been arrested in connection with the incident. The Guardian reported , “Two young men have confessed to involvement in Nusrat’s killing. They include a man who admitted to having a grudge against her for refusing his own advances.”
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asserted, ""None of the culprits will be spared from legal action.” Salma Ali, former director of the Women Lawyers' Association, added, ""When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from police to properly investigate the allegations. It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice. Ultimately the criminals don't get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don't fear to do the same because of such examples."""
KNOWLES: Did The Trump Administration Obstruct Justice? | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46176/knowles-did-trump-administration-obstruct-justice-daily-wire,"April 19, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host discusses the accusaitons of obstruction against President Donald Trump. Transcript and video below.
If you're obstructing justice, you do it in secret. You don't do it in public. Can you name one other example of a president obstructing justice in public like that? I don't think so. Bob Mueller makes this point in the report. He says several features distinguish this from typical obstruction cases. Some of the actions, like firing FBI Director James Comey, are totally within his authority as president, also there's no underlying crime. Also, the Twitter of it all, they took place in public view. It's going to be very hard for the left to twist this report into some awful indictment of the president. What is the takeaway? Nothing new.
We know that President Trump is a real estate developer from New York. We know he pressures and bullies people like business executives do. We know that he pressures and bullies people like he does in public on the campaign trail, even to members of his own administration. We know that there is no Russian collusion.
This is an important point, as William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein point out — he is exonerated on obstruction of justice. Bob Mueller submits the report, not to the American people, not to Congress, not to the president, but to the attorney general. Then it is up to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general to determine whether or not he is to be gone after, whether or not he's committed a crime or whether or not there isn't evidence that he's committed a crime.
It is not for the attorney general to say, well here's the report, make up your own decision. No, it's up to the attorney general to make that decision. He and the deputy attorney general both concluded no obstruction of justice. Our long national nightmare is over. The Russian collusion narrative is over. The Mueller investigation is over. Two years for nothing — to find out that Donald Trump is a tough-talking guy who pressures his subordinates which we already knew. "
Limbaugh: Here Are The Two Lines From The Mueller Report Media Are Using To Create More Fake News | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46175/limbaugh-here-are-two-lines-mueller-report-media-james-barrett,"Limbaugh: Here Are The Two Lines From The Mueller Report Media Are Using To Create More Fake News Photo by Justin Lubin/NBCU Photo Bank April 19, 2019 views
On his radio program Thursday, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh offered a one-sentence summary of the 400+ page final report by Robert Mueller that took two years to compile: ""We found no evidence of collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign, period, and we don’t have enough to say that there was any obstruction of justice."" But, Limbaugh suggested, the media just can't handle that straightfoward and ""disappointing"" of a conclusion. Instead, they're dead set on finding something in the report to keep the collusion/obstruction narratives going. And thus far they've found two passages — both of which, Limbaugh argued, are being distorted to spread more fake news.
The first headline-grabbing quote that CNN and others are using to paint a false picture about what the report actually reveals, said Limbaugh, is Trump exclaiming when he first learned that the special counsel was appointed: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I'm f***ed.""
""Well, now, you can imagine how that is going to be analyzed and amplified on,"" said Limbaugh, shifting into his mock-media voice: ""'Well! (sputtering) That obviously means Trump knew he was guilty. It obviously meant the inspector was going to get to the bottom of it and that was the end of his presidency.'""
""Again, Robert Mueller concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — and about that, he is perfectly clear,"" said Limbaugh. ""Trump is exonerated on the collusion business. There isn’t and wasn’t any. ... But why put [the Trump quote] in the report? Precisely to feed these appetites that Mueller knows the media is going to have.""
After putting himself in Trump's place and wondering aloud how he would respond to what sure looks like a ""set up"" and ""frame"" job, Limbaugh provided more context to Trump's much-reported F-bomb exclamation.
""Now, here’s what Trump actually said about the appointment of the special counsel,"" said Limbaugh. He then quoted directly from the report: ""The president returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, ‘Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worse thing that ever happened to me.'""
""That’s what he said, not the way CNN is excerpting it. 'Oh, my God. I’m screwed! Aw, jeez,' as though the independent counsel’s gonna catch him in illegalities,"" said Limbaugh. ""Trump was not talking about that. He was talking about how these investigations paralyze presidents. ... Folks, this is so damned despicable, I’m having trouble not being profane here today. ... CNN is saying the president acknowledged that the special counsel being appointed screws his presidency. They are attempting to conclude here that Trump was guilty and the special counsel was gonna find the guilt and that Trump knew it! They’re doing this specifically to counter the conclusion that there was no collusion!""
Rush later highlighted a second passage from the report that the media are trying to turn into some sort of bombshell.
""The Drive-By Media also seizing on the part of the Mueller report where it says — I’m paraphrasing here — 'if we had confidence Trump didn’t obstruct justice, we would so state,'"" said Limbaugh. ""Now, stop and think of that for a second. 'If we had confidence Trump didn’t obstruct justice, we would so state.' There you have it. That is a made-to-order morsel for these loon brains at CNN and MSNBC and everybody else in the Drive-By Media to pick up and run off with.""
""In other words, even though they couldn’t find a single example of Trump obstructing justice, they aren’t sure he didn’t and they just didn’t find it,"" said Rush. ""I mean, this is a prosecutorial investigation. ... This is not permitted under Justice Department law. You do not 'not charge' somebody after an investigation and then list all the things you think they did. That’s what Comey did to Hillary, and that’s why he got into a little heap big trouble here. Not supposed to do that. That’s why some people are worried about what’s happening to our rule of law, the Department of Justice — this, folks, it is beyond description.""
The media, said Limbaugh, are busy cherrypicking excerpts of the report and attempting to spin them in a way that maintains their debunked narratives. ""People are reading excerpts from the Mueller report at CNN and MSNBC, New York Times, and they’re rewriting it in the form of transcribing it or simplifying it, taking some of the legalese out of it so that their audiences can understand it. And in the process of doing this they are literally manufacturing things,"" he said.
""I have never seen anything that even approaches this in scope, in attempt, in execution, in dishonesty, in skullduggery, in absolute depraved perversion, I have never seen anything like this,"" said Limbaugh. ""I have never seen, despite all the media bias in the world that we know there is, I have never seen this kind of collusion between a presidential administration and his Department of Justice — Obama, FBI, DOJ — and the entirety of the mainstream media in an effort to bring down someone that they simply personally dislike."""
Buzzfeed Finally Admits It Was Wrong About Trump Directing Michael Cohen To Lie | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46191/buzzfeed-finally-admits-it-was-wrong-about-trump-ashe-schow,"Buzzfeed Finally Admits It Was Wrong About Trump Directing Michael Cohen To Lie Drew Angerer/Getty Images April 19, 2019 views
Remember how the media (yes, including The Daily Wire) jumped on a January 17, 2019 report in Buzzfeed that the Special Counsel had evidence that President Donald Trump “directed” his former attorney Michael Cohen to lie to prosecutors?
The story was questionable on the surface, as its sources were anonymous law enforcement officials and by the time it was reported, Cohen had already been charged with crimes and this would have been something included in those charges. Further, it was clear even the left-wing media was unsure of the veracity of the report, as they couched their reporting on it with the qualifier “if true.”
Hours after the report was released — and after left-wing media outlets spent the day pushing the narrative to suggest Trump was going down soon — Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office issued a rare statement calling the report “ not accurate .” The Washington Post and The New York Times followed up that statement with reports from anonymous sources corroborating the claim of inaccuracy.
""BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate,” said Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller.
Yet Buzzfeed held steadfast to the story, with Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith going on national TV to defend his reporters and his outlet.
Now that Mueller’s report has been released, Smith has finally acknowledged that Buzzfeed’s reporting was wrong, and offered a detailed explanation of how it happened.
“Today, with the release of the Mueller report, we know which characterization Carr was disputing: Specifically, that the series of interactions between Trump, Cohen, and their lawyers did not, in the prosecutors’ view, amount to Trump ‘directing’ Cohen to lie,” Smith wrote.
So, the crux of their story was the “not accurate” part.
Smith says his reporters received handwritten notes from the FBI’s interview of Cohen. One law enforcement source wrote:
DJT personally asked Cohen to say negotiations ended in January and White House counsel office knew Cohen would give false testimony to Congress. Sanctioned by DJT. Joint lawyer team reviewed letter Cohen sent to SSCI about his testimony about Trump Tower Moscow [sic], et al, knowing it contained lies.
This same source also wrote in those notes: “‘Cohen told OSC’ — the Office of Special Counsel — ‘he was asked to lie by DJT/DJT Jr., lawyers,’” according to Smith.
After the Buzzfeed report, Cohen testified before Congress and his attorneys sent a memo to lawmakers claiming Trump encouraged him to lie “in his way,” meaning Cohen inferred that Trump wanted him to lie instead of Trump actually asking him to lie.
Mueller’s report concluded that, “While there is evidence ... that the president knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress ... the evidence to us does not establish the president directed or aided Cohen's false testimony.""
The original Buzzfeed article is still headlined “President Trump Directed His Attorney Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress About The Moscow Tower Project,” but the post now contains an “update” just below the headline which reads: “The Mueller report found that Trump did not direct Michael Cohen to lie.”

"WATCH: CNN's April Ryan Demands Sarah Sanders Be Fired, Nearly Breaks Down In Tears | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46178/watch-cnns-april-ryan-demands-sarah-sanders-be-amanda-prestigiacomo,"April 19, 2019 views
CNN analyst and American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent April Ryan said Thursday that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has to be fired, claiming the press secretary lied to the American people concerning the Russia probe. Ryan, appearing emotionally distraught and angry, also suggested to CNN host Erin Burnett that Sanders is in-part responsible for threats she and her colleagues in the media have faced.
""Not only does [Sanders] not have any credibility left, she lied,"" Ryan said on CNN's ""OutFront."" ""She outright lied and the people, the American people can't trust her. They can't trust what's said from the president's mouthpiece, spokesperson, from the people's house. Therefore, she should be let go. She should be fired. End of story.""
""When there is a lack of credibility there, you have to start and start lopping the heads off,"" she continued. ""It’s ‘Fire Me Thursday’ or ‘Fire Me Good Friday,' — she needs to go.""
Ryan was referring to Sanders telling the press in May of 2017 that ""'countless' FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey despite one reporter’s assertion that the 'vast majority' of them supported his leadership,"" Fox News reported , adding, ""According to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, Sanders told investigators her claim was a 'slip of the tongue' and was 'in the heat of the moment,' admitting that it was not founded on anything.""
Sanders addressed the discrepancy on ABC’s ""Good Morning America” on Friday. ""It was the heat of the moment, meaning that it wasn't a scripted talking point. I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democratic Party,"" the press secretary told George Stephanopoulos. Pressed repeatedly on her comments on FBI agents, Sarah Sanders tells @GStephanopoulos , ""It was the heat of the moment, meaning that it wasn't a scripted talking point. I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democratic Party"" was about Mueller probe. https://t.co/mOQZNKl1wy pic.twitter.com/y3xcNwVYHg — ABC News (@ABC) April 19, 2019
Ryan continued to rail against Sanders, suggesting the press secrecy has sparked threats against her and her colleagues, allegedly prompting Ryan to get personal security and her colleagues to have moved from their homes.
""Sarah plays a dangerous game in that room,"" Ryan said. ""The game is dangerous because she is lying to the American public. Then, on top of all that, she says the press is fake when she’s faking reports from the people’s house. She’s calling us fake? We’ve had colleagues who’ve had to move from their houses because of threats. I have to have security because of being called ‘fake’ and a ‘loser’ and all sorts of things from that White House. It’s time for her to go.""
Ryan and Sanders have butted heads in the press briefing room on more than one occasion. After the press secretary was badgered by the CNN analyst last June, Sanders asked Ryan to stop ""rudely"" interrupting her colleagues and to ""be quiet long enough"" so she could answer her question.
Last May, Ryan was corrected by a colleague at CNN for spreading false information about President Trump. ""Reporters on the South Lawn have confirmed the [Donald Trump] was heckled and booed when he came out to celebrate America,"" the White House correspondent claimed on Twitter.
CNN's Noah Gray countered Ryan directly, tweeting, ""This is not true. There was a protester who shouted at Trump and was booed.""
WATCH: ""Not only does she not have credibility, she lied. She out and out lied...the American people can’t trust her,"" says @AprilDRyan of Press Sec. Sarah Sanders. ""She should be let go. She should be fired, end of story...it’s fire me Thursday or fire me Good Friday. She needs to go."" pic.twitter.com/M0whZiHg1l"
George Mason University President Has 'Painful' News For Students Upset With Kavanaugh Hiring | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46172/george-mason-university-president-has-painful-news-paul-bois,"Ilhan Omar George Mason University President Has 'Painful' News For Students Upset With Kavanaugh Hiring ""Even if the outcome is painful, what’s at stake is very, very important for the integrity of the university."" Pool / Pool / Getty Images April 19, 2019 views
George Mason University students upset about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh teaching a class in England this Summer have, in so many words, been told by president Angel Cabrera to take a hike.
Earlier this month, triggered students at GMU demanded that Kavanaugh be removed from the faculty despite his class being taught in Runnymede, England — where the Magna Carta was signed. The students argued that women would be deeply harmed by Kavanaugh's presence among the faculty due to the sexual assault allegation brought against him by Christine Blasey Ford without corroborating evidence during his confirmation hearing.
""The hiring of Kavanaugh threatens the mental well-being of all survivors on this campus,"" a female student told The College Fix at the time.
According to HuffPost , GMU president Angel Cabrera told students that while he understands they are upset about Kavanaugh's hiring, the university will not reverse course.
""Even if the outcome is painful, what’s at stake is very, very important for the integrity of the university,"" Cabrera said during a two-hour town hall, prompting gasps from the audience.
""Oh, my God,"" one female student gasped in response to the news.
Students have been fighting hard to get Kavanaugh kicked off the faculty and his three-year teaching contract terminated.
""GMU’s student government organized the event, along with student group Mason for Survivors,"" reports HuffPost. ""The town hall comes after protests, an ad campaign and a student-led petition with more than 10,000 signatures opposing Kavanaugh’s hire.""
""Dozens of students came out for Tuesday’s town hall, where Cabrera and other school officials took precleared questions from students,"" the report continued. ""The first hour was closed to the public as students shared personal stories of being sexually assaulted.""
The faculty stood their ground and did not cave to student demands. Provost S. David Wu said he saw ""no reason for university administrators to override"" their decision. Cabrera said the school needed to protect its power to hire whomever it wishes. Students often objected to the hiring by saying it would affect the mental health of sexual assault survivors.
""In hiring Kavanaugh, to what extent did you consider the mental health of the survivors on campus and how that might affect them and their education?"" one male student asked.
Another 19-year-old student shouted a question over students in which he asked the staff if they would be comfortable knowing their children were in close proximity to a man accused of sexual assault.
Cabrera essentially said that the students have no say in how faculty are chosen. ""Even if in this particular case the outcome is one that you deeply disagree with, the process by which these decisions are made and the reason why we are so firm in defending them is actually essential to the way a university like ours operates,"" he said.
GMU president Cabrera has been consistent in his defense of the university hiring Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from the outset. When the criticism first started, Cabrera even said that Kavanaugh is not a ""crazy appointment.""
""He has been confirmed by — this is not a crazy appointment,"" said Cabrera earlier this month. ""This is a Supreme Court justice who is going to be teaching about the United States Constitution. So from that standpoint, I believe I am not going to question the judgment of that. It’s not a crazy appointment. … Having a Supreme Court justice is going to create value for the students. The students, by the way, have agreed. The students have signed up to this class."""
Charlize Theron: My Seven-Year-Old Son Is Really A Girl | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46193/charlize-theron-my-seven-year-old-son-really-girl-paul-bois,"April 19, 2019 views
Just two weeks after making news by publicly challenging men to ""grow a pair"" and ask her out, actress Charlize Theron is back in the headlines for revealing that she has been raising her adopted seven-year-old son as a girl since he was just age three, allowing him to wear dresses and frequently referring to him as ""she.""
""Yes, I thought she was a boy, too,"" Charlize recently told The Daily Mail . ""Until she looked at me when she was three years old and said: 'I am not a boy!'""
""So there you go! I have two beautiful daughters who, just like any parent, I want to protect and I want to see thrive,"" she continued. ""They were born who they are and exactly where in the world both of them get to find themselves as they grow up, and who they want to be, is not for me to decide.""
The ""Atomic Blonde"" actress then defined parenting as simply celebrating her children as they wish to be, rather than as being a guide to direct children.
""My job as a parent is to celebrate them and to love them and to make sure that they have everything they need in order to be what they want to be,"" she said. ""And I will do everything in my power for my kids to have that right and to be protected within that.""
The article later delved into some of Charlize Theron's childhood wounds that may have influenced her permissive approach to parenting. Tragically, she grew up with an abusive father whose death she witnessed at the hands of her mother in self-defense. From the report:
The drama of Charlize's early years is well-documented. The tough life on a remote farm outside Johannesburg, South Africa, tormented by an alcoholic and abusive father who would regularly and viciously beat Charlize's mother, Gerda.
Then the last tragic day when Charlize was 15 and her father, Charles, who ran a construction business, returned home in a rage, carrying a gun and threatening to kill both Charlize and Gerda.
Instead, in front of Charlize's eyes, in what was later ruled an act of self-defense, Gerda shot him dead.
Theron recently caused a stir by lamenting in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that she had been single for about a decade and wishing aloud that men would just ""grow a pair"" and ask her out. ""I've been single for 10 years, it's not a long shot,"" she said. ""Somebody just needs to grow a pair and step up. I'm shockingly available.""
Theron's social circle likely leans left, given her Hollywood career and her history of abortion advocacy, which spans all the way back to the late-1990s. Since she starred in the pro-abortion film, ""The Cider House Rules,"" she has been a vocal supporter of Planned Parenthood and has attended multiple pro-choice rallies.

And of course, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) had to jump in, too, tweeting:
Mueller’s report is clear in pointing to Congress’ responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President. It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution. As such, I’ll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib ’s impeachment resolution … While I understand the political reality of the Senate + election considerations, upon reading this DoJ report, which explicitly names Congress in determining obstruction, I cannot see a reason for us to abdicate from our constitutionally mandated responsibility to investigate … Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment. I didn’t campaign on it, & rarely discuss it unprompted. We all prefer working on our priorities: pushing Medicare for All, tackling student loans, & a Green New Deal. But the report squarely puts this on our doorstep. Mueller’s report is clear in pointing to Congress’ responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President.

Ocasio-Cortez may say she takes ""no pleasure in discussions of impeachment,"" but in an interview she conducted with Univision host Jorge Ramos only days before the November election, Ramos asked Ocasio-Cortez whether she wanted to impeach Trump if she were elected. She replied at length, “I mean, yeah. To me, it’s a no-brainer. Well, I believe that he has violated the law. Violated potentially many laws, whether it’s the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with. Whether it’s what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence … But overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me.”
If the trio of Congresswomen insist on attempting to impeach Trump, they may well regret it. Former President Bill Clinton's job approval rating was at 36% in mid-1993, but after impeachment proceedings were launched against him in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating soared to the highest level of his presidency, reaching 73%."
WALSH: Parents Who Let Their Toddlers Choose Their Own Genders Are Either Mentally Ill Or Evil | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46209/walsh-theron-matt-walsh,"April 19, 2019 views
I announced some big personal news a few days ago: my wife is pregnant with our fourth child. Many people have asked about the gender of the new addition. As a noted progressive, I find these inquiries highly offensive. We allow our children to choose their own genders — along with their own ages, names, and species. Which is why my oldest is a 6,000-year-old dragon named Fart Poop and his gender is pirate.
That's a joke, of course. I'm not mentally ill (despite common misconceptions), and a person would need to be mentally ill to think that a young child is capable of selecting his own biological identity. Nobody of any age is capable of such a thing, least of all a child who doesn't even know what the term ""biological identity"" means. It is quite disturbing, then, to see how many mentally ill parents exist in this country, and how their insane and abusive parental strategies are hailed by the media.
The latest example of this madness comes to us courtesy of Charlize Theron, who recently complained that she is "" shockingly single "" at the age of 43. I think now we know why. In another interview, Theron "" confirmed "" that her 7-year-old son is actually a girl. The poor young boy, who she now parades around in a dress, announced his gender identity at the age of three, Theron claims: ""Yes, I thought she was a boy, too. Until she looked at me when she was three years old and said: 'I am not a boy!'""
I have a son who is almost three and twins who passed that threshold a couple of years ago. I can say from experience that a child at that age knows almost nothing about the world. He cannot speak in complex sentences. He thinks cartoons are real. He doesn't know the difference between truth and fiction — not because he confuses one with the other but because he literally can't comprehend the distinction between the two categories. He believes in Santa and unicorns and monsters under his bed. He thinks that his toys come to life when he leaves the room. He is slightly more intelligent than a goat and slightly less intelligent than a dolphin. He believes anything he is told on any subject. When my twins were that age, I told them that I used to live on the Moon with my pet flying shark named Rocky. They were so thrilled by this biographical detail that I didn't have the heart to admit I was joking. They may still believe it, for all I know. What I'm trying to stress here is that three-year-old children are very, very young and very, very limited in their ability to understand things. And one subject they certainly cannot grasp is biology.
The next time you hear a three-year-old boy claim to be a girl (an extraordinarily common phenomenon, as any parent knows), ask him a follow up question: ""What is a girl?"" He will not be able to answer this brain teaser. ""Girl"" is just a word to him. It's a sound people make. When he says ""I'm a girl,"" he may as well be saying, ""I'm a whoozlewhatzit."" The statement has almost no meaning at all. At the absolute most, the declaration means that he is interested in the things that his little toddler brain associates with girls: bright colors, princesses, fairies, dolls, etc. It probably doesn't even mean that much because most three-year-olds aren't quite advanced enough to draw those connections. But if he is, then ""I'm a girl"" can be roughly translated to ""I think Tinker Bell is cool"" or ""I'd like to wear a pink shirt.""
Of course, this whole conversation is unnecessary because our sex is not something we can reject or change at any age. But if I hit my head and woke up believing that biology is an adjustable characteristic, I would need to suffer several more traumatic brain injuries before I would think that a toddler can make those adjustments. Even a person confused enough to believe in the concept of ""transgenderism"" should still be sane enough to understand why a human being only three or four years removed from the womb cannot possibly be entrusted with the decision.
Are Charlize Theron and company really that insane? Or are they purposefully instilling gender-confusion into their perfectly healthy and normal children simply to be fashionable? Wickedness or mental illness appear to be the only possible explanations here. Between those options, the latter is the more flattering assumption, but I fear the former might be closer to the truth.

The MSM Proves It's Time To Teach The Bible In Schools | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Michael J. Knowles,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46222/msm-proves-its-time-teach-bible-schools-michael-j-knowles,"April 19, 2019 views
The editors of the Associated Press consider it newsworthy to report that the “tourist mecca Notre Dame” is “also revered as [a] place of worship.” Imagine their surprise when they learn the origins of the word “mecca.”
At least the Associated Press reported a religious reality, albeit an obvious one. The New York Times was forced to issue a correction yesterday when it bungled a report on a basic elements of Christian doctrine. Fr. Jean-Marc Fournier ran inside the burning Cathedral of Notre Dame to save the “body of Christ” from the flames, which reporter Elian Peltier imagined entailed the hero priest's hauling out “a statue of Jesus” rather than the Blessed Sacrament. In today’s New York Post , Mark Hemingway recounts several other embarrassing occasions of religious ignorance on the part of the Times .
In 2013, the Gray Lady reported that Easter commemorates Jesus’ “resurrection into heaven” rather than his resurrection from the dead. The following year, it described the Church of the Holy Sepulcher as “marking the site where many Christians believe Jesus is buried.” That reporter holds a masters degree from Cambridge University, which he appears to have earned despite never having read the New Testament. If he peruse the Gospel, he missed the point of the story.
This embarrassingly ignorant reporting reveals a crisis of religious education throughout the West. Such widespread ignorance imperils not merely the future of the faith but the very civilization that Christianity crafted. How can we expect students to appreciate Hamlet if they do not first understand the story of Cain and Abel , Purgatory , or the theological debates at the heart of the Protestant Revolution ? How much meaning can the Gettysburg Address convey, with its peculiar diction and repeated references to ‘dedication,’ ‘consecration,’ and “devotion,” without the context of the King James Bible? Why did John Adams warn the Massachusetts militia that “our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people” and that “it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other”?
Three months ago, President Trump endorsed elective Bible literacy classes for public schools. At least six states have proposed laws that would permit such classes. “The Bible is an integral part of our society and deserves a place in the classroom,” explained North Dakota State Representative Aaron McWilliams. He’s right, though he downplays the Good Book’s significance. Not only is the Bible integral to our society, it constitutes our society’s literary bedrock. Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2019
In 1962, the Supreme Court’s decision in Engel v. Vitale outlawed prayer in public schools. The following year, the Court decided in Abington School District v. Schempp also to ban Bible study, which had formed the basis of American education since the Puritan era, from public schools. The ensuing decades have witnessed the dumbing down of several generations, each more ignorant than the next. Now the highly “educated” writers at the New York Times can’t tell a crow’s ear from a crosier.
We laugh at the religiously illiterate journalists, but far more foolish were their forebears in the 1960s who imagined they could educate students without teaching them the most important book in the history of the world."
Former Rep. Michele Bachmann: Trump ‘Godly’ And ‘Biblical’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46225/former-rep-michele-bachmann-trump-godly-and-frank-camp,"April 19, 2019 views
On April 13, former presidential candidate and former member of the House of Representatives Michele Bachmann appeared on "" Understanding the Times with Jan Markell ,"" a Christian podcast.
During her time on the show, Bachmann spoke with Markell about numerous political issues including the Russia investigation, and the way in which progressive Democrats have turned on Israel.
At approximately the 30 minute mark, Bachmann spoke about the Trump administration’s actions on abortion and religious freedom, stating in part:
For items that we are concerned about biblically, this president has done more to advance the pro-life movement and the pro-life cause than any other president has ever done. Just this week, Secretary of State Pompeo had announced the Mexico City Policy would be enforced even wider than it had before. The Mexico City Policy says not one dime of U.S. taxpayer money will go to pay for foreign abortions. Well, that should be a given, but that isn't the way it was under Barack Obama. We were paying for foreign abortions ...
Not only have we said ""No"" to that, but now Mike Pompeo ... has said even those nonprofits that are contracting with other nonprofits, they can't perform abortions. So, that policy's gone even further, plus defunding of Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortions in America.
Planned Parenthood is being exposed for their deeds of darkness, and we're pulling back money from Planned Parenthood as well through the Trump administration. So, that's just a the pro-life issue.
On the area of religious freedom, we are doing more to advance religious freedom and to protect Christians who are being murdered and persecuted in the Middle East like we have not seen before...
We've talked about pastor Andrew Brunson, that the president would not relent until this pastor was released out of Turkey. Now I've spoken to pastor Brunson myself at the National Prayer Breakfast, and he is back and his ministry has continued...
[Trump] has stood up where most Republicans wouldn't dare to stand up. Donald Trump has had the courage and the fortitude, and I will say to your listeners, in my lifetime, I have never seen a more biblical president than I have seen in Donald Trump. He has so impressed me with what he's done, and we haven't even talked about Israel, what he has done to advance Israel.
He is highly biblical, and I would say to your listeners, we will in all likelihood never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetime. So, we need to be not only praying for him, we need to support him, in my opinion, in every possible way that we can.
Bachmann isn't wrong on the issues quoted.
In January 2017, President Trump reinstated the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which ""requires foreign NGOs to agree, as a condition of receiving global health assistance, that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning,"" according to USAID .
In March, the Trump administration expanded the rule to include NGOs that provide financial assistance to secondary organizations that might provide abortions.
NBC News reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said of the expanded rule: ""We will enforce a strict prohibition on back-door funding schemes and end runs around our policy. ... American taxpayer dollars will not be used to underwrite abortions.""
In March, Health and Human Services (HHS) ruled that Title X funding could not be ""used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning,"" and that there must be ""physical and financial separation"" between what falls under the umbrella of accepted Title X activities and what does not.
Here’s the pertinent text (citations omitted):
This rule, promulgated pursuant to the Department's authority, will ensure compliance with, and enhance implementation of, the statutory requirement that none of the funds appropriated for Title X may be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning, as well as related statutory requirements...
This rule finalizes requirements that ensure clear physical and financial separation between a Title X program and any activities that fall outside the program's scope. This physical and financial separation will ensure compliance with the statutory requirement that Title X funding not support programs where abortion is a method of family planning...address[ing] concerns over the fungibility of Title X resources and the potential use of Title X resources to support programs where, among other things, abortion is a method of family planning...
In October 2016, American pastor Andrew Brunson, who had lived in Turkey for more than twenty years, was accused of ""political or military espionage"" and of ""membership in an armed terrorist organization,"" according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). He was arrested and imprisoned.
In July 2018, his sentence was reduced to house arrest.
In August 2018, the Trump administration sanctioned Turkey’s Minister of Justice Abdulhamit Gul and Minister of Interior Suleyman Soylu. The U.S. Department of Treasury issued a press release announcing the sanctions, stating in part:
...any property, or interest in property, of both Turkey’s Minister of Justice Abdulhamit Gul and Turkey’s Minister of Interior Suleyman Soylu within U.S. jurisdiction is blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.
In October 2018, Brunson was sentenced to more than three years in prison. However, he was also immediately released on what essentially amounted to ""time served."" Brunson swiftly returned to the United States. The United States lifted the previously imposed sanctions on Turkish officials.
Following Brunson’s release, Trump tweeted : ""Pastor Andrew Brunson, released by Turkey, will be with me in the Oval Office at 2:30 P.M. (this afternoon). It will be wonderful to see and meet him. He is a great Christian who has been through such a tough experience. I would like to thank President @RT_Erdogan for his help!""
The line about Erdogan’s ""help"" was met with some derision, considering he is the president of the country in which Brunson was arrested and held for more than two years.
When Brunson met with the president, he prayed over him.
President Trump has indeed presided over several significant policy changes about which Christian conservatives should be delighted. Perhaps that’s what Bachmann meant when she said that the president is ""godly"" and ""biblical"" (and there’s no one arguing that Christians shouldn’t pray for their leaders). That said, to use such terminology about a man who has shown time and time again his lack of personal Christian ethics, or ethics in general, might be a mistake."

To reduce semi-auto pistol deaths I’d have universal background checks and mandatory reporting on mental health. — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) November 16, 2018
When he was asked whether he planned to expand his proposal to all semi-auto rifles now, Swalwell replied, “No different. I interpreted her question to mean semi-auto rifles covered under what’s considered an assault weapon. cc: @DLoesch ” No different. I interpreted her question to mean semi-auto rifles covered under what’s considered an assault weapon. cc: @DLoesch — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) November 16, 2018
Then Loesch asked a question of Swalwell which he did not answer: “Can you explain to me the difference between assault weapons and semi-automatic rifles? Is .223 ok but 30.06 not? Why?” Can you explain to me the difference between assault weapons and semi-automatic rifles? Is .223 ok but 30.06 not? Why? https://t.co/Ew8mYiQewv — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) November 16, 2018
When Swalwell wouldn’t answer, Loesch added on Twitter:
This simply reinforces my suspicion that Swalwell uses “assault weapon” interchangeably with “semi-auto rifle.” He wants to legislate based on a rifle’s appearance and not the actual mechanics or caliber of the rifle. He and others know enough to stop short of saying “semi-auto rifles” so they use the vague and non-technical “assault weapon” descriptor as though they only mean some rifles and not all of them.
Two problems with this. First, the majority of gun homicide is due to illegally possessed handguns. This is supported by FBI UCRs. Second, the argument is inconsistent. Example: you want to ban a .223/5.56 but not a .308 or 30.06? Have you actually compared these rifles? See photo for reference. You’re arguing for an unknowledgeable ban of things based strictly on cosmetic appearances. The argument also completely excludes a multitude of contributing variables from consideration, like the recidivism rate, the percentage of homicide driven by prohibited possessors, a cultural rot eroding respect for life, etc etc. Instead, people who claim to care so much for life and solutions, as you will see in the comments, would rather yell “WHORE!” and “TERRORIST!” at law-abiding gun owners than engage in any real good faith discussion on the issue, which is why we get nowhere."
BOZELL & GRAHAM: The End Of Cathedral Culture | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,L. Brent Bozell Iii,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46228/bozell-graham-end-cathedral-culture-l-brent-bozell-iii,"April 20, 2019 views
Shortly after the tragic sight of Notre Dame Cathedral going up in flames in Paris, as crowds watched and sang ""Ave Maria,"" historian Victor Davis Hanson put our modern times in perspective.
He told Fox News: ""it's going to be very hard in our society to ever build a cathedral again, much less to repair them, because we don't believe in what they represented. And it's ironic, because we don't like the past. We are at war with the past. We tear down monuments. We don't build cathedrals. We erase names.""
Fox's Laura Ingraham underlined his point with a depressing quote from Rolling Stone: ""Any rebuilding should be a reflection not of an old France, or the France that never was — a non-secular, white European France — but a reflection of the France of today, a France that is currently in the making.""
What's ""in the making"" is the world remade by the left, with a secular orthodoxy that's mercilessly rigid. History is suspect. What has been called ""Western civilization"" is seen as white, patriarchal, superstitious and European — not ""inclusive.""
Another horrible sign came in a much-reviled tweet from Library Journal: ""Library collections continue to promote and proliferate whiteness with their very existence and the fact that they are physically taking up space in our libraries.""
Book burners, unite?
This came from an article by a librarian named Sofia Leung — armed with what they call ""Critical Race Theory."" She claimed these collections are ""white dudes writing about white ideas, white things,"" and when collections of books contain this ""so-called 'knowledge,' it continues to validate only white voices and perspectives and erases the voices of people of color.""
This is literally a war on the past. Anything that any ""white dude"" like Shakespeare or Thomas Jefferson or Thomas Aquinas wrote about the human condition is useless; it continues to ""validate only white voices."" Liberty, justice, religion, politics — anything written by our forebears is dismissed as proliferating ""whiteness.""
Leung added that these collections ""are paid for using money that was usually ill-gotten and at the cost of black and brown lives via the prison industrial complex, the spoils of war, etc."" She offered no evidence for this claptrap. This ""so-called 'knowledge'"" is to be accepted as the modern gospel, written by the gods of ""diversity.""
The obedient followers of our dominant culture never look up in a cathedral to contemplate the transcendent. They crowd around TV and movie screens and take every cultural cue from a raunchy and repugnant Church of Entertainment.
As traditionalists, we wince and peek nervously between our fingers at the rot that Hollywood gives us, even in Holy Week, even as the ashes of Notre Dame are tossed in the wind. One cable show featured a main character, an atheist, smearing Jesus Christ as ""the mayor of Auschwitz."" Another had a male crime lord filming a commercial in a bustier and fishnet stockings and curlers in his hair, promising he was ""bringing sexy back to Easter."" He was on a campaign to ""Make Easter Great Again.""
There is not much room for optimism about our mass culture. Christians are called to be set apart. Whether we pray in cathedrals or our homes or our cars, Catholics pray to the mother of Jesus — Notre Dame, ""our lady"" — that His miserable death is not in vain, that we ""may be made worthy of the promises of Christ."" When churches are in flames and blasphemy tumbles in giggle fits from video screens, we feel the aching need for a Savior. We need the hope that Easter brings.

"LIMBAUGH: Trump Is A Threat To The Constitution? Nice Try, Nancy | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,David Limbaugh,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46229/limbaugh-trump-threat-constitution-nice-try-nancy-david-limbaugh,"LIMBAUGH: Trump Is A Threat To The Constitution? Nice Try, Nancy Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images
This week, two high-profile Democrats mouthed their party's delusional mantra that President Trump is a threat to the Constitution — a rich allegation from those would dismantle major pillars of our republican system of government.
While the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris was still burning, quixotic impeachment crusader Rep. Steve Cohen said on MSNBC's ""Hardball,"" ""What he has done to the Constitution and the rule of law is as bad as that fire did to Notre Dame. He's torching the entire structure of government and the people's respect for it. And the Congress needs to act."" Poor form, poor judgment and just plain over-the-top insanity.
The next day on CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, ""Everything is at stake in this election: the Constitution of the United States, with the president who's trying to usurp the power of the legislative branch of government; the environment in which we live; a Republican Party that is in denial about the assault on climate and the climate crisis, which is a health issue, a national security issue, an economic and jobs issue, and a moral issue."" Misguided, incoherent hyperbole.
I doubt that these dueling attacks were coordinated. When the party sings from the same hymnal — at least on Trump — conspiratorial coordination is unnecessary. But it's noteworthy that they're still beating this drum, even though their collusion gambit has backfired and considering that they are the ones engaging in a full-scale assault on the Constitution. Let us count the ways.
The framers believed our rights are God-given and thus inalienable, and they sought to ensure them by designing a system of limited government. Just providing for the people's democratic participation would be insufficient to secure their liberty, because people can vote themselves into tyranny. They knew men aren't angels and that, left to their own devices, they would eventually subjugate others. So, in addition to establishing the Bill of Rights, they divided power among different levels of government — national, state and local — and within the federal branch — legislative, executive and judicial. They crafted a partially but not purely democratic system. Indeed, they imposed safeguards against pure democracy (including the Electoral College), which they knew could lead to mob rule.
Democrats complain about Trump's supposedly authoritarian disposition — pointing to his bullying nature and combative tweets, as if Stalin, Mao or Hitler would have relied on such anemic methods to amass their power and terrorize their people. Please don't respond that Trump is engaged in Nazi-like propaganda, and that he threatens the freedom of the press by calling the ""fake news media"" the ""enemy of the people."" Trump is mostly defending himself against the daily barrage of propaganda leveled against him by a dishonest, monolithic leftist media that is the arm of the Democratic Party. His rhetorical rejoinders seek to showcase the unfairness and dishonesty of his detractors. And unaccompanied by any effort to muzzle them, they are, in the scheme of things, harmless. They are certainly no threat to the Constitution.
Long before their recent barrage of proposals to alter and circumvent the Constitution to make it easier for them to win elections, the Democrats worked to undermine our system of limited government. Their judicial activism resulted in the judiciary usurping powers from the other two political branches, thereby upsetting the constitutional scheme. Their penchant for their presidents to issue unlawful executive orders has also undermined the balance of powers. Their passage of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946 resulted in an enormous power shift from Congress to unelected, unaccountable executive branch bureaucrats whose administrative agencies are models of the type of tyranny the framers warned about because they combine legislative, executive and judicial powers under one tent. By the way, the allegedly anti-Constitution ogre, President Trump, has done more to disempower this ""fourth branch of government"" than any other president, and the constitutional system is stronger, not weaker, as a result.
More recently, Democrats have proposed a rash of disturbing ideas designed to alter our system of government through fundamental changes in our elections. The same Steve Cohen who's now yelling about President Trump's threat to the constitutional order introduced a bill to effectively eliminate the Electoral College and provide for the direct election of the president and vice president. Democrats have advanced proposals to pack the Supreme Court, and a majority of them have voted to reduce the voting age to 16, which is egregious on multiple levels and unwise. In addition, Pelosi introduced the euphemistically dubbed For the People Act, which would overhaul federal election laws to micromanage and centralize the election process now administered by the states, and which would favor the election of Democrats. Other examples of Democrats' mischief that impairs free and fair elections include their opposition to voter ID laws and their objection to a citizenship question on the census form.
And please don't get me started on the Democrats' failed coup to delegitimize and oust President Trump, or their ongoing efforts to baselessly impeach him. Suffice it to say that he represents no threat to the Constitution, but Democrats do. But why shouldn't they? Many of them have openly said that America is not that great, so why trifle over preserving the integrity of the document whose ideas make it unique?

FBI Arrests Head Of Militia Group 'Assisting' Immigration Authorities At Southern Border | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46244/fbi-arrests-head-militia-group-assisting-emily-zanotti,"FBI Arrests Head Of Militia Group 'Assisting' Immigration Authorities At Southern Border SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP/Getty Images April 21, 2019 views
On Saturday, the FBI arrested the leader of a group that claims to be ""assisting"" United States Customs and Border Patrol in apprehending illegal immigrants along the United States-Mexico border.
Reuters reports that the FBI took Larry Hopkins, also known as ""Johnny Horton,"" into custody in New Mexico, “on a federal complaint charging him with being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition.”
Hopkins is the leader of the United Concerned Patriots, who have been ""camped out on a rotating basis"" along the United States southern border near Sunland Park, New Mexico. The group isn't new to the area; a small band of militia members has been stationed in Sunland Park since mid-February.
What is new, however, are complaints. New Mexico state government announced last week that it was cracking down on the group after photos and videos emerged of them rounding up and detaining migrants who crossed the border under the nose of border patrol agents. The videos, which UCP posted itself, show the group capturing illegal immigrants, cordoning them off, and then ordering them to ""stop, sit down, and wait"" until the CBP arrived to handle the situation.
UCP claims to have ""arrested"" more than 5,000 migrants since taking up residence at the New Mexico-Mexico border in mid-February.
The United States Customs and Border Protection Agency says it ""does not support citizens taking law enforcement into their own hands,"" according to Reuters, and instead encourages Americans living along the border to alert law enforcement when they see suspicious activity.
CBP also says that it warned UCP Friday to stop undertaking border interdictions, according to local media , or they could face problems from the federal government.
""Interference by civilians in law enforcement matters could have public safety and legal consequences for all parties involved,"" CBP said in a statement posted to social media.
In response to the videos and UCP's claims, New Mexico's governor and attorney general ordered a halt to UCP's ""operations, and the ACLU, which calls the group a ""fascist militia,"" pressured sites like PayPal to stop allowing UCP to raise funds for its work.
""This has no place in our state: we cannot allow racist and armed vigilantes to kidnap and detain people seeking asylum,"" the New Mexico ACLU said in its own statement issued ahead of Hopkins' arrest.
The FBI says Hopkins was taken peacefully and that his arrest stems from a similar arrest in Oregon in 2006, where he was charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and being illegally in possession of a firearm.
UCP told media that it plans to continue its work until it is officially disbanded, and that it continues to receive support, despite having no access to PayPal or fundraising sites like GoFundMe.
U.S. border patrol authorities have repeatedly said they are unable to handle the flow of illegal immigrants coming across the border since late 2018, and are asking for funds from the federal government to help alleviate a dearth of personnel and resources. Although most pro-immigration activists now recognize that the CBP is overwhelmed, they blame the Trump administration for allowing the situation to reach crisis levels along the southern border."
"George Mason University To Protesters: Brett Kavanaugh WILL Teach Here, Sorry | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46245/george-mason-university-protesters-brett-kavanaugh-emily-zanotti,"April 21, 2019 views
George Mason University says that United States Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will continue to teach a single summer course at the Antonin Scalia Law School, despite concerns from the student body that Kavanaugh's presence made them feel ""unsafe.""
“Even if the outcome is painful,"" the school's president, Angel Cabrera, told a group of students who gathered at a ""town hall"" even earlier this week, ""what’s at stake is very, very important for the integrity of the university.""
The school's provost noted that George Mason saw “no reason for university administrators to override” the law school's decision to welcome Kavanaugh as a guest lecturer during the summer semester, and Cabrera agreed, even though the students at the town hall were left completely bewildered as to why the administration had failed to take their ""mental health"" into consideration when extending an invitation to Kavanaugh.
The Huffington Post reports that students organized the town hall as a protest, alongside an ad campaign and a petition, which received around 10,000 signatures. But it was to no avail.
“Even if in this particular case the outcome is one that you deeply disagree with, the process by which these decisions are made and the reason why we are so firm in defending them is actually essential to the way a university like ours operates,” Cabrera insisted to the students.
The town hall, arranged by anti-sexual assault activists on campus, quickly turned, then, from a discussion between students and administrations into an airing of grievances, with students openly condemning Kavanaugh for his own ""alleged sexual assault"" — a single accusation of impropriety leveled by a former high school classmate about an incident that took place decades ago, and which the FBI could find no proof of. Kavanaugh has routinely and stridently denied the allegation.
One activist even suggested the Kavanaugh contract — which has the Supreme Court justice teaching a single class for the next three summers at the school's campus in the United Kingdom (not even in the continental U.S.) — was evidence that GMU somehow encouraged sexual violence on campus.
“How could Kavanaugh possibly be hired despite Ford’s allegations? Why is the college student that recorded women in the bathroom still on this campus?” said one protester, according to HuffPo. “A blatantly obvious response by GMU [would be one] that states that first they do not believe Dr. Blasey Ford’s testimony and second do not care about the safety of their students.”
“In hiring Kavanaugh, to what extent did you consider the mental health of the survivors on campus and how that might affect them and their education?"" asked another — a question which HuffPo describes as earning ""snaps"" from the gathered students (clapping is, it seems, now considered triggering).
Others were left simply baffled.
“Oh, my God,” one female student said aloud.
“Why?” asked another, to no one in particular.
Kavanaugh, of course, defended himself against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations in an appearance under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has now served on the Supreme Court for half a term."
