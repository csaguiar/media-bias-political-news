The 1st only states that ""Congress shall pass no law"", and so only pertains to Congress. The second contains ""shall not be infringed"", which means neither Congress, the President, the Courts, nor any petty tyrant appointed to some alphabet agency can pass a law, make a rule, or interpret their way into taking arms from law abiding citizens.

Short Circuit: A Roundup of Recent Federal Court Decisions - Volokh Conspiracy :,reason.com,John K. Ross,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/volokh/2019/04/12/short-circuit-a-roundup-of-recent-federa,"
Nashville prohibits people who run home businesses from allowing customers to visit. Want to teach piano lessons in your living room? Illegal. Have a soundproofed recording studio in your basement? No renting that out. Run a one-chair salon? Keep your clippers to yourself. Which is ridiculous—and also unconstitutional. Click here for some in-depth reporting on Nashville's client prohibition from Reason.com.
Allegation: Man steps outside his home in Southeast D.C. to take some air. He's obstructing no one, but police officer in a passing patrol car yells at him to move along, arrests him when he declines. Weeks later and a few blocks away, the same officer arrests another man who stepped outside for a smoke (on Christmas Eve) and who was also not obstructing passersby. D.C. Circuit : A D.C. law that authorizes police to arrest (after a warning) people who obstruct pedestrian traffic is not unconstitutional in all its applications. Columbia law prof disappears from NYC subway in 1956, never to be found. Perhaps he was murdered by agents of Dominican dictator, whom he'd criticized. Alleged to be involved: a former FBI agent who worked for the dictator and was convicted ( later reversed ) of failing to register as an agent of a foreign government. May historian obtain the ex-agent's grand jury records? District court: Generally, courts can authorize grand jury records' disclosure if historically significant. Not so. Grand jury secrecy is the rule , the only exceptions to which are expressly enumerated, and none provides a blanket exception for historically significant documents. In 2012, [REDACTED] sent a big chunk of money to a corporation, which sent a big chunk of money to a nonprofit, which sent a big chunk of money to a political action committee. That violates campaign finance law, and the Federal Election Commission ultimately settled the case with a fine of $350k on the corporation, the nonprofit, and the PAC, but not [REDACTED]. May the FEC now release documents that would disclose [REDACTED]'s identity, over [REDACTED]'s objections? D.C. Circuit : [REDACTED] loses. Dissent: [REDACTED] should win. Certain Dallas landlords refuse to accept ""Section 8"" vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. (Landlord participation in Section 8 is voluntary.) But the users of those vouchers are disproportionately members of racial minorities. And—since a 2015 Supreme Court case—the federal Fair Housing Act can prohibit housing policies that disproportionately affect minority groups. So does the refusal to accept Section 8 vouchers violate the Fair Housing Act? Fifth Circuit (2–1): It does not. The Supreme Court said to be careful of claims like this, which take disparate impact liability too far. Near the start of the 2013–14 school year, Mississippi truancy officer calls 6-year-old student's listed contact person to figure out why student is missing school. Beats me, says the contact, I'm his aunt; he doesn't live with me. The officer apologizes for the confusion. Fast-forward to the end of the school year: Student has 16 unexcused absences, so the truancy officer swears out an arrest warrant for … the aunt? She's handcuffed, taken to jail, and strip-searched before the mistake is discovered. Fifth Circuit : No that. The great philosopher David Hume argued that if you see one billiard ball strike another, after which the first ball stops and the second ball acquires motion, you don't really see the first ball cause the second to move; you just see one event follow the other. A Humean district court judge might apply similar reasoning to this New Orleans waste disposal company, which made $20k in illegal campaign contributions through four shell corporations to former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin (who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for accepting (unrelated) bribes), after which Mayor Nagin canceled a competing waste disposal company's landfill contract. Fifth Circuit (over a Humean dissent): This RICO case by the aggrieved competitor should have gone to a jury. Georgetown, Ky. police officer shoots driver ""at some unspecified point"" after the driver hit a police cruiser with her car. The driver later pleads guilty to wantonly endangering the officer's life. Does this plea bar the driver's excessive force lawsuit? Sixth Circuit : It depends. If the officer shot because he was in danger, the claim is barred. If he shot after the threat had ended, it isn't. Remanded for limited discovery. Some cases deal with issues so earthshaking that they invoke ""ordered liberty"" itself. There's also this case, in which the Sixth Circuit holds that a particular cooperative of cherry growers was lawfully a member of the federal Cherry Industry Administrative Board—a regulatory body that we are not making up. ""These appeals, unfortunately, are not Nora's first encounter with attorney discipline. See, e.g., [string cite] ."" You can probably tell from the opener that the Seventh Circuit upheld Ms. Nora's suspension from practice in the Western District of Wisconsin. But don't overlook the additional sanctions imposed for her conduct during the appeal. Woman is convicted of assault for slapping a fellow passenger on flight from Minneapolis to Los Angeles. (She's fined $760.) Ninth Circuit (creating a circuit split): Conviction reversed. The trial was held in federal district court in Los Angeles, but the assault happened before the plane reached that district's airspace. Dissent: Asking victims to pinpoint and the gov't to prove the precise moment an assault took place will make prosecutions (of crimes much more serious than this one) on board aircraft well-nigh impossible. Man spends over four years in jail awaiting trial. That's too long! Kansas court orders him released, and the Kansas Supreme Court affirms, holding that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause applies to civil commitment proceedings. Tenth Circuit : But he can't sue the state official in charge of civil commitments for not taking action sooner; some of the delay was on him for asking for new lawyers and judges. And in other news, the Second Circuit has withdrawn its decision holding that landlords can be liable for tenant-on-tenant harassment under the Fair Housing Act. This week, IJ launched two new cases. Up in Pennsylvania, Lancaster and Berks County prosecutors are refusing to turn over to a local journalist records that detail how much property they take through civil forfeiture and how the proceeds are spent—despite a ruling from the state's Office of Open Records that those records should be available to the public. Click here to learn more. And in Indiana, IJ is challenging a law that bars patients from utilizing telemedicine to obtain prescriptions for eyeglasses or contacts. The tech is safe and effective, but it threatens some optometrists' profits, and they prevailed on the legislature to ban it. Click here for more."

Easy to say but until CA decides that the republican (small-r) form of government works, then nothing they do will ever work. Just as one example. CA froze the size of their assembly at 80 - in their 1880 Constitution - when the population of the state was 860,000 and CA was a very middling state (fewer peeps than Louisiana but more than Arkansas). Now the population is close to 40 million (with fewer reps now than either LA or AR or hell NH or ND). On what planet can anyone possibly think that that size assembly can represent their peeps, bring those issues forward, and figure out different ways of dealing with those state level issues? They can't - and their incompetence at that is why CA chose to double down on the stupidity via term limits as well. Since the assembly can't represent - and now is trying to figure out where the bathrooms are, they end up 'addressing problems' via referenda/initiatives/propositions which only rarely produces any sort of real road map beyond feel-good superficial emotional direction (see Brexit) that ends up very cronyist as well.

Death and the Shadow Docket - Volokh Conspiracy :,reason.com,A nerdy Fred,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/volokh/2019/04/12/death-and-the-shadow-docket#comment_7755858,"What is the interest in timeliness here?
In a civil lawsuit, delay is bad because it leaves the wronged party without a remedy while the delay continues.
Public safety is equally well served if executions are rushed or delayed. A murderer on Death Row is safely isolated from the public.
If relatives of the victim are bloodthirsty for revenge, the whole premise of the criminal justice system is that the offense is an offense against the state, which then preempts and prevents their vengeance."
Death and the Shadow Docket - Volokh Conspiracy :,reason.com,Will Baude,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/volokh/2019/04/12/death-and-the-shadow-docket,"A couple months ago, the Supreme Court lifted a stay of execution in Dunn v. Ray , allowing Alabama to execute a man despite the prison's refusal to let his imam attend to him in the execution chamber. While much of the controversy about the case was about the religious discrimination angle, the Court's opinion stressed an issue of timing -- the Court claimed that he had raised the issue too late in the day, and that this was an independent reason to deny his claim for relief. Four Justices joined a very powerful dissent written by Justice Kagan. ( I wrote about this here .)
Then in late March, the Supreme Court granted a stay of execution in Murphy v. Collier , a similar case out of Texas (this one involving a Buddhist). Two Justices, Thomas and Gorsuch, announced their dissent. Justice Kavanaugh, who had necessarily joined the majority in Dunn v. Ray, wrote an opinion explaining why he ruled in favor of the prisoner on the religious discrimination issue. He also included a footnote announcing that the case was different from Dunn v. Ray on the timing issue because ""Murphy made his request to the state in a sufficiently timely manner, one month before his scheduled execution.""
Many observers were not convinced that the timing was that different, since Ray had made his request to the state two weeks before his execution, and the difference between two weeks and a month seems somewhat arbitrary. Indeed, Ray actually filed his lawsuit sooner than Dunn. Ray sued ten days before his execution; Murphy sued in state court eight days before his execution and in federal court two days before his execution. But Ray died and Murphy lived.
Because both of these decisions were dealt with on the orders list (or the ""shadow docket"") rather than the merits docket, the Court provided only very brief explanations of its decision. Justices Gorsuch and Thomas did not explain their dissent in the Murphy case. We also do not know how Justice Alito or Chief Justice Roberts voted in Murphy. Unlike with merits opinions, it is possible for a Justice to dissent from an order without publicly noting it, so the decision might have been 7-2, 6-3, or 5-4. And if those justices voted with the majority in Murphy, we don't know whether they agreed with Justice Kavanaugh about how to distinguish Dunn. But the combination of the cases prompted various explanations, such as the possibility that different lawyering or different amicus participation made the difference, or that the Court had felt the blowback from its Dunn decision and was quietly beating a retreat.
Then the plot thickened. In Bucklew v. Precythe , a merits case about an Eighth Amendment challenge to an execution protocol, Justice Gorsuch's opinion for the Court included a 2-page section at the end of the opinion raising general concerns about litigation that delayed the death penalty. The Court reiterated that ""federal courts can and should protect settled state jugments from undue interference by invoking their equitable powers to dismiss or curtail suits that are pursued in a dilatory fashion or based on speculative theories."" And it doubled down on Dunn v. Ray, including a long footnote reiterating Ray's claim had involved undue delay. So it doesn't seem like there is a retreat.
Finally, last night in Dunn v. Price , the Supreme Court divided 5-4 over another request to lift a stay. The Court lifted a stay imposed by the Eleventh Circuit because Price's complaint was too late -- but he had challenged his April execution in February (though he had also ""submitted additional evidence ... a few hours before his scheduled execution time"") rather than electing that method of execution last June. Justice Breyer wrote a dissent joined by four Justices that began ""Should anyone doubt that death sentences in the United States can be carried out in an arbitrary way, let that person review the following circumstances as they have been presented to our Court this evening."" He emphasized that he had just wanted to delay discussion until today, when the Justices could discuss the case in person, rather than dealing with it in the middle of the night. Ironically, the Court's own decision that Price's litigation came too late itself came too late. Apparently because the Court's decision didn't come out until after 1 am EDT, Alabama's death warrant expired and will have to be renewed in a month.
It seems clear to me that the Court is attempting to signal a significant shift in how it handles death-penalty litigation, but it is struggling over how to carry it out, and also likely divided over whether that shift is a good idea in any event. This problem is significantly exacerbated by two procedural features of the death penalty shadow docket. One is that these decisions are made with a modest amount of briefing, no oral argument, and without the Justices meeting in person to talk about them. The other is that these issues come up on a tight time frame, often in the middle of the night. Both the majority and the dissent are trying to respond to these features, but in different ways that each presuppose the correctness of their proposed solutions.
I say this as somebody with a great deal of sympathy for the Court, who thinks that the death penalty is justifiable and constitutional, but: this is no way to run a railroad . If the Court wants to regularize its death penalty procedures or stop the last-minute filings, it might be time to consider any of the following: promulgating a new Supreme Court rule setting out some deadlines or timeliness rules; adopting a general presumption of deference to the lower court in last-minute filings; adopting a general presumption of deference to the district court in last-minute filings; granting certiorari and oral argument in one of these shadow-docket cases so that some specific timeliness principles could be discussed, adjudicated, and adhered to; keeping all of the Justices in the building on execution night so that they can discuss controversial orders in the conference room. I'm sure somebody else can think of better ideas.
But I fear that muddling through these cases on the shadow docket will not produce the procedural regularity or early filing that the majority claims to want, and if it goes on much longer, it may also give Justice Breyer's accusations of arbitrariness the unfortunate appearance of truth."

Hard to accept that phrase, since the evidence cited in the post is fairly strong that Breyer's statement not only has the appearance of truth but is truth itself.
One has to remember that although the opinions in the decisions and discussions like this cite the prisoner as the one arguing and filing etc, it is actually the prisoner's attorney and the prisoner is likely partially or completely ignorant of the law, the procedures or anything else regarding the appeals. And so the prisoner is punished for the sins of an attorney, in many case an inexperienced court appointed novice. One can call this many things, but calling it justice is difficult if not impossible."

That would simply ensure the abolition of the death penalty in any zone covered by a Court of Appeals with a liberal majority. Since the CoA would always vote for a stay, and there are an unlimited number of ""last minutes.""
If you want a general presumption it should be based on each CoA's ""batting average"" in death penalty cases. So if a CoA is batting below .500 in appeals to SCOTUS in death penalty cases, there should then be a calculation of its direction of error. Does it err more often in preventing the death penalty proceeding (too wussy) , or allowing it when it shouldn't (too rabid)?
The presumption should be to defer to the appeal court if it is going against its previous error flow - eg a rabid court voting for a stay. But to overrule the appeal court if it is going with its previous error flow - eg a wussy court voting for a stay.) If it's batting above .500 though, then it should be deferred to anyway.
An alternative would be to go with the automatic deference to the lower court, but when SCOTUS finally gets round to considering the substance, if it decides that the lower court should not have granted a stay then one of the erroneous lower court judges (chosen by lot) should be invited to resign, or join the convict in the chamber."

If you defer to the lower court issuing stays each time, the stay becomes permanent.
Obviously if you don't think the death penalty benefits the public, then delaying its execution does no harm. But if you take the opposite view, delay is harmful to the public, and permanent delay even more so.
We're already up to delays of 20 years or more, 40 years would be worse. And never worse still."

You have put your finger on the problem. Federal law allows a private suit for violation of one's civil rights. You can obtain damages, and sometimes an injunction. Problem is, in most cases, there is no need for an injunction, as the violation was one time and stopped.
As for damages, in most cases, they end up being paid by the employer -- in this case the school board -- and ultimately the taxpayers.
So there is no disincentive for someone like the principal here to violate someone's civil rights. At worst, there will be a lawsuit, where the school board will pay for his lawyer, and pay any damages.
IMO, federal law should be amended to disallow this compensation. Let the principal lose his house for acting like a jerk. Maybe the next principal will think twice."

Expel them. Explain to them that it's for their own safety. Even go so far as refunding their tuition. And then remind them that they could have received a degree from Harvard."

No. First because he is not the college.
But second since he could stop it and chooses not to the interpretation which fits the evidence most completely is that he does support the behavior but doesn't want to accept the criticism of doing so openly."
