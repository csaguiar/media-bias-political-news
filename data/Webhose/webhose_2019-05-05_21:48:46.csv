I remember that summer well and watched the hearings daily. The biggest difference between people in 1973 and people now is that we didn't have social media, didn't have FOX news, didn't have the societal violence we do now, and we're worse off for it too. Dispassionate, intelligent debate in our society disappeared a long time ago, replaced by self-righteous bombast of a much less educated populous, who finds itself highly suspicious of others and completely distrusting of government. The rise of Donald Trump, and the dissatisfied extreme political right, is not a new phenomenon in politics. We have seen this 3-act tragidy too many times before in world history, its roots now well understood, its results regretted as any that can be. I have watched tapes of Hitler speaking in Nuremberg in the '30's. I have actually met people years ago who were there at those rally's telling me about the ""trance-inducing"" Hitler whose invective was ""so powerful, so alluring, so much the siren's song of seduction"", that an entire nation followed this vile Pied Piper into the sea of carnage and death. Donald Trump has read Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" (reports Melania) and understands the mechanics of political grandstanding like no others since Goebbels & Hitler. Trump, who is by no comparison an intelligent man, is ""New York street-savvy"" enough to know a good con-job when he sees one, and the object of this con is America, our country. As I see it, Trump's entire purpose is not to ""Make America Great Again""; his entire reason for existance is to dismantle our government as much he can get his hands on, and ""auction off"" the pieces to the highest uber-wealthy bidder as he seeks to take America private - Removing our heritage from its rightful owners - The People, while enriching himself and the card-carrying oligarchs like him. Trump is antithetical to Democracy; Trump is antithetical to our notion of a Republic. The hallmark of any ""pretender"", and Trump is just that, a ""Pretender-to-the-Crown"", is to surround yourself with mindless sycophants so as to get acquiescence, the green light, in your evil. We are now entering a most dangerous phase of this drama, not unlike Russia in the spring of 1917 before the October Revolution and I predict we may see blood in the streets soon. History never misleads, and I know human history well. The People demand to see the Mueller Report now, in its entirety, with some redactions by Senator Mark Warner and Congressman Adam Schiff alone. The People are happy with the ""Affordable Care Act"" and do not want it lessened, but improved upon. The People either want ""Medicare-for-All"", better yet offer ""VA-for-All"" to every citizen. The People do not want nuclear platforms in space that will certainly bring about the end of all mankind. The People do not want Trump, Pompeo, and Bolton to take us into a war with Iraq. The People want a ""reset"" with Russia and Vladimir Putin. The People know about our secret 1945 military plan to nuke all of Russia, (as did Josef Stalin). We know that the soured 70-years of U.S./Russia relations are of our own doing entirely. (Google: 9/15/1945 Secret Plan to Nuke Russia) The People do not want our National Parks privatized. The American Indian People do not want their sacred lands desicrated & fracked. The vast majority of the People to don't want ""Roe v. Wade"" overturned. The People want their children to go to college without debt as I did. The People demand we stop our endless military adventurism around the world, & quit the endless wars-for-profit, and to stop whoring out our national treasury to the military/industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us not to do in 1960. So what exactly is it that the People actually do want? *We want justice. *We want peace. *We want clean air again & clean water again. *We want this country fixed the way it needs to be fixed. *If we don't descend into a nuclear war first, global warming will kill us all before our kid's get old if we don't address it right now, today, with Green Energy. [It's time for the greedy, ignorant, spoiled, self-serving miscreant's to leave Congress, now] And it's now HIGH TIME for the Siren's Voices of Tomorrow to sing those sweet, warm songs of change to lead the likes of Alexandrea Ocasio-Cortez, Beto O' Rourke, and Elizabeth Warren, into our highest body politic while we still have a fighting chance of survival, lest this become: ""The Late, Great, Planet Earth""!"

Those who hate Trump will continue to say he did ""some thing wrong"". They will shout ""cover up!"" Then if Mueller report does actually clear Trump they will shout ""Mueller was paid off""! That is what is wrong with this country. Lets go back to just before the election. Remember when Trump was saying he thought the election was rigged? Then all the liberals in the media and Clinton supporters were bitching that ""Trump wont accept the results of a fair election"". ""He should accept it for the good of the country and lets all just come together after the election"". Oh but... whoops... their candidate lost. So they all went into their corners to cry and then came out SCREAMING RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA... oh wait... that was after they tried to flip electors, then tried to come up with some why to stop Trump from being sworn in. People... you are exactly what you railed against when you thought Hillary would win. You are being lied to by Democrats and the MSM... wake up.

None of these people is a knight in shining armor who protects us from perils of all kinds. If democracy and the rule of law will survive in the USA it's because there is a mass of people willing and able to defend those qualities of American life. I think that current events have already put to rest the idea of American Exceptionalism. If America truly was so exceptional and unlike all other nations we wouldn't have Donald Trump as our president.
