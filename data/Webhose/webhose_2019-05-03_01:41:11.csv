Do Liberals have to choose between Muslims and Gays?,hurryupharry.org,Libby T,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://hurryupharry.org/2019/04/03/do-liberals-have-to-choose-between-muslims-and-gays/,"Do Liberals have to choose between Muslims and Gays? 3 April 2019
Last week I received some criticism for daring to discuss the reasons why many might fear Islam. Some felt it was an overreaction to link the Sharia-sanctioned judicial murder of gay people in almost a dozen Muslim-majority countries, most lately Brunei , with the Section 28 -style demands of protesting Muslim parents in Birmingham (which is now spreading to other cities ).
Was it “fair” to link the motives of those who impose cruel Sharia-law punishments on lesbian and gay people in Islamic countries with the actions of the Birmingham parents who are merely “religiously conservative”? Well, I’m not sure I was saying anything as bluntly as that, though given the polls I referred to one has to wonder what sort of society these parents might wish to create if they had the numbers, or were unconstrained by the consequences of not obeying secular law in a Western country. It stands to reason that laws are made by people – they are not imposed on us like the weather, or the laws of physics. It is people with beliefs and opinions – and demands – who create societies, which give rise to the structures which create the laws. People are responsible for those laws.
But before I could grapple with the metaphysical questions, news came in which short-circuited the need for deeper theoretical analysis. An article in The Observer identified one of the leaders playing a “key role” in the Muslim-led homophobic campaign to stop LGBT-inclusive lessons as a Dr Kate Godfrey-Faussett – a psychologist, no less – who heads up an organisation called StopRSE, which has been investigated by the National Secular Society.
The StopRSE organisation promoted the DEATH PENALTY for homosexuality.
From The Observer article:
In a letter dated 18 February, seen by the Observer, the society warned the council that the Stop RSE campaign had “promoted material which says the punishment for homosexuality is death. Our research has found that downloadable resources which were available on Stop RSE’s website as recently as last week [since withdrawn] included a book which endorses lashing and killing gay people.”
Can you imagine any other group getting away with this?
It is almost certain that if members of a far right group were found to have distributed literature arguing that Muslims should be killed, they’d be jailed under terrorism and racial hatred legislation, but this woman and her group aren’t. Why?
Here is an extract from a book shared as a resource by the anti-LGBT inclusion campaigners. It is called “ Marriage and Morals in Islam “. This is being distributed in the UK, not Brunei.
So we see that as far as the Qur’an is concerned, homosexuality is an “indecency,” and that Allah had destroyed a whole nation because of this indecent sexual behavior.
In the Islamic legal system, homosexuality is a punishable crime against the laws of God. In the case of homosexuality between two males, the active partner is to be lashed a hundred times if he is unmarried and killed if he is married; whereas the passive partner is to be killed regardless of his marital status. In the case of two females (i.e., lesbianism), the sinners are to be lashed a hundred times if they are unmarried and stoned to death if they are married. (See the chapter on “hudud” in Sharaya and Shark Lum’a also al-Khu’i, Takmilah, p. 42-44.
Why is Islam so severe in matters of fornication, homosexuality and lesbianism? If the Islamic system had not allowed the gratification of the sexual urge by lawful means (without even associating guilt with it), then it would be right to say that Islam is very severe. But since it has allowed the fulfillment of sexual instincts by lawful means, it is not prepared to tolerate any perverted behavior.
The homosexuals are considered as the high risk group for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). This shows that nature has not accepted it as a normal sexual behavior among mankind. The homosexuals are told that in order to have safe sex, they must use condoms. If homosexuality without condoms is not safe sex, then how can it be natural? Isn’t the statement that “it is natural but not safe” a contradiction in itself?
The moral bankruptcy of the West is clearly evident in the present trend where some Christian churches are willing to consider modifying the Biblical moral values to accommodate the whims of those who want to justify their immoral behavior!
You will notice that it specifically condemns “The West” and mainstream Christian churches for their departure from “Biblical moral values” and accommodating lesbians and gays instead of killing them. You will notice that this is not just quoting dead scripture for scholarly purposes, but situating it as relevant in a modern social and political context.
Talking to gay friends it is not hard to see why they’re concerned. Material is being produced and distributed and it is similar to that touted by the late crank Rev Fred Phelps of the cultish Westbro Baptist Church. But instead of being roundly condemned and mocked, it is being taken seriously. Indeed, BBC Question Time even posed the question : “Is it morally right from 5 year old children learn about LGBT issues in schools?”
Morally right? To learn that gay people exist? In a world where some of those 5 year olds might have gay parents, or a gay older sibling, or other gay relatives, or their parents may have gay friends? Or their neighbours might be gay? How is this a “moral issue” any longer? Is the very existence of gay people meant to be kept a secret?
Sure, I accept that some religious institutions – Jewish, Christian, and other – might take this approach, but the neutral, secular, BBC? It is hard to believe that other than out of the deference nice liberal people extend to Islam the question would have been asked at all, let alone in this way.
The head of ‘ Tell Mama ‘ an anti-Islamophobia campaigning group, Fiyaz Mughal, wrote an op-ed for The Independent warning the Muslim parents that they can’t have it both ways. “If we’re defended against bigotry, so must the LGBT+ community,” he wrote. That was three months ago. No one has listened. On the contrary, in the weeks that followed, the protests gained momentum . They spread. The “be tolerant of others so that you may also benefit from tolerance” argument has not succeeded.
In his article he described as ‘archaic’ the view put forward by one of the Muslim parents: “ Children are being told it’s okay to be gay, yet 98 per cent of children at this school are Muslim. It’s a Muslim community.” Treating the Muslim community like a monolithic bloc is what nice liberal people like us are not supposed to do. So what are we supposed to do when it turns out that we are out of step, and liberal Muslims like Fiyaz Mughal is out of step with a strident community voice saying the exact opposite?
I would have preferred to write the moderate piece Mughal wrote, but he has already written it, months have passed, it made no appreciable impression at all, so what is the point of writing another along the same lines?
The problem with liberals is that we lie as much as our enemies lie. The only difference is that we chiefly lie to ourselves. We want the quid pro quo of inter-minority tolerance to be true because we want that world to be true. Perhaps it isn’t. Perhaps it never will be. Consider this: Thirteen years ago Peter Tatchell drew attention to the fact that Islamists with “kill the gays” views were welcome in Left-wing organisations. Nothing was done about the willingness to turn a blind eye towards Islamic homophobia then, and it appears nothing is being done about it now.
Just look at the confused language of the SWP’s position on the issue. Its primary concern seems to be that the “Islamophobic Prevent strategy” is not brought to bear on this extremism. They say that this “ pits LGBT+ and Muslim people against one another and undermines the possibility of open discussion in schools.” Platitudes aren’t going to help. I fear that this is an irreconcilable difference between the lesbian and gay community and the Muslim community and Liberals are going to have to choose whether they support a regressive, homophobic and patriarchal religion which will not budge, or modern Western liberal democracy.
The hardest choice, of course, will have to be made by liberals who are Muslims, and lesbians and gays who are Muslim (whether they are liberal or not). But the tragedy is that we have not been able to build successful institutions to give reformist Muslims an authoritative voice in this country. At the same time the failure to stand unequivocally against problematic stances of Islamism have left a gap open for the far-right. So the problem becomes that those who hate Muslims as a whole rarely care about gay Muslims, specifically; and those who stand in solidarity against anti-Muslim bigotry rarely also speak up against religiously sanctioned homophobia. Worse, the liberal/left tries to shut up even ex-Muslims from talking about the faith they’ve abandoned. So we’re at an impasse, and we do not have the political infrastructure to deal with it. This is why we have come to a point where this invidious choice even has to be contemplated.
Paralyzed by this, many liberals will not want to choose, and that is why my gay friends don’t trust them. Would you if your rights, your dignity – and in extreme cases – your very life – depended on it ?
What’s to be done? Who the hell knows! But arresting and prosecuting members of organisations that promote killing gay people might be a start. Share this article."

Liberia: Crane Currency Refutes Wrong Doing in L$16 Billion Saga FrontPageAfrica,frontpageafricaonline.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/business/economy/liberia-crane-currency-refutes-wrong-doing-in-l16-billion-saga/,"Liberia: President Weah, VP Taylor Smoke Peace Pipe at… Apr 16, 2019
MONROVIA – Crane Currency, the company accused of conniving with the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) to print excess Liberian dollar banknotes at the expense of Liberian taxpayers has refuted the allegation, noting that its operations with CBL was in full compliance with the law. Report by Lennart Dodoo, [email protected]
Crane was drawn in the L$16 billion fray when the Presidential Investigation Team (PIT) in their investigative report stated that CRANE which was contracted by the CBL in two separate contracts to print banknotes totaling L$15 billion at the cost of US$15,331,689.20 conspired with officials of the CBL to defraud the Government of Liberia by ignoring the terms and conditions of the contract and went ahead to print L$18,151,000,000 in breach of the contract. The Government of Liberia incurred an extra printing cost of US$835,367.78.
The PIT also recommended prosecution for CRANE AB.
However, CRANE in its first reaction to the allegation, stated in a press release that there have been no charges levelled against them by the Liberian government.
“Crane has not been charged with any crime in Liberia, and at all times Crane has operated in full compliance with the law and rejects completely any allegation of wrongdoing,” Crane noted in the release.
The currency printing firm further denied allegations of receiving kickbacks to violate the contract with the Government of Liberia.
“That allegation is false and without merit. Crane fulfilled its contractual obligations as set out in two delivery contracts and two subsequent documented agreements between the CBL for Crane to deliver the finished banknotes, and every banknote delivered was properly invoiced and accounted for. Crane was paid in full the correct amount (and no more) as had been agreed with our Liberian customer for these contracted deliveries of banknotes, and there were no excess or improper payments made by the CBL or any other party.”
PIT report, Milton Weeks, found former Governor of the Central Bank, Charles Sirleaf, Deputy Governor for Operations, Hagba Dorbor, director of banking, Richard H. Walker and Joseph Dennis liable of conniving to conceal the true nature of the total and actual amount of Liberian dollar banknotes printed and received by the CBL.
They were all arrested upon the release of the report on February 29. Currently, they face charges of economic sabotage, criminal conspiracy and Misuse of Public Money, Property or Records and Illegal Disbursement and Expenditure of Public Money.
According to the Kroll report, Crane AB was awarded the second contract in June 2017 by the CBL to print new banknotes totaling L$10.0 billion, four weeks before two officials from the Legislature requested that the CBL replace all legacy banknotes.
The CBL procured the services of Crane AB for both contracts without adhering to its own internal tendering policies for procurement, the report said. Post Views: 3,330"
Chicago Elects First Gay And First African-American Woman As Mayor,crooksandliars.com,Frances Langum,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/chicago-elects-first-gay-and-first-0,"By Frances Langum
Old Man Daley must be rolling over in his grave. His machine lost last night. Chicago Tribune:
Lori Lightfoot won a resounding victory Tuesday night to become both the first African-American woman and openly gay person elected mayor of Chicago, dealing a stinging defeat to a political establishment that has reigned over City Hall for decades.
After waging a campaign focused on upending the vaunted Chicago political machine, Lightfoot dismantled one of its major cogs by dispatching Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, whose candidacy had been hobbled in part by an anti-incumbent mood among voters and an ongoing federal corruption investigation at City Hall.
Lightfoot’s campaign, which started last May as a long-shot bid to replace the city’s clouted politics with inclusive change, took the former federal prosecutor and first-time candidate from toiling in relative political obscurity to toppling the head of the Cook County Democratic Party. History was made tonight in Chicago. Lori Lightfoot will replace Rahm Emanuel as the city’s mayor following a runoff election, making her Chicago’s first openly gay mayor AND the first Black woman to hold the position. https://t.co/It7ImRdfdT

Monrovia – Salieu Jalloh is now serving his three years prison term at the Monrovia Central Prison for killing a friend identified as Alpha Jalloh on November 26, 2018, in the township of West Point. Report by Augustine T. Tweh-00231775524647 / [email protected]
He was sentenced by Criminal Court ‘A’ Judge Roosevelt Z. Willie on Tuesday, April 2, 2019.
“This court says that predicated upon the facts that the defendant has admitted to killing the deceased but out of provocation and mistake, and also in view of the fact that the prosecution has interposed no objection; this court will indeed exercise justice with mercy,” Judge Willie said.
“Accordingly, while the maximum sentence for manslaughter under our law is five years, the court hereby sentenced the defendant to three years imprisonment which began effectively April 2, 2019”.
After the judge ruling, Convict Jallon was seen in the dock (A confined place for a prisoner in court) in a confused mood with tears rolling down his cheek.
According to the ruling, Salieu Jalloh was charged with the crime of murder when the case was first called for trial.
But during the reading of the indictment, defendant Jalloh then pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter instead of murder, on grounds that the victim’s (Alpha Jalloh) death was caused by mistake.
The ruling further states that during the trial, convict Jalloh admitted killing the victim mistakenly and prayed the court to exercise justice with mercy in sentencing him.
According to Judge Willie, state prosecutors interposed no objection to convict Jalloh’s pleads for mercy and manslaughter, allowing him to rendered justice with mercy.
“In view, this court says that predicted upon the facts that the defendant has admitted to killing the deceased but out of provocation and mistake, and also in view of the fact the prosecution has interposed no objection; this court will indeed exercise justice with mercy,” an excerpt of the ruling.
Jalloh was indicted by the grand jurors of Montserrado County in November 2018 in the township of West Point, Montserrado County.
According to the indictment, at about 9:00 PM on November 26, 2018, the deceased and his brother Amandou Jalloh were boiling Hatai (Attai) when the defendant choked the deceased, causing him to suffocate.
The indictment further added that prior to the incident, defendant Jalloh had suspected and openly accused the victim of having an affair (love) with his wife.
According to the indictment, “The incident which led to the demise of the deceased was initiated by the defendant, when he began choking the deceased which resulted into the intervention of the deceased brother who used force to have the deceased released from the grip of the defendant; who had refused every attempt by neighbors to have him (defendant) release the deceased.
“That this act angered the defendant who reverted to taking a knife and pursuing the deceased brother who absconded the scene, thereby causing the defendant to revert to attacking the deceased with a black knife.
“The defendant knowingly, purposely, intentional willfully and maliciously attacked and stabbed the victim in his chest, causing him to bleed profusely. The victim was rushed to the JFK Hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival”. Post Views: 2"

He said such a study should lead to the formulation of “Medical and Commercial Marijuana Regulations (or the Marijuana Act)” which will lay the framework for the industrialization of the plant for medical purpose.
Meanwhile, another Liberian who has been using a medication made of Marijuana, says approving the usage of it in Liberia would save more lives.
Momou Dorley says he is suffering from perennial genetic and nerve ailments and have had two cervical spinal surgeries and several other minor surgeries.
“I am suffering from chronic undiagnosed pain in my lower extremities and feel stiffness in my left pelvic and hip. In fact am unable to freely move my left leg,” Dorley said of his medical condition.
“It was in 2016, while in Germany, my pain went through the roof and I began scouring the internet. There, I came across a certain medicine, (name I cannot recall).
“However, I googled the active components of the medicine and one of those components was hemp. I never knew what hemp was before then. After my googled research, I learned that hemp, cannabis and marijuana were the same family.”
Two days later, when he begun using the medication, his pain was relieved and Dorley has since used it as a treatment for his medical condition.
Now, he too has added his voice to the many Liberians calling for the use of Marijuana for medical purpose, which he says will also create economic benefits for the country.
“The government can follow suit as it is being done elsewhere by licensing Marijuana and other drugs. This will make drug available through doctor or legal sale agents. The government will also gain revenue by taxing drugs and putting those funds to not only stimulating economic growth but rehabilitating drugs users,” he said. Post Views: 1,533"
Liberia: Weah-Led Government Hires Trump Operative as DC Lobbyist FrontPageAfrica,frontpageafricaonline.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/uncategorized/liberia-weah-led-government-hires-trump-operative-as-dc-lobbyist/,"Liberia: Mixed Emotions Swirl In Mandingo Community Amid… Apr 2, 2019
The signing of Mendes has likely brought to an end the Weah administration ties to Riva Levinson, who lobbied in a similar role for former President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf for the last twelve years. Levinson, credited for being the engine behind ex-president Sirleaf’s international public relations, branding and global marketing propaganda, found her way back into Liberia’s politics – shortly after Weah won the presidency in2017.
Last September, FrontPageAfrica Document obtained and published documents showing the Weah’s administration had hired KRL International LLC, a Washington DC-based communications and government relations firm that focuses on the world’s emerging markets.
That deal between the government and KRL International was consummated on August 22, 2018 and signed on behalf of the government by Foreign Minister Gbehzohngar Milton Findley while Jeffery Haymaker, the Chief Financial Officer, signed on behalf of his firm.
In signing Menges, the Weah administration is hoping to get a strong window to President Trump, who President Weah has been trying to meet since winning the presidency.
The United States of America and Liberia have a longstanding historical relationship dating back to founding of Liberia. At least eight of its former presidents were born in the United States of America. The capital, Monrovia, was named after the fifth U.S. President James Monroe and so are many of its cities or townships which are named after places in the United States. Moreover, the United States has been Liberia’s largest source of donor support over the years.
Levinson was one of the quiet drivers in Liberia’s progress during her regime. In an interview with Forbes in 2016, Levinson revealed how she first encountered Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Her relationship with Pres. Sirleaf is dated back to July 1996 when she was working at the United Nations, waiting for the political space to open up so she could return home.
Former President Sirleaf never had a better image in her home country, but was internationally acclaimed, wining several international awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 just few months to that year’s presidential election.
As an opposition, Weah’s Congress for Democratic Change took Sirleaf for spending in 2014, more than US$200 million in lobbying fees to foreign firms in the United States. Despite refuting those allegations and informing the House of Representatives that it was “preposterous” for anyone to believe that her government could spend such an amount, the lobbying tag left a stain on Sirleaf’s legacy.
Sirleaf did state that only Levinson’s KRL lobbied on behalf of Liberia from 2007 to 2013 and was paid a total of a little over $368,000.
Political observers say, ditching Levinson for Menges is a sign that Weah, who received a lot of support from the former President Sirleaf may be signaling a full disengagement from the Sirleaf administration, especially in the wake of the recent embarrassing arrest of her son, Charles Sirleaf, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia linked to the probe of the missing LD16 Billion scandal.

Speaking to the male students Mrs. Grants urged them not to do harmful drugs but to be focus on their education which will make them leaders tomorrow.
She challenge the students to be satisfied with whatever their parents give them because it they are not they will get it the wrong way which will harm them.
Also at speaking at the program the executive director of the Liberians Against Drugs Abuse, Eugene David encourage the kids to go out in their community and not stigmatize their friends who are drugs users.
“We need to start educating the kids from home how harmful drugs are dangerous to their body and society,” David said.
According to him, when people are educated they make better decision, so education about substance abuse is better them stigmatization.
The advocate against drugs in Liberia disclosed that 90% of youth that take in drugs become nothing in life something he said is not good for the country because the country depends on the future generation.
He said it is time for schools to own super Friday by having activities for students outside of their normal academic study.
“For you to not to be like those disadvantage youth you need to stay away from bad friends.” “I have come to tell you to be very much focus on positive things, education on substance abuse is not about age or religious you must go out and educate others on things you learn from here today,” Eugene said.

"Liberia: Reps. Younquoi, Howard Join Opposite Alternative National Congress FrontPageAfrica",frontpageafricaonline.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/politics/liberia-reps-younquoi-howard-join-opposite-alternative-national-congress/,"Liberians Condemn Ex-Rebels’ Threats against Rep.… Apr 18, 2019
Monrovia – The membership of the opposition Alternative National Congress (ANC) got a big boost over the weekend when Representatives Larry Younquoi (Nimba, District #8) and Beyan Howard (Lofa, District #5) joined their ranks. Report by Gerald C. Koinyeneh 00231880881540 / 00231777769531 / [email protected]
At an elaborate ceremony on Friday, March 29, the lawmakers said they were joining the ANC because the party is the “best option for the upliftment of the Liberian people.”
According to Rep. Youngquoi, his decision to join the ANC is taken at a ‘very critical time’ of the nation’s history where it is going through political and economic uncertainties.
“It (his defection to ANC) is happening at a time when there’s alignment and realignment of political actors all over in our country for the sake of finding the appropriate solution to our political problems. It is happening at a time the entire country is almost being overwhelmed by fear, economic hardship, political marginalization and an attempt to create a one-party state,” he said. Rep. Larry Younquoi, House’s Committee Chair on Elections and Good Governance announcing his membership of the Alternative National Congress (ANC) at the party’s headquarters in Monrovia
The defection of Rep. Younquoi from the ruling Unity Party to the ANC come at a time the opposition blog is joining forces to ‘hold the CDC government’s feet to the fire.’
But Rep. Younquoi said although his decision to join the ANC effectively terminate his membership from the former ruling Party (UP), the opposition has not lost anything as his move offers him the greater opportunity to work harder and strengthen the opposition blog.
Said Rep. Younquoi: “I wish to admonish the public not to speculate a lot into my decision today. The opposition has not lost anything by my action, given that I am moving within the opposition. If it is anything, my move strengthens the opposition and, hence our democracy. The only difference is ANC offers me the opportunity to work harder and broaden my participation in the political process of our land.”
Speaking earlier, Rep. Howard noted that he joined the ANC because of the exemplary leadership role of the ANC political leader, Alexander Cummings and his (Cummings) vision of building Liberia and improving the lives of his fellow compatriots. Cllr. Beyan Howard, Representative, (Independent, Lofa Disrict #5) declaring his membership to the ANC at the Party’s headquarters
“We found a good home and all of the goodies are found in the first partisan. We can assure you that we are not going to disappoint you,” the Lofa County lawmaker said.
The party’s officials including its Standard Bearer, Alexander Cunnings, and Vice Standard bearer, Jeremiah Sulunteh as well as the party’s Chairman, Lafayatte Gould were on hand to receive their new members.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Cummings thanked the two lawmakers for the bold step taken and expressed hope that the coming in of Reps. Younquoi and Howard will pave the way for more lawmakers to join the party.
He attributed the ANC to a bowl of rice, stating: “We will try to grow this board of rice and make it big for everyone to eat. In the ANC, we will work together. We will debate the issue and move forward. The mantra of the ANC is put Liberia first and we are committed to travelling length and breadth of this country with our message. With the joining of Hon. Younquoi and Hon. Howard, we will get other Legislature on our side,” he averred.
Cummings was speaking as the result was being announced as the result of the impeachment vote was being announced. He declared that the decision to impeach Ja’neh was a misstep and a shame to the Legislature.
He then stressed that the ANC will field candidates in the 2020 Senatorial election against senators who voted to impeach the Supreme Court Justice. “If the Senate impeaches Ja’neh, then shame on them. It will show a lack of change; we Liberians deserve better,” he said. Post Views: 1,976"
Liberia: Civil Society Groups Worried About Hyperinflation Amid Declining Economy FrontPageAfrica,frontpageafricaonline.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/politics/liberia-civil-society-groups-worried-about-hyperinflation-amid-declining-economy/,"Liberia: Jobs, Revenue Delayed as Company to Transport Iron… Apr 16, 2019
Monrovia – Leading civil society organizations in Liberia have called on President George Manneh Weah to address the “many emerging national issues that have the propensity of derail political and economic gains made over the past 13 years.” Report by Gerald C. Koinyeneh – 00231880881540 / 00231777769531/ [email protected]
The civil society groups including the Center for Transparency and Accountability (CENTAL), Institute for Research and Democratic Development (IREED) and the National Youth Movement for Transparent Elections (NAYMOTE), in a joint press statement issued on Tuesday, April 2 stated that these concerns range from the management of the Liberian economy, respect for the rule of law and the constitution and limited political will to robustly fight corruption.
In addition, they cited the “dwindling of civic space” for citizens’ participation in the democratic process and freedom of the press and of expression as some of the issues that need to be addressed by the Weah’s administration.
State of the Liberian Economy
On the state of the economy, the groups noted that they are keenly following with dismay the deteriorating rate at which the Liberian economy has weakened over the past 13 months.
They cited the exchange rate between the Liberian Dollars and the United States Dollars and says it is ‘scarily’ plummeting, while the costs of basic commodities have doubled over the last 12 months despite the government’s decision to reduce tariffs on 2,000 commodities in May 2018.
“With the pace at which things are proceeding, if pragmatic steps are not taken by the government to salvage the economy, we are afraid that we would be heading down the slope of hyperinflation,” the civil society groups warned in the statement read by the Executive Director of CENTAL, Anderson Miamen.
According to the groups, the declining economic situation is making life unbearable for many, especially ordinary Liberians and rural dwellers, many of whom are without jobs and better livelihood opportunities.
They say the short term measure undertaken by the CDC-led government including the “US$25 million mop-up exercise” has not worked, thus leading to the perpetuation of the problems.
On the other hand, they noted that the Liberian Legislature seems to be dragging its feet in providing the necessary administrative oversight in helping to resuscitate the economy and improve the governance landscape and called on the government and international community to support a national conference to come up with a solution to salvage the economy.
State of Corruption
The group commended the government for establishing a committee to investigate a number of corruption allegations and scandals including the National Housing Authority’s corruption saga involving its Managing Director Duanah Siryon and principal deputies who are facing prosecution over an alleged bribery act.
They also lauded the government for sanctioning the investigation of the L$16 billion alleged missing money scandal and the establishment of the Concession Review Committee to review all existing concessions from the previous government.
But the groups noted that “While we applaud the government for these steps, we are extremely disappointed in the slow pace at which these investigations are proceeding.”
The group record that in February 2018, President Weah ordered the review of all concessions entered into by the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s administration.
More than one year since the committee was constituted, the group said it is yet to make public its findings or update the public about the status of the review exercise.
Additionally, in April 2018, they noted that the President ordered an investigation of Exxon Mobil fraudulent acquisition of oil block 13, but till date, the outcome of that investigation has not been made public.
According to them, this is compounded by limited political will to comprehensively audit the past administration and prosecute those who allegedly misapplied public resources as well enforce existing laws and policies, including the Code of Conduct for Public Officials, part 10 of which provides for officials who make decisions after contracting, tendering or procurement, and issuance of licenses of various types to declare their assets, incomes and liabilities before taking office.
Provision of Basic Social Services
The CSOs say they are monitoring efforts across the country and have uncovered rapid decline in the provision of basic social services, particularly health.
They furthered that evidence shows that conditions at health centers are extremely alarming.
“In all of the 15 political sub-divisions, there is a complete breakdown of health service delivery: there are no essential drugs and supplies at health facilities as well as fuel to run generators at health centers and county administrations,” the groups explained.
They CSOs say this is putting Liberians at risk and exposing the vulnerability of the health system to preventable disease outbreaks including Ebola; something that may lead to worsening of the already high maternal mortality of 1072.
commenting on the rule of law and the constitution, the civil society organizations claimed that there is an apparent resurgence of lawlessness and disrespect for the rule of law and institutions of governance.
The groups condemned the increasing waves of mob violence and other crimes against free speech.
They made reference to several instances of mob violence and other crimes against free speech including the Montserrado County District #13 electoral violence, which they said the authorities are yet to release the report, terming it as troubling.
In addition, they named the attack on Root FM, the investigation of alleged vandalism and firing at District #10, Montserrado County involving Rep. Yekeh Kolubah, mob violence in Glahn Town, Gbi-Doru District, Nimba County that led to the death of two persons.
They also mentioned mob violence in Ganta, Nimba County in March 2019 that also led to two deaths and the increase in the report of rape cases and violence against women, the recent burning down of Weala Police station and Magisterial Court in Margibi County.
Recommendations
In the statement signed by Harold Marvin Aidoo, IREED Executive Director, Eddie D. Jarwolo, NAYMOTE’s Executive Director and Anderson Miamen, Executive Director of CENTAL, the CSOs called on President Weah to take leadership in the fight against corruption.
They also called for the Weah-led government to conduct a comprehensive audit of the past administration and a timely completion of all ongoing investigations the current government has launched.
In addition, they called on the Liberian leader, the Legislature and the government at large to ensure the respect for the rule of law and the constitution of Liberia.
“We call on the government to invest and build the capacity of LRA (Liberia Revenue Authority) to enhance the country’s domestic resource mobilization.
“We also call on the Liberia National Police to be proactive and more efficient in the discharge of their duties. We call on all citizens, especially young people to stop the use of violence as a means of seeking redress and rather use constitutionally established channels for grievance redress.” Post Views: 844"

Upon returning home, the child’s temp had gone down and he appeared to be feeling better.

The House Judiciary Committee just completed a vote that authorized its chairman to use a subpoena to force the Justice Department to give Congress a full copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report and all of his underlying evidence. BREAKING: The House Judiciary Committee votes to authorize a subpoena of the full Mueller report, setting up a clash between Congress and President Trump https://t.co/ppQmewO8pJ pic.twitter.com/y5fxkgyMq1
The committee chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, said he would not issue the subpoena right away, however.
The party-line vote won by Democrats who control the committee will increase the pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr as he decides how much of the Mueller report to share with Congress.
“I will give him time to change his mind,” Mr. Nadler said in his opening statement. “But if we cannot reach an accommodation, then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials.”
The Judiciary Committee also gave its approval for subpoenas to five former White House employees. Democrats said these people were all relevant to their ongoing investigation into possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power and corruption within the Donald Trump administration.
The five employees are: Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist; Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director; Reince Priebus, the president’s first chief of staff; and Annie Donaldson, a deputy of Mr. McGahn.
Barr wrote a letter to Rep. Nadler and other congressional leaders last week saying that he would give Congress a redacted version of the Mueller report by mid-April and would not share it with the White House before then.
Barr also said that Justice Department officials, working with the special counsel’s office, were “scrubbing” the Mueller report of four categories of information that must be redacted : classified material, secret grand jury testimony, details pertinent to ongoing law enforcement investigations and statements “that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.”
Barr missed a House-imposed deadline of yesterday to turn over the nearly 400-page report.
This is a developing story and will be updated."
Virginia’s community colleges expect fewer 18-year-olds to enroll by 2026. What happens after that?,www.virginiamercury.com,Mechelle Hankerson,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/02/virginias-community-colleges-expect-fewer-18-year-olds-to-enroll-by-2026-what-happens-after-that/,"Email Germanna Community College held it's Nursing and Health Technologies Convocation in 2014. Nursing and other health programs continue to be a popular choice for students at the school near Fredericksburg. (Creative Commons, Robert A. Martin via Wikimedia)
By 2026, Virginia Community College Chancellor Glenn DuBois thinks colleges will be competing so hard for students, it will feel like “The Hunger Games.”
“Beginning in 2026, we will see a decline in the traditional college-aged student that is more dramatic than we’ve ever seen before,” DuBois said in a 2018 address to community college leaders.
Last year was the seventh straight year of enrollment decline for the Virginia Community College system.
System-wide, the Virginia Community College System lost about two percent of its students between 2013 and 2018, according to data from the State Council for Higher Education of Virginia.
In some places, enrollment has crept back up after dipping down. In others, including the largest colleges in the 23-school system, enrollment continues to drop.
To keep seats filled and state funding coming — community colleges get state money based on enrollment numbers — DuBois wants to change the type of student that considers attending a community college.
He wants adult students older than 25 to see the system’s fast-track career certification and skills programs as a way out of dead-end and low-paying jobs.
“While serving 18-year-olds remains an important part of what community colleges do, it probably won’t be the most important thing we do,” DuBois said in his 2018 remarks. “The need for higher education is strong and growing, but its traditions are fleeting.”
System leaders are also anticipating a smaller pool of students in the future, thanks to the country’s shrinking birthrate.
There were 4.2 million births among women aged 15–44 (what the government considers childbearing age) in 2000, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
In 2008 — the year 18-year-olds who enroll in college in 2026 would have been born — the number of births was at 4 million.
Births continue to fall, according to the most recent report on birth rates . In 2017, 3.86 million births were registered in the United States, down two percent from 2016.
Southside Community College, based in Alberta between South Hill and Emporia, has lost 2,354 students since 2013.
J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College in the Richmond area has lost the largest number of students: 3,717 since 2013. It’s also one of a handful of colleges that have started to reverse the trend.
Germanna Community College in the Fredericksburg area has seen a considerable increase in its enrollment numbers, said Jan Gullickson, the college’s president.
In 2013, the college had about 7,300 students. Enrollment dipped to 6,600 students last year but bounced back up to about 7,200 this school year.
“We’re in a very desirable geographic area,” Gullickson said of the school’s rebound. “Many community colleges across the country have lost enrollment because many of them are dispersed throughout states.”
She also said the college made some common-sense changes, like getting departments to work together to create better class schedules, streamlining enrollment and financial aid processes and hiring more student advisers.
“I think everyone here at Germanna … all know enrollment’s their business,” Gullickson said.
When enrollment drops, colleges often have to lay off staff, which Gullickson did when she started at Germanna. Most recently, Tidewater Community College in Hampton Roads , one of the state’s largest community colleges, also had to lay off staff because of declining enrollment.
“It’s ugly,” Gullickson said of campuses struggling with fewer students. “In Virginia, enrollment is king. You have to have enrollment to have money in Virginia.” President Barack Obama tours the Automotive Training Program at the Northern Virginia Community College, Alexandria Campus, before delivering remarks on June 8, 2011 in Alexandria, Virginia.

At the community colleges where enrollment has managed to recover, students can often enroll in niche programs that funnel them into a career.
Community colleges have an inverse relationship with the economy: When things are good, community colleges struggle to get students. When there’s a downturn, community colleges thrive as people go back to train for new or more stable careers quickly.
DuBois said he thinks the key to increasing enrollment even when the economy is in an upswing will be older adults who lack mobility in their current jobs and feel pressure to make more money.
“They’re in low-paying jobs and not making enough money, they have car payments, they have rent, they have kids, they simply want a better opportunity but the traditional college menu doesn’t sync up,” he said. “It’s not an appropriate opportunity for them because they can’t give three or four years or even two, but they may have a few weeks or a semester.”
“Not all of these people live below Virginia’s poverty line. Some are just barely above it, making them harder to see, understand and serve.”
At Patrick Henry Community College in Martinsville, a popular welding program has also drawn in enough students that there’s a waiting list and a new building with space for those students should open in the next two years, said Randy Ferguson, the college’s spokesperson.
At Germanna, Gullickson said the school’s asphalt technician program is a popular choice among students, as is information technology and cybersecurity.
“It’s a big win-win,” DuBois said of community colleges’ programs. “Employers are screaming for these people.”"
Rappahannock Sierra Club: Support the Spotsylvania solar farm,www.virginiamercury.com,Guest Column,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/02/rappahannock-sierra-club-support-the-spotsylvania-solar-farm/,"A massive proposed solar development on this timberland property in Spotylsvania County has drawn major opposition from locals. (Sarah Vogelsong/ For the Virginia Mercury)
By Richard Eggeling and Bill Johnson
The Rappahannock Group of the Sierra Club has taken awhile in arriving at our position on sPower’s proposed Spotsylvania solar farm because we wanted to complete our own analysis of the issues.
On the one hand, it is critical that we stop spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to slow down global warming. On the other hand, the destruction of natural habitats, potential pollution of streams and waterways, potential increased fire hazard, etc., are valid concerns. When considering all these variables, RGSC strongly supports the solar farm for the following reasons.
The proposed site has been continuously logged for many years, an industrial activity that has already resulted in the degradation of wildlife habitat, sediment runoff into streams and rivers and increased chances of large-scale fires. These are the very objections opponents raised about the solar farm, with this exception — timbering is a continuous industrial activity, while the solar panel installation is one-time. Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality will monitor implementation to ensure that all regulations are followed.
Many of the opponents’ claims ring hollow. The roads around the site are continuously used by heavy logging trucks. So why are these same roads an issue when one-time, solar farm construction is involved? Chainsaws and noisy heavy equipment are regularly used during timbering season, so why are vibratory drivers used only during solar farm construction a concern? They produce half the noise when no closer than 175 yards from any home.
Wildfires during droughts are fueled by undergrowth and timber debris, like woodchips, stumps, unusable logs and branches. Solar panels are made from inflammable materials, with electrical current overload and short-circuit protection, built within a controlled and carefully managed landscape. Why would anyone consider that a greater fire hazard?
The use of biosolids to encourage faster forest regrowth, sometimes used for timber operations, results in spreading all sorts of toxic ingredients into the environment, including household chemicals and drugs. That is significantly worse for the environment and the people living nearby than the threat that cadmium telluride will pollute the land and groundwater. There has been no evidence of this happening in 20 years of such solar panel installations, including sites hit by hurricanes and tornadoes.
Opponents claim that the economic impact will result in the county losing millions of dollars in tax revenue and homes nearby losing value. It is pure conjecture to say that taxes would go down, based on “what if” speculation about possible land uses. Further, the county will have significantly lower future expenses without having to pay for new schools, roads and other infrastructure projects that would be required if a housing development was built.
In fact, the county will see an immediate, predictable long-term increase in revenue, and the residents of Fawn Lake will see improved housing values, as sPower pays half the cost of replacing obsolete water lines. A housing development would make permanent any wildlife habitat loss and increase environmental damage.
Decommissioning worries seem to be a major concern, but they don’t reflect reality. sPower is buying the land, not leasing it. Why would any for-profit company invest in the land, build a solar farm, and then walk away from it? They would not; instead, they would continually upgrade the site and keep it functioning into perpetuity, to keep profits coming.
Instead of wearing red or green to clearly separate sides, each should raise legitimate issues, work through them, and arrive at an acceptable compromise. It doesn’t take long to realize that no matter how many issues are raised, some people will continuously advance new issues that can never be satisfied. As a community, state, and nation, we all should be aware by now that renewable energy offers the cleanest and least expensive source for power generation. We must try to understand the mechanics of these systems and not be afraid of something new.
The long-term repercussions if we fail to deploy them are onerous, as is shown by the fourth annual National Climate Assessment report, issued by 13 U.S. government agencies. We need to do this for our children and grandchildren to mitigate the harm we have already caused by releasing far too many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Va. pipelines set off ‘an alarm bell’ for skeptical energy regulator,www.virginiamercury.com,Robin Bravender,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/01/va-pipelines-set-off-an-alarm-bell-for-skeptical-energy-regulator/,"Va. pipelines set off ‘an alarm bell’ for skeptical energy regulator By Workers began laying the Mountain Valley Pipeline in Roanoke County over the summer. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury) WASHINGTON — Most Americans have no idea who Cheryl LaFleur is. The wonkish attorney, a Massachusetts native and electricity expert, has spent nearly a decade as a commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a federal agency that regulates the transmission of oil, electricity and natural gas pipelines, among other responsibilities. It’s not often that she gets recognized in the supermarket. “I believe we have important jobs, but there’s a lot more famous people in this town,” LaFleur told the Virginia Mercury in a recent interview in her office a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. “It’s not like being a congressperson where every time you’re sitting and having a glass of wine with a friend, somebody might be snapping you on their iPhone. Being a FERC commissioner is definitely not like that.” Cheryl LaFleur, a FERC commissioner for nearly a decade, is stepping down this year after Democrats in the Senate declined to nominate her for another term. (Robin Bravender/ For the Virginia Mercury) But while she’s not one of Washington’s best-known policymakers, LaFleur, who is not being nominated for a new term, has been central figure in the battles playing out in Virginia and around the country over the necessity and environmental impacts of gas pipelines — behemoth infrastructure projects that can cost developers billions of dollars and that often ignite fierce opposition campaigns. “LaFleur has been an important voice in mobilizing the conversation for a comprehensive approach to analyzing climate impacts,” said Gillian Giannetti, a staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. LaFleur, appointed to the commission by President Barack Obama in 2010, made waves a couple of years ago when she split with her Republican colleagues over the approval of the controversial Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley natural gas pipelines, massive projects slated to run through Virginia. The GOP-led commission approved both pipelines, but LaFleur wrote in her Oct. 2017 dissent that she couldn’t conclude that either project was in the public interest. “I am particularly troubled by the approval of these projects because I believe that the records demonstrate that there may be alternative approaches that could provide significant environmental advantages over their construction as proposed,” she wrote at the time. That dissent marked a significant moment for LaFleur and for the commission, which has long been criticized as a rubber stamp for industry when it comes to approving interstate pipeline projects. “It was not an easy decision,” LaFleur told the Mercury. “I had been voting on pipelines for seven years before this came up. I had had dissents on cases before, infrequently.” But “this was unusual.” The decision “crystallized a lot of the issues that had been troubling me,” she said. FERC is supposed to weigh the public interest of constructing proposed pipelines, she said. But the fact that the two pipelines were proposing very similar routes was “an alarm bell in my mind. … Why do we need both of them?” LaFleur said the fact that the pipelines proposed to cross national parks, sinkhole-prone karst terrain and historic resources demanded more scrutiny.
“I just wanted to be sure they were both needed if we were going to approve both of them. So what I said was that I would not have approved both of them, I would have required them to work harder on the alternatives analysis to see whether they could co-locate more of the route,” she said. “But I used the dissent to talk about some other issues, such as how we assess need. If we assess need pipeline by pipeline, and then you had multiple pipelines in the same region and a very similar route. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline route. (Image via Protecthighland.org)
“These happened to be coming for a decision at the same time but you might accidentally overbuild if you’re kind of building one and then another and not looking at them in a more macro-basis.” ‘People were shocked’ LaFleur was in North Carolina — where the 600-mile underground Atlantic Coast Pipeline is planned to end — the weekend after her dissent came out. She saw coverage in the papers there and learned “some people were shocked” by her opposition. “I felt like we’ve actually been agonizing about these things all along, we’ve been talking about these things for a couple years,” she said. “So the fact that people didn’t think a FERC commissioner could ever say no was somewhat disappointing. But it was because we don’t say no very often, I do understand that.” Over 30 years, FERC only rejected two pipelines out of hundreds proposed, according to a 2017 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity and StateImpact Pennsylvania. The Mountain Valley Pipeline route. (via Roanoke County government) LaFleur declined to discuss internal deliberations on the commission, but she said “people might have been frustrated with me to come along this late in the game and say, ‘Hey, you should have had a common route,’ because maybe we should have said that before.” She added, “I understand that frustration, but at some point I had to feel like, if I’m going to take a stand, I have to start somewhere.” Since her lone dissent in late 2017, the two pipelines have been mired in legal battles, much of it playing out in the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court dealt a blow to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s lead developer, Dominion Energy, in December, when judges ruled that the U.S. Forest Service lacked the authority to allow the pipeline to cross the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. The Mountain Valley Pipeline is also facing legal challenges . “They’ve had all kinds of issues … in the 4th Circuit primarily,” LaFleur said. She thinks some of those court opinions validated her concerns about the pipelines. “The subsequent history, which, I am not so self-centered as to think had anything to do with my dissent, but the subsequent history in the courts and so forth has led me to believe I guess my instinct that this one was environmentally complicated might have been correct,” she said. LaFleur is credited more broadly with pushing FERC to change how it accounts for pipelines’ impacts on the environment, including on how the combustion of the natural gas that’s transported through those pipes and methane released from pipeline operations contributes to climate change. Her “dissents in Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast ignited and brought into focus a conversation that was long overdue about how FERC considers and incorporates upstream and downstream greenhouse gas emissions into their reviews,” said Giannetti of NRDC. ‘She’s not a bomb thrower’ LaFleur announced earlier this year that she’ll be retiring from the commission after the end of her term on June 30. Senate Democratic leaders declined to nominate her for a third five-year term. “I always knew it was up to others besides me,” she said. “I think the Democratic majority leader in the Senate [Chuck Schumer of New York] had a lot to do with it. I never thought I was entitled to a third term, although I think the issues are going to be interesting.” She declined to say what she might do next, but noted, “I want to stay involved in these issues in some way.” Mike McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who led President Trump’s Energy Department transition, said Senate Democrats appear to be “looking for somebody who’s a bit more confrontational” to fill LaFleur’s seat on the bipartisan five-person commission. LaFleur isn’t “a crazy-eyed environmentalist by any stretch of the imagination,” McKenna said. “Cheryl is very much a believer in FERC as an institution. In cases where she disagrees with either staff — which is occasionally — or other commissioners, she tends to be a fairly low-key person. She’s not a bomb thrower.” McKenna said he expects that “some variation” of the pipelines through Virginia will get built. “You’re pulling a lot of gas out of the ground in Pennsylvania, now Ohio, and that’s going to go places,” he said. It’s possible that the paths will be tweaked to satisfy court demands or that lawmakers will make legislative deals to boost their construction, McKenna added. Some opponents of the pipelines, meanwhile, aren’t as certain. “I think it’s difficult to handicap them with so many things outstanding,” said Giannetti. “We do hope that both [Gov. Ralph Northam] to the extent that he can and the courts take a real deep look at these pipelines, because NRDC is of the position that they are not needed to satisfy our energy needs.”"
"Virginia explained: Why Republicans keep pushing bare-bones, high deductible health plans and Northam keeps batting them down",www.virginiamercury.com,Katie O'Connor,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/01/virginia-explained-why-republicans-keep-pushing-bare-bones-high-deductible-health-plans-and-northam-keeps-batting-them-down/,"Creative Commons via Pixabay.
Editor’s note: First in an occasional series explaining Virginia’s policy debates.
A news release that Gov. Ralph Northam issued in late March couldn’t have come as much of a surprise to anyone. It mirrored another from last year , in which he explained why he vetoed a string of health care bills.
The arguments were the same: The bills “put Virginians at risk of being underinsured, result in rapidly increasing marketplace premiums and undermine key protections in the Affordable Care Act.”
During General Assembly committee hearings, Republican lawmakers’ also repeated prior year arguments: Health care is too expensive, and while the federal government fumbles for a solution, Virginia needs to do something to ease the burden for its residents.
At issue are bills that would expand access to short-term and catastrophic health plans. To Republicans, they present a reprieve from the high costs that many who don’t qualify for subsidies are facing on the individual market. To Democrats, they risk uprooting the market and leaving people on the hook for huge deductibles.
The political lines aren’t exactly stark in Virginia. Two of the bills were unanimously supported in the Senate, though the House was generally divided along party lines. But the back-and-forth tracks with the debate at the federal level as Republicans have tried to either repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act and the passionate divisions between the two parties on health care have become increasingly fierce.
But what are short-term and catastrophic plans, and why does one side see them as common sense solutions and the other label them as amplifying, rather than fixing, problems in the American health care system? Short-term plans
Short-term plans are traditionally considered coverage bridges for people switching between health insurers. They’re aimed at those who are between jobs, for example, or a college student who graduates in the spring but won’t start a new job until the fall.
But last year, the Trump administration issued a new rule that would allow states to expand short-term policies so people can remain on them up to a year, with renewals for up to 36 months.
They’re very cheap, but for a reason. They aren’t compliant with the Affordable Care Act, so they don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions, nor do they have to offer the ACA’s essential health benefits, such as maternity care, mental health care or prescription drug coverage.
Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, submitted bills for Virginia to expand access to short-term plans, one expanding the amount of time the coverage can last and the other that guarantees someone can purchase the plan again without re-underwriting. They were among those Northam vetoed.
During a House Commerce and Labor Committee meeting in February, Reeves told a story about a friend of his who doesn’t qualify for subsidies on the marketplace and he says pays more than $3,000 a month in premiums.
“We don’t have other options out there,” Reeves told the committee.
Both short-term and catastrophic plans bring with them fears of weakening the traditional, more comprehensive pools. In insurance, pooling is a way to ensure that the risks — like a major flood in the case of flood insurance, or massively expensive cancer treatment in health insurance — are spread across all the members of the pool.
“We know that if the problem is that insurance is too expensive, and you continue to drain healthy people out of the pool, then the only people left in the pool are going to be sick people, and the insurance premiums are going to go up even more, creating this death spiral in insurance lingo,” said Carolyn Engelhard, a health policy professor at the University of Virginia.
Some states, like California, Massachusetts and Oregon, among others, have prohibited the sale of short-term health insurance policies altogether if they don’t protect people with pre-existing conditions.
But consumers, some proponents of the plans argue, should know the risks. Short-term plans are required to have a prominent notice to consumers that reminds them to “check your policy carefully to make sure you are aware of any exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of preexisting conditions or health benefits,” according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . Catastrophic plans
Catastrophic plans are already offered in the ACA marketplace and are compliant with the health law’s requirements: They cover those with pre-existing conditions and must offer essential health benefits . In terms of the individual market’s metal tier system (platinum, gold, silver and bronze), these plans will make up a copper tier, meaning they’re at the bottom.
But access to them is limited. Currently they’re only available to those who are 30 years or younger and to people who have experienced a financial or other hardship. Legislation submitted this year and last year would have required the state to request a waiver from the federal government so that anyone would be eligible for the plans.
Like short-term insurance, catastrophic plans have cheaper premiums but the trade-off is a much higher deductible. Patients have to pay more for their services before their plan will pick up the tab, other than the three primary care visits guaranteed under the ACA. For 2019, the deductible for these plans is $7,900, according to healthcare.gov .
Freddy Mejia, a policy analyst with the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, pointed out that, if eligibility is broadened and more older, high-risk people sign up for catastrophic plans, they may not remain cheap.
The position against catastrophic plans is similar to those against their short-term counterparts. In his veto statement, Northam argued those plans fragment the individual market, as they attract otherwise healthy people who can afford to put off preventative care into the catastrophic plans, destabilizing the remaining risk pools.
He added that the plans leave people under-insured in much the same way that short-term plans do. Because they’re on the hook for such huge deductibles, many people will likely put off care, increasing the likelihood that their medical conditions could worsen — and get more expensive — without preventative care.
But lawmakers like Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, who sponsored the legislation (along with Del. Roxann Robinson , R-Chesterfield), adamantly disagree with that notion. He argues that more people are choosing to forego insurance altogether in light of how expensive it can be for those who don’t get subsidies. At least these health plans give them an option and ensure their pre-existing conditions are covered.
He also took issue with the suggestion that the plans would fragment the individual marketplace. Someone with catastrophic coverage would remain in the exchanges, he pointed out, rather than encouraging them to opt out of insurance altogether.
“This is a way to help bring people back in to that health insurance risk pool, make sure that more people are covered, and at the same time give them an affordable option,” he said. How to fix the marketplace
While big decisions about the individual market are largely made at the federal level, the states do have some options to address high premiums.
One is creating a reinsurance program, which some states are doing successfully. It essentially moderates premiums by helping to pay the costs of people with high medical bills so that companies can, in turn, lower premiums.
The Virginia Market Stability Work Group, which Northam convened last year to study ways the state can stabilize premiums on the individual market, published a report in December that identified reinsurance as one of the “most promising” options “to stabilize Virginia’s individual market.”
Like their Republican counterparts, Democrats have also pushed to address health care costs for patients. In addition to Northam’s work group, legislators this session proposed options like increasing transparency and strengthening the rules around minimum loss ratio , which requires insurers spend 80 percent on their premium revenues on health claims.
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, proposed a bill that would have required several types of coverage, like short-term and catastrophic plans, as well as association health plans and others, to provide preventative care, but it was defeated early in session on a party-line vote.
Until the state can agree to take a more drastic move to stabilize the individual market, though, legislators like Sturtevant will still try to do what they can to address high health care costs, he said.
“It’s a problem that still has not been solved,” he said. “Health care coverage has only gotten more expensive.”

What goes on in Poland on the 3rd of April. Buzek: It is hardly possible that Nord Stream 2 will be completed on time
– I rely on the strength of the European Commission and I would like the European Commission to have enough power to implement all legal solutions within the EU countries. However, there are doubts whether EC will be strictly obeying EU’s regulations concerning Nord Stream 2 pipeline, said Jerzy Buzek talking to journalists. He believes that It is hardly possible that Nord Stream 2 will be completed on time. The EU Gas directive
Buzek opines that the current gas directive contains all provisions which was expected in order to embrace all built by third countries piplines with EU law.
He stressed that Nord Stream 2 which is thrusting forward by Russians will be covered by EU regulations, including those concerning competitiveness.
– Of course, it will be less profitable for the pipeline’s investors and users, he added.
He also emphasized that rules of exploitation and connection of Nord Stream 2 will be determined by the intergovernmental agreement between Germany and Russia, and they will be strictly controlled by the European Commission.
Buzek added that gas directive will be applicable to Nord Stream 2, but also to other gas infrastructure passing through the territory of the European Union. According to Buzek the EC should strictly stick to the EU law.
– There should not be any doubt about it. The EC has to be restrictive both towards pipelines and other issues. I am afraid that it may not be so, although the European Commission has blocked recently the merger into one company Alstom and Siemens. This is very important especially if some people argue that we have the Franco-German alliance within the EU and that France and Germany are able to deal with all issues between themselves. Please note how much hype and dissatisfaction in Germany and France was triggered by the decision made by the European Commission. Let’s do everything we can to make sure that the EC is restrictive in every case, especially that we can see on the example mentioned above, it does not always work in favor of the Germans, he stated.
Referring to media reports about a possible agreement between Germany and France, regarding Berlin’s support for the controversial EU copyright directive (called ACTA 2 – editor’s note) in exchange for Paris’s support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, he stated that these issues have nothing to do with each other. Denmark can hold up the Nord Stream 2 project
Talking to journalist prof. Buzek also mentioned Denmark, which is waiting for the next application for the construction of Nord Stream 2. – It will be expensive for the project and its investors. We can see that gas directive poses problems for the Nord Stream 2, he said. Buzek estimates that the attitude of the Danes may hold up the Nord Stream 2 project. – It is hardly possible that the pipeline will be completed on time, he added. Related posts:"
Przybylski: Renewable energy is a great opportunity for Poland (INTERVIEW),biznesalert.com,admin5,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://biznesalert.com/przybylski-siemens-gamesa-poland-res/,"Energy Renewables 2 April, 2019 10:00 am Editorial staff Przybylski: Renewable energy is a great opportunity for Poland (INTERVIEW)
– The law has a direct impact on which projects can be implemented. Poland has a great opportunity to become a significant producer of green energy. Plans of liberalization of the so-called “Distance Law” are the right step and we should take advantage of this opportunity. From an ecological and economic perspective, renewable energy is an opportunity for us. We are a developing country and we should strive for sustainable development, said Paweł Przybylski, CEO of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy in Poland, in an interview with the BiznesAlert.pl.
BiznesAlert.pl: Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy has announced that it had received an order for delivery of 14 wind turbines in Poland. Is that the first such a large order received by your company in our country?
Paweł Przybylski: CEO of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy in Poland: Siemens Gamesa has been actively involved in Polish wind energy for 16 years. Currently, over 500 wind turbines are in operation in our country, with a total capacity exceeding 1 GW. My company has been operating on Polish market since 2003 and employs about 100 people. During this time, SGRE successfully completed over 50 investments in the Polish wind energy sector. Barwice is not the largest project which has been implemented so far, because the wind farm in Margonin, which has a capacity of 120 MW is even larger and actually the largest installation of that kind in Poland.
The wind turbins towers in Barwice will be constructed in Poland. How do you estimate the production potential of local producers of wind farm components?
We have a wide network of local suppliers in Poland. These companies meet the most stringent quality standards, and additionally have extensive experience in this type of production. Cooperation with many qualified and successful suppliers, not only in wind energy industry, but also in other branches, proves that Poland has a huge potential for development of the wind sector. Especially that wind and renewable energy sources are a dynamically developing industry with broad range of opportunities.
We can produce windmill’s masts in Poland, but we cannot yet make a turbine which is a windmill’s heart. When it will be possible to manufacture this domestically?
In fact, many turbine’s components are manufactured in Poland right now. We work with domestic suppliers of blades and electrical components, and parts coming from Poland are significant elements of several turbine models. In 2018 we allocated approximately EUR 150 million / PLN 600 million in total for orders from the wind sector, so that our suppliers cooperate with us on major projects.
Poland, but also other EU countries are racing against the clock to reach the target on renewable energy by 2020. Have you noticed an increase of orders in the last 1-2 years?
We have been witnessing recently the dynamic development of wind energy in a whole Europe. However, the onshore market and the offshore market are both developing in two different directions. The offshore generates huge investments, and countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and France are aiming to achieve large production capacities basing on it by 2030. The Great Britain also has ambitious plans. London decided to double its production capacity to 30 GW. Onshore largely depends on local regulations, and the shifting to energy auctions slows down its development on some markets. However we can notice, especially in the Nordic countries, as well as in the USA, that solutions such as corporate PPA contracts (Power Purchase Agreements) while purchasing electricity directly from renewable energy producers, can cause a strong onshore development, as they provide a certain a kind of bonus against the market price of energy, which the project developer receives from the corporate customer.
We can meet the opinion that wind onshore farms will lose their importance after 2030, and wind offshore farms will gain it instead. Is the cheapest source of energy, which experts say is currently the wind on land will lose its importance in 10-12 years’ time?
Technological development is progressing very quickly, we already see huge changes in technologies which include increasing of efficiency, in addition, the maintenance of turbines is increasingly more efficient, both on land and sea farms. I am convinced that the wind – and other renewable energy sources – will become more and more affordable, and positive investment examples will attract potential investors. At the end of the day, the future energy landscape will be – and must be – diversified, so that every source of energy will be needed and will take a specific perspective of development.
The Polish government announces the liberalization of the so-called “Distance Law”. Will it unblock the development of wind onshore farms?
Certainly the rules have a direct impact on which projects can be implemented. Poland has a great opportunity to become a significant producer of green energy. I think that the new law is the right step and we should take advantage of this opportunity. From an ecological and economic point of view, renewable energy is an opportunity for us. We are a developing country and we should strive for sustainable development.
Also Germany and France had problems with locating new wind onshore farms in 2017 and in 2018, because residents of nearby areas were protesting against them. Have you noticed a drop of orders in these countries?
The number of new wind onshore farms in Germany and France has dropped according to the data published by local onshore associations. As reported by the German Wind Energy Association (BWE), in 2018 were created almost 750 land turbines, what means a 55 percent decrease compared to the previous year. In France, number of installations fell from 1,692 MW in 2017 to 1,565 MW in 2018. However we do not refer to the situation in individual countries, so I would not like to discuss the development of wind energy too extensively. Certainly, the current situation on the European market is uneven.
According to the WindEurope, around 2027, the wind will be the basic source of electrical energy. However, it needs a support from other more stable source of energy. What kind of source could it be in Poland or Germany?
The future of energy from renewable sources will be large-scale energy storage. We developed a technology based on storage of energy as a heat closed in volcanic stones. This concept allows to store huge amounts of energy for many days or even weeks – for a low price and with low maintenance requirements.
Currently in Hamburg is being built a test facility which is directly connected to the network, and it will store up to 1.5 MWh. The next projects will reach the scale measured in GWh. If this concept works, and we are convinced that it does, it is very likely that it will contribute to a huge changes on the whole energy market.

Piotr Naimski who is a Polish Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy Infrastructure believes that Poland should build offshore and nuclear energy capacities to keep the current coal’s share in energy mix. Naimski gave a speech at the 4th Scientific Conference “Energy Security – Pillars and Development Perspective” under media patronage of BiznesAlert.pl.
– Wind is a future and offshore wind farms are stable source of energy and they will be built, because we need them to keep diversified energy mix in Poland, said Naimski.
He also referred to provisions of the Polish Energy Policy until 2040, saying that Poland needs zero emission energy sources, including offshore wind farms amongst others to maintain Polish energy sovereignty, which is based on domestic energy sources. – Apart of offshore, also the coal entirely comes from our country. Unfortunately, while the coal offers wealthy, it raises problems. If we want to keep coal’s share on energy market, we have to develop low carbon resources and cooperation with Denmark in this field is especially valuable for our country, stressed Naimski.
He also commented on possible construction of a nuclear power plant in Poland, saying that “this is a huge project and the government is working on it”. Baltic Pipe in Rzeszów. Lars Christian Lilleholt, Danish Minister of Energy and Climate was awarded the Ignacy Łukasiewicz’s prize.
The prize was awarded in energy security category for the natural gas diversification project in Europe, at the 4th Scientific Conference “Energy Security – Pillars and Development Perspective” under media patronage of BiznesAlert.pl.
Lilleholt was awarded for the Baltic Pipe project which Denmark is implementing together with Poland and Norway.
Thomas Rizk who is a Head of the Trade Department in Embassy of Denmark in Poland collected the award on behalf of Minister Lilleholt.
– I would like to thank to Ignacy Łukaszewicz’s Award Committee for recognizing the contribution of Minister Lars Christian Lilleholt and his team to cooperation with Poland, said Piotr Naimski, a Polish Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy Infrastructure.
– We have been in touch for 3 years with our colleagues in Copenhagen and accomplishing successfully the Baltic Pipe project would not have been possible if they had not understood us and had not cooperated with us on every stage of it. The success I am talking about let me say today, that the strategic project of connection Poland with natural gas sources located on Norwegian continental shelf under the Baltic Sea and through Denmark, is implemented accurate to within a week. If we are able to say so, being in a halfway of the project, it should be perceived as a success of people implementing it – said Naimski."

A sad spectacle (if true: it wouldn’t be the first hoax to hit the Internet).
I’m afraid it’s an illustration of how those more easily influenced by hearsay, claptrap, and poisonous rabble rousing can be led into dangerous areas of political extremism. I associate this kind of behaviour with Erdogan voters, AfD voters, and Trump fans.
Could it also be an illustration of the tendency of the more fascistoid personality types to think of (and ultimately resort to) violence? Posted on 4/3/19 | 1:29 PM CEST Jan Winter

Inbox zero and email nightmares: what behavioral science can teach us.,slate.com,Brigid Schulte,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/inbox-zero-email-nightmares-behavioral-science.html,"My Wife Cheated—and Let Him Do Something She’d Never Let Me Do The following article is a written adaptation of a recent episode of Better Life Lab, the podcast from New America and Slate about the art and science of living a full and healthy life. Find the show via Apple Podcasts , Overcast , Spotify , Stitcher , or Google Play . For me, July 23, 2007, is a date that lives in infamy. That’s when productivity wizard Merlin Mann took the stage at Google and gave an influential tech talk. He called it “ Inbox Zero. ” “The single practice that I think could really change your life starting today is to process to zero,” he said. “Process to zero every time you check your email. You never check your email without processing. A lot of people get really good at checking email and they don’t always get so good at doing anything about it.” It’s such an appealing idea, right? But for a while, “Inbox Zero” became an obsession for me, and I never get there. Actually, I got there once. I wrote a story about having 23,768 emails in my inbox that I did get down to zero . But I virtually didn’t do much else for about a week. Then, once it was cleared out, it quickly filled back up with about another 23,000 emails from everyone responding to all the emails I sent. It was crushing. So, 12 years after Mann’s dictum, I am still struggling. I realized I needed to confront my demons: I needed to have it out with Merlin Mann himself. He joined me on Better Life Lab , the podcast about work-life balance that I host for New America and Slate. I asked Mann about the idea of “Inbox Zero” as the ultimate Nirvana—this utopia that we all need to get to in this crazy-making world of constant email. I told him that, after I listened to his talk in 2007, I spent the entire night cleaning out my inbox, trying to get to “Inbox Zero.” When I finally looked up, I saw that it was 7 a.m. and it was time to start the day. But Mann said I was doing it all wrong. “Let’s not worry about ‘Inbox Zero’ so much, but let’s see what we can do to help you,” he says. “We can get you out of this situation and focused on the stuff you would really like to be doing. If you have time to check email, you have time to do something with that email. Otherwise, you shouldn’t even bother checking. A lot of times that’s deleting it, archiving it, it’s just not doing anything at all, it could be a short response, but I have to get it out of the way straight away. ‘Inbox Zero’ does not mean sit in your inbox all day and get rid of email—that’s quite the opposite of what I said, let alone intended.” Mann says that the whole concept of “Inbox Zero” has been “willfully misperceived” and that it’s actually some kind of fun joke now. “The truth of it is, the real zero is how much of your mind is on email,” he says. “I wouldn’t begin to say that’s a simple or easy problem to solve, but there are ways to do it. No matter what solution you come up with, it’s going to take a change of your own attitude, and then a very mindful attempt to [dedicate] yourself to having the life you want to have, rather than feeling led around by a bunch of bits and bytes on a computer.” I like that idea—it seems like Mann is talking about a shift to “Mindset Zero.” He argues that the real problem is that our inboxes have become a source of anxiety, and like with anything, whether that’s Slack messages, social media, a person, or the onslaught of information, we can’t let these things run our lives. “You would not put up with a cutlery drawer that sometimes had a wolverine in it, so how could you run your life out of something where, literally anybody can put anything in there?” he says. “If you carry around this mantle, this responsibility that you’re going to respond to every [email], you’re a crazy person.” At this point, Mann says he kind of regrets ever saying the phrase Inbox Zero . “All I wanted to do was help myself and help other people get their brains out of this idea that they had to be controlled by this thing,” he says. But email input is never-ending, and it can be crazy-making—it is the wolverine in the cutlery drawer that a lot of us are living with. Bain & Co. has looked at how knowledge workers use email and how they work. They found that between emails and meetings, the average middle manager spends only six hours a week on concentrated, important, meaningful work. I would argue that the wolverine is running roughshod over all of us. But Mann says it’s all about your viewpoint. “It’s a question of the expectations that you perceive, coming from other people, and the expectations that you have of yourself,” he says. “There’s no tip, trick, or life hack—anything that’s going to help you unless you get down to addressing how you look at this input in your life, and what you’re committed to doing about it.” He continues: “I think a lot of it is a reluctance to realize that you can’t do everything. Nobody likes to let other people down. Nobody likes to say no, nobody likes to be obdurate or tardy. It makes us feel bad, we feel bad about ourselves, we feel like we’re being disrespectful of others.” To get to “Inbox Zero,” many of us think that means responding to everything in the inbox. But in that, Mann says, we’re building the wrong expectations and setting the wrong priorities. “You’re saying to somebody, My time is so up for grabs that I’ll stop whatever I’m doing and take care of it,” he says, meaning giving more time and attention to what’s important to the sender, whether or not it’s important to me.“I think I responded to your emails pretty quickly, [Brigid]. You know why? Because I look at my email once and I’m done. I think I pretty quickly said, Let’s schedule this right now . We didn’t have 17 different exchanges about needing to go out and have a cup of coffee and talk about it. There’s action. That is a very practical approach, but it’s all underpinned by a philosophical difference in the way that you choose to look at any input in your life. I think that’s difficult for people, and especially difficult when you feel like you’re the only one having trouble holding up your end.” Mann insists we shouldn’t feel badly for not responding to email. But that’s a really human notion that the behavioral scientist Dan Ariely has discussed . He explains that it’s like when somebody taps you on the shoulder, what are you going to do? You’re not going to turn around? There’s something that feels very rude about ignoring all of that stuff in our inboxes. And yet, as Mann says, if you respond to everything, then you’ve just made everybody else’s priorities your agenda. “I think teams have an opportunity to greatly improve the culture of how they work together when they explore tools that are there to solve a problem, rather than just open the passage to its largest aperture,” Mann says. “There’s a reason your house has a door. You’re not a jerk for closing your door after six o’clock. You’re not a jerk to close your door at all—it’s your house.” It wasn’t always like this. Back when the internet first started, you had to physically be at a computer with a modem or a hardwired connection in order to communicate. “Basically, it was like going to Mass to go to your email—you went to email and you did the email and then you went back to your job,” Mann says. “There was absolutely zero expectation you’d be able to do anything about it right then. You used a fax for something important. That’s really changed.” Now, Mann argues that our email culture has become like the Wild West, where 25 people are copied on one message, and no one blinks an eye. “I have all kinds of thoughts on how to write a good subject line, how to write a good short email that will get action from people, or get a response from people,” he says. “What I don’t have is a solution for how to stop billions of strangers from having access to you in a way that you have no control over. Only you can decide how you are going to govern that.” But it’s not just about volume. Mann also concedes that, in many ways, email is about power. “I’ll touch the third rail here and say there’s also an element of privilege to this, which is that the ability to decide how you’re going to deal with email is almost a class issue in some ways,” he says. “It’s certainly at least a hierarchical issue.” He continues: “Over the years, I’ve become very interested in how culture works inside companies. I still really feel like, at best, the culture of your group is going to be defined by the most powerful people, and through two things: Basically, what they reward and what they tolerate.” Many leaders send after-hour emails because they tend to not only tolerate but reward people who seem to be working all the time. Yet research has found that the mere anticipation of an after-hours email from your supervisor or your boss can create more stress than actually getting that email. It puts everybody in a state of constant vigilance and anxiety. You can’t disconnect and enjoy the rest of your life. So now, more than a decade after he coined the term Inbox Zero , does Mann have any regrets? “It’s just it’s become such a millstone that this 12-year-old idea is something that I’m supposed to constantly redefend, even though people can’t be troubled to listen to what I was actually trying to offer,” he says. “ Inbox Zero does not mean you always keep your inbox empty. It means you’re an adult. You’ve got big boy or big girl pants, and you can make decisions on how you conduct yourself. Whatever your situation is, if you’ve accepted that input, that is something you have to take care of in a responsible way, if you have to spend eight hours a day doing email, then that’s your job now. I don’t know another way to slice it that’s more kind or honest, but the truth is, if that’s your job, then something’s got to change or you have to put on your résumé that you’re an email doer.” As Mann was telling me all this, I realized that some air bubbles were forming over my head—like in cartoons. Those little thought bubbles filled with ampersands and exclamation points and number signs. I just wanted to stop—to freeze our conversation. I wished I could have someone else there listening over my shoulder like a friendly genie. The voice I really wished I could hear belongs to Amy Westervelt, author of Forget “Having It All”: How America Messed Up Motherhood—and How to Fix It . She’s a busy freelance writer. She writes for the Guardian and the Wall Street Journal, and she just can’t afford to waste time on email. She says she loves Mann’s take on email and actually finds it funny. “I feel like he has all the same reasons for Inbox Zero that I have for Inbox 100,000, which is that you can’t let someone’s need to send you an email at 2 a.m. dictate how you’re going to structure your day,” she says. “I’m impressed with his ability to train people not to send him email. I feel like I have the same approach as him … but I have not successfully dissuaded people from continuing to send me lots of emails.” Westervelt says that while a shift to stop caring about email has led her to Inbox 100,000, it has also made her more productive. “I wrote a book and started a company in the same year, and, I swear to God, a big part of it is just not doing email,” she says. “I realize that a lot of people really do have to respond to particular types of people—if it’s a boss or whatever—and that I’m in a position where I mostly work for myself. Although, it also feels like I work for 100 different people. I feel like you set that precedent with people. I have a couple people that I interact with, for example, who only check their email at two particular times a day.” But Westervelt says that, like many of us, she just couldn’t check her email only two times a day. “I get sucked in too much,” she says. “Sometimes I just search my email, I don’t even look at the first page of the inbox because I don’t want to get dragged into something that is not on my list for the day.” A study published in the academic journal Computers in Human Behavior took a group of people and told them, for one week, to check their email three times a day, and for the following week, check it as many times as they wanted. What they found is that during the week when people limited their email checking, they were much less stressed out and much happier. I asked Westervelt how she deals with all of this. “I don’t open my email on my computer when I’m doing other work, and I leave my phone in the car if I’m doing an errand, otherwise, I will [check my email],” she says. “It’s very easy to just be in line waiting for something and see if anything’s come in. It’s not even just the time that it takes—it takes my focus away from the thing I was doing, and then it takes me another extra 10 minutes to regain that focus. It doesn’t really deliver any value for wreaking all that havoc on my day.” So in the end, whether it’s Inbox Zero or Inbox 100,000, the key is to think differently about email. The wolverine—endless emails, requests, the floor of information—will always be circling out there and ready to pounce. We just have to remember that our time and attention, our cutlery drawer, so to speak, are limited and precious. And it’s up to us to keep that damn wolverine out.

Capping THC concentration is a backdoor tax on patients,floridapolitics.com,Peter Schorsch,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://floridapolitics.com/archives/292544-capping-thc-concentration-is-a-backdoor-tax-on-patients,"Capping THC concentration is a backdoor tax on patients
It raises the cost of MMJ while forcing patients to smoke more. Share this: April 3, 2019 Capping the concentration of THC in whole-flower medical marijuana makes no sense. None whatsoever. For starters, the amount of THC someone ingests when smoking it is far more dependent on how many hits (or do they call it “tokes” if it’s medical?) someone takes. No matter what percentage cap is in place, a patient that takes three or four hits will put far more THC into their body than if they smoked the same cannabis but inhaled only once. But still, lawmakers are considering a 10 percent cap on the amount of THC in smokable MMJ. But perhaps more to the point, a patient can walk into any Florida’s dispensary — properly carded and with proper orders from a properly licensed medical marijuana doctor, of course — and purchase other products that are highly condensed. We’re talking THC concentrations as high as 80 percent. If that’s fully legal in Florida, why put limits on whole-flower? That’s not to say I don’t get where some folks are coming from. When The Lancet has a study , people pay attention. Sure. But that study is narrow. It references a small sample with a very narrow band of diseases that are suffered by a minute portion of medical marijuana patients. It’s simply not apples to apples. But, it seems the House just doesn’t like smokable weed and isn’t ready to give up the ghost. It’s time let it go, folks. Ben Pollara , who served as the campaign manager of the 2016 ballot initiative to legalize medical marijuana, noted the irony Tuesday, telling the New Service of Florida the proposal “basically acts as a tax on patients” by causing them to spend more money to “buy more marijuana to achieve the same effect as if the caps were not in place,” “The other irony is it would result in patients having to smoke more marijuana to achieve the desired effect,” he said. “If there’s two things the Florida House hates, it’s higher taxes and smokable marijuana, and this has the functional impact of doing both.” If the proponents of a cap on THC wanted to raise the cost of medical marijuana while forcing patients to smoke more, I guess a 10 percent cap is one way to do it.

Eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt competed against a tuk-tuk in the Peruvian capital Lima on Tuesday, and won.
The vehicle never stood a chance, as the aptly named Bolt jogged ahead of it at a leisurely pace.
The Jamaican athlete won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relays in the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games, although he later lost his gold in the 2008 relays after a team mate was disqualified for failing an anti-doping test.
Bolt, 32, retired after the 2017 World Athletics Championships in London.
He greeted the hundreds of cheering fans who turned out for the Lima event with his signature lightning bolt pose, saying: ""I didn't know there was going to be so much people, but I'm excited and it's awesome to see so much people coming out.""

FTC says it only has 40 employees overseeing privacy and data security | TheHill,thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/437133-ftc-says-it-only-has-40-employees-overseeing-privacy-and-data-security,"FTC says it only has 40 employees overseeing privacy and data security By Harper Neidig - 04/03/19 11:01 AM EDT
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Wednesday told Congress that it only has 40 full-time employees dedicated to overseeing internet privacy and data security and requested lawmakers give the agency more resources to adequately police tech companies.
FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, a Republican appointed by President Trump Donald John Trump Colbert mocks Trump for 'oranges' gaffe Dem wins Trump district in swing-state Pennsylvania Trump says health care plan will be first vote after 2020 election MORE , wrote in a letter to House leaders this week that the commission lags far behind other developed countries’ data watchdogs.

""For example, the U.K. Information Commissioners' office has about 500 employees, and the Irish Data Protection Commissioner has about 110 employees,” Simons wrote. “Although these entities have somewhat different mandates, the contrast is stark.
""The FTC, as the federal entity primarily responsible for protecting consumers' privacy and data security in the United States (a much larger jurisdiction), should have more employees devoted to this effort.""

Lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned about Silicon Valley’s handling of user privacy and the government’s ability to hold companies accountable for abusing or mishandling consumers’ data.
“It's shocking that a nation of over 320 million people only has 40 people dedicated to privacy and data security at the FTC,” the two Democrats said in a joint statement on Tuesday. “We are glad that the FTC recognizes that it needs more authority, more technical resources, and more people to address privacy and data security. We will look at giving the FTC more responsibilities in a comprehensive privacy law, but in the meantime we need to ensure that it has the resources necessary to effectively protect consumers.""
Pallone and Schakowsky had posited three different budget scenarios to Simons, asking what his agency would do with budget increases of $50 million, $75 million and $100 million.
The FTC chairman said that an additional $50 million would allow the agency to hire 160 new staffers, $75 million would get 260 and $100 million would get 360.
Simons said that the additional staff would allow the commission to bring more privacy cases. He said that the current 40 employees have averaged about 20 cases a year over the past five years."

""Operation carried out by the Azerbaijani Army with courage and heroism to liberate the occupied lands went down into our history with glorious and golden letters,"" Head of the Azerbaijani delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) Samad Seyidov said at the meeting of the Joint Working Group on Human Rights held in Milli Majlis.
He noted that Azerbaijan sent a message to the world through the April battles: ""We have once again given serious messages to both the world and forces that occupied our lands. We declared that our lands will be liberated from occupation. We proved by April war that occupiers will be removed from our land. We are proud of these battles. However, we also sadden, as the heroic sons of Azerbaijan were martyred during the operation. They sacrified their lives for the territorial integrity of our country and duly executed the order of Supreme Commander-in-Chief Ilham Aliyev. ""

""We are doing and will continue to do everything necessary for our army,"" President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Commander-in-Chief Ilham Aliyev said.
He made the remarks April 2 at the meeting with servicemen of a military unit of the Special Forces of the Defense Ministry.
“Today, Azerbaijan is one of the most powerful countries in the world in terms of army building,” he said.
“As I have already noted, according to the latest ratings, the Azerbaijani army is ranked in 52nd place in terms of its potential on a global scale,” he added. “The two military parades held last year demonstrated our military might. The most modern weapons and equipment are purchased for our army and its combat capability is increasing. The April battles are a good example of this. We are doing and will continue to do everything necessary for our army. Last year, a successful Nakhchivan operation was carried out. As a result of this operation, we have seized strategic heights. These heights allow us the opportunity to control a vast territory. The successful Nakhchivan operation showed that our army is professional and its combat capability is at a high level.”
All this is a reality, Ilham Aliyev said.
“Today, every citizen of Azerbaijan can be justly proud of the Azerbaijani army, and we are proud of our soldiers and officers,” he noted. “The Azerbaijani army is the main factor playing a role in the protection of the territorial integrity of our state.”

House Democrats took the first big step toward obtaining the full Mueller report as the Judiciary Committee voted 24-17 to subpoena the report.
Before the vote, chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler said, “This committee has a job to do. The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct. That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves — not the attorney general’s summary, not a substantially redacted synopsis, but the full report and the underlying evidence.”
Video of the vote: The fight is on. The House Judiciary Committee has voted 24-17 to subpoena the full Mueller report. pic.twitter.com/sltNKrdxch
— Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) April 3, 2019
The vote was a party line vote with zero Republicans voting to give the full report to the committee. Republicans are in full protection mode for this president. If the report exonerates Trump, the vote should have been unanimous to have it released in full. The fact that Republicans voted the way that they did suggests that they know that the report does not exonerate Trump.
The next step in the process is expected to be that the White House will ignore the subpoena and force the House of Representatives to sue them for the unedited report. The authorization of the subpoenas is the beginning, not the end of the process, but the quick action of the Judiciary Committee is proof that Democrats are wasting no time in their efforts to obtain the unedited Mueller report."

Like Libya and Syria, Venezuela is not “just about oil”. 29 pm
Yes, the latest research confirms that Venezuela is so rich in natural resources that it could single-handedly satisfy all global demand for oil for over 30 years. And it has much more than oil to offer, in its Orinoco basin and in other areas of the country.
But it is not all ‘about oil’; actually, far from it.
Those who believe that what propels the spread of Western terror all over the world, are just some ‘business interests’ and legendary Western greed, are, from my point of view, missing the point.
I noticed that such individuals and analysts actually believe that ‘capitalism is responsible for everything’, and that it creates the culture of violence of which, both victims and victimizers, already became hostages to.
After working in all corners of the world, I am now more and more convinced that capitalism is actually the result of Western culture , which is predominantly based on expansionism, exceptionalism and aggression. It is also constructed on a deeply rooted desire to control and to dictate. Financial/monetary greed is just a by-product of this culture which has elevated its superiority to something that could be defined as religious, or even religiously fundamentalist .
Or in other words : belief in its own superiority is actually now the main religion in both Europe and North America."
