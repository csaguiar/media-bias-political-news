"Dutch F-16 fighter jet SHOT ITSELF with cannon during drills, probe reveals",lunaticoutpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120651.html,"Post: #1 Dutch F-16 fighter jet SHOT ITSELF with cannon during drills, probe reveals

A Dutch F-16 fighter jet somehow managed to shoot itself with its own autocannon during a military exercise this year, local media reports, citing investigators. The military is still not sure how exactly the incident happened.
The F-16 jet suffered “considerable damage” after getting hit by a projectile – which turned out to be its own ammunition, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported this week. The bizarre incident occurred in January and has been under investigation ever since.
A pair of the US-made fighter jets were training together and shooting ground targets with their six-barrel Vulcan autocannons. One of the machines was damaged during the exercise, but landed safely afterwards. Its pilot walked away from the incident unharmed.
A photo released by the investigators to Dutch media shows an apparent bullet hole and a dent in the plane’s port side, right below the canopy. Fragments of the ammunition had also reportedly damaged the aircraft’s engine. It is not yet clear how many bullets hit the plane, but at least one definitely left the mark.
How exactly the aircraft managed to get hit by its own bullet remains a mystery and is the subject of a further investigation – which will take an unspecified amount of time.
“It is a serious case. Therefore, we want to find out what happened and how we can prevent this in future.” Safety Inspector-General Wim Bargerbos said.
While some aircraft have, indeed, scored ‘own-shots due to faulty missiles and improperly detatching bombs, catching an ‘own bullet’ mid-flight is nearly impossible. There’s been basically only one well-documented incident before, and that, too, involved a US-made plane.

The Israel Air Force, along with pilots from the United Arab Emirates and a number of other countries, is flying in Greek skies as part of Iniohos 2019, Greece’s largest military exercise.Pilots from the IAF are taking part in the drill, which started on Monday at the Andravida Base in the Peloponnese and will end on April 12, along with pilots from the UAE, United States, Italy, Cyprus, and almost the entire Hellenic Air Force fleet. “The objective of the exercise is to provide realistic operational training in conditions that resemble a complex, multi-threat combat environment to maximize the operational capabilities of the Air Force,” read a statement released by the HAF.According to reports, Iniohos 2019 will include F-16, F-35, F-4, M-2000, EMB-145H AEW&C, Tornado and Tanker aircraft. The HAF is flying six F-4E fighter jets, 32 F-16C/D jets and six M2000. Israel is participating with 12 F-16 C/D/Is, the Italians are flying with six Tornado ECR/IDSs, the Americans with 12 F-16 C/Ds and the United Arab Emirates are participating with six M2000-9s.As part of the drill, Israeli pilots took part in a formation of seven fighter jets consisting of F-35s, F-4, M-2000 and Tornado jets flying over central Athens last week, Greece’s Ekathimerini news site reported.According to the HAF website, the drill will see a range of missions including Offensive Counter Air Operations (OCA), Air Defense Operations (ADO), Counter Surface Force Operations (CSFO) including Air Power Contribution to Land Ops (APCLO) and Air Power Contribution to Maritime Ops (APCMO), RECCE missions, Combat Search and Rescue missions, Time Sensitive Target missions, Dynamic Targeting, High Value Airborne Asset missions and Slow Mover.“Given the high level of the HAF personnel and our capability to conduct exercises involving a variety of weapon systems within one of the largest exercise areas in Europe, the INIOCHOS exercise tends to become one of the most competitive exercises in Europe and the Mediterranean region, and provides participants with a high level of training and a unique experience of participation,” the HAF said.Israel maintains broad cooperation with the Greek Air Force and has participated in numerous military exercises of air, sea and ground forces with the Mediterranean country.While Israel has participated in the drill for several years, last year it did not appear on the exercise’s website as a participant – even though there were hints of Israel’s involvement in the patch worn by the pilots on their flight suits where the Israeli flag was visible.The drill this year will also see the participation for the first time of F-35 stealth fighter jets from the Italian Air Force.On Friday, Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, head of the Pentagon’s F-35 officer’s group, was quoted by Reuters as telling the US Congress that “future potential Foreign Military Sales customers include Singapore, Greece, Romania, Spain and Poland.”His comments came two days after Washington froze the delivery of F-35 jets to Turkey over Ankara’s plans to purchase the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system.

It will not only have to evacuate the communities around the Strip, but also [the cities of] Ashdod and Ashkelon and even Tel Aviv,” Yahya Sinwar told a group of Gaza officials. “Our fingers are on the trigger and they will remain pressed against it in order to protect our people. We will be the sword and shield,” Sinwar said, according to the Hamas-linked Al-Aqsa TV.
Sinwar also noted the role played by Egyptian mediators in negotiations to broker understandings between Israel and the terror group, saying the country “had a significant role in easing the siege imposed on Gaza, and we are grateful.” Both Israel and Egypt enforce a number of restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. Israel says the blockade is necessary to keep Hamas and other terror groups in the Strip from arming or building military infrastructure. An Islamist terror group, Hamas seeks to destroy Israel.

SNL Cold Open: Joe Biden Goes Through Sensitivity Training,crooksandliars.com,Nicole Belle,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/snl-cold-open-joe-biden-goes-through,"By Nicole Belle
SNL alumni Jason Sudeikis returns to reprise his role as Joe Biden, whose consultants have specifically hired someone to teach him how to not be such a huggy, touchy-feely kind of candidate in the post-MeToo age, with middling results. Like the real guy, SNL's Uncle Joe has a hard time wrapping his head around what is an appropriate kind of touch.
It's not surprising that the SNL writers would take a break from the non-stop Trump dumpster fire to tackle Biden, who has all but officially signaled that he plans to throw his hat in the ring for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. His anticipated candidacy has caused multiple women to come forward to speak to levels of discomfort of their interactions with Biden.
It's important to point out that none of the women have accused him of sexual assault or improprieties. And Biden is as demonstrative with men as he is with women. Biden has promised to be more mindful of those interactions, but this week, joked at a speech that he had ""permission"" to hug and touch two male participants .
It was those jokes that made many women upset, because too many times, women don't come forward, because they're afraid that they will be dismissed or laughed at or not taken seriously. Those jokes Biden made did all that and sent the message to these women that their fears are justified. “I appreciate his attempt to do better in the future, but to me this is not mainly about whether Joe Biden has adequate respect for personal space. It’s about women deserving equal respect in the workplace.” https://t.co/ex4MN15PdY
— Irin Carmon (@irin) April 4, 2019 The message that Joe Biden’s comments sent women and girls today was that if you set boundaries and speak out when you’re uncomfortable, men will turn it into a joke. https://t.co/pYb773IZi4
— Leah Greenberg (@Leahgreenb) April 5, 2019 So I guess we’re all just going to ignore the fact that the punchline of Biden’s joke was that asking boys for consent is a hilarious concept. ↓ Story continues below ↓
— Liz Plank (@feministabulous) April 6, 2019 This is an object lesson in how not to respond to allegations that you made women uncomfortable with your behavior. This isn’t something to laugh off or to joke about. It is easy to see why Anita Hill has been waiting for an apology for damn near 30 years. https://t.co/NtbdwSO4FO

ISLAMABAD, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Ministry of Narcotics Control has proposed to establish at least one provincial laboratory with capacity of testing drugs with equipped and properly trained staff for use of all Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF).
Timely and proper investigation of drugs is first step for a successful trial while on other hand, if seized substance is not a drug, a quick and accurate report helps exonerate those who have been arrested on suspicion without much evidence.
There are few drug testing and forensic laboratories in the country that test controlled substances under CNS Act, 1997.
In a new National Anti-Narcotics Policy-2019, the Ministry stressed that one Federal drug testing laboratory will be identified which shall, in addition to testing samples that it receives, be responsible for developing/ documenting/ prescribing standard testing protocols for each narcotic drug, psychotropic substance and precursor and any other related tests.
The other responsibilities would be to developing/documenting/prescribing standard methods for testing samples of blood , urine, etc. to confirm consumption of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances by any person.
Developing advanced forensic testing methods such as impurity profiling, developing standardized forms of reporting which can withstand legal scrutiny, publishing and disseminating manuals on the above to all forensic science labs in the country and identifying basic minimum equipment required to conduct tests to determine the nature and purity of any narcotic drug psychotropic substance or precursor would be other responsibilities.
It would identify the gaps between equipment that is required and that which is available in each of the labs, make recommendations on equipment required to strengthen each laboratory and conduct training programme for personnel working in various forensic laboratories in the country.
The ANF being a lead/premier Agency should develop a state-of-art Drug Laboratory as a centre of excellence where apart of routine drug testing, can also act as an appellate (third party) platform, the policy document further suggested.

"U.S. Job Growth Remains Strong, Adding 196,000 Jobs in March and Surpassing Market Expectations | The White House",www.whitehouse.gov,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/u-s-job-growth-remains-strong-adding-196000-jobs-march-surpassing-market-expectations/,"U.S. Job Growth Remains Strong, Adding 196,000 Jobs in March and Surpassing Market Expectations April 5, 2019 All News
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report, showing that the United States economy is continuing to boom with a strong labor market. Total nonfarm payroll employment in March rose by 196,000 jobs (see figure), beating market expectations (175,000). The month of March continued the longest streak of growth on record (102 months). Job gains in February were revised up by 13,000, and January jobs were revised up by 1,000 for a cumulative increase of 14,000 jobs. In total, the economy has added over 5.5 million jobs since President Donald J. Trump was elected.
The March jobs report reflects a sharp rebound in job growth, suggesting that February’s revised outcome (+33K) was a blip rather than a trend. Since the President was elected, job gains have surpassed 100,000 jobs in 26 of the 28 months. The average jobs growth in the past 12 months is a robust 211,000 jobs and jobs growth in the past 6 months has averaged 207,000 jobs. Both the 12-month and 6-month averages remain above the 2017 average of 179,000 jobs gained per month.
Job growth in March was largest in the education and health services industry, which added 70,000 jobs. Since the President’s election, the manufacturing industry has added 480,000 jobs and 209,000 jobs in the past 12 months.
The report indicates that strong jobs growth is being coupled with wage growth. Nominal average hourly earnings rose by 3.2 percent over the past 12 months, marking the 8 th straight month that that year-over-year wage gains were at or above 3 percent. Prior to 2018, nominal average hourly wage gains had not reached 3 percent since April 2009. Taking inflation into account, there is evidence that real wages are also growing. Based on the most recent Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data from January, inflation in the past year was 1.4 percent, and based on the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) price data from February, the inflation in the past year was 1.5 percent. (March inflation data is not yet available for either series).
A separate household survey released by BLS shows that the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8 percent in March—and marks the 13th consecutive month at or below 4 percent. The unemployment rate for adult women (20+) ticked down to 3.3 percent and re-achieved its lowest rate since 1953.
The labor force participation rate – which tracks how many people are working or looking for work—edged down by 0.2 percentage point to 63 percent, but 0.3 percentage point above the rate when the President was elected in November 2016. The labor force participation rate for prime-age adults (ages 25-54) which largely avoids the demographic effects of the aging population held steady at 82.5 percent—1.1 percentage points above the rate at the President’s election in November 2016.
A thriving economy stimulated by pro-worker policies is pulling workers off the sidelines. In spite of the continued low unemployment rates over the past year, there is still what economists call “labor slack”—or a pool of potential workers on the sidelines. This allows for continued employment and overall economic growth as workers reenter the labor force. In the first quarter of 2019, 71.4 percent of workers entering employment came from out of the labor force rather than from unemployment.
The March employment data depict an American economy that remains strong and booming with a continued low unemployment rate, historic trends in job growth, and rising wages.

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The Pakistan Economy Watch (PEW) has lauded the government 's decision to introduce a new tax amnesty scheme that would help review economy.
""The move will be an important part of the government 's efforts to revive the economy in these difficult times,"" it said Chairman PEW Brig. Muhammad Aslam Khan (Retd) in a statement issued here.
He said that the scheme should be finalized as soon as possible because it would not only increase tax net and improve revenue but also help the worried business community.
He said that the government should announce that the upcoming scheme would be the last one which would be followed by strict action as many owners of Benami assets deserve a last chance.
Brig. Muhammad Aslam Khan noted that amnesty schemes announced in the past have not benefitted the government but some elements, therefore, the government should learn a lesson and announce an acceptable and transparent scheme.
He noted that the same political parties were criticizing the move despite the fact that they announced highly controversial amnesty schemes when in power.
Keeping benami assets has become impossible due to the efforts of the government , he said."

The sanitary workers have complained about the poor working conditions and inhumane attitude of their bosses who asked them to work for extra hours without any over time.
Talking to APP, a sanitary worker at G-7 requesting anonymity said the existing contract system was encouraging their exploitation at the hands of MCI contractors who usually threatened them to cut their wages if anyone dared to raise voice against their highhandedness.
""We are getting Rs 15,000 per month, out of which approximately Rs 2,000 are being taken by the inspectors of our contractor and if we refuse to pay the extortion money , we are told to leave the job ,"" the worker alleged.
He alleged that the workers in his area could not sell the material, collected after segregation, to the scrap dealer of their own choice.
""We are asked to sell such material on the designated shops that purchase it on half rates of the market price ,"" he added.
He urged the quarters concerned to rectify the situation and take the necessary action against the contractors as per law.
Another worker at G-8 sector requesting not be named due to its job security said they were not provided safety equipment and denied of health and other benefits including vacations, insurance schemes, rest days and pensions, adding that they were working under extremely health hazardous and life threatening conditions.
He demanded weekly off for them without their salaries cut so that they could also give time to their families on weekend.
A lady sanitary worker at G-7/1 also requesting anonymity said the female staff was also facing some issues with the contractors and regretted that they were even deprived of maternity leaves.
MCI Director Sanitation, Sardar Khan Zimri said he could not say that everything was going well. Admitting misconduct of some supervisors, he said the department had already taken action against some fraudulent elements and black sheep.
To a query, he said the contractors were given clear direction to fire a shirk worker.
When contacted, a supervisor, who was blamed of getting bribe , rejected such an allegation.
According to official sources, the Capital Development Authority had outsourced the waste collection to some private companies in G and I series sectors a couple of years ago.

SEOUL, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The employment-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio fell to a fresh record low last year, data showed Sunday , as the South Korean economy is experiencing a technology-led development.
The ratio measures the number of newly employed workers per 1 billion won (US$878,000) of GDP, a gauge of people finding work in proportion to economic growth.
Data from the Bank of Korea ( BOK ) and the Korea Employment Information Service put the ratio at 16.79 last year, down to a new record low from 17.18 in the previous year.
The ratio was 43.1 in 1990. It fell to 29.6 in 1997, and since dipping to under 20 at 19.9 in 2009, it hasn't rebounded.
The speed of the fall is more alarming than the band of the decline.
The ratio lost 0.39 last year, marking the largest on-year drop since 2010 in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.
The gap between growth in the national economy and in employment was also widening, according to the data.
In 2017 , South Korea 's economy grew 3.1 percent, but the number of employed rose 1.2 percent. Last year, GDP expanded 2.7 percent, while employment edged up 0.36 percent.
The difference between the two expanded to 2.34 percentage points in 2018 from 1.9 percentage points in 2017 .
Economy watchers say the ratio naturally falls with technological development as machines replace humans at production facilities.
In particular, the semiconductor industry has led the country's economic growth for recent years. Also some 20 percent of the country's total employed people were in the less labor-intensive service sectors like retail, wholesale and accommodations last year.
""It is less likely that employment will expand to a large extent this year,"" said Kim Hyeon-wook from the state-run Korea Development Institute (KDI). ""We need to boost the service sectors that have a higher employment-to-GDP ratio, such as medical treatment, education and communication."""

Lahore (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 7th April, 2019) Pakistani authorities forced an Indian cargo plane on its way from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates to Afghanistan’s Kabul to turn back after it entered Pakistan’s airspace.
Islamabad opened its airspace in phases in March after closing it following the Indian airstrike on a terror camp in Pakistan on February 26.
India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) officials said the Pakistani airspace is closed for flights originating from India . The pilot must have thought that the flight can enter the Pakistani airspace as it was neither destined to nor coming from India , they added.
“It was a Boeing 737 cargo plane with registration number VT- SFB. SpiceJet launched cargo flights from January and it has been going to Afghanistan and Hong Kong regularly,” a DGCA official said.
India carried out the airstrike in Balakot after Pakistan-based Jasih-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack on a paramilitary convoy that left 40 security personnel dead in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district.
Pakistan retaliated on February 27, downed a fighter jet and captured Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Abhinandan Varthaman before releasing him two days later. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Supra-Glacial lake formed over Shisper Glacier, in the west of Hassanabad village Hunza, needed urgent attention of concerned departments as it is posing serious threat to local population and infrastructure.
""Shisper Glacier has been surging at a normal rate whereas the supra-glacial lake formed is the matter of concern for GBDMA and other stakeholders as it is posing serious risk to local population and infrastructure"", said an official of Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA).
The glacier is surging five meters to six meters per day which means it would take 2-3 months to reach to Karakoram Highway (KKH) main bridge which at the moment five kilometers far from the glacier, he told APP.
""The experts monitoring the situation, have found that a thick ice wall of 1 km has been created on the glacier. The ice wall has overruled the threatening risk of glacial lake outburst. The only damage made so far has been to an irrigated water channel near Aliabad village,"" he added.
However, it depends on the weather patterns, which would affect glacial melting process and cause flooding in the area, he noted.
""The authority is waiting for the response of its letter written to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) for isotopic study of the Shisper glacier to ascertain the melting stage of the glacier"", he informed.
He further mentioned that water discharge below the surging glacier was continuing which made it difficult to determine the course of water that either it was the glacial lake's water running or the glacial melt at the surface level.
He informed that surging was not an issue, mitigation work was in progress which would be completed in 2-3 weeks. The population was already informed about the developing serious situation and there was enough rationing of non-food items and medicines to deal with the consequent disaster, he added.
To a query, he said presently they have enough response time till the glacial lake burst and once latest early warning systems have been installed then they would be able to manage early and safe evacuation in case of disaster.
""During a glacial lake outburst phenomenon we have maximum 15-30 minutes response time available"", he informed.

Bolsonaro struggles in first 100 days as Brazil leader,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/bolsonaro-struggles-in-first-100-days-as-braz-587973.html,"Bolsonaro Struggles In First 100 Days As Brazil Leader Faizan Hashmi 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 12:10 PM
Rio de Janeiro, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Since taking power on a pledge to trash corrupt ""old politics,"" Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's first months have been marred by chaos and blunders that have eroded support for the far-right leader and put the brakes on his reforms.
The brash ex-army captain -- nicknamed the "" Trump of the tropics"" for his admiration of the US president -- is struggling to make good on his key election promises to kick-start Latin America's biggest economy and stamp out corruption .
As Bolsonaro prepares to mark the symbolic milestone of 100 days in office on Wednesday, analysts say the euphoria of his October victory that ended decades of center-left rule is evaporating.
""It wouldn't be an understatement to say that the president's performance to date has been disappointing,"" said Thomaz Favaro of the political risk consultancy Control Risks.
""There was a misperception that he was coming in with a very strong support base and I think we're now beginning to see that maybe that support wasn't strong."" Condemned by opponents as racist, sexist and homophobic before the ballot, Bolsonaro's message of toughness and an end to business-as-usual politics resonated with voters fed up with violence and industrial-scale graft.
But Bolsonaro, who was better known for making insults rather than policy during his decades as a congressman, is finding that his uncompromising style and penchant for Twitter are not working in Congress where he lacks a ruling-party majority to push through legislation.
His signature policy to overhaul Brazil 's unsustainable pension system, which he has warned would bankrupt the country if changes are not adopted, has stalled following a spat with key political allies and raised doubts about his ability to do the job .
""Over the last few weeks we've really seen the side people feared about Bolsonaro,"" said William Jackson , an economist at London-based Capital Economics.
""His lack of governing experience, showing up in deteriorating relations with Congress , and his struggles to keep his coalition together seem to have led to a paralysis in policymaking."" Bolsonaro appears to have adopted a more conciliatory tone in recent days, holding meetings with the leaders of several parties.
He may have finally accepted the ""give and take"" of Brazilian politics, said David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia .
""It's a make or break,"" Fleischer warned. If the pension reform bill fails then Bolsonaro ""doesn't get any tax reform, which is another important thing on the table, and his government will just drift along until 2022."""

Washington, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Two weeks after he exonerated President Donald Trump in the Russia meddling investigation, Attorney General Bill Barr faces mounting pressure to show the full evidence behind his decision.
Allegations this week that the US Justice chief downplayed serious evidence of illegal obstruction by Trump in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's final report are fueling demands that he release the entire, unexpurgated document to Congress .
News reports, citing unnamed members of Mueller's staff, said Barr ignored the summaries Mueller's team prepared for public release, and instead issued his own on March 24, in which he peremptorily cleared the president of any wrongdoing.
And Barr now says he will not release key evidence given to Mueller's grand jury, a special panel used by prosecutors in politically-sensitive cases. Democrats suspect the evidence could be damning to the president -- setting up a legal and political showdown.
The Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee this week prepared to subpoena the full report, a move Barr and the White House will almost certainly contest.
And on Thursday Jerry Nadler, the committee chairman, demanded Barr turn over all communications between his office and Mueller's, following the reports Mueller's staff were unhappy with the way Barr presented their conclusions.
Barr's distillation ""appears to minimize the implications of the report as to the president,"" said Nadler.
""Releasing the summaries -- without delay -- would begin to allow the American people to judge the facts for themselves,"" Nadler wrote."

Addis Ababa, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :With poems and speeches, Ethiopians have held an emotional farewell for murdered rapper Nipsey Hussle, whose roots in neighbouring Eritrea won him admirers in both countries.
Known for his Grammy-nominated debut album, Hussle was shot dead last week in front of the clothing store he owned in the US city of Los Angeles , whose violence-plagued neighbourhoods he had tried to revitalise.
On Friday, 29-year-old Eric Holder pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder over the shooting that also wounded two other men.
At the Saturday evening memorial in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa , Hussle was remembered as a rare entertainer who bridged his American upbringing with his roots in the Horn of Africa .
""When we heard there's an Eritrean rapper out there, we were fans before we heard his music ,"" said Ambaye Michael Tesfay, who eulogised Hussle at the event held in a darkened parking lot. ""He was an icon for us."" Before his 2018 debut album ""Victory Lap"" scored a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album, Hussle, born Ermias Asghedom, had won the attention of rap fans from both Ethiopia and Eritrea for his embrace of his father's Eritrean heritage.
Eritrea was a province of Ethiopia until 1993, when it voted for independence after a decades-long independence struggle, but both countries still have close cultural and family ties.
""It's just really tragic what happened,"" said Tezeta Solomon, an Ethiopian living in Los Angeles who attended the memorial in Addis Ababa .
""When he first came out, we were all so excited. To know there was a habesha rapper out there definitely sparked some pride,"" she said, using a common term to describe people from the Horn of Africa .
Hussle embraced his Eritrean heritage, visiting the country last year and telling state media , ""More than anything I am proud of being Eritrean."" The relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea has often been tortuous, and the countries were not on speaking terms for years following a 1998-2000 border war that ground into stalemate.
That ended with the signing of a peace agreement last year that restored ties between the neighbours.
The frosty relations did little to dampen Ethiopians' pride in Hussle's success.
""We're all one people,"" said Nemany Hailemelekot, an organiser of the memorial.
The crowd of hundreds gathered in the parking lot observed a moment of silence for the slain rapper, who was 33.
Then by the light of candle-like sticks known as twafs held by attendees, speakers came onto a stage erected before the crowd to eulogise Hussle and read poems in his honour. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Clubs fume over 'deplorable' Sydney Cricket Ground pitch,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/clubs-fume-over-deplorable-sydney-cricket-g-587970.html,"Clubs Fume Over 'deplorable' Sydney Cricket Ground Pitch Zeeshan Mehtab 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 12:05 PM
Sydney, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Australia's football players' union Sunday demanded an investigation into the ""deplorable"" Sydney Cricket Ground pitch after midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a potentially serious knee injury during an A-League game.
Antonis collapsed to the ground in the second-half of the match on Saturday between Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC after slipping on the uneven surface when no-one else was around him.
Professional Footballers Australia chief executive John Didulica said the pitch was in a ""deplorable state"" and clearly dangerous as he demanded answers from Football Federation Australia as to how the game was allowed to go ahead.
""The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods,"" he said.
""As demonstrated, cricket wickets present an unreasonable danger to the health and safety of footballers and it remains the view of the PFA that players are under no obligation to participate in matches when such risks are present. "" The iconic cricket ground is being used for soccer and rugby while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is demolished and rebuilt.
Last month, large sections of the hallowed turf was ripped apart during a Super Rugby game between the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds.
Management were forced to replace 3,000 square metres of grass afterwards in preparation for a rugby league match.
Sydney FC chief Danny Townsend said the pitch ""clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football "" and said the club could move its next match elsewhere.
Victory coach Kevin Muscat said it was too early to assess Antonis' injury, but he has been ruled out of their AFC Champions League clash with Guangzhou Evergrande in China this week.
""That simply is not good enough,"" he said of the pitch. ""Not for the contest tonight (Saturday), not for anything."" Sydney won the game 2-1."

PHOENIX — Carson Kelly drilled a single into the left-field corner, scoring Nick Ahmed with two outs in the ninth inning to lift the Arizona Diamondbacks over the struggling Boston Red Sox, 5-4, on Saturday night.
Boston has dropped three straight and is now at 2-8 overall, a lousy start to their World Series championship defense.
Colten Brewer (0-1) allowed consecutive singles to Eduardo Escobar, Ahmed and Kelly in the ninth. Right fielder Mookie Betts threw out Escobar at home on Ahmed's hit, but Kelly's rip to left allowed Ahmed to score easily.
Kelly had two hits and three RBI. The walkoff knock was the first of his career.
Greg Holland (1-0) pitched a scoreless top of the ninth for the win.
The Diamondbacks led, 4-3, after two innings, but neither team scored again until the seventh. Jackie Bradley Jr. drew a leadoff walk against Yoshihisa Hirano and took third on J.D. Martinez's pinch-hit single. Andrew Benintendi drew a walk, and Betts drove in the tying run with a sacrifice fly.
The Red Sox loaded the bases against one of Arizona's top relievers, Archie Bradley, but Bradley got Xander Bogaerts to ground into an inning-ending fielder's choice.
Boston's David Price started and worked six innings, allowing four runs and seven hits with four strikeouts.
Luke Weaver improved from his last start, allowing three runs, five hits and two walks with four strikeouts over five innings. Weaver gave up four earned runs in 4 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers on March 30.
The Red Sox plated the game's first three runs in the top of the second. Bogaerts led off with a walk and took third with heads-up baserunning on a shallow single to center by Rafael Devers. Eduardo Nunez's groundout scored Bogaerts, and one out later, Devers came home on Price's single past first base. That was Price's first career RBI and his fourth hit in 50 at-bats.
Benintendi hit a ground-rule double to center field, scoring Christian Vazquez and making it 3-0.
The Diamondbacks took the lead in the next half-inning. Ahmed singled in David Peralta from third base with one out, and Kelly followed with a two-run double. Adam Jones singled in Kelly, who crossed home before a close play on Jones at second base. Jones was first called safe at second, but the Red Sox challenged and the play was reviewed and overturned.
Roof it
The retractable roof at Chase Field opened with no problems as the top of the fourth inning got underway. The roof malfunctioned Friday during the Diamondbacks' home opener.
Trainer's room
Red Sox: IF-OF Brock Holt and LHP Brian Johnson were placed on the 10-day injured list on Saturday. Holt has a scratched cornea in his right eye, and Johnson has left elbow inflammation. ... Utility player Tzu-Wei Lin and RHP Marcus Walden were called up from Triple-A Pawtucket. Lin grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.
Diamondbacks: LHP T.J. McFarland (shoulder) threw 20 pitches in a simulated game on Saturday and manager Torey Lovullo was encouraged. ... RHP Taijuan Walker is set for a 40-pitch bullpen as he comes back from elbow surgery a little less than a year ago.
Up next
RHP Merrill Kelly (1-0) is set for his second start of the season on Sunday against Boston. He allowed three runs in six innings at San Diego in his first start to earn the win. The Red Sox had yet to name Sunday's starting pitcher as of Saturday night. Never miss a story

"In possible first, Cuba allows march by animal activists",www.providencejournal.com,"Michael Weissenstein, The Associated Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190407/in-possible-first-cuba-allows-march-by-animal-activists?rssfeed=true,"In possible first, Cuba allows march by animal activists Michael Weissenstein, The Associated Press Sunday Apr 7, 2019 at 12:49 AM Apr 7, 2019 at 12:49 AM
HAVANA (AP) "" On Sunday morning a group of animal-lovers will march a mile down one of Havana's main thoroughfares waving placards calling for an end to animal cruelty in Cuba.
Short, seemingly simple, the march will write a small but significant line in the history of modern Cuba. The socialist government is explicitly permitting a public march unassociated with any part of the all-encompassing Communist state, a move that participants and historians call highly unusual and perhaps unprecedented since the first years of the revolution.
""It's a historic event,"" said Beatriz Del Carmen Hidalgo-Gato Batista, a 21-year public communications student who received the permit for the march from the Plaza of the Revolution borough of Havana.
There is no indication Cuba is moving toward unfettered freedom of assembly: The state still clamps down on unapproved political speech with swift and massive police mobilizations, waves of arrests and temporary detentions. So a march by independent civil society groups seeking government action will be a remarkable sight in a country where, for nearly 60 years, virtually every aspect of life was part of a single chain of command ending in a supreme leader named Castro.
""It's unprecedented,"" said Alberto Gonzalez, a co-organizer of the march and publisher of The Ark, an online Cuban animal-lovers magazine. ""This is going to mark a before and an after.""
Since shortly after its foundation, the Cuban Communist government has only permitted the existence of what it calls ""legitimate civil society"" "" groups overseen, sponsored and managed by the state and Communist Party. Those groups are fixtures in the mass marches and gatherings organized by the state on public holidays. On the other end of the spectrum are dissident groups, often with close ties to anti-Castro forces in Miami who want to overthrow the socialist government and reinstall a capitalist system with close ties to Washington. Their attempts at street protests and other forms of organizing are almost instantly quashed by state security.
The animal-rights march is part of a wider change in the relationship between the Cuban state and independent civil society "" Cubans trying to effect change in their society while making clear to everyone, particularly the authorities, that they have no interest in crossing the red line known as ""politics.""
In the year since Raul Castro handed the presidency to longtime party technocrat Miguel Diaz-Canel in April 2018, churches, civil society groups and loose associations of like-minded acquaintances have been using the growing availability of internet in Cuba to organize for various causes, and the state has been ceding them a small degree of freedom to operate.
Artists pushed back successfully against a new law regulating artistic expression. Evangelical churches prodded the government to rescind a proposal to legalize gay marriage. Thousands organized online to get private aid to victims of a tornado in Havana in January. Biologist Ariel Ruiz Urquiola was freed from prison after an online campaign by a wide range of Cubans against his one-year sentence for ""disrespecting a forest ranger"" during a broader campaign against illegal logging and other environmental violations in western Cuba.
""It's part of a trend toward recognizing civil society, in a tacit manner, sometimes a timid one, but one that's growing, little by little,"" said Yassel Padron Kunakbaeva, a blogger and intellectual who describes him as a Marxist revolutionary.
A 10-year-old private group known as Forest Guardians regularly organizes tree plantings and cleanups of rivers that cross the city of Havana, said organizer Isbel Diaz, a biologist. Last year, the group used $11,000 in small donations to buy a headquarters where it holds workshops and study groups with what it calls a leftist, anti-capitalist orientation.
Diaz said that the group's first cleanup of the Malecon promenade in 2010 had 14 members picking up trash as several dozen state security agents filmed, took photos and called out threats and insults.
""Activism in Cuba has taken place despite the state,"" Diaz said. ""In my opinion, it's not because the state has felt the need to open up, but because it's had no other option than to accept reality and people with a lot of courage have defied the limits and pushed the boundaries back a little.""
In contrast, when self-employed taxi drivers went on an informal strike to protest new regulations, they were met with a flood of inspections that forced many to stop working.
Animal-rights activism has been a fertile field for organizing in Cuba, where these are no laws against animal abuse and virtually every neighborhood has a resident or two who dedicate hours to feeding, treating and sterilizing street dogs and cats, sometimes with the help of foreigners donating supplies and funds.
The country has one officially recognized animal-rescue group, Aniplant, and perhaps a dozen other small, non-state organizations in Havana and other major cities. In recent years the groups have collected thousands of signatures asking for an animal-protection law, with no success to date.
""What I believe is that, if I live in this country I should try to fight for what I want in this country, and what I want is to help Cuban animals,"" said Grettel Montes de Oca Valdes, a professional dancer and founder of the group Cubans in Defense of Animals, whose members will march on Sunday. ""I don't think that we should stop speaking out because if we stop speaking out nothing happens. That method is useless.""
The march is planned to end at the grave of Jeannette Ryder, an American who fought for animal rights in Cuba at the start of 20th century. Aniplant has typically organized what it calls pilgrimages to the grave every April.
In a sign of remaining tensions between the official and unofficial in Cuba, many volunteers from the government-backed animal group are boycotting Sunday's march and holding their own event next week.

Maldives leader celebrates victory in parliamentary election,www.providencejournal.com,The Associated Press,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190407/maldives-leader-celebrates-victory-in-parliamentary-election?rssfeed=true,"Maldives leader celebrates victory in parliamentary election Sunday Apr 7, 2019 at 2:01 AM Apr 7, 2019 at 2:01 AM
MALE, Maldives (AP) "" Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's party is leading in the vote count in the parliamentary election and has already declared a landslide victory that could give him a free hand in efforts to restore political freedoms and tackle corruption.
The official results are expected late Sunday. Local reports say Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party is leading in 60 out of the 87 seats in Parliament.
This could be the first time that a single party has won the majority in Parliament since the Indian Ocean archipelago nation became a multiparty democracy in 2008 after decades of autocratic rule.
More than 264,000 people were eligible to vote for 386 candidates running for the 87 seats. Voter turnout in Saturday's election was over 78 percent.
Solih said the people should not forget ""the immense challenges that lie ahead of us"" as his party began celebrating after the counting started Saturday night.
""The work to strengthen our democratic institutions, to deliver basic services for citizens, to our promise of bringing corruption, past and present to book and ending impunity starts now,"" he said in a statement Sunday. ""I look forward to working with all of you to realize our promises to the people.""
Solih's party is seeking at least 44 seats in for a majority to pass legislation needed to implement pledges from last year's presidential campaign. His coalition currently has 52, but one partner with 22 seats is aligned with former strongman Yameen Abdul Gayoom.
Solih defeated Yameen last year, giving new hope to the young democracy that has gone through a tumultuous transition that threatened to drag the Maldives back to its autocratic past. Yameen had curtailed freedom of speech and jailed his political rivals.
Solih was only a fallback choice as president for his party because charismatic former President Mohamed Nasheed had been sentenced to prison under Yameen and was ineligible to run.
Solih promised reforms, an end to political influence over the courts, police and the bureaucracy, and the recovery of money lost through corruption.
Opposition politicians came together in a grand alliance to defeat Yameen, their common foe. But soon the coalition cracked and despite repeated efforts, Solih failed to secure parliamentary approval for promised commissions to inquire into corruption, the disappearance of a journalist and the killing of a blogger during Yameen's rule.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" For those who thought Texas Tech only plays defense, it's time to meet Matt Mooney.
While the Red Raiders were locking down Michigan State on one end, the graduate transfer shooting guard was raining in 3s on the other, lifting Tech one win away from a title Saturday night with a 61-51 victory over the Spartans in the Final Four.
Mooney matched his season-high with 22 points, including three 3-pointers over the span of 3 minutes to give Texas Tech a 13-point lead midway through the second half.
With the kind of 'D' Texas Tech plays, it was too much to overcome, and now the Red Raiders and are getting ready for another defensive battle, in a Monday final against Virginia, and its vaunted pack line defense. The Cavaliers are a slight 1-point favorite, and the over/under was at 117 � and falling late Saturday night.
Texas Tech wins by doing just enough on the offensive end. On this night, Mooney did the major damage.
""He's obviously very, very talented, but the thing that impressed me tonight was just his courage, wanting to make those big plays in big moment,"" Texas Tech coach Chris Beard said.
Mooney's first two shots in the stretch capped a 5-for-5 hot streak by Texas Tech (31-6) that stood as the game's only true blast of offense. His third 3 gave Texas Tech a 48-35 lead with 9:38 left.
Before and after that, it was all about defense "" a game filled with air balls, blocked shots and clogged-up passing lanes. At one point, over a two minute stretch late in the first half, eight shots went up. Six of them didn't touch the rim.
It was, to put it Texas Tech's way, perfectly ugly.
""It's like they never make mistakes,"" Michigan State forward Kenny Goins said. ""They got us kind of caught in that trap today.""
Michigan State (32-7) leaves coach Tom Izzo's eighth Final Four with its seventh loss "" the 2000 title is still the only time the Spartans have taken it all the way under their veteran coach.
But they did not go away easily.
After Mooney put them down by a baker's dozen, the Spartans trimmed it to 3. Matt McQuaid had a wide-open look from the corner "" one of the very few on this night "" that would've tied it with 1:50 left, but the ball rimmed out and the Red Raiders pulled away.
Jarrett Culver (10 points, five boards) finished it off. He made one free throw on the next trip down, then Norense Odiase swiped the ball from MSU's Xavier Tillman "" one of Tech's four steals on the night "" and the Red Raiders worked the ball to Culver, who made his only 3 to push the lead to 58-51 and start the celebration.
Culver shot 0 for 6 in the first half, and scored six of his 10 points over the last 2:30.
""When you've got a whole team that trusts you on the court, you keep shooting with confidence,"" he said.
Meanwhile, a defense that led the nation in efficiency and held teams to under 37% shooting this season "" second best in the county "" held Michigan State to 31.9% from the floor.
Most tellingly, it stymied Big Ten player of the year Cassius Winston. Yes, Winston led the Spartans with 16 points, but it came on 4-for-16 shooting, and he was held scoreless in second half for more than 10 minutes "" not perking up until after Mooney had given the Red Raiders their big cushion.
Mooney is the fifth-year senior who made his way to Texas Tech after graduating from South Dakota "" the school he transferred to after a rough year at Air Force.
Most all these Red Raiders have a story like that.
Beard is on his 12th stop in a travelogue of a career "" and he's been recruiting grinders like him to help him take this most-unexpected ride.
Culver wasn't in the top 300 among high school recruits, and chose his hometown college over a few other places. He kept battling despite the rough start, and Texas Tech overcame his cold first half to head to the locker room leading by the not-so-scintillating score of 23-21. It was the lowest scoring first half at the Final Four since the Spartans took a 19-17 lead over Wisconsin in a 2000 slugfest.
""We threw a lot of punches tonight,"" Beard said. ""We tried a lot of things on defense, and fortunately most of them worked.""
Culver had one block and rim protector Tariq Owens, also a grad transfer, had three more before leaving late in the second half with a leg injury.
Owens came jogging back in toward the end to the cheers of the Texas Tech crowd, which included alum Patrick Mahomes, the high-flying QB for the Chiefs.
""Pretty cool to have the MVP of the NFL on our side, cheering for us,"" Mooney said.
Turns out, the quarterback isn't the only Red Raider who can light up that scoreboard.

Russo, The Associated Press Sunday Apr 7, 2019 at 12:18 AM Apr 7, 2019 at 12:18 AM
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" Hard to call Virginia basketball boring after the last two games. And the Cavaliers have pretty much put the choker label to rest, too.
From one-and-done to NCAA Tournament miracle men, Virginia will play for the national title for the first time after pulling off another last-second stunner. Kyle Guy made three free throws with 0.6 seconds left, steadily swishing each one as debate immediately started over the sequence that sent him to the line, and Virginia beat Auburn 63-62 Saturday in the Final Four.
A year after becoming the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16, these top-seeded Cavaliers now look like destiny's team.
""It's a great story,"" Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. ""It is.""
The Cavaliers (34-3) will face Texas Tech on Monday night as the slight favorite to win the tournament.
Bennett has built a powerhouse in 10 years in Charlottesville on a style of play that is often about as exciting as a trip to the campus library. The Cavaliers have gotten straight A's in the regular season with stingy defense and walk-it-up offense, but NCAA success has been hard to come by. Blown leads and early exits have been their story "" never more than when the Cavaliers lost to UMBC, a school known for chess, not hoops.
Something has gotten into these Wahoos the last two weeks, though. They reached the Final Four for the first time since 1984 with a wild buzzer-beater by Mamadi Diakite to send their Elite Eight game against Purdue to overtime. Beating the Tigers took an even crazier finish.
Fifth-seeded Auburn (30-10) had erased a 10-point deficit in the final five minutes and taken a 4-point lead. Heartbreak was again at hand for Virginia.
The Tigers led 61-60 after Guy made an off-balance 3 with 7.6 seconds left. The shot snapped a drought of more than five minutes by the Cavaliers, who then immediately sent Jared Harper to the line.
Harper made one and Auburn, with fouls to give, did so twice. On one of them, it looked as if Ty Jerome might have double-dribbled into a decisive turnover. Jerome also might have been fouled before the mishandle. But there was no whistle for either.
""We knew there was a disruption,"" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said.
With 1.5 seconds left and in need of some magic, Virginia got the ball to Guy in the corner. He turned and fired and Samir Doughty, hands straight up in the air, bumped into Guy's hip. The shot was short, bouncing off the rim. Game over? Auburn started to celebrate and the PA announcer in U.S. Bank Stadium even announced the Tigers had won.
Guy pulled his jersey over his face. But not in angst. He said he exactly knew why official James Breeding had blown his whistle.
""I heard him call it right away,"" Guy said. ""That was me focusing.""
Meanwhile, Pearl lost it on the sideline, pumping his fist and screaming.
""We kind of thought we had it sealed,"" said Bryce Brown, who led the Auburn comeback with three 3s in the final 4:30. ""It's not why we lost the game. I just didn't agree with the call.""
Pearl said he didn't want the final call to define a great game, but he did say the officials seemed to be letting physical play go throughout.
""My advice ... if that's a foul, call it,"" Pearl said. ""Call it at the beginning of the game, call it in the middle of the game, call it at the end of the game. Don't call it any more or less at any other time during the game.""
Guy swished the first two free throws to tie it and Auburn called a timeout to ice him. Didn't work. He hit one more for the lead.
""I just literally told myself that we dream of these moments, and to be able to make one happen was special,"" Guy said.
Auburn threw a long inbound pass to Brown, but his desperation 3 was short.
The Cavaliers mobbed Guy on one end. Brown sat on the court, head hanging on the other. Auburn, in the Final Four for the first time, had its 12-game winning streak and season end in a most painful way.
NCAA national coordinator of officials J.D. Collins declined comment on the potential double dribble, but said Breeding's call was correct.
The foul violated the rule that ""verticality applies to a legal position and also to both the offensive and defensive players,"" Collins said. ""The defender may not 'belly up' or use the lower part of the body or arms to cause contact outside his vertical plane or inside the opponent's vertical plane.""
Jerome scored 21 points for Virginia and De'Andre Hunter had 10 of his 14 in a stellar second half.
Doughty led Auburn with 13 points and Brown had 12 for Auburn, which survived the first round against New Mexico State when Terrell Brown of the Aggies missed two of three free throws with 1.1 seconds remaining in the Tigers' 78-77 victory.
Auburn wasn't so fortunate this time, and Virginia, the team that made UMBC a household name "" at least for a little while "" in the first round of last year's tournament would not be denied. Being on the receiving end of maybe the most humbling NCAA Tournament upset ever has been Virginia's cross to bear all season. Even after beating Auburn, the Cavaliers had to recall the feeling of their offseason routine starting unexpectedly early last year.
""I feel like I get asked this question every single round, every round we advance, and every round I say the same thing almost,"" Jerome said, ""and it feels a little bit sweeter, a little bit sweeter.""
Then Guy said: ""Not much to add. Just you guys can ask that question again on Monday.""

RomeroThe Associated Press Sunday Apr 7, 2019 at 12:03 AM Apr 7, 2019 at 12:03 AM
PHOENIX — Carson Kelly drilled a single into the left-field corner, scoring Nick Ahmed with two outs in the ninth inning to lift the Arizona Diamondbacks over the struggling Boston Red Sox, 5-4, on Saturday night.
Boston has dropped three straight and is now at 2-8 overall, a lousy start to their World Series championship defense.
Colten Brewer (0-1) allowed consecutive singles to Eduardo Escobar, Ahmed and Kelly in the ninth. Right fielder Mookie Betts threw out Escobar at home on Ahmed's hit, but Kelly's rip to left allowed Ahmed to score easily.
Kelly had two hits and three RBI. The walkoff knock was the first of his career.
Greg Holland (1-0) pitched a scoreless top of the ninth for the win.
The Diamondbacks led, 4-3, after two innings, but neither team scored again until the seventh. Jackie Bradley Jr. drew a leadoff walk against Yoshihisa Hirano and took third on J.D. Martinez's pinch-hit single. Andrew Benintendi drew a walk, and Betts drove in the tying run with a sacrifice fly.
The Red Sox loaded the bases against one of Arizona's top relievers, Archie Bradley, but Bradley got Xander Bogaerts to ground into an inning-ending fielder's choice.
Boston's David Price started and worked six innings, allowing four runs and seven hits with four strikeouts.
Luke Weaver improved from his last start, allowing three runs, five hits and two walks with four strikeouts over five innings. Weaver gave up four earned runs in 4 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers on March 30.
The Red Sox plated the game's first three runs in the top of the second. Bogaerts led off with a walk and took third with heads-up baserunning on a shallow single to center by Rafael Devers. Eduardo Nunez's groundout scored Bogaerts, and one out later, Devers came home on Price's single past first base. That was Price's first career RBI and his fourth hit in 50 at-bats.
Benintendi hit a ground-rule double to center field, scoring Christian Vazquez and making it 3-0.
The Diamondbacks took the lead in the next half-inning. Ahmed singled in David Peralta from third base with one out, and Kelly followed with a two-run double. Adam Jones singled in Kelly, who crossed home before a close play on Jones at second base. Jones was first called safe at second, but the Red Sox challenged and the play was reviewed and overturned.
Roof it
The retractable roof at Chase Field opened with no problems as the top of the fourth inning got underway. The roof malfunctioned Friday during the Diamondbacks' home opener.
Trainer's room
Red Sox: IF-OF Brock Holt and LHP Brian Johnson were placed on the 10-day injured list on Saturday. Holt has a scratched cornea in his right eye, and Johnson has left elbow inflammation. ... Utility player Tzu-Wei Lin and RHP Marcus Walden were called up from Triple-A Pawtucket. Lin grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.
Diamondbacks: LHP T.J. McFarland (shoulder) threw 20 pitches in a simulated game on Saturday and manager Torey Lovullo was encouraged. ... RHP Taijuan Walker is set for a 40-pitch bullpen as he comes back from elbow surgery a little less than a year ago.
Up next
RHP Merrill Kelly (1-0) is set for his second start of the season on Sunday against Boston. He allowed three runs in six innings at San Diego in his first start to earn the win. The Red Sox had yet to name Sunday's starting pitcher as of Saturday night. Never miss a story

SAN DIEGO (AP) "" The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year, a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody.
The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47,000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1, 2017 and June 25, 2018 "" the day before U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families. The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation "" for example, children under 5.
The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to reunite families and criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday.
""We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families,"" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU's lead attorney. ""The government needs to make this a priority.""
Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2,700 children in government care on June 26, 2018 be reunited with their families, which has largely been accomplished. Then, in January, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017. The department's inspector general said the precise number was unknown.
The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps. A hearing is scheduled April 16.
Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge's June order, Jonathan White, a commander of the U.S. Public Health Service and Health and Human Services' point person on family reunification, said in an affidavit.
White, whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge, would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement. Dr. Barry Graubard, a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute, developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated.
The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives, but many are not parents. Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year, 49 percent went to parents, 41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt, uncle, grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives, family friends and others.
The government's proposed model to flag still-separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent. Other signs of likely separation include children under 5, younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol's El Paso, Texas, sector, where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017.
Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico. The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children. The policy now applies only to single adults. Never miss a story

Ex-Sen Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina dies at 97,www.providencejournal.com,"Meg Kinnard, The Associated Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190406/ex-sen-ernest-fritz-hollings-of-south-carolina-dies-at-97?rssfeed=true,"Ex-Sen Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina dies at 97 Meg Kinnard, The Associated Press Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 9:43 AM Apr 6, 2019 at 8:26 PM
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) "" Ernest F. ""Fritz"" Hollings, the silver-haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U.S. Senate, has died. He was 97.
Family spokesman Andy Brack, who also served at times for Hollings as spokesman during his Senate career, said Hollings died at his home on the Isle of Palms early Saturday.
Hollings, whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, retired from the Senate in 2005, one of the last of the larger-than-life Democrats who dominated politics in the South.
He had served 38 years and two months, making him the eighth longest-serving senator in U.S. history.
Nevertheless, Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term. The senior senator was Strom Thurmond, first elected in 1954. He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest-serving senator in history.
In his final Senate speech, made in 2004, Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election, calling money ""the main culprit, the cancer on the body politic.""
""We don't have time for each other, we don't have time for constituents except for the givers. ... We're in real, real trouble.""
Hollings was a sharp-tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate, but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped.
He sometimes blamed that failure on his background, rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation.
However, South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s.
Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958. He built a national reputation as a moderate when, in his farewell address as governor, he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University.
""This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina's choice, a government of laws rather than a government of men,"" he told lawmakers. Shortly afterward, Clemson was peacefully integrated.
In his 2008 autobiography, ""Making Government Work,"" Hollings wrote that in the 1950s ""no issue dominated South Carolina more than race"" and that he worked for a balanced approach.
""I was 'Mister-In-Between. The governor had to appear to be in charge; yet the realities were not on his side,"" he wrote. ""I returned to my basic precept ... the safety of the people is the supreme law. I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed.""
In the Senate, Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers. He chaired the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees.
But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble. He once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the ""senator from the B'nai B'rith"" and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-California, as ""wetbacks.""
Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Early in his Senate career, he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina, one of the poorest states in the union.
Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam, but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory.
Hollings, who made three trips to the war zone, said he learned a lesson there.
""It's a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time,"" he wrote in his autobiography, warning that America is now ""repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq.""
Despite his changed views, Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government.
In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities, helping lay the groundwork for the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, feeding program.
A year later, his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book ""The Case Against Hunger.""
In 1982, Hollings proposed an across-the-board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit, a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid.
He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act. Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm-Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget.
Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq.
In his later years, port security was one of his main concerns.
As he prepared to leave office, he told The Associated Press: ""People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment. I never, ever lived that way. ... I'm not trying to get remembered.""
He kept busy after the Senate helping the Medical University of South Carolina raise money for the cancer center which bears his name and lecturing at the new Charleston School of Law.
Hollings' one political defeat came in 1962 when he lost in a primary to Sen. Olin Johnston. After Johnston died, Hollings won a special election in 1966 and went to the Senate at age 44, winning the first of his six full terms two years later.
Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on Jan. 1, 1922. His father was a paper products dealer but the family business went broke during the Depression.
Hollings graduated from The Citadel, the state's military college in Charleston, in 1942. He immediately entered the Army and was decorated for his service during World War II. Back home, he earned a law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1947.
The next year, he was elected to the state House at age 26. He was elected lieutenant governor six years later and governor in 1958 at age 36.
As governor, he actively lured business, helped balance the budget for the first time since Reconstruction and improved public education.
Hollings had four children with his first wife, the late Patricia Salley Hollings. He is survived by three of his four children. His second wife, ""Peatsy,"" died in 2012.
A funeral home handling arrangements said that after a three-hour visitation April 14 in Charleston, the senator's body will lie in repose Monday, April 15, at the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia, with a funeral service to follow the next day at the Citadel in Charleston.

Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected,www.providencejournal.com,"Karin Laub, The Associated Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190406/netanyahu-vows-to-annex-west-bank-settlements-if-re-elected?rssfeed=true,"Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected Karin Laub, The Associated Press Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 4:32 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 10:01 PM
JERUSALEM (AP) "" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Saturday to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected, a dramatic policy shift apparently aimed at rallying his nationalist base in the final stretch of the tight race.
Netanyahu has promoted Jewish settlement expansion in his four terms as prime minister, but until now refrained from presenting a detailed vision for the West Bank, seen by the Palestinians as the heartland of a future state.
An Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank is bound to snuff out any last flicker of hope for an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the terms of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in 1967.
A so-called two-state solution has long been the preferred option of most of the international community. However, intermittent U.S. mediation between Israelis and Palestinians ran aground after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital early in his term. The Palestinians, who seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as their capital, suspended contact with the U.S.
More recently, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in 1967. The move was viewed in Israel as a political gift by Trump to Netanyahu who is being challenged by former military chief Benny Gantz.
The U.S. State Department declined to comment on Netanyahu's statement.
Polls have indicated a close race, though Netanyahu's Likud Party is expected to have a better chance than Gantz's Blue and White slate to form a ruling coalition. Polls forecast more than 60 out of 120 parliament seats for the Likud and smaller right-wing and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties
On Saturday, Netanyahu gave an interview to Israel's Channel 12 TV at the top of the prime-time newscast. Netanyahu portrayed the U.S. policy shifts on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as his achievements, saying he had managed to persuade Trump to take these steps.
Netanyahu pledged that he would not dismantle a single Jewish settlement and that Israel would retain control of the territory west of the Jordan River "" the West Bank. More than 600,000 Israelis now live on war-won lands, two-thirds in the West Bank.
The interviewer asked why he hadn't annexed some of the larger settlements during his current term. ""The question you are asking is an interesting question, whether we will move to the next stage and the answer is yes,"" he said, adding that the next term in office would be fateful. ""We will move to the next stage, the imposing of Israeli sovereignty.""
""I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,"" he said. ""From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.""
In any partition deal, the more isolated Jewish settlements would likely have to be uprooted to create a viable Palestinian state.
Saeb Erekat, a veteran former Palestinian negotiator, said he held the international community, especially the Trump administration, responsible for Israel's policies.
""Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administration's support and endorsement of Israel's violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine,"" he said in a statement.

Trump: Democrats would 'leave Israel out there',www.providencejournal.com,"Zeke Miller, The Associated Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190406/trump-democrats-would-leave-israel-out-there?rssfeed=true,"Trump: Democrats would 'leave Israel out there' Zeke Miller, The Associated Press Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 12:55 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 9:32 PM
LAS VEGAS (AP) "" President Donald Trump warned on Saturday that a Democratic victory in 2020 could ""leave Israel out there,"" as he highlighted his pro-Israel actions in an effort to make the case for Jewish voters to back his re-election.
Speaking at the annual meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump touted his precedent-shredding actions to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and recognition last month of Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel seized from Syria in 1967.
""We got you something that you wanted,"" Trump said of the embassy move, adding, ""Unlike other presidents, I keep my promises.""
The group, backed by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson, supported Trump's 2016 campaign and is preparing to spend millions on his 2020 effort.
""I know that the Republican Jewish Coalition will help lead our party to another historic victory,"" Trump said. ""We need more Republicans. Let's go, so we can win everything.""
Jewish voters in the U.S. have traditionally sided heavily with Democrats "" and are often ideologically liberal "" but Republicans are hoping to narrow the gap next year, in part as Trump cites actions that he says demonstrate support for Israel.
The Jewish Democratic Council of America on Saturday said American Jews leaving the Democratic Party are a Republican fantasy.
""Trump's presidency has only solidified the fact that the Democratic Party has been - and will remain - the political home of the American Jewish electorate,"" JDCA Executive Director Halie Soifer said in a statement. ""This is because Trump's policies and rhetoric are antithetical to Jewish values, and because anti-Semitism has increased to unprecedented levels due to Trump's divisive words, policies, and willful blindness.""
But at the RJC, Trump earned standing ovations for recounting both the embassy move and the Golan Heights recognition.
Trump noted it had long been a priority for Adelson and his wife, Miriam. ""That is the most important thing that's ever happened in their life,"" Trump said. ""They love Israel.""
Trump's speech comes weeks after he suggested Democrats ""hate"" Jews. His remark followed an internal fight among Democrats over how to respond to comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that some criticized as anti-Semitic.
Trump mockingly thanked Omar as he began his speech, before adding, ""Oh, I forgot. She doesn't like Israel, I forgot, I'm sorry. No, she doesn't like Israel, does she? Please, I apologize.""
He also accused Democrats of allowing anti-Semitism to ""take root"" in their party.
Before Trump's appearance, people assembled for the event carried signs with ""We are Jews for Trump"" and ""Trump"" written in Hebrew. Dozens of men and several women wore red yarmulkes with ""Trump"" in white that were distributed at the event.
Trump also took credit for eliminating hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians and for pulling the U.S. out of several U.N. organizations, the U.N. Human Rights Council and UNESCO, citing anti-Israel bias in their agendas.
Trump criticized some 2020 Democrats who have suggesting they would re-enter the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew the United States. The agreement was fiercely opposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has cheered as Trump re-imposed stringent new sanctions on the country that Israel regards as an existential threat. Trump is closely aligned with Netanayu, who's seeking to return power in Tuesday's national election.
Trump predicted that election is ""gonna be close,"" adding it features ""Two good people,"" seemingly referring to Netanyahu and his chief threat to Netanyahu's coalition, former Israeli army chief of staff, Benny Gantz.
Despite his criticism of Democrats, Trump has faced his own criticism from the Jewish community. Trump was slow to condemn white supremacists who marched violently in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The previous year, he circulated an image of a six-pointed star alongside a photo of Hillary Clinton, a pile of money and the words ""most corrupt candidate ever.""
When he addressed the RJC in 2015 he said he didn't expect to earn their support because he wouldn't take their money. ""You want to control your politicians, that's fine,"" Trump said at the time. Ultimately, the group and many of its donors backed Trump.
Trump met privately with Adelson before speaking, according to an official. Adelson has cancer and has been in poor health, but he and his wife attended Trump's remarks "" receiving a standing ovation when they entered the ballroom.
The Adelsons gave Trump's campaign $30 million in 2016. They followed that by contributing $100 million to the Republican Party for the 2018 midterm elections.
Introducing Trump, former Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., the chairman of the RJC, led the audience in an adapted version of the Passover reading ""Dayenu,"" as he recounted what Trump had done for Israel.
Stuart Weil, a Jewish man from Fresno, California, said Americans have traditionally been very supportive of Israel but ""the progressive, liberal wing of the Democratic Party"" is changing that.
Weil, who wore a blue Trump-style hat that read, ""Making Israel & America Great Again,"" says he's a Republican because of the party's strong stance on Israel.
According to AP Votecast, a survey of more than 115,000 midterm voters and 3,500 Jewish voters nationwide, voters who identified as Jewish broke for Democrats over Republicans by a wide margin, 72 percent to 26 percent, in 2018.
Over the past decade, Jewish voters have shown stability in their partisanship, according to data from Pew Research Center. Jewish voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a roughly 2-1 ratio.

AFP/Getty Images Washington And The World Kim Jong Un’s Warning to Trump North Korea’s leader is telling Washington that his patience is wearing out. But his New Year’s Day speech contained other fascinating clues to Kim’s ambitions for 2019—and beyond. By ANKIT PANDA Continue to article content
Ankit Panda is an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists and a senior editor at The Diplomat. Follow him on Twitter at @nktpnd .
Kim Jong Un had a simple message for U.S. President Donald J. Trump during his New Year’s Day address . Echoing months of statements carried in North Korean state media since the June 12, 2018, summit meeting between the two leaders in Singapore, Kim noted that he had followed through in good faith on measures to signal his interest in seeing through “complete denuclearization” on the Korean Peninsula. In two words, Kim’s message for the United States: “Your turn.”
It’s a message Kim has been repeating since June 13 , when the North Korean leader was paraphrased in his state media as vowing that “if the U.S. side takes genuine measures for building trust in order to improve the DPRK-U.S. relationship,” North Korea would offer up further concessions. In Kim’s view, he had offered up ample concessions in 2018 to merit concessions from the Trump administration, which remains fixated on offering North Korea sanctions relief and other inducements only after the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea is attained. Story Continued Below
In 2017 and 2018, Kim had a habit of telling us what he was going to do in the year ahead and then proceed to do it. While North Korea is often painted as an opaque state, impossible to predict, the truth is that Kim has been remarkably transparent about his intentions. On defense and nuclear matters, at least, North Korean policy has remained static through his tenure.
In 2017, for instance, Kim promised that North Korea would acquire a capability to strike the U.S. mainland that year. By November, he showed that he had successfully overseen that project, with two intercontinental-range ballistic missile designs having been flight-tested successfully. Similarly, in 2018, Kim ordered the mass production of ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. Per multiple reports last year citing U.S. intelligence assessments, that’s happened, too—even as Kim jetted off to foreign capitals, shedding his reputation as a hermit king.
Kim recounted this history in his speech, underlining North Korea’s internal and external promises to behave responsibly as a nuclear weapons-possessing state. He noted that North Korea had “declared … that we would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them, and we have taken various practical measures [in this regard].”
This line may sound new and significant, but it isn’t. It reiterates directives dating back at least to North Korea’s March 2013 adoption of nuclear-state status . In that declaration, the Kim regime pledged to handle nuclear materials securely, not proliferate them, and to only use nuclear weapons in circumstances where it perceived its national security and survival to be threatened. (North Korea has been promising not to proliferate its nukes for years before Kim Jong Un.)
Kim’s “your turn” message for Trump this year shouldn’t have surprised anyone paying attention. It was, after all, during the September 2018 summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that the North Korean leader signed his name onto a statement that suggested he might be open to the prospect of further disarmament gestures should the United States deliver “corresponding measures.” During the North Korean foreign minister’s address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York that same month, it became clear that the primary North Korean demand—as had been true for years—was the removal of international sanctions.
In April 2018, Kim had announced a unilateral suspension of nuclear tests and tests of the kinds of missiles that could strike the U.S. homeland. The gesture was at the time justified on the basis of technical parameters: Kim suggested that North Korea had sufficient testing data, had completed its deterrent force qualitatively, and could now cease testing. In subsequent weeks, however, those measures came to be described as “denuclearization steps” by North Korea. Kim was framing the mere cessation of testing as a significant concession on the pathway to the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
That phrase received particular attention in Kim’s New Year’s address, too. In December, a remarkable commentary in the state-run Korean Central News Agency attributed to the pen name Jong Hyon defined that phrase—and its geographic contours—in stark detail. “When we refer to the Korean Peninsula, they include both the area of the DPRK and the area of South Korea where aggression troops including the nuclear weapons of the U.S. are deployed,” the commentary noted, revealing North Korea’s continuing conspiratorial belief that U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were removed from the Peninsula in 1991 remain there.
“When we refer to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it, therefore, means removing all elements of nuclear threats from the areas of both the north and the south of Korea and also from surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted. This should be clearly understood,” the commentary added.
Kim Jong Un emphasized this same message, though less explicitly. He noted that U.S. “strategic assets”—a North Korea phrase used to mean everything from ballistic missile defense capabilities like THAAD to nuclear attack submarines and aircraft carriers—“should no longer be permitted” on or around the Korean Peninsula.
It’s here too that Kim seized on the tremendous progress North Korea made in 2018 to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. Pointing to the success in the implementation of the September 19 inter-Korean Comprehensive Military Agreement, which saw a range of tension reduction measures on land, at sea and in the air, Kim said South Korea should cease “joint military exercises with foreign forces.” The allies have already announced that the upcoming 2019 iterations of Foal Eagle and Key Resolve—the large springtime exercises—will be modified to allow diplomacy to proceed with North Korea. But separately, Kim’s speech, which was broadcast live for the first time in South Korea, comes amid great discord between Seoul and Washington on the finalization of an agreement to govern burden-sharing within the alliance.
Going further, Kim encouraged his counterpart in the South to push ahead with inter-Korean projects without waiting for support from the United States—effectively an invitation to Moon to recognize the historic moment and push forward in the spirit of Korean self-determination, even if that meant violating international sanctions. Kim dangled specifically the prospect of resuming the operations of the Kaesong Industrial Park and tourism activities at Mt. Kumgang—two banner projects of the “Sunshine” era of inter-Korean rapprochement in the early 2000s, during the rule of his father, Kim Jong Il.
Zeroing in on what Kim said about the United States misses the broader significance of his speech. Although Kim spent about a quarter of his speech addressing inter-Korean issues and diplomacy with the United States — generating most of the headlines — it was primarily about internal affairs.
That other three-quarters reveals North Korean priorities in the year ahead. Namely, the “new strategic line” announced by Kim last year in April as a successor to the byungjin line , which sought the parallel attainment of a nuclear deterrent and economic prosperity, is here to stay. This strategic line remains without a name or a slogan for now, but North Korea’s core drive now is attaining economic self-sufficiency and prosperity—an updated version of its foundational ideology of juche .
It’s clear from his speech that Kim hopes to see through North Korea’s economic development regardless of changes in the external environment. He emphasizes the importance of industrial capacity-building, improvements in management techniques for facilities, attaining energy self-sufficiency and modernizing North Korea’s military. Last year, despite Kim’s relatively heavy travel schedule, he conducted multiple “on-the-spot guidance” visits to a range of North Korean industrial, health care and commercial facilities to direct this project of economic improvement. While Kim himself and his father and grandfather all have conducted these kinds of visits, his tours in 2018 were notable for the push toward modernization and development.
Kim also signaled that he recognizes that the United States won’t be lifting its sanctions anytime soon. As a result, North Korea intends to hedge by shifting away from its reliance on exporting coal—a sanctioned activity—to using it domestically. Kim additionally referenced “atomic power” in his speech, perhaps suggesting that 2019 may see a new push by North Korea to finalize and announce the operation of a new facility thought to be an experimental light-water reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex.
Kim did leave one warning on the table that should be taken seriously by Trump and his national security team. He warned the United States not to insist on his unilateral capitulation as it has been and, in the process, test North Korea’s “patience.” If it does, Pyongyang may “be compelled to find a new way for defending the sovereignty of the country and the supreme interests of the state and for achieving peace and stability of the Korean peninsula.”Kim conveyed again his willingness to meet Trump—and only Trump—but he also made clear that a second summit will have to open a door to the concessions that North Korea seeks from the United States.
What exactly Kim wants is left ambiguous, but even Trump—who has repeatedly tweeted about how much he appreciates the cessation of nuclear and missile testing—can guess what might lie on the other side. At some point in 2019, if the “corresponding measures” North Korea has been seeking from the United States fail to arrive, Kim will likely turn back to his old ways. The missiles will begin flying again as North Korea showcases the fruits of its qualitative and quantitative attainment in 2017 and 2018. A North Korean statement in the final days of 2018 alluded to this , suggesting that the U.S. State Department was “bent on bringing DPRK-U.S. relations back to the status of last year, which was marked by exchanges of fire.” Given progress on the inter-Korean front in the meantime, Kim may be betting that South Koreans supportive of Moon’s inter-Korean peace push will be eager to blame the collapse of diplomacy on the United States, dealing a blow to the already-troubled U.S.-South Korea alliance in the process."

Texas Tech has earned a trip to Monday night's championship game to face Virginia.
The Red Raiders beat Michigan State 61-51 in Saturday night's second national semifinal.
Matt Mooney scored 22 points to lead Texas Tech, which is playing in its first Final Four.
Leading scorer Jarrett Culver was quiet for much of the night, but he scored six straight points to keep the Red Raiders in control after the Spartans had cut a 13-point deficit to 52-51 with 2:54 left.
Texas Tech shot 56 percent after halftime, while its trademark defensive edge locked down on Michigan State. The Spartans shot just 32 percent, including 8 of 24 in the second half.

The foul called with 0.6 seconds left on Auburn in the first semifinal became an instant classic, when Virginia's Kyle Guy made three free throws to give the Cavaliers a 63-62 victory.
But there was another officiating decision, or in this case non-decision, that drew heavy scrutiny from TV viewers and disgust from Tigers fans. Ty Jerome appeared to be guilty of a double dribble on his way up the court in the closing seconds, prior to the fateful play.
The NCAA said the correct call was made on the foul, but the organization declined to comment on whether or not a double dribble should have been called.

9:05 p.m.
The NCAA says the foul on Auburn's Samir Doughty with 0.6 seconds left in the first Final Four game against Virginia was the correct call.
National coordinator of officiating J.D. Collins released a statement through the NCAA that said the whistle by official James Breeding was in accordance with Rule 4, Section 39.i. That states: ""Verticality applies to a legal position and also to both the offensive and defensive players. The basic components of the principle of verticality are: The defender may not 'belly up' or use the lower part of the body or arms to cause contact outside his vertical plane or inside the opponent's vertical plane.""
Doughty's foul gave Kyle Guy three free throws with the Cavaliers trailing 62-60. Guy made all three to send Virginia to the national championship game for the first time in program history.

Surprise, surprise! Defense is the name of the game again tonight, with Texas Tech's stifling half-court pressure enough to produce a 23-21 lead over Michigan State at halftime in the second national semifinal at U.S. Bank Stadium.
The Spartans made only one of nine field goals over the final 7 � minutes of the first period, a 3-pointer by Cassius Winston with 1:03 left. They're 7 for 23 from the field, with nine points apiece from Winston and Matt McQuaid.
The Red Raiders, who have allowed the third-fewest points per game in the nation this season, have nine points from Matt Mooney.

The celebrity factor is always high at the Final Four, and Texas Tech and Michigan State each have a hotshot NFL quarterback on their side in the house in Minneapolis.
Minnesota's Kirk Cousins is cheering on his Spartans, in the same stadium where he plays for the Vikings in the fall. Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes III is rooting on his Red Raiders, with Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce sitting next to him in the seats.
Cousins and Mahomes traded tweets earlier in the day, with Cousins sending a #GoGreen hash tag with a GIF of the Sparty mascot at Mahomes. Mahomes directed a #GunsUp hash tag with a GIF of mascot Raider Red at Cousins.
Both NFL stars were shown on the scoreboard, prompting loud roars from the respective fan bases.
Cousins is third on the current NFL list of average annual contract value for quarterbacks at $28 million. Mahomes, the 2018 NFL MVP, is 32nd at $4.1 million.

The second national semifinal game has begun at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis between Texas Tech and Michigan State, with Virginia waiting for the winner in the championship on Monday night.
Spartans coach Tom Izzo has taken his team to the Final Four for the eighth time, with point guard Cassius Winston leading the way this season after surviving the stacked East Region and defeating consensus favorite Duke, the No. 1 overall seed, in the Elite Eight.
This is the first appearance for the Red Raiders, who are coached by Chris Beard and fueled his relentlessly aggressive defensive approach. The Red Raiders also beat a No. 1 seed to get here, taking down Gonzaga in the West Region final last weekend.

Several members of the Auburn student section were escorted out of U.S. Bank Stadium by police after the Tigers lost to Virginia 63-62 on three foul shots by Kyle Guy in the final second of the game.
The free throws came after the Tigers had rallied from a 10-point second-half deficit, and after it appeared that the Tigers had won the game. Guy missed a 3-pointer from the corner and the buzzer sounded, and Auburn players began spilling onto the court to celebrate.
But official James Breeding had whistled a foul on the Tigers' Samir Doughty for bumping into Guy on the shot, and that gave one of Virginia's best free-throw shooters a chance to win the game.

The Tigers had used a 14-0 run in the closing minutes to turn what had been a 10-point deficit into a 61-57 lead with 19.3 seconds left. Guy answered with a 3-pointer to give Virginia a chance, and the Tigers' Jared Harper could only make the front end of a one-and-one with 7.4 seconds left.
Virginia was not yet in the bonus, and Auburn brilliantly used a couple of fouls to whittle time off the clock. The Cavaliers wound up with 1.5 seconds to work and got the ball to Guy, who was bumped by the Tigers' Samir Doughty on a 3-point shot from the corner.
The buzzer sounded and Auburn thought it had won, but official James Breeding had called a foul and sent Guy to the line. He made all three free throws and the Tigers' desperation heave was no good.

Virginia's defense is doing a good job of protecting the rim against undersized Auburn.
The Cavaliers have blocked seven shots as of midway through the second half of Saturday's national semifinal. That includes three in the paint in the second half, one being a dunk attempt that was stuffed by De'Andre Hunter.
Mamadi Diakite has blocked four shots for Virginia, which had managed seven or more blocks just twice all season. The Cavaliers' season high is eight late in the regular season against Syracuse.

Virginia is dictating its typical snail-like tempo, and a barrage of 3-pointers has given the Cavaliers their biggest lead of the game at 50-43 over Auburn with less than 8 minutes to go.
Meanwhile, the starting lineups are out for the second national semifinal.
Texas Tech is going with the same veteran group that propelled it to the first Final Four in school history. That means sophomores Jarrett Culver and Davide Morretti will join seniors Tariq Owens, Norense Odiase and Matt Mooney when the Red Raiders face Michigan State.
The Spartans counter with Big Ten player of the year Cassius Winston and Matt McQuaid in the backcourt, and Kenny Goins, Aaron Henry and Xavier Tillman in the frontcourt.

The first eight points of the second half belongd to Virginia.
So does the pace of play. And the rebounding battle. And the momentum. And most importantly, the lead. The Cavaliers have edged ahead 36-31 with 14 1/2 minutes to go in the national semifinals.
The Tigers missed their first eight shots to start the second half. They've been particularly bad from the 3-point arc, where Bryce Brown's latest miss left them 3 for 19 from 3.
Auburn coach Bruce Pearl dismissed any concerns about his sharpshooting team's ability to make shots in a football stadium, saying Thursday that the rims were ""soft."" They haven't been so far.

The second half between Auburn and Virginia is under way with a national title berth at stake.
The Tigers were just 3 of 14 from beyond the 3-point arc in the first half, though they still managed to take a 31-28 lead into the locker room. A big reason for that was their ability to get to the rim against a Virginia defense that is designed to prevent just that.
The Cavaliers are leaning on Ty Jerome, who had 13 points in the first half.
Virginia center Jack Salt played only 2 minutes in the first half because of foul trouble, and that meant a short bench for coach Tony Bennett. Salt should figure more prominently in the second half.

Auburn is 20 minutes away from the national title game after what might go down as one of the fastest first halves in Final Four history.
The Tigers lead Virginia 31-28 at the break. But the teams burned through the first half in less than 40 minutes of real time, thanks in part to seven total turnovers and nine total fouls.
In fact, there was never an under-4 minute media timeout because there was never a dead ball down the stretch. Missed shots were cleanly rebounded, neither team turned it over and there was never a blown whistle for a foul "" so the teams kept on playing.

The first 10 minutes of the Final Four matchup between Auburn and Virginia is going about as expected: The Tigers are throwing up 3-pointers and the Cavaliers are slowing the pace.
Worth watching, though: Virginia center Jack Salt already has two fouls.
The Cavaliers figured to have an advantage in the paint with Auburn missing 6-foot-8 forward Chuma Okeke to a knee injury. But the 6-10 Salt is on the bench, where he does Virginia no good.
Meanwhile, Auburn football coach Guz Malzahn got a big ovation when he was shown on the video screens inside U.S. Bank Arena.

The betting public is split on Virginia and Auburn in the first game of the Final Four.
Betting data released by William Hill US on Saturday night shows more wagers are being placed on Auburn on spread and money line bets, but more money for both wagers is backing Virginia.
That difference shows a split between sharp bettors gambling more money per bet and a higher number of casual bettors who wager less.
The difference is especially stark on the money line, which is minus-300 for Virginia, meaning a gambler would need to bet $300 to win $100. William Hill says 77% of wagers are backing Auburn, where a $100 bet can win $250 if the Tigers win the game outright. Still, 72% of the money is favoring Virginia to win straight up.
The money line bet between Texas Tech and Michigan State is seeing a similar divide, with sharp bettors heavily backing the Spartans (92 and more tickets on Texas Tech (58%).

It's been McLemore and sixth man Danjel Purifoy who have picked up the minutes in place of forward Chuma Okeke, who tore the ACL in his left knee late in a regional semifinal win over North Carolina.
Virginia is going with freshman Kihei Clark and juniors Kyle Guy and Ty Jerome in the backcourt, and De'Andre Hunter and Mamadi Diakite provide some length and ability to guard down low.

It could also be just a ruse, though. The Baltimore Sun received a text message from Odom saying of the rumor, ""Nothing to it."" The newspaper also reported that two anonymous sources said the 44-year-old Odom ""a longtime Virginia Tech assistant under Seth Greenberg "" isn't going anywhere.

BRIDGEPORT, Conn. — Ryan Bourque scored two goals and Travis St. Denis had the eventual game-winner in the third period as the Bridgeport Sound Tigers skated to a 4-3 victory over the Providence Bruins on Saturday night.
The P-Bruins got two goals from Paul Carey, along with a goal from Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson. Dan Vladar made 22 saves in the loss.
The two teams, which combined for 14 goals in an 8-6 Providence victory on Friday, scored four in the first period on Saturday. Bridgeport scored just 3:29 into the game when Bourque tipped in a Kyle Burroughs shot. At 12:50, Oliver Wahlstrom blasted a one-timer past Vladar on the power play to make it 2-0. Mitchell Vande Sompel and Josh Ho-Sang picked up assists on the goal.
Carey then took over the period, scoring twice in the final 4:06 to tie it. He scored his 24th goal of the season at 15:54 as he walked in from the point and beat Christopher Gibson with a wrister. Lee Stempniak and Jakub Zboril earned assists. With 42 seconds left in the period, Jordan Szwarz fed Carey, who was cutting in alone toward Gibson, and he deflected it in for his second goal. Cooper Zech also earned the second assist.
Bridgeport regained the lead 4:46 into the second period as Bourque netted his second goal. Stephen Gionta sent a lead-pass to Bourque, who split a pair of Providence defenders and beat Vladar on a breakaway.
St. Denis made it 4-2 at 6:27 of the third period with a power-play goal. Grant Hutton fired a slap shot that Steve Bernier tipped behind Vladar and St. Denis knocked it in for his 16th goal of the year.
Providence cut the deficit to 4-3 with 10:54 remaining when Forsbacka Karlsson’s centering pass to Stempniak went off a defender and past Gibson. Stempniak and Victor Berglund earned assists.

Trumps North Korea tweet on sanctions aims to please Kim Jong Un,www.vox.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18277581/trump-north-korea-tweet-sanctions-kim,"President Donald Trump talks to reporters before departing the White House March 22, 2019, in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Donald Trump just reversed a plan to impose sanctions on North Korea intended to strangle its economy — something that his own administration recently said was vitally important. The Trump administration’s chosen strategy for dealing with North Korea’s nuclear program has long been to place sanctions on the country, until it has no choice but to dismantle its arsenal. Should Pyongyang do that, Washington would lift the sanctions in return. Last month, Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a summit to haggle over the nuclear program’s future, and many expected them to make a deal . But they came nowhere close to striking such an accord. In response, the US planned to place new and larger sanctions on North Korea next week. But Trump didn’t make that known at the time with his Friday tweet , making it seem like he was talking about something else. It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2019 Indeed, many thought he was referring to sanctions, announced on Thursday, on two Chinese shipping companies for continuing to trade with North Korea. Members of the National Security Council, the White House team that helps the government coordinate foreign policy, even met with reporters to discuss the necessity of the financial penalties. John Bolton , Trump’s national security adviser, also tweeted on Thursday about how important the sanctions move was. That’s why experts who track Trump’s North Korea policy were immediately confused by Trump’s tweet. “What the actual f*ck is going on,” tweeted Grace Liu , a North Korea expert with the Middle Institute for International Studies. Others felt the same sentiment . White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tried to explain, saying: “President Trump likes Chairman Kim and he doesn’t think these sanctions will be necessary,” according to a White House pool report. So here’s what this seemingly means: Trump just defied his own administration in order to make Kim happy, even though the North Korea leader is a brutal dictator who has done next to nothing to dismantle his nuclear program. There’s a potential reason why: According to one person familiar with the situation, Trump is worried that Kim may back out of diplomatic efforts after the no-deal summit in Vietnam. The worry is somewhat justified, as it seemed North Korea planned to launch a satellite earlier this month and on Friday withdrew officials from a liaison office with South Korea . The real problem, though, isn’t Trump’s sudden sanctions reversal — but rather what it says about his North Korea policy. Trump and Trump’s government are two separate things Adam Mount , a North Korea expert at the Federation of American Scientists, tweeted his main reaction to Trump’s announcement. Over and over officials and optimists explain to me that negotiations policy is rational, unified, coordinated, managed by experts, that DPRK could never divide the government or the alliance, that the president effectively exerts leverage. Somehow I'm still not convinced. https://t.co/l6D3bC8nUr — Adam Mount (@ajmount) March 22, 2019 That, in a nutshell, is the main takeaway. Trump’s government went ahead with devising the sanctions and working to implement them. But Trump clearly wasn’t too aware of what was going on. When he heard about it, it seems, he ordered the process to stop. It’s another example of how American foreign policy is increasingly driven by Trump’s whims, and that especially applies to US-North Korea nuclear negotiations. There is a generous interpretation of what just happened, though. Trump, in an effort to look like the good guy, could have orchestrated an entire scheme whereby the US seemed like it was about to place sanctions on North Korea but he single-handedly stopped them — all to let Kim know he’s still willing to play nice. But based on months and months of America’s negotiations with North Korea , which have been nothing short of chaotic, that seems unlikely. In fact, what Trump’s tweet on Friday really shows is that when it comes to his North Korea policy, chaos still reigns. In this Storystream"

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) "" Leaders with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints delivered spiritual guidance aimed at strengthening members' faith amid a world of temptation and immorality and reaffirmed the faith's opposition to gay marriage during a church conference Saturday in Utah.
Many church members had been bracing for more announcements of change during the two-day conference because church President Russell M. Nelson has made a flurry of moves in his first year at the helm. Those decisions included the surprising repeal Thursday of 2015 policies that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled people in same-sex marriages as sinners eligible for expulsion.
But through the first three sessions Saturday, faith leaders instead focused speeches on how members can become better followers of the faith. During an all-men's session Saturday night, Nelson encouraged men to be better husbands by making their wives a higher priority than watching sports.
""Your first and foremost duty as a bearer of the priesthood is to love and care for your wife. Become one with her. Be her partner,"" Nelson said. ""Make it easy for her to want to be yours. No other interest in life should take priority over building an eternal relationship with her.""
Neil L. Andersen, a member of a top governing panel called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, spoke about the importance of one of the religion's signature proclamations that states marriage should be reserved for relationships between man and a woman and that a person's God-given gender is an essential part of a person's eternal identity.
""If we pick and choose what we accept in the proclamation, we cloud our eternal view,"" Andersen said.
He acknowledged that not all church members fit within the proclamation's boundaries and seemed to suggest there is room for LGBTQ members by offering an example of a gay member who follows church teachings to not engage in same-sex relationships to remain a faithful member.
""Some will say, 'You don't understand my situation.' I may not, but I testify that there is one who does understand,"" Andersen said. ""There is one who, because of his sacrifice made in the garden and on the cross, knows your burdens. As you seek him and keep his commandments, I promise you that He will bless you and lift the burdens too heavy to bear alone.""
The Utah-based faith widely known as the Mormon church has long opposed gay marriage and same-sex intimacy. But it has spent much of the last decade trying to carve out a more compassionate and welcoming stance toward LGBTQ members.
The conference brings about 100,000 people to Salt Lake City to watch five sessions in person. Millions more watch live broadcasts and livestreams.
Ulisses Soares, a Brazilian-born member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, cited Nelson's recent remarks about a world with ""rampant immorality and addictive pornography"" as he told members to root their families in the teachings of Christ and never reject family members or friends who stray from the correct path.
""Fill your hearts with compassion, run to them, fall on their neck, and kiss them, like the father of the prodigal son did,"" Soares said.
Becky Craven, a member of the Young Women General Presidency, dovetailed on Soares' speech by instructing members not to fall victim to temptation and be diligent following the faith's teachings. Craven advised members to make sure they don't let modern fashion prevent them from dressing modestly, especially in worship settings.
""As a covenant people, we are not meant to blend in with the rest of the world,"" Craven said. ""We have been called a peculiar people - what a compliment.""
The Utah-based faith teaches abstinence from alcohol, instructs members to wait until marriage to engage in sexual relations and encourages a modest dress code. The faith opposes same-sex relationships. The religion, widely known as the Mormon church, also asks members to avoid coffee and hot drinks as part of its health code.
Dieter Uchtdorf, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, issued a plea for members to openly discuss their faith with others in ways that feels normal and natural and embrace the proselytizing component of the faith. He said church members can share their faith through an act of kindness or by posting testimonials on social media.
Uchtdorf encouraged members to talk about the new shortened Sunday worship schedule, from three hours to two, or explain the faith's push for use of the full name that emphasizes the faith's belief it is the ""Church of Jesus Christ."" The religion is trying to end the use of previously accepted shorthand names ""Mormon"" and ""LDS.""
Church membership growth and the number of convert baptisms have slowed in recent years. The new total membership announced Saturday of 16.3 million marked a mere 1.2 % increase from 2017 "" the slowest membership growth rate since 1937 according to �independent church researcher Matt Martinich.
Uchtdorf advised members not to get discouraged by people who don't immediately accept an invitation to join, suggesting patience is key.
""If we interact with people with the sole expectation that they soon will don a white jumpsuit and ask for directions to the nearest baptismal font, we're doing it wrong,"" said Uchtdorf, referring to a baptismal ceremony for new members. ""Some who come and see will, perhaps, never join the church; some will at a later time. That is their choice. But that doesn't change our love for them.""
Nelson, 94, ascended to the presidency in January 2018 after nearly three decades in a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve that helps the president lead the faith.
He launched a campaign calling on people to stop using the shorthand names ""Mormon"" and ""LDS,"" severed the faith's ties with the Boy Scouts of America after a century, revised how leaders handle closed-door interviews with young people and changed rules to allow missionaries to speak with their families more often.
Quorum of the Twelve member M. Russell Ballard said Nelson is ""carrying the Lord's work forward at a breathtaking pace.""
""I worry that the spiritual purposes of these adjustments might become lost in the excitement about the changes themselves,"" said Ballard, adding later: ""Let's not complicate things with additional meetings, expectations, or requirements. Keep it simple. It is in that simplicity that you will find the peace, joy, and happiness."" Never miss a story
