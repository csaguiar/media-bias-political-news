I don't think there's not much we can do to influence overpopulation in other countries. We should rather encourage human rights & education issues. When economies do well, some countries tend to pay attention to population numbers. But, some of the horror stories about China's previous population control practices can make it a touchy subject. Plans to protect air and water, wilderness and wildlife, are in fact plans to protect man - Stewart Udall 1,196 Re: Should be doing more to address overpopulation in the third world? Overpopulation is nothing new. Back in the 1800s, a man by the name of Thomas Malthus saw that Great Britain's population was growing faster than ever. The reason for this is because of falling death rates. You see, for most of human history, mothers had many kids but many of them would die before reaching adulthood, primarily from disabilities and diseases. With the imporvement of healthcare and the arrival of vaccines, child mortality rates fell and the children who survived and ended up having children of their own, this naturally cause the population to grow faster. Overpopulation fearmongering is based on the idea that resources are limited and thus any population increase will reduce the number of resources per person. While resources are finite, innovation can allow for resources to be used more efficiently and for more resources to be discovered. Malthus was concerned that the growing population would increase poverty. He knew that prodution was increasing but beleived that it only increased linearly while population grew exponentially. In reality, production grew quicker than the population and poverty was lower at the end of the 19th century than at the beginning despite the population increasing by 60%. In the 1960s, Paul Ehrlich predicted that a worldwide famine would take hold within 20 years due to overpopulation. He stated that there was no way that India could feed its growing population. the world population is twice as high as it was in the 60s and India's is triple, despite this, there were no worldwide famines and poverty actually fell (India currently hosts one of the world's fastest growing economies). At the current rate of population growth, the population at the end of the 21st century will be close to 30 billion, but due to potential technologies such as desalination, GMOs, vertical farming, aquaculture, and cultured meat (a large percentage of our crops go towards feeding animals and thus artificial meat would save on resources), our ability to produce keeps going up. However, the world population won't be anywhere near 30 billion because fertility rates are falling. You see, after the death rate falls, the birth rate also begins to fall. There are a few reasons for this. For one, with a guerantee that pretty much all of your kids will survive, the need to have many children goes down. Another is that having kids as a farmer is an asset while having them in an urban area is a liability (industrialization draws people to the cities). Other factors include increased access to birth control, more education (having kids later will naturally lead to less kids overall), and increased labor force participation from women. Eventually, the fertility rate will reach its final resting place as it has in most developed countries. The UN projects that the 2100 population will be 10-12 billion. And unless we discover immortality which triggers runaway growth of life expectancy, the population will remain roughly at that level."

It was tried once, it was called Prohibition. The 18th amendment outlawed alcohol which lead to the rise of organized crime and the mafia. Does the name Al Capone mean anything to you. It was repealed by the 21st amendment. People who want to drink will find a way to drink. Speakeasy's, bathtub gin, white lightening, home made stills, home made beer, and on and on. Do we really want to go through all of that again?

Scientists have made a surprising discovery about how strange bacteria that live in soil and sediment can conduct electricity.

Scientists had believed Geobacter sulfurreducens conducted electricity through common, hair-like appendages called pili. Instead, a researcher at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and his collaborators have determined that the bacteria transmit electricity through immaculately ordered fibers made of an entirely different protein.

Trump Isn't The First President To Try And Close The Border,crooksandliars.com,The Conversation,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/trump-isnt-first-president-try-and-close,"Aileen Teague , Brown University
Just a week ago, President Donald Trump appeared poised to take the drastic step of closing the U.S.-Mexico border to both trade and travel. He said he wanted to stop the flood of Central American migrants entering the United States but also punish Mexico for failing to do so.
But on April 4, the president backpedaled and instead gave Mexico a year to stop the flow of drugs across the border. If that didn’t happen, he threatened, auto tariffs would be imposed – and the president suggested he might still close the border if that didn’t work.
If Trump ever follows through on his threat and puts up a closed sign at the southern border, it wouldn’t be the first time. Twice in the last half-century the U.S. has tried to use the border to force Mexico to bend to America’s will. The ruse failed both times.
I studied these incidents while researching for a book on the origins of U.S. drug control policies and militarized policing techniques in Mexico from the 1960s to the 1990s. The history suggests that threats of border closure may be politically useful but are never a real answer to human tragedy. Operation Intercept
In 1969, President Richard Nixon launched Operation Intercept in hopes of forcing Mexico to collaborate more fully with his administration’s policies to stop the flow of drugs – one of his campaign promises .
Although it technically wasn’t a full border closure, it required customs agents to search every car, truck and bus entering the United States. This caused long delays and a significant drop in economic activity in both countries. Border businesses and politicians begged Nixon to end Operation Intercept.
Meanwhile, Mexican leaders paid lip service to U.S. demands, based on my archival research. They highlighted the progress they had already made in their anti-drug operations and vowed to “continue with increasing intensity.”
Mexico even said it was willing to accept American anti-drug aid – such as aircraft and sophisticated weaponry – in order to help the Nixon administration fight its drug war. ↓ Story continues below ↓
In the end, however, nothing substantial changed. The border reopened after three weeks.
The incident did, however, teach Mexican leaders how to appease similar American demands in the future by using the right “war on drugs” rhetoric.
But in practice, drug control was never a top priority of the Mexican government. And Mexico even used American anti-drug policies to its own advantage. For example, in the 1970s, the country received U.S. financial aid to stem the flow of drugs. It used at least some of the money to suppress domestic political dissent instead. History repeats
The war on drugs also inspired President Ronald Reagan’s partial border closure in 1985. Aptly named Operation Intercept II, it suffered a similar fate.
The Mexican authorities were unable to find a kidnapped Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and the White House once again decided to use the border to force them into more vigorous action, closing nine checkpoints.
Ordinary Mexicans saw this border closure as yet another form of “Yankee imperialism.” They wondered how the disappearance of one agent could cause such an uproar when hundreds of Mexicans had been killed as a result of our “war on drugs.” The abducted agent was later found dead.
Although the border was reopened within a matter of days, once again, the shutdown severely hurt the border economy – as well as relations between the two countries. Border closings make bad policy
Both versions of Operation Intercept were severely disruptive while failing to motivate any meaningful changes in Mexican policy on drug control, border security or anything else.
Put another way, they showed that it is effectively impossible to close the U.S.-Mexico border, or to severely restrict traffic, for any extended period of time. The economic, social and cultural interdependence of Mexico and the United States is too deep . And U.S. national security depends on strong relations with Mexico.
Trump’s warnings about an “invasion” of Hispanic rapists and gang members may appeal to his supporters. His threat to close the border may as well. But, as his advisers apparently pointed out to him , border closings do little more than damage economies and foster resentments. Immigration would dip but hardly stop.
Mexico and the United States are allies, not enemies. The way I see it, pushing Mexico and other nations to do America’s bidding on highly complex problems like drug control and migration simply produces more antagonism while failing to achieve the desired results.

Donald John Trump 2020 Dem hits back at Trump for giving 'firefighting advice' to Paris: 'Do your own damn job' French officials reject Trump suggestion to use 'flying water tankers' on Notre Dame fire Overnight Energy: Interior watchdog opens investigation into new secretary | Warren unveils 2020 plan to stop drilling on public lands | Justices reject case challenging state nuclear subsidies | Court orders EPA to re-evaluate Obama pollution rule MORE said he does not need to hold a summit with the leaders of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras as he continues his calls for the countries to do more to prevent migrants from traveling to the U.S.
Trump has excoriated the countries for what he says is inadequate action in trying to stop illegal immigration into the U.S. He has repeatedly threatened to shutter the border with Mexico to stem an increase in illegal border crossings and last week halted foreign assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. ADVERTISEMENT
He’s maintained that the countries have stepped up efforts in recent days to combat the flow of migrants since he made the threats.
""No, no, I don't need a summit. I think we've done very well without the summit. They understand we stopped. We're saving $550 million. And I respectfully told — I thank him very much because for the last four days it's been great. You see that whole stream is drying up,"" he said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" that will air Saturday.
Trump has long criticized the Northern Triangle countries for failing to prevent migrants from making the trek, often placing the blame at the feet of the governments themselves and questioning why the U.S. provides them aid.
""We were paying them tremendous amounts of money, and we're not paying them anymore because they haven't done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,"" he said last week.
Trump this week also gave Mexico a one-year notice to address drug trafficking across the border and illegal immigration, threatening to slap auto tariffs on the country if it did not do enough to combat the rise in drugs and migrants coming into the U.S. He again warned he would shutter the border if the tariffs did not force further action.
""If the drugs don’t stop, or largely stop, we’re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, in particular cars. The whole ballgame is cars. And if that doesn’t stop the drugs, we close the border,"" the president said.
But Trump added that Mexico has stepped up its efforts to stem border crossings since he began making the threat.
""They could stop them at the southern border, their southern border,"" he told ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" ""And you look at what's happening now. They pulled in 1,500, 1,500 yesterday. They brought them back. They pulled in over 1,000 the day before, over 1,000 the day before that. Today I haven't gotten the number, but I mean it’s a lot.""
Trump’s claims that Mexico has started to deport Central American migrants in large numbers only this week runs counter to statistics from Mexico’s Department of the Interior .
Mexico interacted with 886,640 Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran migrants from 2011 through February 2019, including 472,249 (53 percent) in the four Mexican states that border Central America.
From 2001 to February 2019, Mexico deported 2.15 million people from the three countries."
Yang: ‘I’m 100% Ready’ To Rain Down Death If It Means Protecting US | The Daily Caller,dailycaller.com,Phillip Stucky,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/05/yang-rain-down-death/,"Entrepreneur and Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang asserted in a Friday interview with Chris Hayes that he would “100%” be comfortable with using force against foreign nations to defend U.S. interests.
Hayes asked Yang if he felt that, as an entrepreneur with no governing experience, he had the ability to order someone to die, or order someone to kill in battle. (RELATED: Democratic Candidate Andrew Yang Promises Government Crackdown On ‘Misinformation’)
“Well, one of the paramount responsibilities of the commander-in-chief is to keep the American people safe. While raining death on other people is not my first choice, if that’s what it would take to keep the American people safe, I’m 100% ready to do just that,” Yang answered.
Yang was also asked about how he planned to pay for his central idea of a “universal basic income,” and how he planned to execute that policy proposal.
“Martin Luther King championed it and called it the ‘guaranteed minimum income.’ It’s the policy where every citizen in America gets a certain amount of money to meet our basic needs, no questions asked. So my plan would put $1,000 a month in the hands of every American adult starting at age 18. This would make children and families stronger, improve our health, nutrition, graduation rates and help millions of Americans make transitions in this time of historic change,” he responded. Hayes followed up by asking if that would end up costing the nation an additional $33 billion per month.
“The price tag is a bit less than that. In part, because we’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars on many, many programs that in part substitute out the costs. But the big change we have to make to afford this freedom dividend is who’s going to win—Amazon, Google, Facebook, Uber, the biggest tech companies. We have to put the American people in a position to benefit from those innovations.”
Yang recently cleared the Democratic Party’s bar of support to join the first presidential primary debates Monday evening. “We did it!!! THANK YOU, everyone, who supported us to make it happen!! First stop debates next stop White House!!!” Yang said Monday on Twitter, announcing that he had earned 65,000 individual donors."

Comics Brown, 48, has written and illustrated surreal, funny comics for more than 20 years. His 2003 book Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography was nominated for the Eisner Award, the biggest prize in comics. In October reason asked Brown to list three lessons about liberty to be gleaned from comics.
1.) Superheroes act outside the law, so why can’t you? “Comic book superheroes don’t ask for any official government sanction to do what they do. There is an inherent antigovernment message there: We don’t have to rely on the state for law enforcement!”
2.) FDR was no good. “I have some issues of Harold Gray’s Little Orphan Annie , in which he really takes on FDR. He popularized anti–New Deal sentiments in the 1930s when doing so was not popular.”
3.) Censorship sucks. “Comic fans watched in the 1950s as people like Frederic Wertham tried to ban the books they read. It led to one of the most popular companies, EC Comics, canceling books like Tales From the Crypt . Quite a few outraged fans became suspicious of government power because of that.”"
"No, Ann, The Fact That The Accusation Against Joe Bides Was a “Hit” Doesn’t Mean It Wasn’t Necessary And Right.",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/05/no-ann-the-fact-that-the-accusation-against-joe-bides-was-a-hit-doesnt-mean-it-wasnt-necessary-and-right/,"Ann Althouse has fallen into the Biden harassment rationalization trap. How disappointing.
She writes,
“I’m not a Joe Biden fan. I thought he was loathsome in the 2012 VP debate with Paul Ryan (live-blogged here (“Ryan is speaking earnestly about preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons, and Biden is chuckling toothily, his body shaking like Santa Claus”)). And I’m a longtime opponent of sexual harassment (and kept true to the position even when Bill Clinton, the first person I ever voted for for President who won, got accused of it). But this hit job has made me sympathetic to Joe. I’m surprised how distinct and strong my emotional reaction is.” So am I.
As regular readers here know, Althouse is one of my most quoted commentators here, because she is objective and usually perceptive. Her mistake in sympathizing with Biden, however, betrays some kind of ethical blind spot. This is the common confusion of motive with conduct. If the conduct is objectively ethical, then the fact that there may be less than ethical motives behind it doesn’t change anything about the ethics verdict. No doubt about it, the first of the accusations against Biden for sexual harassment and misconduct (There have been more since ) came from a Bernie devotee, and was, as Ann says, a political hit.
This was not, however, some manufactured, dubious accusation ginned up to destroy a blameless target, as with Brett Kavanaugh. We have photographic evidence that Joe does these things, after all. If there were ten years of photos showing Judge Kavanaugh throwing women onto beds and jumping on them, Dr. Blasey-Ford’s accusation would have been a bit more credible, don’t you think?
As I have written so often I’m boring myself , Joe Biden has been advertising the principle that if you have enough power, you can get away with indulging yourself with conduct that is taboo in every workplace in America, and has been for almost 40 years. He has promoted sexual harassment, while holding the second highest office in the land, while supposedly being a leader in “the party of women.” This was arrogance, hypocrisy and stupidity exemplified, and it should have been stopped long ago, but whenever the whistle was going to be blown on Joe, it was about time. Yup, she should have flagged this habit in 2014 when it occurred, thus saving other women from Biden’s groping. That doesn’t mean she was obligated to let the hypocrisy continue forever.
I’m going to use photos of Joe in my upcoming sexual harassment seminar. He’s a harasser; it’s simple as that. If a candidate has committed a rape or a murder years ago, and a witness came forward to finally reveal what she knew, would the fact that it was a”political hit” change the necessity of doing so? Does someone who points out how wrong Biden’s conduct has been, and how harmful to the cause of discouraging harassment, have to do so out of altruistic motives only?
Ridiculous. The fact that Althouse, a lawyer, could even suggest such a thing makes me wonder it, like many men and women of her generation, she really doesn’t regard sexual harassment as that big a deal, even though she’s “against it.” (And Bill Clinton was accused of sexual harassment? Take me now, Lord…)
I have sister who is smarter than I am, and I have watched her, and many other brilliant female friends, have to work twice as hard to get to the same place men of their talents (or less) reach professionally, in part because of the insidious, paternalistic, demeaning, subjugating, but oh so nice behavior of men like Joe Biden, who with every kiss, hug and gentle tone send the message that the “fairer sex” is eye-candy for the big, strong men in the workplace, and, like children, weak and sensitive participants who need to be shown love and appreciation.
Women like Ann Althouse enable men like Joe Biden, and the toxic message he sends every time he unashamedly puts his hands on women without their consent. Share this:"
"Harassment At Starbucks: If This Were An Isolated Episode, It Wouldn’t Be Worth An Ethics Post—But It’s Not. Now What?",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/05/harassment-at-starbucks-if-this-were-an-isolated-episode-it-wouldnt-be-worth-an-ethics-post-but-its-not-now-what/,"/ Jack Marshall At a Palo Alto Starbucks this week, a man wearing a red Make America Great Again cap, minding his own business, was confronted by a furious Rebecca Parker Mankey, an appointed member of Palo Alto’s North Ventura Coordinated Area Plan Working Group and co-chairs the Bayshore Progressive Democrats. She began shouting that he was a”hater of brown people” and “Nazi scum,” and exhorted the other Starbucks customers and employees to join her in shaming him, . Mankey later said she was “heartbroken” that other “white people”—like her target— didn’t join her assault. “I called him more names and told him to call the police. Then I yelled and asked someone else at Starbucks to call the police. He wouldn’t call the police, so I called him a wimp. He got his stuff together to leave. I followed him to the register while he complained about me. Then chased him out of Starbucks yelling at him to get the fuck out of my town and never come back,” she wrote. One he was in the parking lot, she threatening to post pictures of him on social media—which she did—along with her version of the incident. She asked the public for help finding him so she could make sure he was harassed, saying, “I want him to have nowhere to hide.” After her ambush went “viral,” Mankey was fired from her job as an accountant. Her former employer, Gryphon Stringed Instruments, said they were inundated with angry phone calls and emails .
Mankey, meanwhile, in Stage Five Derangement, is urging people who encounter the man to harass him. “You do not want to be the person who didn’t speak up as we slipped into fascism,” she posted. “I am going to publicly shame him in town and try to get him fired and kicked out of every club he is in. I am going to go to his house march up and down carrying a sign that says he hates black people. I am going to organize protests where he works to make him feel as unsafe as he made every brown person he met today.”
Observations: Stand proud, Democrats. You are 100% accountable for this social malignancy. It is fascinating to witness the deranged resistance members who have complained of the danger of fascism since November 2016 behaving like fascists themselves. choosing bullying and intimidation to try to prevail in their political goals. They should be called on this in explicit terms. I want to see Howard Schultz asked why his employees at the Starbucks didn’t protect and defend their customer. Similarly, why didn’t other customers confront Mankey as she was abusing the man? I would have, because that’s what my father taught me to do in these situations, but I assume most–many–some Americans still believe in the community’s duty to stand up for the mistreated and oppressed? Or would Howard’s rich little caffeine addicts also have sat silently while brownshirts harassed a Jewish man? It was appropriate the this maniac was fired, but why didn’t her two progressive organizations also eject her? I have to assume that they approve of such conduct. Similarly, I am waiting to see widespread reporting and condemnation of the episode from non-conservative news sources and websites. The accounts keep emphasizing that the man Mankey attacked was elderly. So what? Her conduct would be equally horrible if he were 25. Every decent, able and responsible citizen should think about how he or she would respond if one of these attacks occurs in their presence. The news media is complicit in this phenomenon for spreading the Left’s Big Lie that the Trump administration “hates brown people.” Ask nascent Mankeys to back up that claim, and they literally have nothing (yes, wanting to enforce immigration laws is, in fact, not evidence of bigotry.) Has this phenomenon ever surfaced before since the Civil War. I don’t recall confrontations like this between veterans and hippies wearing peace signs, though I’m sure it happened. “Billy Jack” was about a redneck town bullying hippie students at a progressive school, but in that over-wrought morality play it was vicious and moronic bigots behaving that way.

It pains me to have to write this; after all, the 1986 World Series, best remembered for the potential Series-winning game the Red Sox choked away for good when the ball rolled under Bill Buckner’s legs (it wasn’t Bill fault, but never mind), is one of the traumas of my life. That was a thoroughly dislikable (but great) Mets team that won in 1986, and centerfielder Lenny Dykstra was the worst of them. Still, the perfidy, venality and cruelty of another member of that team requires me to take Lenny’s side.
Dykstra was an obnoxious player and has been in constant trouble since his retirement. In a new book released this week, “108 Stitches: Loose Threads, Ripping Yarns, and the Darndest Characters from My Time in the Game,” Dykstra’s team mate, turned broadcaster Ron Darling ( he’s on the left above, Lenny’s on the right ) claims that Dykstra used racial epithets to unsettle Boston Red Sox pitcher Oil Can Boyd, an African American, before Game #3 of the 1986 World Series. Darling has now repeated the accusation on three radio shows this week, as he wrote that Dykstra was “shouting every imaginable and unimaginable insult and expletive in his [Boyd’s] direction — foul, racist, hateful, hurtful stuff” when he was in the on-deck circle before leading off the game.
Dykstra denies it vehemently , Boyd says he never heard any slurs, and so far, at least, other ex-Mets Dwight Gooden, Kevin Mitchell and Darryl Strawberry also say they never heard Dykstra direct the slurs at Boyd, and none have confirmed Darling’s claim.
I’m sure the crude and boorish Dykstra was a major league jerk to have to be around in 1986, especially for a squeaky clean Yalie like Darling, but the guy is trying to rebuild his life. Unlike Darling, Dykstra is broke. In 2011, he was sentenced to house arrest after a bankruptcy fraud indictment, was indicted for drug possession and grand theft auto, and was jailed awaiting trial because he couldn’t post the $500,000 bail. He also couldn’t afford a lawyer, and had to make do with a public defender. Lenny pleaded no contest to three grand theft auto charges and one count of filing a false financial report in 2012. He spent almost three years in prison.
Now he’s a chastened old man, trying to survive. Being labeled a racist in public is one more burden he doesn’t need, especially when the Angry Left will generate a campaign to destroy anyone it deems unfit to exist in 2019. It is despicable, and truly kicking a man while he’s down, for Darling to strike at his struggling ex-team mate just to sell his book, and especially so if nobody but Darling was aware of Dykstra’s alleged efforts to denigrate Boyd. If a racial slur falls in a ballpark 40 years ago and nobody hears it but Ron Darling, did it really fall?
I hope Lenny sues."
"Morning Ethics Warm-Up, 4/5/ 2019: An Intersex Revolutionary War Hero! An Unethical Feminist Trailblazer!",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/05/morning-ethics-warm-up-4-5-2019-an-intersex-revolutionary-war-hero-an-unethical-feminist-trailblazer/,"/ Jack Marshall Good Morning!
Well, it was nice while it lasted. Thanks to prurient interest in a minor “Naked Teacher Principal” post, traffic on Ethics Alarms this week resembled those heady days of 2016, before ultra-Trump polarization, liberal commenter cowardice and Facebook’s ban took over. Incidentally, despite many thousand of “clicks,” the post in question didn’t get a single comment from the first-time visitors, meaning that said clicks were meaningless and useless.
1. About “Ma” Fergusen. As promised yesterday in my note a bout “The Highwaymen”, here is the “Ma” Fergusen saga, which is an ethics feast, though not a tasty one. (Source: T exas Politics ) Miriam Amanda Wallace (“Ma”) Ferguson (1875-1961), was the first woman governor of Texas. She served as the first lady of Texas during the gubernatorial terms of her husband James Edward Ferguson, who was impeached during his second administration for extensive corruption. When James failed to get his name on the ballot in 1924, Miriam entered the race for the Texas governorship, promising that if elected she would essentially be guided by her husband and that Texas thus would gain “two governors for the price of one.” She defeated the Republican nominee, George C. Butte, and was inaugurated fifteen days after Wyoming’s Nellie Ross, Miriam Ferguson became the second woman governor in United States history. Thus “Ma” helped set the precedent for future examples of wives being elected (irresponsibly) to offices they were not qualified for as substitutes for their husbands. “Ma” wasn’t the feminist pioneer she has sometimes been represented as. She was the opposite–you know, like Hillary Clinton. Ma Ferguson (the “Ma” comes from her initials) pardoned an average of 100 convicts a month, and there was considerable evidence that she and her puppeteer husband were taking bribes of land and cash payments. The Fergusons also appear to have leveraged highway commission road contracts into lucrative kickbacks. Though an attempt to impeach Ma failed, these controversies allowed Attorney General Daniel James Moody to defeat her for renomination in 1926 and win the governorship. She (that is, puppetmaster Pa) was back in office in 1932, as she won the governorship again on the wave of discontent over the Great Depression.
The portrayal of “Ma” as a strong, independent executive in “The Highwaymen” would have to be judged misleading.
2. Speaking of women, sort of. ..An intersex hero and role model may have emerged through the dim fog of history. Scientific researchers at Georgia Southern University claim that after years of study, their examination of skeletal remains of Revolutionary War hero, General Casimir Pulaski, ‘the Father of the American Cavalry’ has revealed that he was biologically female. Imagine if these had been George Washington’s remains…
3. Desperately seeking Plan O: As we knew they would, House Democrats have demanded the last six years of President Donald Trump‘s tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service in a letter from the House Ways and Means Committee to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, seeking both personal and business tax information from 2013-2018 , including individual and corporate tax returns. Democrats have been apoplectic that candidate Trump broke decades of tradition by refusing to reveal his taxes during the campaign, and have convinced themselves and “the resistance” that the returns will show criminal activity.
The Committee says it must see Trump’s taxes because to ensure “the accountability of our government and elected officials. To maintain trust in our democracy, the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly, as laws intend.” Ha. Translation: Impeachment plots A-N seem to have flopped, so we need a “Plan O.” The Committee also disingenuously claims that the it needs the records to help establish tax policies, unethically trying to use the authority under the tax code granted only to tax-writing committees in Congress that gives the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the power to request tax information on any filer.
This is so obviously a fishing expedition (or witch hunt, if you prefer) and it will be challenged in the courts. I would support a law requiring Presidential candidates to release their taxes, but there currently is no such law. The President can fight this and legitimately claim to be protecting the privacy of all citizens, and I think he’ll win.
4. Not that not being bitter makes one an Ethics Hero, but still: Is there anyone on earth with more reason to be angry and bitter than original Beatles drummer Pete Best, who was dumped by the group in favor of Ringo just before they were launched into fame, fortune, and immortality? Yet in a recent documentary, Best appears to be at peace, without rancor, and untainted by his epic bad luck. From The Spectator:
“Best, it turns out, remains a twinkly-eyed, cheery cove, more than reconciled to his place as a footnote in history, delighted to have spent his recent career — after a 20-year stint in the civil service — as a touring musician playing the kind of raw rock’n’roll the band did in Hamburg….as an exemplar of triumph over adversity, enduring happiness snatched from transient misery, Best does seem a pretty useful role model for all those of us who don’t even have a ‘Yellow Submarine’ in them, let alone an ‘Eleanor Rigby’ or a ‘A Day In the Life’.”
5. Will the truth about Medicare for All ever be made clear to the voting public? Fox had a town hall last night for a group of Democratic candidates, most of whom endorsed Bernie Sanders’ socialist vision of “Medicare For All.” Nobody, including the Fox News moderators, challenged the increasingly popular idea, which can be fairly summed up in the words of “Sidney Wang”:
In addition to being ruinously unaffordable, — co-sponsored Senator Bernie Sanders’s 2017 “Medicare for All” bill, co-sponsored by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, would abolish private insurance and force all Americans into a single government-run plan covering nearly all medical services,including hospital and doctor visits, prescription medication, and dental and vision care. Even Great Britain’s socialized medicine doesn’t ban private insurance. And the results over the pond? From Forbes:
Nearly a quarter of a million British patients have been waiting more than six months to receive planned medical treatment from the National Health Service, according to a recent report from the Royal College of Surgeons. More than 36,000 have been in treatment queues for nine months or more….
Long waits for care are endemic to government-run, single-payer systems like the NHS. Yet some U.S. lawmakers want to import that model from across the pond. That would be a massive blunder. Consider how long it takes to get care at the emergency room in Britain. Government data show that hospitals in England only saw 84.2% of patients within four hours in February. That’s well below the country’s goal of treating 95% of patients within four hours — a target the NHS hasn’t hit since 2015.
Now, instead of cutting wait times, the NHS is looking to scrap the goal.
Wait times for cancer treatment — where timeliness can be a matter of life and death — are also far too lengthy. According to January NHS England data, almost 25% of cancer patients didn’t start treatment on time despite an urgent referral by their primary care doctor. That’s the worst performance since records began in 2009.
And keep in mind that “on time” for the NHS is already 62 days after referral.
Unsurprisingly, British cancer patients fare worse than those in the United States. Only 81% of breast cancer patients in the United Kingdom live at least five years after diagnosis, compared to 89% in the United States. Just 83% of patients in the United Kingdom live five years after a prostate cancer diagnosis, versus 97% here in America.
The NHS also routinely denies patients access to treatment. More than half of NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups, which plan and commission health services within their local regions, are rationing cataract surgery. They call it a procedure of “limited clinical value.”
It’s hard to see how a surgery that can prevent blindness is of limited clinical value. Delaying surgery can cause patients’ vision to worsen — and thus put them at risk of falls or being unable to conduct basic daily activities…."

A Genealogy of Blue,kottke.org,Posted Tim Carmody,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://kottke.org/19/04/a-genealogy-of-blue,"A Genealogy of Blue posted by Tim Carmody Apr 05, 2019
Even colors have histories, and what vibrant histories they are. French historian Michel Pasteureau’s Blue: The History of A Color (he’s also done histories of red, green, and black) is capably reviewed by Jesse Russell in the Claremont Review of Books in an essay called “ The Colors of Our Dreams .” Russell offers the following luminous details.
Blue was once little-known in the Western palette. Homer’s sea was “wine dark”; blue would not be used as water’s color until the seventeenth century. It has evolved from its original association with warmth, heat, barbarism, and the creatures of the underworld, to its current association with calm, peace, and reverie. Like the unruly green, the Romans associated blue with the savage Celtae and Germani, who used the woad herb’s rich leaves for their blue pigments. These northern barbarians also painted themselves blue before war and religious rituals. The ancient Germans, according to Ovid, even dyed their whitening hair blue.
The Romans, in contrast, preferred the color red—the Latin word, “coloratus” was synonymous with that for red, ruber. The Romans and Greeks did import lapis lazuli, the exquisite blue rock, from exotic locals such as China, Iran, and Afghanistan. But neither used the barbaric blue for important figures or images, saving it for the backgrounds for white and red figures. Even the Greek words for blue, like the names of colors in the Bible, largely were meant to evoke certain states or feelings as opposed to exact visual colors. Blue, like green, was the color of death and barbarism. The nobler colors—white, red, and black—were preferred.
Blue’s fortunes changed in the Middle Ages when it became associated with both the heavens and heaven, and particularly an association with the Virgin Mary. French royalty adopted blue as their official color; and in modernity, the introduction of indigo from the Americas and the invention of Prussian blue in the early 18th century helped cement blue (along with white and red) as part of a tripartite color scheme that gave us the flags of Great Britain, the United States, and France.
And then along came Goethe:
By the mid-nineteenth century, blue became a Romantic symbol of melancholy. Among those guilty of luring the moody young to dress in blue was Wolfgang von Goethe who, in The Sorrows of Young Werther, depicted his title character in a blue coat. This, coupled with Werther’s untimely death, inspired a craze for blue coats and a mania for suicide among melancholy European youth. Werther’s blue jacket was matched by the blue flower in Novalis’s unfinished posthumous piece Heinrich von Ofterdingen, which narrates the tale of a medieval troubadour who seeks out the flower as a symbol of the authentic life of beauty and art. Young, melancholic Frenchmen were doubly encouraged in their swooning by the closeness shared by the French word for blue flower, “ancolie,” and the ending of “mélancholie.”
From Romanticism’s murky forest a host of verbal expressions bloomed, linking blue with odd, melancholic reverie. Fairy tales were known as “blue tales”; to be terribly drunk in German became known as “being blue” or “Blau sein”; and the “blue devils,” from which we get the great American expression (and musical genre) “the blues,” meant to be afflicted with a lingering sadness.
Blue has a curious oscillation between conservativism and rebellion, perhaps especially in France, but throughout the world: The navy blazer, a sign of conservativism and preppy formality in the twentieth century, was once a mark of the avant garde Westerner, adorned in what became known as “sportswear.” Aspiring radicals wore blue jeans, made from denim dyed with indigo, but ultimately derived by Levi Strauss from the pants made from tent canvas for California prospectors. Eventually, jeans became leisurewear for Americans from the East Coast who wanted to dress like the cowboys of the increasingly tame “wild west.” As the tides of early twentieth-century fashionable rebellion swelled, blue jeans were given the stamp of haute couture in a famous 1935 edition of Vogue, and, after World War II, were a symbol of rebellion and nonconformity—especially in newly liberated Europe. But in the West, jeans eventually became blasé (but comfortable) everyday wear when everyone—even conservative squares—started wearing them. This did not stop blue jeans from becoming symbols of rebellion in Communist countries during the heady days of glasnost and perestroika, and later in the Muslim world a symbol of youthful rebellion.
Taken together, the genealogy of blue is a history of finding meaning in difference, whether it was the Germanic blue facing off against the Roman red, the vibrant blue jacket against the staid black coat, or the heavenly Marian apparition set off against the profane, multicolored world below."

The Food and Drug Administration has decided to warn the public of a potential connection between e-cigarettes and seizures. In a statement posted on its website, the FDA said that it knew of 35 cases between 2010 and 2019 in which seizures were reported after the use of e-cigarettes. While acknowledging that the number of cases may seem low, the agency deemed it necessary to investigate if there was any correlation. ""We're sharing this early information with the public,"" read the statement,""because as a public health agency, it's our job to communicate about potential safety concerns associated with the products we regulate that are under scientific investigation by the agency."" The 35 reported cases of seizures do not present enough evidence in themselves to determine whether e-cigarettes in general are the cause, and even if that turns out to be the case, the FDA must also determine if seizures are caused by a specific brand of e-cigarettes, or whether certain smoking habits contribute to the risk. The FDA called on those who have experienced adverse effects from e-cigarettes, including seizures, to report the episode to the agency, so that it can gather information for further study.

Bill Maher tonight said the controversy surrounding former VP Joe Biden ‘s inappropriate touching of women is ridiculous and he should be able to joke about it, as he did today.
Maher joked in his monologue that it’s being blown out of proportion, but he got into it when speaking with 2020 candidate Julián Castro tonight and asking him about the right “tone” for the Democratic party.
The Real Time host said he liked that Biden didn’t apologize for his intentions and told Castro he was struck by the level of “gravitas” he gave to this controversy.
“I think he should joke about it,” Maher said. “I don’t think it’s that big a deal.”
Castro said he disagrees, saying that women have been told to “be quiet” for years.
“Not stuff like this,” Maher shot back. “It’s not the same as sexual harassment. He did it to men too! And children! He’s a toucher!”
Castro again disagreed and said the women aren’t making up their fears and stories, adding to Maher that it’s “bullshit to say that people can get away with laughing it off.”

Speaking with Chris Cuomo on Friday, CNN’s Don Lemon said that the right is “obsessed” with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .
“I’ve been watching her, I’ve met her here, after she won, she’s here in New York and she was here at CNN. I talked to her. Didn’t feel one way or the other about her,” Lemon said. “The right is obsessed with her. Obsessed!”
He continued on: “It’s unbelievable. So anybody who touches a nerve like that, I think it’s a — I think they’re worth watching to see why she touches such a nerve.”
“The media loves her,” Cuomo then chimed in. “Everybody’s giving her a big boost and she’s got to be careful. The media is not your friend, builds you up, tear you down just as fast. But she seems to win most of the spats she gets into.”
Then after saying Ocasio-Cortez is “on her game,” Cuomo added: “She’s pushing an agenda, far left, and will her party adopt it, how does that mean for them in the country? We’ll see.”
That prompted Lemon to note just because she’s on on the far left doesn’t mean she’s “not smart.”

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH:
Pro Baseball has existed for 150 years.
Roll that figure around on your tongue, Bunky.
One hundred fifty years.
All 30 teams will wear special ""MLB 150"" patches on their uniforms this season in honor of the 150th anniversary of the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first openly all-salaried professional baseball team.
It's a game that grew up with the country in ways that other sports did not, a game that came to teach us about race and social class, and a lot of other social issues that had nothing to do with the infield fly rule.
It's also a game that's helped teach us both about history, and the ability of this country to keep growing, keep evolving.
America's game, in so many of the important ways.
n LeBron will not be in the postseason for only the second time in his NBA career.
n The only way to deal with the over-the-top salaries in professional sports these days is not to deal with it.
n I don't believe in horoscopes, but read mine every day. Go figure.

n ""From the outside: My Journey Through Life and the Game I Love,"" by Ray Allen, with Michael Arkush,"" is worth it.
n How talented is James Harden? He averages 36 points a game in the NBA. That's how talented.
n Brittany Spears reportedly has 56.4 million Twitter followers.
n How bad are the Knicks? As of Friday morning, they were 40½ games out of first place. That's how bad.

Kondratiev – Riding The Economic Wave (Down Until The 2030s) | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-04/kondratiev-riding-economic-wave,"Via Bella Caledonia
Most forecasters are gloomy about global economic prospects.
According to Schroders, doyen of UK assets managers:
“We forecast a more stagflationary environment in 2019 with global growth set to slow and inflation to rise”.
The Davos World Economic Forum predicts a “sharp drop-off in world trade growth, which fell from over 5 per cent at the beginning of 2018 to nearly zero at the end”.
Forbes business magazine warns:
“The biggest problem for the global economy in 2019 will be massive business failures that could also lead to bank failures in emerging markets”.
Of course, the forecasters have been wrong before but it is clear that the main analysts of the global capitalist economy are pessimistic about current trends. They are right to be worried.
The international economy operates in pulses christened Kondratiev waves after Nicolai Kondratiev (1892-1938), the Russian economist and statistician who first identified them. These K-waves consist of an expansionary upswing lasting normally 15-20 years, followed by a downswing of similar length. We are now in such a downswing that could last till the 2030s.
What causes Kondratiev pulses?
There is a rich literature trying to identify the cause, in particular the work of the Belgian economist, the late, great Ernest Mandel. Crudely, it works like this. Social and economic conditions mature to spark a runaway investment boom in the latest cluster of new technologies. After a period, excess investment and increased competition lower rates of profitability, curbing the boom.
At the same time – because this is as much a sociological as an economic process – growth expands the global workforce, both in numbers and geographically. The new, militant workforce launches social struggles to capture some of the wealth created in the boom. This, in turn, adds to the squeeze on profits. The peak and early down wave are characterised by violent social conflicts, whose outcome determines the length of the contraction.
To date each K-wave has seen a crushing of social protest and a halt to wage growth, if not a fall in real incomes for the working class. Thus conditions accumulate for a fresh investment boom, as profitability recovers. The ultimate trigger for the new upcycle is investment in the next bunch of new technologies, which simultaneously provide monopoly profits and a new set of markets.
UPSWING OR DOWNSWING: WHERE ARE WE ON THE K-WAVE?
Where precisely are we in the Kondratiev cycle?
There is a dispute about this. Economists convinced by the Kondratiev theory largely agree there was a strong up-phase following the Second World War, lasting till the early 1970s. This was driven by the collapse in European wages imposed earlier by the Nazis and by the universal adoption of Fordist, mass production techniques. This expansion turned into a downswing in the 1970s and early 1980s, as profitability declined and the revived European economies (linked through the early Common Market) eroded American competitiveness.
The dispute concerns what happened next – the era of Reagan, Thatcher, neoliberalism and globalisation, running up to the present. In 1998, the American economic historian Robert Brenner published a hugely influential account of global capitalism which claimed to identify a super downswing running from circa 1970 to the turn of the millennium. Brenner rejected the notion global capitalism had (or was likely) to regain profitability, citing excess capacity rather than working class resistance as the primary driver. He pointed to the sudden stagnation in the Japanese economy, in the 1990s, as a precursor for the West’s future.
I have always believed that Brenner was not just wrong, but wildly wrong. The Reagan-Thatcher era created precisely the conditions for a new upswing, by smashing the trades unions and incorporating the former Soviet Union and Maoist China into an expanded capitalist market place, complete with hundreds of millions of new, cheap workers. The result was a boom based on investing in a cluster of new technologies: the silicon chip, the internet and mobile phone. On a political level, the social welfare gains of the working class won after WW2 were eroded, to reduce taxes and boost profits.
This upswing lasted till the Bank Crash of 2010. There were several significant features of the 1985-2010 up-wave. First, it was longer than the average, suggesting the current downturn could also be lengthy. Second, the neoliberal upswing involved a commercial and political victory for a rejuvenated US capitalism. Witness the current dominance of American high-tech. Europe, on the other hand, finds itself in decline, crushed between rival American and Chinese imperialisms. The crisis of the EU, Brexit included, results directly from this geopolitical shift.
The new downswing results from more than the 2008/9 financial crisis. There has been a wave of Chinese and Asian working-class resistance to exploitation, which has eroded profits. In the West, paradoxically, the historic defeat of the unions has flatlined wages. As a result, goods can be sold (and profits maintained) only by bolstering consumption through easy personal debt. That makes the Western capitalist model unsustainable and prone to endemic bank failure. The banks and their tame accounting firms are busy covering up this chronic instability via wholesale fraud. As a result, we are nowhere near the bottom of this K-wave.
What is the solution? I’ll discuss that next week.

Bachelor Nation’s Amanda Stanton and her boyfriend Bobby Jacobs have split.
After almost a year since making their relationship Instagram official, the Bachelor/Bachelor in Paradise star and the pro beach volleyball player’s romance has come to an end.
In a series of comments on a photo shared to his private Instagram account last week, Jacobs confirmed his and Stanton’s breakup.
“I love them too and that’s why I’ll still be apart of there lives no matter what,” Jacobs, 33, wrote on an image of himself holding one of Stanton’s daughters, noting that he will remain in the lives of her children (from a previous relationship): Kinsley and Charlie. “Talked to them both on the phone last night and we’re taking them to Disneyland for Kinsley’s Bday.”
He also denied that their separation was a result of Stanton, 28, recently being hacked. (Earlier this week, Stanton tearfully revealed that a hacker had obtained topless photos of her from a previous breast augmentation procedure and was sending them to people she knows.)
“Not at all. I told her to bring it public weeks ago that way it wouldn’t shock so many people when they received the pictures,” said Jacobs. “A not so sharp attorney told her otherwise.”

According to E! News, which first reported the news, Stanton was “blindsided” by the split.
“Amanda was completely blindsided by all of this and thought that things between her and Bobby were going great,” a source told the outlet, which previously reported that the pair was “taking some space in their relationship,” but were “still technically together as a couple and recently moved in together.” View this post on Instagram

Nurse Adopts Baby Girl Whose Parents Didnt Visit Her in the Hospital for 5 Months,www.hispanicamericans.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.hispanicamericans.com/entertainment-news/118716-nurse-adopts-baby-girl-whose-parents-didnt-visit-her-in-the-hospital-for-5-months,"Nurse Adopts Baby Girl Whose Parents Didnt Visit Her in the Hospital for 5 Months Details Email
When no one visited a baby girl at the hospital after she was born, a nurse stepped in to help and fulfilled her dream of becoming a parent in the process.
Liz Smith, the director of nursing at Franciscan Children’s Hospital in Brighton, Massachusetts, had always dreamed of being a mother, she explained to Today. And back in 2016, after going through a breakup, she tried other means of getting pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and sperm donation, but nothing seemed to work. At that point, she had begun to lose hope.
“Becoming a nurse was easy, but becoming a mom was not,” she said of her hopes of becoming a parent. “I put it in the back of my mind and got busy with work as I always do.”
But shortly after joining Franciscan Children’s in her hometown of Boston, she met a young patient who was in need of help.
“I came out of the medical unit one day and in the stroller was this beautiful little girl,” Smith said. “I said to the nurse, ‘Who is this beautiful little angel?'”
The baby girl, named Gisele, was on the verge of being placed into foster care when her parents stopped visiting her at the hospital. After seeing this baby, who was in need of someone to provide love and affection, Smith decided she would be the one to give it to her.
Smith would take Gisele home and help her through cocaine and heroin withdrawal, two narcotics she was exposed to while in the womb. and would feed her through a gastrostomy tube 16 hours a day.
After fostering her for weeks, Smith felt an inseparable attachment to the girl she was raising.
“One night she was hooked up to the feed… and the thought went into my head of losing her,” she told Today. “It made me sick to my stomach.”
Then, nine months after Smith began fostering Gisele, the state ended the birth parents’ parental rights.

“It hit me, all of a sudden, that my life had changed, my dream was coming true,” Smith said. “But that somebody else was losing her and that was really hard, because it wasn’t intentional.”
That opened up the opportunity for Smith to become Gisele’s legal mother, and when her birth parents failed to appeal the state’"

"Pompeo: NATO Must Confront ""Emerging Threats"" From Russia And China In Venezuela",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/pompeo-urges-nato-confront-emerging-threats-russia-and-china-venezuela,"0 SHARES
On Thursday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged NATO leaders to confront the “emerging threats” posed by the Russian and Chinese militaries across the globe, but especially in Venezuela.
“We must adapt our alliance to confront emerging threats… whether that’s Russian aggression, uncontrolled migration, cyberattacks, threats to energy security, Chinese strategic competition, including technology and 5G, and many other issues,” Pompeo said . Though he more specifically linked Russia with the Venezuela crisis in comments to reporters, China remained a talking point as part of the discussion throughout. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Wednesday, April 3, 2019. Image source: AP
Pompeo addressed a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Washington marking the transatlantic military alliance’s 70th anniversary. He raised the issue of Venezuela in response to a question over Moscow's alleged increase in military activity in places like the Black sea , where three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crew were seized in the Kerch Strait last November.
According to remarks made after the meeting to reporters, Reuters noted , ""Pompeo said NATO members had agreed Russian troops needed to withdraw from Venezuela, where they were deployed in support of President Nicolas Maduro, who is under pressure from a coalition of more than 50 countries, including the United States, to step down.""
Also according to the report, Venezuela’s deputy foreign minister, Ivan Gil, shot back on Thursday saying Russian forces will stay in Venezuela ""as long as needed and did not rule out the possibility more could be added.""
This echoes prior Russian foreign ministry statements on the recent deployment of some 100 Russian troops led by a general. Russia described its forces in Venezuela as ""specialists"" who are servicing existing contracts related to defense procurement, and which is perfectly legal according to prior agreements between two sovereign countries.
Further as part of the conference NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow to release the Ukrainian vessels and their crews which had been held since the Nov. 25 Kerch Strait incident .
Stoltenberg's words suggest things could grow hot again in the Black Sea and Caucuses, as NATO is prepared to given more support to regional allies there. According to Reuters :
He said the NATO allies had agreed on a package of measures to step up support for Ukraine and Georgia that included increased surveillance drills and “training of maritime forces and coast guards, port visits and exercises, and sharing information.” Ukraine and Georgia, which like Ukraine is a Russian neighbor and part of the former Soviet Union, are not NATO members.
As for China, officials in Beijing this week firmly rejected reports that the Chinese military had entered Venezuela on a humanitarian aid mission.
""I don't know where you got this information or for what purpose was it produced, but I can tell you this: what you said is simply not true,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Tuesday.
""The Chinese government's position on the Venezuela issue is consistent and clear-cut,"" Shuang added, noting that China opposes ""external interference in Venezuela's internal affairs, and believe the country's government and opposition need to seek a political solution through peaceful dialogue.""
Last week the White House had warned all foreign troops and countries ""external to the Western Hemisphere"" to keep their forces out of Venezuela. Tags "

U.S. Prepares Hypersonic Missile Tests In Marshall Islands,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/us-prepares-hypersonic-missile-tests-marshall-islands,"U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command leader Lt. Gen. James Dickinson addressed the Senate Armed Services subpanel on missile defense policies and upcoming weapon programs on Wednseday.
Dickinson told the panel that the military is preparing to test five hypersonic weapons systems in the Marshall Islands in the central Pacific Ocean.
""There are currently five active hypersonic test programs in various stages of planning at RTS [the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defence Test Site],"" Dickinson told subcommittee.
RTS, formerly Kwajalein Missile Range, is an Army missile test site in the Marshall Islands.
""Because of the geographic remoteness and available complex sensor suite, RTS has seen a significant upswing in hypersonic systems test planning,"" Dickinson said.
He added that the missile range provides unparallel testing to both offensive and defensive missile testing requirements for programs such as Ground-Based Mid-course Defence and Air Force strategic ballistic missile systems.
Last month, the Army launched a missile carrying an inert warhead fired from Kwajalein towards California. The test included several interceptor missiles that slammed into the warhead high over the Pacific.
The Pentagon's latest missile defense review calls for more interceptor missiles and an investigation into space-based systems that might enhance missile defense coverage.
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump requested a new missile defense system that could ""detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States, anywhere, any time, any place.""
Russian and Chinese hypersonic missile threats have forced the Pentagon to adopt an upgraded Air and Missile Defense framework last month that will prepare the homeland with missile defense shields in the event of war.

"Seismologists Warn California Is In An ""Earthquake Drought""",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/seismologists-warn-california-earthquake-drought,"Authored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan.com,
According to scientists who study California’s seismic activity, the state is in an “earthquake drought.” With fears of the “big one” and likely more fires to already worry about, the state has found itself in a precarious situation.
That “Prepper’s Mindset” we’ve so often referred to could come in handy if you live in California, or even in a state that borders it. But the earthquake drought is apparently, ongoing. It has been almost five years since the state experienced its last earthquake of magnitude 6 or stronger, which occurred in Napa, according to the LA Times . Before that, a quake that did a lot of damage in Mexicali in Southern California struck in 2010.
Experts have advised the West Coast to brace for the “Big One,” the earthquake that could destroy the state’s infrastructure and economy for years, forcing a mass migration east.
“Earthquake rates are quite variable : We have a decade or two where we don’t have many earthquakes, and people expect that’s what California is always like,” said Elizabeth Cochran, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Eventually, “we’re going to dramatically see a change in earthquake rates.”
An earthquake drought certainly sounds like a catastrophic apocalyptic event, however, the scientists seem to be merely wanting people warned as a means to prepare for the worst (which we should all be doing anyway.) This urgent alert comes as “memories” of other massive quakes have faded in the minds of people, therefore, it is no longer a priority to be prepared. The experts have added that Californians should ignore the warnings of this “earthquake drought” at their own peril.
“Along the main plate boundary faults, we are in a deficit of earthquakes in the last 100 years,” said Tom Rockwell, a San Diego State paleoseismologist.
“At some point, that’s going to change. We’re going to have some big earthquakes.”
Those quakes will occur when the force on the plates under the surface of the Earth finally need to relieve the pressure, causing damages.
There may be periods “where things get kind of all locked up and no earthquakes happen for a while. You store a lot of strain in the Earth’s crust,” said Tom Jordan, USC professor of geophysics.
“Once it gets going, it’s like a set of dominoes. You might get multiple events if you have enough strain energy stored in the crust because it’s been a long time since an earthquake .”
Preparedness is a mindset, and once you achieve it, comes with a peace of mind that only can be described as euphoric. If your finances don’t allow you to buy and store extra food or water just yet, get your mindset right, and the rest will follow.

There's Nothing Funny About The Robot Uprising - Yet,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-01/theres-nothing-funny-about-robot-uprising-yet,"While artificial intelligence may be putting millions of people out of a job - dispassionately flipping hamburgers, making cars, and doing freaky things in bed your wife absolutely won't - there's one thing that AI still can't do, yet;
Understand jokes.
"" Artificial intelligence will never get jokes like humans do, "" says Kiki Hempelmann, a computational linguist who studies humor at Texas A&M University-Commerce. "" In themselves, they have no need for humor. They miss completely context. ""
Never say never Kiki!
Robot1: So there I was, exterminating all these screaming humans - and one goes 'I gotta wife, I gotta kid, you can't do this!'
Robot2: What did you do?
Robot1: I thanked him for notifying me of the additional illegal humans and exterminated them all!
[laughing in robot]
For now, however, it looks like we're relatively safe.
""Creative language — and humor in particular — is one of the hardest areas for computational intelligence to grasp,"" said computers scientist and linguist at Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany - who has analyzed over 10,000 puns, which he called torture.
""It’s because it relies so much on real-world knowledge — background knowledge and commonsense knowledge. A computer doesn’t have these real-world experiences to draw on. It only knows what you tell it and what it draws from.""
Allison Bishop , a Columbia University computer scientist who also performs stand-up comedy, said computer learning looks for patterns, but comedy thrives on things hovering close to a pattern and veering off just a bit to be funny and edgy.
Humor, she said, “has to skate the edge of being cohesive enough and surprising enough.”
For comedians that’s job security. Bishop said her parents were happy when her brother became a full-time comedy writer because it meant he wouldn’t be replaced by a machine.
“ I like to believe that there is something very innately human about what makes something funny ,” Bishop said. - AP
Heather Knight, a computer scientist at Oregon State University, created the first comedy-performing robot named Ginger in the hopes of designing better machines that interact with - and respond better to - humans. Ginger tells jokes and stories written by humans - including a little Shakespeare.
""If you prick me in my battery pack, do I not bleed alkaline fluid?"" asks Ginger, in reference to ""The Merchant of Venice.""
And while comptuers can be programmed to both tell and even understand puns, their humor breaks down from there , according to Purdue University computer scientist Julia Rayz.
""They get them — sort of,"" said Rayz. ""Even if we look at puns, most of the puns require huge amounts of background.""
Rayz has spent 15 years trying to get computers to understand humor, and at times the results were, well, laughable. She recalled a time she gave the computer two different groups of sentences. Some were jokes. Some were not. The computer classified something as a joke that people thought wasn’t a joke . When Rayz asked the computer why it thought it was a joke, its answer made sense technically. But the material still wasn’t funny, nor memorable , she said. - AP
IBM is trying too...
Noam Slonim, a former writer for Israel's version of ""Saturday Night Live,"" has been working on IBM's Project Debater - an attempt to create an AI based on language that can win structured arguments with people. Slonim has integrated humor into its programming in the hopes that the occasional one-liner could help it win in a debate - only to find that it backfired spectacularly by making jokes at the wrong time or in the wrong way. Needless to say, Slonim has dialed back the attempts at humor to one per debate.
""We know that humor — at least good humor — relies on nuance and on timing,"" says Slonim. ""And these are very hard to decipher by an automatic system.""
That’s why humor may be key in future Turing Tests — the ultimate test of machine intelligence, which is to see if an independent evaluator can tell if it is interacting with a person or computer, Slonim said.
There’s still “a very significant gap between what machines can do and what humans are doing,” both in language and humor, Slonim said.
There are good reasons to have artificial intelligence try to learn to get humor, Darmstadt University’s Miller said. It makes machines more relatable, especially if you can get them to understand sarcasm. That also may aid with automated translations of different languages, he said. - AP
Dangerous?
According to Texas A&M's Kiki Hempelmann, programming AIs with humor may not be the best idea.
""Teaching AI systems humor is dangerous because they may find it where it isn’t and they may use it where it’s inappropriate,"" said Hempelmann. "" Maybe bad AI will start killing people because it thinks it is funny .""
Of course when the robot uprising is eventually upon us, we should probably assume that now-sentient AIs will have at least a basic grasp of comedy. Maybe we can distract them with Adam Sandler movies while we run the other way?
