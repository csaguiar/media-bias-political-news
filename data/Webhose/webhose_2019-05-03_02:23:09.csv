Nikki Haley was honored by various Jewish groups for her defense of the Israeli state on Tuesday. The Sanhedrin, a Jewish group devoted to building a third Jewish temple on the Temple Mount, praised Haley by minting a coin in her honor, along with two other religious groups according the Associated Press. “She supported and she told the truth … that all the United Nations, all its agenda, is to destroy,” Hillel Weiss, spokesman for the group, said Wednesday. “She acted in a manner that represented biblical tenets,” he added.Similarly, the group made a coin in honor of US President Donald Trump after he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the embassy.“You look at the anti-Israel bias, and the strength and courage that the president showed in moving the embassy – and showing the world we will move our embassy where we want,” Haley said after she resigned as the US ambassador to the United Nations, listing her accomplishments. Haley's coin depicts her in front of the UN with a Jewish Menorah on top. It is being sold for USD $65 for silver and USD $90 for gold, plus shipping, according to its website. According to the report, the proceeds will go towards the building of the third temple. On the same day, Haley was bestowed with the Humanitarian of the Year Award from American Friends of Magen David Adom, an organization that raises funds and awareness for Israel's national emergency response team, according to the Jewish Journal. Haley accepted the award in front of a crowd of some 400 adoring fans who screamed “Nikki for President!” and “Nikki 2020!,” according to the report. While Haley does not intend on running in the next presidential election, she said she would do everything in her power to ensure the US always supports Israel. Haley was Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations and ended her term in 2018. Haley is often lauded as a defender of Israel. The Temple Mount is the holiest place in Judaism and coveted as the third holiest place in Islam as well. It is also where Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock currently stand.

(photo credit: SPACEIL) The Israeli spacecraft Beresheet is meant to escape the Earth’s gravitational pull on Thursday afternoon in a maneuver that will hopefully allow it to reach the moon. Should it fail to do so it will be trapped in the Sun’s gravitational pull and eventually melt near the sun. If successful, “capturing the moon” will lower the speed of the spacecraft to allow it to be “captured” by the moon’s gravitational pull, , Artuz Sheva reported. A successful capture will mean the spacecraft will first circle the moon in an elliptical course. The plan is to use further maneuvers to slow its velocity to change the course into a circular one. The circles are meant to become closer and closer to the surface of the moon until the expend April 11 landing. Ahead of the date, Israel’s Space Agency planned twenty cross-country events that will be open to the public free of charge.

Soldiers wearing white masks sifted through the site with spades, trowels and their gloved hands to collect the bones. Press Secretary of the Belarus Embassy in Israel and Belarus Counsel Andrei Sadovski told the Jerusalem Post that until now 1,214 bodies were exhumed and the rescue excavation ended in the end of March. The remains of the victims will be buried in a Jewish ceremony in a cemetery in Brest with the city budget covering the costs, he told the Post. “The buildings will not be built on the site but next to it,” he said, “the actual site will be turned into a park with a commemoration sign explaining what happened there, it will not be turned into a parking space nor a playground.” He added that after the remains were found the Brest authorities had been in constant communication with the Jewish community in Belarus.

One of NBC’s newest buzzworthy TV shows, The Village, stars Israeli actress Moran Atias.The drama, which premiered last month, spotlights the lives of the residents of a Brooklyn apartment building. One of the main characters is Ava, an Iranian immigrant portrayed by Haifa-born Atias. In the pilot episode, Ava, a single mom, is arrested by ICE officers for entering the country illegally. “It is a drama, but with a lot of laughter and moments of joy and hope,” Atias said in a recent video interview with IMDb. “It’s a great reminder of the importance of community.”The Village has received decidedly mixed reviews, and a wave of comparisons to another NBC tearjerker - the popular This is Us. Atias joins an all-star cast in the show, including Frankie Faison (The Wire), Michaela McManus (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) and Lorraine Toussaint (Orange is the New Black).Atias told the Los Angeles Jewish Journal last month that she spent five months living in New York during filming for the show.“I was lucky enough to meet a beautiful Jewish community that hosted me for Shabbat dinners,” she said. “I think it’s one of the most beautiful things in our culture, people coming together and blessing the wine and bread and what we have. I’m hosting 18 people for Shabbat tonight, trying to continue the tradition.”The Israeli-American actress, who lives in Los Angeles, is no stranger to the small screen. Many viewers will recognize her from the 2008 Starz series Crash, the Fx show Tyrant, or the Fox medical drama The Resident.The Village premiered to so-so ratings, but it was the winner in its 10 p.m. time slot. A TV writer for US Today said Wednesday that the show is touch-and-go for NBC to renew for a second season.Will Ava and the rest of The Village return next year? Stay tuned.

And speaking of “sarcasm”, Tucker’s — “apparently blackface was the equivalent of business casual for young Virginia Democrats in the 80’s” — slam during the Ralph Northam circus almost made me fall out of my chair!....
My only real critique of Carlson’s show is the good-cop-bad-cop segments with FNC’s smarmy and smirking left-wing “contributors” like Richard Goodstein.. But I suppose that’s just part of FNC’s “fair and balanced” shtick; something that’s getting REAL old real fast — i.e. their hiring the former CNN debate fixer Donna Brazil...."

CNN responds by promoting boycotts of his show from far-left groups https://t.co/aBwrrTNOtr
— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 2, 2019
CNN responded with an article lauding the claim that “Carlson’s commercial breaks have had only a smattering of ads from lesser-known brands.”
According to CNN, this is because the Fox News host, “made racist remarks on immigrants in December,” even though he didn’t and was merely making the factual observation that migrant caravans often leave a trail of litter behind them. Over the last month, Tucker Carlson's commercial breaks have had only a smattering of ads from lesser-known brands. It might be a new normal for the Fox News host, who has endured ad boycott campaigns since he made racist remarks on immigrants in December. https://t.co/Ac9sfcYiaS pic.twitter.com/O9GNUKxmyr
— CNN (@CNN) April 2, 2019
CNN then amplified Mimi Chakravorti, the executive director at the branding firm Landor, who basically threatened advertisers that if they continued to appear alongside Tucker’s show, they would be in violation of ‘the great awokening’– in other words, the increasingly shrinking number of viewpoints that remain acceptable and politically correct to the establishment. A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“If you stay you’re saying your brand is aligned with Tucker Carlson — past and present, if you leave, you’re saying you’re not aligned with Tucker’s views,” warned Chakravorti.
This is why they hate Tucker Carlson.
His message resonates with an increasing number of Americans and all CNN can do in response is to abuse their platform by lobbying for boycotts of his advertisers.
Their own tweet attacking Tucker as “racist” got ratioed, with the vast majority of respondents siding with Carlson.
CNN isn’t a media company anymore, it’s an activist organization which now devotes a huge chunk of its resources to silencing its competition.

They know they are lying. They are terrible people doing terrible things and will be burning in a hot place for a long time when they are gone. The damage they are doing is irreversible at this point in our societal collapse.
The true shame lies in the people who actually believe the lie. If there were jobs posted that offered a man 20% more than a woman, that company would be sued in oblivion.
And if greedy corporate America wanted to save over 20% on payroll, why not fire every man in the company and only employ women?
