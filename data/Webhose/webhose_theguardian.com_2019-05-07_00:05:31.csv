Summary Richard Parkin
Another eventful evening of Sportwatch has concluded. Still pinching myself at that third golden point win of the round in the NRL , on a night where there were some tight scorelines in the AFL as well.
But the day was all about the New South Wales women‚Äôs rugby union team who claimed consecutive Super W titles in a ding-dong of a battle with nemeses Queensland, 8-5 the final score there - keep an eye out for Jill Scanlon‚Äôs column on that tomorrow.
We‚Äôll also have the brilliant-as-ever Craig Little with his write up of Brisbane Lion‚Äôs remarkable start to the season. As always, thanks for your company - and that‚Äôs Sportwatch.

A-League: Central Coast Mariners 0-3 Perth Glory And the 10th v 1st encounter ends in the manner in which many would have expected. Perth with far too much quality across the park, and they made it look relatively comfortable in the end.
A shout out to defender Dino Djulbic who scored his first A-League goal in over four years. Bringing his tally to 7x that of namesake Dino Kresinger.
One dark spot for Perth fans though as Chris Ikonomidis limped out with a shoulder injury. Let‚Äôs hope the gun striker isn‚Äôt another finals casualty like Terry Antonis.

NRL: Newcastle 12-13 St George Guys. This is nuts. Cut it out. It‚Äôs a third golden point win of the round - what a weekend of high drama!
It turned into a shootout at the end with Mitchell Pearce, Ben Hunt and Corey Norman all taking turns to try and plug droppies with the scores locked at 12-12 at 80 minutes. But after numerous missed chances it was the former Eel who eventually landed one, to the dismay of the home fans. They won‚Äôt admit it yet, but they definitely got their money‚Äôs worth. Wow.

A-League - penalty! Central Coast 0-3 Perth (Kilkenny, 58‚Äô)
Ach. This could get ugly for the absolute most faithful of faithful up in Gosford. They‚Äôve not been poor this second half, the Mariners, but cunning from Diego Castro draws a clumsy penalty from Jacob Melling, and Neil Kilkenny gratefully tucks it away. They‚Äôve been some leans years up in Gosford. The off-season can‚Äôt come soon enough.

AFL: Fremantle 11.5 (71) defeat St Kilda 9.12 (66) It‚Äôs another game that finishes inside a goal, gee, they‚Äôre only playing thrillers this season, aren‚Äôt they, the Saints? They‚Äôre on the wrong end of it this time, and the Dockers - narrow losers last week - emerge narrow winners tonight.
Luke Ryan with 32 disposals, 13 marks and two tackles standing tall for the Dockers, with Brandon Matera the pick of the goal kickers with three.
A nasty concussion to Nat Fyfe the big concern for Freo fans, as he left the pitch still reeling from an inadvertent head clash.

A-League - goal! Central Coast 0-2 Perth (Djulbic, 29‚Äô)
It‚Äôs a booming header from a set piece, and the veteran Dino Djulbic doubles Perth‚Äôs advantage! Neil Kilkenny with the corner in, and nobody could stop the leap of the big centre back. They should be comfortable from here Perth, surely they‚Äôve too much quality to let this one slip.

A-League - goal! Central Coast 0-1 Perth (Chianese, 12‚Äô)
It‚Äôs 10th hosting 1st, and despite a bubble in form and confidence with the appointment of former Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, you‚Äôd have to suspect the cellar dwellers were going to be up against it tonight already.
It was some nice combination play from Perth in the lead up, before Joel Chianese, seemingly forced too wide, was able to cut back inside and fire a worm-burner past Ben Kennedy in the Mariners‚Äô goal.

NRL - half-time: Newcastle 10-8 St George
And profuse apologies, I‚Äôve completely missed the second fixture in the NRL tonight (fires assistant). Both these sides went into tonight‚Äôs game with just one win in three so a tasty two points on offer.
It‚Äôs Edrick Lee that got the opening try for the Knights, but an early penalty and a try to Tyson Frizzell had the Dragons poke their noses in front twice. Hymel Hunt crossing the stripe shortly after for the home side, and how‚Äôs this ball from Kalyn Ponga. Brilliant.

A-League: Adelaide United 3-1 Wellington Phoenix And despite mustering less than 50 successful passes that entire second half, the Reds have hung on! The damage done in a dominant first 25-30 minutes, while Stamatelopoulos‚Äô red card just before half-time definitely put the home side on the defensive. Their visitors appeared to have set their shooting radars to comedy mode - 19 shots, but only six on target, and only one finding it‚Äôs way past Paul Izzo in the Reds goal.
It sets up a fascinating last three rounds in the race for the final home final spot - Phoenix stay on 37 points, Adelaide more to 37 points, and Melbourne City move to 36 points. All to play for.

A-League - goal! Adelaide 3-1 Wellington (Sheridan, 73‚Äô)
Too little, too late? Or are we set for a banging last twenty here?
It‚Äôs a first A-League goal for the Irish striker Cillian Sheridan, a one-time national teammate of Perth‚Äôs Andy Keogh, and now he‚Äôs just 52 goals shy of his compatriot‚Äôs tally.
It was a well-struck shot from Mandi that cannoned back off the post, and the second-half substitute was on hand to tuck home.

AFL - half-time: Fremantle 6.2 (38) lead St Kilda 5.3 (33)
It‚Äôs another see-sawer, having conceded six straight goals without answer, the Saints have fired back four of their own. In fact they‚Äôd be ahead if they‚Äôd shot at 100% like the Dockers, but two behinds keeps the Saints just nipping at the heels.
No real standouts in terms of touches, but it‚Äôs the home side with the larger share of disposals and inside 50s. And interestingly enough, we have 11 separate goal kickers. They‚Äôre coming from everywhere.

Super W final: New South Wales 8-5 Queensland Ooph. You could hear the collective relief around Leichhardt at full-time - what a battle that was! Despite making so much of the attacking play, at the end it was the blues who held on - such a terrific effort from Queensland, and yet they couldn‚Äôt quite vanquish their nemeses. What an advertisement for tough rugby!

We‚Äôve about ten to play, and it‚Äôs going right down to the wire in the Super W final! Who can be the hero? Who can win this for their state?
It‚Äôs a penalty to Queensland, but they‚Äôre deep inside their own half. Can they launch a good line out play to put the blues under pressure?

NRL: Melbourne 18-16 Canterbury-Bankstown It‚Äôs hardly crystal ball stuff to say, there I told you, but they‚Äôve only gone and won it, the Storm.
Tough to take that for Bulldogs supporters - they played well, completing sets at over 80% and dominating metres run and line breaks. But you just can‚Äôt write champion sides off.

AFL: Hawthorn 13.8 (86) defeat North Melbourne 8.11 (59) It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. A veritable tale of two halves in Melbourne, where the Kangaroos led for most of the first, and the Hawks for most of the second.

And there it is - finally, the maroon wall is breached, and NSW have the try they‚Äôve long been chasing! It‚Äôs the vice-captain and backrower Grace Hamilton, but Hewson misses the conversion and we‚Äôre still within just a penalty. What a last 25 we‚Äôve got to come!

Super W final - second half!
We‚Äôre back in action in Leichhardt, but there‚Äôs been no change to the score, so far. As per the first half it‚Äôs New South Wales predominantly on the attack. We‚Äôve had about seven minutes played.

Yikes. It‚Äôs a flying start in the city of churches, where the home side have fired not one, but two goals in quick succession. Michael Marrone the unlikely opening scorer - just his second A-League goal in 204 competitive games!
That one came in the 10th minute, and seven minutes late it was two - the terrifically named Apostolos Stamatelopoulos tucking home a pass from former Phoenix player Scott Galloway.
They‚Äôve scored 15 goals in their past three games, the Nix, but could they be on the end of a few today? Just 30 minutes played so far.

"The week in radio and podcasts: once heard, never forgotten | Television & radio | The Guardian",www.theguardian.com,Miranda Sawyer,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/07/favourite-single-podcast-episodes-this-american-life-love-radio-memory-palace-heavyweight-griefcast,"From This American Life to Griefcast, our critic picks her favourite individual programmes that might stop you in your tracks. T his week I‚Äôm celebrating single programmes. Those one-off episodes that catch you unawares, knock you sideways as you‚Äôre making the tea, make you pull over in the car because you‚Äôre fighting back tears. My life is peppered by these aural moments: I have an interior/exterior map of places where I first heard a particular podcast. Often it‚Äôs in my local park. At the bottom of one hill is where I heard a wife speak on iPM about her husband‚Äôs unfaithfulness . Up towards the cafe is the spot where I listened to the final episode of S-Town . I cried about The Living Room episode from Love + Radio while jogging so slowly past a bench that the teenagers sitting on it pointed at me and laughed.
Anyway. There are certain long-running shows that will always give you a good listen. And sometimes they come up with something exceptional, an episode that stays with you for months, even years after you hear it. This American Life is a series that does this. Love + Radio is another. Radiolab ; The Memory Palace . And Desert Island Discs , of course: Bob Mortimer‚Äôs episode is a recent classic.
I asked Twitter audio fans for one-off shows that they loved, and I got some brilliant suggestions. From This American Life , the episodes Three Miles (about a scheme to bring poorer kids into an elite private school); Very Tough Love (on prohibitive sentencing for drug users); The Super , about building managers; Dr Gilm er and Mr Hyde (on a strange doctor, presented by Serial ‚Äôs Sarah Koenig); and Break-Up ‚Äì especially the bit where Starlee Kine tries to write a break-up song with the help of Phil Collins.
I‚Äôll mention three more from This American Life . Unconditional Love , a recently rescheduled 2006 episode, begins with a shocking revelation about how physical affection was once deemed bad for children, and continues with the most moving story of a Romanian boy, adopted at seven, whose start in life made it almost impossible for him to bond with his new parents. Then there‚Äôs The Room of Requirement , an uplifting programme about the power of libraries. And from recent episode Beware the Jabberwock , act two, Alex in Wonderland , about Alex Jones, who spread the idea that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax, in which Jon Ronson interviews Jones‚Äôs old schoolfriends.
Love + Radio is another podcast likely to deliver stay-in-the-mind audio. I recently listened to Coming Back , on a friend‚Äôs recommendation. It‚Äôs about a woman who has her brain stopped for a serious operation and who leaves her body and moves towards the light. There‚Äôs The Living Room, a Rear Window -style story ‚Äì usually the first podcast episode I recommend for any newbies. Plus, A Girl of Ivory , about an American love affair, which has a proper oh-my-God moment.
The Memory Palace , which tells stories about the past, came up many times too. Several episodes were mentioned ( Notes on an Imagined Plaque‚Ä¶ ; Roots and Branches and Wind-Borne Seeds ; If You Have to Be a Floor (about‚Ä¶ being a floor). But the one that sears itself on to your heart is episode 90, A White Horse , and it‚Äôs another show I recommend to new podcast listeners.
From Heavyweight , Jonathan Goldstein‚Äôs podcast about ‚Äúthe moment everything changed‚Äù, the episodes Julia, Gregor and Marchel . Radiolab ‚Äôs War of the Worlds (about Orson Welles‚Äôs radio drama) , as well as Lu vs Soo ; Oliver Sipple; and Anna in Somalia .
If you like interviews, there are lots to choose from. Cariad Lloyd‚Äôs Griefcast episodes with Robert Popper , Sara Barr on , Aisling Bea , Adam Buxton . From Richard Herring‚Äôs long-running live interview series RHLSTP , the episodes with Brian Blessed and Stephen Fry . The Two Shot Podcast interview with Joe Gilgun . And from Unfiltered, James O‚ÄôBrien talking to Akala .
Oh, there are so many to choose from! But I‚Äôm going to leave you with two. One is Haven , a recent episode of Radio 4‚Äôs The Digital Human , another long-running show. It‚Äôs about Mats, a young Norwegian who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and his extended group of online friends. Uplifting and upsetting.
The other programme also came out of an excellent Radio 4 show, Short Cuts . A Twitter user mentioned it, and Short Cuts ‚Äô producer, Eleanor McDowall, pointed me to the original interview, which can be found on a little-known podcast, 2+2=5: The Dialogue Project . Scroll down to Prepared to Love , which tells the story of Adrian and how he decided to treat himself on his 42nd birthday. It‚Äôs about sex, romance and self-worth and it had me in absolute bits. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.
Three funny people doing interesting shows Trolled
Actor Tracy Ann Oberman used to be a Twitter-lover. But over the past 18 months, as she‚Äôs increasingly used social media to highlight misogyny and antisemitism (she‚Äôs Jewish), Oberman has found Twitter less welcoming. She has, in fact, been heavily trolled, receiving appalling abuse and death threats so bad she‚Äôs had to involve police. This podcast is Oberman‚Äôs attempt to create something positive out of this awfulness, and in this first episode features MP Luciana Berger and Gary Lineker. Future episodes promise fellow trollees (trolleys?) David Baddiel and Al Murray.
We Have Ways of Making You Talk
A weekly show that looks at the second world war in a different way, with the comedian Al Murray (again) and historian James Holland as presenters. It doesn‚Äôt set out to be a comprehensive, event-by-event retelling of WWII, but rather a did-you-know? show. Each week, Murray and Holland will discuss a second world war thing as a kick-off point ‚Äì such as, in the first episode, an extending piece of metal that‚Äôs actually part of a Spitfire wing. They also tackle how war films often use the wrong equipment. Listeners can send in questions.
Meet David Sedaris
David Sedaris is one of the funniest writers alive, and a new series of his essays started last week on Radio 4. The shows are simple ‚Äì Sedaris just reads out his essays and some of his diary in front of a live audience ‚Äì but they are guaranteed to cheer you up in these fun-free, panicky days. Episode 1, Father Time, is partly about Sedaris‚Äôs 95-year-old dad, and is hilarious and touching, as ever. (Nerdy fact: Sedaris‚Äôs sister, Amy, is an actor, and played Audrey Temple in Gimlet Media‚Äôs Homecoming podcast.)

Russian artist‚Äôs masterpiece ‚Äòwas work of a pupil‚Äô | World news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Vanessa Thorpe,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/kazimir-malevich-lost-masterpiece-painted-by-pupil,"Art lover tracks portrait hailed as by Kazimir Malevich through Soviet archives. Billed as a rediscovered masterpiece by Kazimir Malevich, the portrait of a bohemian Russian woman holding a red bag was the charismatic star of a London exhibition in 2014. Critics picked out the image for special praise in the Tate Modern show dedicated to the avant-garde painter.
But now the painstaking research of a Russian art lover has exposed art world chicanery that appears to lead from the Soviet culture wars of the 1930s to the misattribution of a painting since valued at millions of pounds.
Documents gathered by Andrey Vasiliev and shared with the Observer indicate that the portrait of the stage designer Elizaveta Yakovleva and her jaunty red bag is likely to be the work of the woman she once lived with in Leningrad, a former pupil of Malevich called Maria Dzhagubova. She had also designed the fashionably suprematist , or geometric-shaped, bag that Yakovleva holds.
So, though the portrait was praised during the Tate show by Nicholas Cullinan, now director of the National Portrait Gallery, as a work in which Malevich used colour to rebel by ‚Äútacitly alluding to the innovations he had pioneered‚Äù, it seems it can no longer be regarded as an exciting addition to the figurative output of Malevich, an artist best known for his minimalist 1913 work, Black Square . Cullinan told the Observer he remembers his praise for the work, but had no comment on doubts about its attribution.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Maria Dzhagupova, pictured in the 1910s
The key evidence is a document retrieved from Soviet archives by Vasiliev, a retired psychiatrist, that itemises all the paintings by Dzhagubova that were held by the state. By then socialist realism was the only creative style sanctioned during Stalin‚Äôs rule and works by Malevich and his pupils were suppressed.
A Leningrad ledger lists the work as Position 1 ‚Äì Portrait of Yakovleva estimated at 30 roubles, and gives the inventory number 434 208. This number is still visible on the back of the canvas.
‚ÄúFortunately for both posterity and accuracy, some detail-obsessed Soviet bureaucrat scribbled the accession number of the district financial department on the verso of the portrait of an elegant lady with a suprematist bag,‚Äù said Vasiliev, adding that Dzhagupova, ‚Äúa gifted and prodigious artist‚Äù, was proud of the portrait. ‚ÄúShe included it in the list of her significant creations, supplied for a dictionary of Soviet artists. The portrait was important to her not only because it was one of her better paintings but because Yakovleva was her friend and partner,‚Äù he said.
The Tate show, which came to London from the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn and started in Holland in 2013, displayed the portrait to such advantage that the Stedelijk museum, Amsterdam, was keen to buy it from its Dutch owner, the collector Philip van den Hurk. However, the price asked, of more than ‚Ç¨20m, put an end to negotiations.
Trouble started when the portrait was shown in Russia in 2017 at a Malevich exhibition, Not Just the Black Square. Vasiliev had a feeling of d√©j√† vu. The portrait had been offered to him as a work of an unknown artist during the 1980s, he said.
Vasiliev visited a series of St Petersburg archives and the riddle of the lady with a red bag began to unravel. Several documents in the State Archives of Literature and Art were missing. It seemed the name of Dzhagupova was being airbrushed from art history.
State accounts show the painting was sold in 1977 for 14 roubles 40 kopeks and it didn‚Äôt reapppear until the end of the 1980s, recorded then as the work of an unknown artist. By the 1990s, when van den Hurk purchased it, Malevich‚Äôs signature was there.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kazimir Malevich. Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images
The painting had been authenticated by the time it was seen in the west and was later certified by Andrei Nakov, a French art historian, who expressed doubts about the artist‚Äôs signature. He said: ‚ÄúI developed certain doubts about the portrait, especially after I saw the X-ray of it. I believe that it was started by Malevich but finished by another artist. In future when I publish a new addition of the catalogue raisonn√© I will address this issue.‚Äù
Without seeing the original, the leading American expert on Malevich, Charlotte Douglas, took it to be an authentic Malevich in her essay on his use of textiles in an edition of Art Journal from 1995.
Any attempt to reach Yakovleva, the sitter for the portrait, to settle the issue would by then have been in vain . She had died in the siege of Leningrad in 1942 and the last person close to her, Dzhagubova herself, had died alone in 1975, leaving no family.
For Vasiliev the story of the portrait is illuminating. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, art experts and museum curators elevated the painting created by the unknown pupil of Malevich to the level of masterpiece,‚Äù apparently without being able to check its provenance, he said. ‚ÄúOn the other - the tale of the female artist whose name was erased to appropriate her work as a creation of the great ‚Äòdead white man‚Äô of the Russian avant-garde fits perfectly into contemporary feminist discourse.‚Äù
Yet Vasiliev also suspects Dzhagupova might have been pleased about the misattribution. ‚ÄúAs the devoted pupil of Malevich, who idolised her teacher, she might have been proud that her painting was taken for the best work of his later period.‚Äù

O ne of the great gifts of soul music is the persuasiveness of its succour. Bursting with love and sweeping horn arrangements, the seventh ensemble album from Lee Fields and the Expressions is like being broadsided by the unexpected aroma of wildflowers on some blasted heath: hard to believe, but real nonetheless.
New York scene man Fields is celebrating 50 years of releasing music ‚Äì an artist who has survived his good friends Sharon Jones (once his backing singer) and Charles Bradley (Fields gave the fledgling Bradley an early tour support slot). The Expressions, meanwhile, often double as the Daptone house band, a reservoir of vintage class for the likes of Amy Winehouse.
Here are evergreen contemporary songs in which gratitude and fortitude are exercised in no facile fashion, but with spittle and swagger. The love songs are present and correct ‚Äì the title track and Love Is the Answer bookend the album with an unembarrassed embrace ‚Äì but songs such as Wake Up exhort people to ‚Äúget loud‚Äù as some galvanised production bounces and booms. Two Faces confronts adversaries who think they have the upper hand with Fields‚Äôs rueful righteousness, and trumpets.

It might be too early, too reductively silly, certainly too likely to lead to splenetic bouts of disagreement, but can anyone be said to have had a ‚Äúgood‚Äù Brexit? My own partisanship would allow me to hope that most non-soft brains might want to include Fintan O‚ÄôToole , James O‚ÄôBrien, Anna Soubry, Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy, Donald Tusk.

She was at it again, indefatigable, lucid, unflappable, somehow managing to keep the eye-rolling to a minimum, in The Brexit Storm , a glorious, access-most-areas hour-long recap of just what a wild and crazee ride this has been. Had the programme been aired the night after the referendum, it would have either been written off as an offensive satirical misstep by the likes of Armando Iannucci, or led, for once, to real British riots on real British streets.
As this Italo-Glaswegian scion of Hutchesons‚Äô grammar school took us through not even the full 1,000 days but just the most ludicrous, post-Chequers chunk, in an intelligent mix of to-camera reports and personal asides, you could see her weariness, but also, often, her glee: Kuenssberg, you always feel, actually enjoys this kind of thing. And comes at it with a rare mix of cynicism and energy, while having to change outfits at speed about 12 times a day, and push to the front or squat in the rain to bark (generally) non-snarky questions. When the bulk of the population give in to a feeling of squirmy-head at the latest byzantine demographics, Kuenssberg is always able to understand them, which makes her, frankly, a little odd but also unassailably crucial.
Perhaps wisely, this programme opted to give us little of the presenter herself. Does she ever bitch or bake? Do karaoke or sudoku? Go for long walks down a lonely beach with the mobile left at home? Of this we learned precisely jack. Quite correct. A gal‚Äôs got a right. Instead, among the insights vouchsafed: Theresa May really doesn‚Äôt do small talk. I know everyone says it but, honestly, one could have more amiable, even insightful, chitchat with a napkin. Boris has the intelligence, but not the emotional equipment, for a journey in politics: by far most shots were of him looking simply lost, or with his head in his hands. And, crucially, a cruncher of a post-Chequers memo, leaked to Kuenssberg, revealed how virulently unloved the May deal was even at the time. It‚Äôs worth rewatching for this reveal alone.

Talking of Iannucci, the final series of Veep , the US-based spin-off of The Thick of It which he showran until series 4, began on Sky Atlantic with a roisteringly hearty bout of foot-shootery. It‚Äôs probably time that it should depart, but I‚Äôm going to miss it immensely: gag per minute, it‚Äôs as richly seamed as Brooklyn Nine-Nine . I know most people say that it‚Äôs impossible to compete satirically with the real events unfolding in the White House, but sometimes, surely, it‚Äôs just enough to get on with being very, very funny. (Besides, I wonder how much successful skewering is being done among the sharp and enlightened. When two of the highest profile ‚Äújokes‚Äù of recent times have involved a giant inflated baby, and a depiction of Trump with a small penis, you might want to regrade the parameters of ‚Äúhumour‚Äù.)
Anyway, Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus, still worth every Emmy going) is running again for president, launching her bid at the shrine that is the birthplace of women‚Äôs rights activist Susan B Anthony. ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she gasps, ‚Äúthis place has feminist symbolism just‚Ä¶ spurting out of its dickhole.‚Äù Selina simply lives, breathes, such crassnesses: gloriously, more than she should, she actually voices them.
She‚Äôs not sure about standing for ‚Äúall America‚Äù. How about, an aide suggests, Real America? ‚ÄúI like that. We can figure out what it means later.‚Äù When finally settling on why she‚Äôs actually running ‚Äì ‚ÄúTell them it‚Äôs all about getting a better deal for Americans. Or some fucking crap like that‚Äù ‚Äì she is congratulated: Kennedyesque. ‚ÄúBut John, right? Not Teddy. Or the‚Ä¶ rapey‚Ä¶ one. Or the one that killed that little girl.‚Äù But the altogether is far from crass, and we even get a smartish explanation of the difference between metonymy and synecdoche. And, later in the series, a fine trope in which young pretty women queue up to accuse senators and congressmen of entirely ‚Äúappropriate behaviour‚Äù: they are often in tears because the politicos have boastfully and falsely claimed intimate knowledge. The hashtag #notme begins to trend.
Our Planet is, by Mr Attenborough‚Äôs reckoning, worth abandoning (temporarily) the Beeb for, in order to employ Netflix‚Äôs budget and, crucially, power of global message, to reach an audience 10 times the numbers achievable with Blue Planet II . I reckon it‚Äôs been a good gamble. To nobody‚Äôs surprise, it‚Äôs phenomenally well filmed; the aerial shots of glaciers plunging into the Arctic sea just beggar belief. It is also relatively unafraid to lecture: every episode features quietly urgent warnings, about overfishing, say, or date palm overforestation. This is rather refreshing: it feels as if we are being told facts, rather than cottonwooled with cuddly animals and a mimsied semi-warning over the end credits.
It‚Äôs unafraid to engage the brain too, daring some relatively complex explanations of the interconnectedness between most biological microsystems, their careful millennia of natural balance and how the doubling of the Earth‚Äôs human population since the moon landings is jeopardising the scales. And, wonderfully, it offers some ways forward. All good, then, but, oh, the bloody music. Never mind Ellie Goulding‚Äôs dirgefest of a closing anthem, the intrusive incidental stuff grates way too often. Worst, always, is the jaunty ‚Äúhumorous‚Äù stuff by which perky oboes and grampus bassoons illustrate, say, baby wildebeest playfully trampolining on the savannah, or courting manakin birds, or a wolf wittily ripping the throat from a young caribou. There‚Äôs just, really, No Need.

I suspected even halfway through the opener of Line of Duty that the undercover cop we were being nudged towards (Rochenda Sandall) wasn‚Äôt an undercover cop but a nasty piece of real gang work. Well, aren‚Äôt I the clever little smugkins? So well versed are we in the writings of Jed Mercurio that he finds it hard to slip these red herrings past us; the price of success. But I certainly hadn‚Äôt guessed on it being the wonderful Stephen Graham . At least four dead cops to his direct credit after this episode alone, he, and Mercurio, are going to have to work awful hard at plausible extrication. Buckle in: this might be the best yet.
Quite accountably, in the less than loved This Time With Alan Partridge , they saved the very worst for last. I‚Äôd retained hopes for this, and some of the format worked winningly, but as soon as his co-host, the wonderful Susannah Fielding, walked off set at the very start, it fell apart: Alan was just allowed to get nasty, which was never, ever, the point. I‚Äôd love to see Alan return. Just not with those writers.

The five: underwater discoveries | Technology | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,msn.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/07/the-five-underwater-discoveries-archaeology-ancient-civilisations-lost-worlds,"Five of the most significant finds in subaquatic archaeology. Lake Titicaca On 1 April, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US highlighted the significance of a recent expedition that made multiple finds in the depths of Lake Titicaca. Among gold medallions, precious shells and stone artefacts were the bones of sacrificed young llamas. The discovery provides new insights into the religious rituals of the pre-Columbian Tiwanaku state that dominated in the Andes region between AD500 and 900.

In the first century BC, a Roman-era ship sank near the Greek island of Antikythera . Some 2,000 years later, sponge divers accidentally found the wreck in what became one of the most extraordinary of underwater archaeological discoveries. Expeditions to the site have recovered classical bronze and marble statues and a complex astronomical device known as the Antikythera mechanism .

About 400 metres off the shores of Israel lies the neolithic village of Atlit-Yam . Initial findings in the 1980s were followed by expeditions that unveiled a settlement with wells and houses and more than 60 skeletons. The site is one of the best preserved prehistoric villages . It was submerged after the ice age, but life at Atlit-Yam had already come to an end, perhaps due to a tsunami.

This site in the south of Greece had already been explored in the late 1960s, but in 2009 new technological methods revealed its archaeological significance. Dating back 5,000 years, the site is considered the oldest submerged city . Other, older underwater settlements have been discovered, but none of them boasts such distinctly urban features as Pavlopetri.

In 1933, an RAF commander spotted ruins under the sea when flying over the mouth of the Nile. He visited the site with an Egyptian scholar and discovered several artefacts. By the end of the century it was revealed that they were the ruins of two ancient cities: Thonis-Heracleion and Canopus. Expeditions found statues and other treasures .

Edvard Munch ‚Äòreunited‚Äô with fianc√©e for British Museum show | Art and design | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Vanessa Thorpe,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/07/edvard-munch-portrait-fiance-british-museum,"Edvard Munch‚Äôs most angst-filled moment may well not be represented by his best known work, The Scream . Another painting in a British Museum exhibition that opens on Thursday holds the key to a moment of greater drama and violence in the Norwegian painter‚Äôs troubled life.
In 1902 inside the bedroom at the home of his fiancee, Tulla Larsen, an argument escalated and shots were fired. Munch, who sustained a bullet wound to his left hand in the scuffle, later sawed his portrait of the two of them in half. Now visitors to the museum will be able to see the two pieces side by side.
‚ÄúHe did this extraordinary portrait at the height of their relationship,‚Äù said the curator Giulia Bartram. ‚ÄúHe looks red-faced and she looks pretty fed up. The halves have remained in the Munch family.‚Äù
Bartram hopes visitors will see the significance of the work and she argues that Munch‚Äôs portraits of women are the unsung stars of the new show. ‚ÄúMunch had hugely complicated relationships with women,‚Äù said Bartram. ‚ÄúHe almost physically feared them. He was nervous about commitment to the point of neurosis. And perhaps his most torturous relationship was with Larsen.‚Äù
Larsen, the daughter of an affluent wine merchant, pursued him around Europe.
‚ÄúTheir relationship went on for about four years and she was the only woman to whom Munch was actually engaged,‚Äù said Bartram. ‚ÄúAlthough he spent most of his time trying to run away from her. His relationships with women can be found throughout his work, although these paintings have been overshadowed by the fame of The Scream . If it wasn‚Äôt for these women, he might not have been such a brilliant artist or created such visceral work.‚Äù
The injury to the painter‚Äôs left hand was the subject of one of the very first medical X-ray photographs taken and it captured the image of the bullet. Munch later said the shooting had only happened because he was drinking too much; but, warns Bartram, he often wrote and rewrote the facts of the more significant incidents in his life."

Are big tech‚Äôs efforts to show it cares about data ethics another diversion? | John Naughton | Opinion | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,John Naughton,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/big-tech-data-ethics-diversion-google-advisory-council,"Google‚Äôs establishment of an advisory council comes across as little more than window-dressing. Y ou may not have noticed it, but there‚Äôs a feeding frenzy under way in the tech world. Traditionally, such frenzies are driven by greed. This one, interestingly, is driven by fear, though you‚Äôd never guess that from its cover story, which is that it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúethics‚Äù, specifically the ethics of using (and, more commonly, abusing) personal data. Suddenly, wherever you look, data ethics has become the obsession du jour of governments, tech companies and regulators. Everyone and his dog is now publishing data-ethics guides, codes and pious exhortations. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, for example, is setting up a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation . Consortiums of tech companies have set up initiatives such as the Partnership on AI (motto: ‚ÄúThe best way to ensure a good future for AI is to invent it together‚Äù). Google has published a set of ‚Äú AI principles ‚Äù and the other day followed up with an external advisory council ‚Äúto help advance the responsible development of AI‚Äù. And so on.
I‚Äôve been tracking this obsession for a while, tagging every instance of it that I found on the web with the software I use for keeping track of memes. At first, I thought that the accumulating stack of references was just a reflection of journalistic scepticism and my suspicious temperament. But it turns out that I was not alone in noticing this trend. No less a source than Gartner, the technology analysis company, for example, has also sussed it and indeed has logged ‚Äúdata ethics‚Äù as one of its top 10 strategic trends for 2019.
Given that the tech giants, which have been ethics-free zones from their foundations, owe their spectacular growth partly to the fact that they have, to date, been entirely untroubled either by legal regulation or scruples about exploiting taxation loopholes, this Damascene conversion is surely something to be welcomed, is it not? Ethics, after all, is concerned with the moral principles that affect how individuals make decisions and how they lead their lives.
That charitable thought is unlikely to survive even a cursory inspection of what is actually going on here. In an admirable dissection of the fourth of Google‚Äôs ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù (‚ÄúBe accountable to people‚Äù), for example, Prof David Watts reveals that, like almost all of these principles, it has the epistemological status of pocket lint or those exhortations to be kind to others one finds on evangelical websites. Does it mean accountable to ‚Äúpeople‚Äù in general? Or just to Google‚Äôs people? Or to someone else‚Äôs people (like an independent regulator)? Answer comes there none from the code.
Warming to his task, Prof Watts continues: ‚ÄúIf Google‚Äôs AI algorithms mistakenly conclude I am a terrorist and then pass this information on to national security agencies who use the information to arrest me, hold me incommunicado and interrogate me, will Google be accountable for its negligence or for contributing to my false imprisonment? How will it be accountable? If I am unhappy with Google‚Äôs version of accountability, to whom do I appeal for justice?‚Äù
Quite so. But then Google goes and doubles down on absurdity with its prestigious ‚Äúadvisory council‚Äù that ‚Äúwill consider some of Google‚Äôs most complex challenges that arise under our AI Principles, such as facial recognition and fairness in machine learning, providing diverse perspectives to inform our work‚Äù.
One of the luminaries chosen to do this is Kay Coles James, president of the Heritage Foundation , an influential rightwing thinktank that played a significant role in helping Trump identify suitable candidates for his White House staff. James, for her part, has fought against equal-rights laws for gay and transgender people, a fact that prompted an open letter objecting to her membership of the council. ‚ÄúIn selecting James,‚Äù the authors write, ‚ÄúGoogle is making clear that its version of ‚Äòethics‚Äô values proximity to power over the wellbeing of trans people, other LGBTQ people and immigrants.‚Äù
Google‚Äôs half-baked ‚Äúethical‚Äù initiative is par for the tech course at the moment. Which is only to be expected, given that it‚Äôs not really about morality at all. What‚Äôs going on here is ethics theatre modelled on airport-security theatre ‚Äì ie security measures that make people feel more secure without doing anything to actually improve their security.
The tech companies see their newfound piety about ethics as a way of persuading governments that they don‚Äôt really need the legal regulation that is coming their way. Nice try, boys (and they‚Äôre still mostly boys), but it won‚Äôt wash.
Postscript: Since this column was written, Google has announced that it is disbanding its ethics advisory council ‚Äì the likely explanation is that the body collapsed under the weight of its own manifest absurdity.

Tippett has always had his advocates, but after his death he fell into near oblivion. For the most part his compositions are neglected, the pacifist wartime choral work A Child of Our Time and a few orchestral works aside. His music is uneven, prone to adopt the latest vernacular and then appear dated. Some of it is embarrassing (‚ÄúSure, baby,‚Äù as his 1970 libretto for The Knot Garden has it). His gift was for the long phrase, the neoromantic outpouring, in an era of spiky experiment and tight control. King Priam (1962) is powerful, the other operas ‚Äì The Midsummer Marriage , The Ice Break ‚Äì awkward to stage, but surely worth another try. His second symphony, difficult but not unplayable, broke down at its first performance. The conductor, Adrian Boult, apologised and started again. Tippett apologised too, though it wasn‚Äôt his fault. He was that sort of person.
Yet there are so many pleasures, both grand and tender, to be found. Two decades after he died ‚Äì an apparently statutory interval before reassessing the culturally unfashionable ‚Äì Tippett renewal is in the air. Oliver Soden ‚Äôs bumper new authorised biography (seriously bumper: around 600 pages of text, 150 pages of notes and index), the first full-length life, should fire interest. A John Bridcut documentary, made with Soden, is in the offing, and an exhibition on the composer‚Äôs life has opened at the Red House in Aldeburgh , former home of his younger contemporary Benjamin Britten .
This book furnishes every event, major and minor, from birth to death with comment, observation, quotation
Tippett was a late starter, whereas Britten was precocious; he was slow to work, whereas Britten was fast and fluent; and, unlike Britten, he wasn‚Äôt instinctive. Nor was he the amateur some would suggest (indefatigable though he was in helping real amateurs to make music, at Morley College and elsewhere). It‚Äôs a tribute to Tippett, or more so to Britten, who was merciless in dropping friends for the smallest offence, that the two remained on good terms. The older composer never wrote anything to match Peter Grimes . Nor did he achieve the success of Britten, who may never have feared him as a rival. Tippett‚Äôs strange radiance is harder to grasp or sum up.
Exhaustively researched, lovingly detailed, epic in scale, revelling in gossip, stuffed with information, this book furnishes every event, major and minor, from birth to death, with comment, observation, quotation. Unpublished letters, diaries, audio tapes and recollections from friends have fuelled the narrative. Each page seethes with anecdote, episode and excursion. At times I wondered whether I could justify so many hours spent absorbed in the composer‚Äôs tumultuous love life; his politics; his double pneumonia; troubled friends‚Äô breakdowns and, in some instances, suicide; the cost of his house or its refurbishment; or the state of his parents‚Äô sex life or his own, fascinating though it is.
Soden‚Äôs irresistible attraction to metaphor sometimes clogs his well-marshalled prose. While some judicious, or even savage, editing would have been welcome ‚Äì there‚Äôs a slimmer book struggling to get out ‚Äì we should accept and enjoy this super-abundant, loving account. Its like will not come again.

The Tippett milieu is a fertile subject from the off. He grew up in an eccentric English family, his mother a suffragette, briefly detained in Holloway prison, who expected her younger son, Michael, to support the cause by speaking in public aged eight. On 28 February 1913, a suffragist newspaper reported the boy‚Äôs fervent words: ‚ÄúSome people say that the men are more clever than the women, and stronger and bigger. But you can just tell them that they are not right, for some women are even bigger than the men ‚Äì like my mother ‚Äì and cleverer too.‚Äù
His father pursued a series of precarious, not unsuccessful enterprises. ‚ÄúHe reads the Times all day and sleeps in Mummy‚Äôs bed all night,‚Äù the young Tippett boys said, when asked.
Soden is perceptive in unravelling Tippett‚Äôs tortured but warm personality. He couldn‚Äôt bear trouble. When a relationship with a younger man foundered because the man had taken up with not one but two women, Tippett took them all on holiday. When another lover returned to his ex-wife (there are many men, each logged here, their sleeping arrangements and covert liaisons assessed), Tippett‚Äôs response was: ‚ÄúWonderful for them all.‚Äù
I met Tippett, too briefly, in his final years. Tall, stooping, bright blue eyes weak from macular degeneration but still piercing, he embodied charm. He wore bright clothes, and his laugh was a boyish giggle. Soden (born in 1990), who inherited the task of writing this first full life from the late Dennis Marks (ex-BBC and English National Opera), was too young to have known Tippett. He makes up for that loss with sleuth-like questing, talking to those who remember him, using imagination to bring alive Tippett‚Äôs Edwardian childhood, his 1930s Trotskyist youth, midlife as an impoverished prep-school teacher, delayed fame, a late surge of creativity. Soden‚Äôs sense of adventure endears: he even gets to commune with Tippett‚Äôs ashes. As he says, in the writing of this book: ‚ÄúI have lived his life, more, it sometimes felt, than my own.‚Äù
His preoccupation is with the man. Sometimes, the human detail is so full you miss the not insignificant fact that Tippett has just completed an opera or symphony. It‚Äôs an insoluble dilemma when writing about a composer.
Soden states in his preface that the book is a ‚Äúlife‚Äù, not a ‚Äúlife-n-works‚Äù. There is no technical analysis. ‚ÄúI invite musicologists and performers to go on from here.‚Äù Thus Soden lets himself off the hook on which his critics might hang him. This gap will trouble some, relieve others, if only because an already monumental book would have been twice the length. As a panoramic view of an artistic, political, sexual and social life in the past century, it omits nothing.

The word is also slightly shorter and pithier than centre.
I think the current use stems from network theory in which a hub is the central connector that links otherwise disparate entities. Itself used as simile to the hub of a bicycle wheel.
It is therefore arguably more apt than centre when describing centres that have linking as a core function. Eg transport, business. And maybe the sports centre is supposed to bring people together and various sports together.
I do think it is easy to be critical of a stylistic change. Especially of one that is perfectly grammatical with dictionary-perfect usage (I checked). Indeed - of one that may represent more succinct and more nuanced description."

T here‚Äôs no strong evidence that if you warm up, you will reduce your risk of injury, but there is evidence that warming up can improve your performance. Five to 10 minutes of aerobic exercise will raise your muscle temperature and your heart rate so that more oxygen reaches your muscles. Warming up also provides an opportunity to incorporate beneficial exercises such as strengthening and control work.
Brief workouts for runners: dynamic warm-up Read more
Whether or not you warm up will probably depend on how long and how hard you plan to work out. If you have 20 minutes for a run, you could just put your shoes on and go. If you are about to take part in a race, such as a Parkrun-type event, you might want to warm up for 15 or 20 minutes. Elite athletes will warm up for 45 minutes to an hour before they go into competition, and may do specific exercises such as ‚Äústrides‚Äù ‚Äì race-pace speeds to prepare the body. You don‚Äôt need to do that if you‚Äôre going for a gentle jog around the park. If you‚Äôre really unfit, you could warm up with a walk-run.
As far as stretching is concerned, it also doesn‚Äôt prevent injury, and there is a school of thought that if you do lots of sustained static stretching ‚Äì holding a position ‚Äì it can dampen down some of the force your muscles can produce. Most athletes will do more ‚Äúdynamic mobility‚Äù work, where you take your joints through their range of motion, rather than holding a stretch.

I can‚Äôt do without... A gender-neutral scent for a fresh spring day Come spring, I begin reconsidering my fragrance choices. Olfactory families, however, can be tough to navigate - floral, too sweet, citrus sometimes reminiscent of bathroom cleaner, gourmand‚Ä¶ well, why anyone would go out of their way to smell like vanilla or chocolate is beyond me. These things, of course, are subjective. It is impossible to choose a fragrance that gratifies every nose. No one wants to wear something bland and forgettable (your fragrance says so much about who you are), but at the other end of the spectrum, you never want to be that person whose scent overwhelms to the point of nausea (lady on the weekly rush hour Southern train, please take note). Colognes, I find, are less likely to offend. Now let‚Äôs not get confused here. I‚Äôm not talking about Old Spice. The new breed of colognes are gender-neutral, smell utterly exquisite and are worth the investment ‚Äì like the exciting Californian-inspired trio from Louis Vuitton. Sun Song (a musky orange blossom), Afternoon Swim (think freshly cut oranges) and Cactus Garden (a bergamot and exotic tea blend) all have the traditional freshness of a cologne with the endurance of a fine perfume.

I t‚Äôs April, the time of showers and warmth, so it‚Äôs likely safe to say it‚Äôs the month to unleash your soil. Uncover cloches if you sowed hardy vegetables in March, and lift them from any over-wintered chards and kales.
Plant any potatoes you haven‚Äôt yet got in the ground and earth up any earlies already in. Go back over seed beds. We don‚Äôt divide our plot into beds except by sowing different rows in different directions: a combination of leaves, say, running one way, beets another, herbs perhaps scattered through, calendula, too, for colour and companion planting. There is no right or wrong, though best not to sow the same seed in the same place every year if you have enough space avoid it.
Sow rocket now, and pick through as it grows. Try a short test row of radicchio (it may still be a little early). Sow spinach and chard to replace last year‚Äôs lingering leaves, though perhaps leave one strong chard to seed. Repeat-sow any oriental salad mix in a ratio that best pleases you. I will often add wild rocket.
Sow carrots, beetroot, lettuce, radishes, parsley, and start off, say, basil inside. Sow leeks and onion seed if you are not planting onion sets. Remember to sow fennel away from coriander or dill as they may cross-pollinate. But be more careful with sowing tender plants the further north you are.
Think about starting off summer squashes inside so you can transplant them outdoors in May. The same rule applies to any French and runner beans and sweetcorn. It‚Äôs also likely to be your last chance to sow tomatoes indoors if you want them to ripen outside.
In short: the garden message this month is simple: it‚Äôs (nearly) all go. So sow.

What an outstanding review, I was really interested to read how Jay decided which places he was going to review, I was worried he was told which places, but seems from this he has free choice. I'm pleased with that.
I'm sure I'd love this place, and I'm jealous of Benedisco above who lives so close. Those dishes and photo's are mouth watering. Well except for the offal, I know this is a failing on my part but I just can't shake off my dislike of offal. I have too many memories of when we were younger and offal was all we could afford from the butcher. That's not to say my wife didn't do wonderful things with lambs hearts and pig kidneys but we knew we'd rather have steak or chops.
Anyway, another great piece Jay, thank you. -Jim"

Having been in therapy off and on for 20 years (with a large break after one therapist cried in front of me and another disclosed her own problems with depression), I'd say the therapists and counsellors who have disclosed personal struggles have completely disengaged me. Much like when I was violently raped, friends and family came out of the woodwork to tell me their own stories of child abuse and rape. Of course I wanted to be sympathetic but the thing was I was all out of sympathy at that time. It was well meant but not helpful. I think disclosure can be helpful in peer support, e.g. Mental Health First Aid but even then needs to be handled very carefully, e.g. as ""I'm evidence that there is hope for the future"" not ""I know how you feel, I tried to commit suicide once."""

Not only did she not diagnose the PTSD but her crying as I told her my traumatic experience put me off therapy for 8 years meaning it took me getting so much worse, to the point of a suicide attempt before I was diagnosed, got the help I needed and I started to get better.
It may be suitable for some therapeutic relationships for the counsellor or therapist to be more human in their responses but for me it doesn't work. I am not there for the therapist to be upset at my predicament even if that is due to a reminder in their history. In my opinion, friends are there for commiserating with not therapists. I don't want to talk to a therapist and be constantly worried about how they're feeling. I need it to be a relationship where I can say anything about how I'm feeling."

The central character, Billy Batson (Asher Angel), is 14; so is his smart-alec foster brother and ‚Äúmanager‚Äù, Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer). Billy is granted a tidy collection of magic powers by a wizard (a bewigged and bearded Djimon Hounsou), including strength, super-speed and fingertips filled with lightning. By shouting ‚ÄúShazam!‚Äù he is transformed into an adult in a superhero suit (Zachary Levi, believably and likably hapless), so, like many 14-year-old boys, he uses his new identity to buy beer (which he promptly spits out), saunter into a strip club, and go viral on YouTube. The evil Dr Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong) is after Billy‚Äôs powers, hell-bent on revenge after being told, as a child, by both his father and the wizard that he was weak.
There‚Äôs a sense of Stranger Things camaraderie among Billy and his foster siblings, who are actually fun to spend time with, and the film‚Äôs message of found family is a sweet one. Still, its overblown finale overstays its welcome, teeing up the team as mainstays in the inevitable sequel.

"Thukral and Tagra: Bread, Circuses and TBD; Kimsooja: To Breathe ‚Äì review | Art and design | The Guardian",www.theguardian.com,Laura Cumming,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/07/thukral-tagra-bread-circuses-kimsooja-to-breathe-yorkshire-sculpture-park-review,"A new gallery opens with a bout of conscience wrestling. Across the park, Kimsooja‚Äôs chapel of light would be perfect but for the heavy breathing. A new gallery has opened in the rolling green paradise of Yorkshire Sculpture Park . Or rather an ace cafe with a space for art. The new Weston building, a visitor centre designed by architects Feilden Fowles , is light-filled, airy and undoubtedly beautiful, its concrete and polished plaster tinted to match the sandstone bedrock of this glorious landscape, which is everywhere visible through spectacular windows, beneath a roof planted with spreading wild flowers.
The restaurant is all wood-burning stoves and Scandinavian neutrals, the entrance hall so capacious you could throw a party beneath its wood-wool ceiling. And the gallery is handsome too, with sweeping roof lights in ribbed striations. But it is barely a third of the building, and so regular a box as to feel more like a conference centre, an effect cruelly reinforced by the inaugural show , which amounts to little more than a set of conference papers.

Delhi-based artists Thukral and Tagra are deeply involved in the plight of destitute farmers in India. They have established a kitchen in Jalandhar, Thukral‚Äôs hometown, to support the families of farmers affected by suicide and debt. They want us to understand something of their suffering. On the gallery floor is a vast version of a Twister mat, in which visitors are invited to adopt the positions of a traditional form of Indian wrestling known as kushti, in order ‚Äúphysically to connect with the issues and consider the problems‚Äù.
Alas, the positions are a kind of slack and all too easy yoga. Giggling inevitably breaks out, and nobody can hold any of the poses while also reading the consciousness-raising leaflet. Equally, the walls are hung with digitalised DayGlo collages of crops, farmers and wrestling that the eye simply cannot read. The artists‚Äô devotion to raising our awareness of the endless concatenation of tribulations ‚Äì from poor seed stock to drought, low government pricing, seasonal unemployment and urban migration ‚Äì is not in doubt. But they haven‚Äôt found a way to evoke any of it.

The one outstanding contribution here is a printout of a blog about the devastating suicide of a young girl who wanted to spare her impoverished parents the terrible burden of trying to raise a dowry for her marriage. You can find this online . In fact, read anything by the distinguished Indian writer Devinder Sharma and you will learn, feel and understand far more.
Across the idyllic park is another new show, by the South Korean artist Kimsooja . This takes place in the chapel, or rather it transforms that exquisite classical building in the simplest but most astonishing way. Step inside the ordered black and white interior, from 1744, and you find it filled with what appears to be the radiant light of some imaginary new heaven, conjured merely with mirrors.
The floor is liquid light, reflecting and redoubling the magnificently precise architecture around it. The steps to the altar dissolve in light, so disorientating you hardly know where to put your feet. And most breathtaking of all are the rainbows that shed their brilliant colours through every high window, prisms radiating across the walls, floor and ceiling.
It is a marvellous experience, immediately summoning the poetry of the King James Bible, the language of rainbows after the flood, of divine light, of the land of milk and honey. The experience is so pure, so immaculate, as to rise to a spiritual level, no matter what one‚Äôs beliefs. Look through the windows, and the sun itself appears to be bursting into strange new rays through the perfect peace.
And then Kimsooja blows it with a fatuous soundtrack of herself breathing faster and faster, louder and louder, as if she‚Äôd run all the way up the hill to the chapel and was now winded. One word ‚Äì that‚Äôs all it might have taken; but the relationship between artists and curators is getting awfully complacent these days.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kimsooja‚Äôs To Breathe. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA
At the original visitor centre, you can strap on a pair of headphones and listen to a new work of sound art by Dillan Marsh and Eleanor Clare to accompany you through the park. The Poacher‚Äôs Lament could have been so good, echoes creeping up in the strangest of places. But the opening electronic cacophony is repellent, and the footsteps rushing up behind you are crass. Harsh little incantations fill your ears in front of the wide blue lake, and across the bridge where a sculpture rises from the waters like a drowning headstone, its latter-day Romanticism undermined by the soundtrack.
Still, what makes Yorkshire Sculpture Park so unique is its freedom, in all respects. There is no entry ticket, and you are entirely at liberty to roam across 300 beautiful acres, planted with contemporary sculpture, from Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth to Andy Goldsworthy, Jaume Plensa and Ai Weiwei. You can ‚Äì are encouraged to ‚Äì take it or leave it, to love a work, or to walk on and away.
And it contains one of the greatest works of outdoor art in this country, namely Deer Shelter Skyspace , by the American light and space artist James Turrell . Converting the old shelter into a miniature pantheon ‚Äì a rotunda, its dome open to the heavens ‚Äì he frames the sky as an ever-changing image that slows down the mind and eye. Even small children sit there, still and spellbound with awe.

T he fifth feature from stop-motion animation studio Laika ( Coraline , Kubo and the Two Strings ) is a witty, nimble dismantling of British colonialism. Victorian explorer Sir Lionel Frost (Hugh Jackman) seeks a mythical Sasquatch (Zach Galifianakis), a marzipan-textured Bigfoot resembling a giant pine cone with a monkey‚Äôs snout and an affable, human smile. The Sasquatch can talk (and write!), goes by the name of Susan, and wishes only to be escorted to Shangri-La to reunite with his Yeti cousins. Frost‚Äôs motivations are selfish: he simply wants in on a member‚Äôs club at the mercy of gatekeeper Lord Piggot-Dunceby (Stephen Fry). His ex-lover Adelina (Zoe Saldana) is both travel companion and educator, criticising his sneering, entitled colonial attitude towards their new friend (‚ÄúYou poke him with your stick, call him names, say he smells, treat him like your slave!‚Äù). Even more satisfyingly tongue-in-cheek is when Piggot-Dunceby climbs on a table, shoes on, proudly exclaiming that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taught British table manners to savages!‚Äù Yet the film feels more like an elbow in the ribs than a slap on the wrist, revelling in the miscommunications between Susan the Sasquatch‚Äôs literal-minded monkey brain (‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say!‚Äù jokes Frost. ‚ÄúI do!‚Äù he replies).

Free Spirit , the 21-year-old Texas singer‚Äôs follow-up, is more universally resonant. Full of Robin Schulz-esque sweet guitar licks, warm synths and exquisite, powerful vocals, it sits somewhere between early Frank Ocean, Miguel and even the better parts of Zayn Malik‚Äôs recent work.
Khalid‚Äôs concerns are still youthful (on lithe bop My Bad, he‚Äôs apologising for not replying to a text), but Free Spirit makes for an engaging listen, if perhaps not as exuberant as the title suggests. The standouts come when he digs deeper: the self-indulgent romance in lines such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been focusing on putting me first, so can never see you with somebody else‚Äù; the gloriously squelchy funk infusion of Paradise; the epic, gospel-tinged Heaven. At 17 tracks, the album feels long, but at its best, Free Spirit finds Khalid soaring closer to becoming pop‚Äôs next big star.

Come from Away review ‚Äì surprisingly uplifting 9/11 musical | Stage | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Claire Armitstead,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/07/come-from-away-review-musical-9-11-phoenix,"Making a song and dance of how Newfoundland took in thousands of diverted passengers after the World Trade Center attack is fun up to a point. T here‚Äôs a lot to love about Come from Away , the feelgood 9/11 musical, if you allow yourself to go with the flow of slightly hokey camaraderie. The songs are fun and serve the drama well; the staging is nifty, the actors stick refreshingly to the authentic side of slick, and there‚Äôs even a take-it-away moment for the humble bodhr√°n as part of a joyous ceilidh number.
Crafted as a hymn to the power of community, this story of how the Canadian island of Newfoundland coped with the arrival of 38 planeloads of traumatised passengers after the attack on the World Trade Center has carried its own community with it on its travels from a Canadian college to Broadway and on to London‚Äôs West End. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre writing a show about giving people sandwiches? Good luck with that!‚Äù the local airport director reportedly told the show‚Äôs creators, Irene Sankoff and David Hein .
And you can see his point: nothing much happens for not very long, though friendships are forged, relationships tested, and an unlikely romance blossoms between an uptight English oil executive and a lonely Texan divorcee. For those of us fortunate enough not to have been directly involved, 9/11 is chiefly notable today for the wars it unleashed around the world. This a big load for a single character to carry ‚Äì and it is invested here in the tragicomic struggles of Muslim Ali to prove himself to be not a fundamentalist terrorist but an acclaimed chef.
Like most of the named characters, Ali is a composite of real people, played by an actor who doubles up, in this case, as a gay man. Though the casting makes an interesting connection between two embattled communities, I wished Ali had been given his own song. Watching his painful story flicker through the bonhomie felt uncomfortably like accompanying a once-bullied child to a jolly reunion of a class you weren‚Äôt in.

Based on Patrick deWitt‚Äôs 2011 novel , French director Jacques Audiard‚Äôs English-language debut is a revisionist western. Images of the Oregon trail‚Äôs deserted beauty invoke the genre‚Äôs cinematic history, but these aren‚Äôt John Ford‚Äôs stoic, taciturn cowboys. Instead, they‚Äôre foul-mouthed and self-destructive (drunkard Charlie), sensitive (the soft-hearted Eli), even idealistic (would-be socialist Hermann).
Reilly is particularly good here, browbeaten tenderness leaking, for example, into a role-play scene at a whorehouse. The film‚Äôs sometimes tiresome sense of humour is laddish in its embrace of viscera (blood, boils, vomit and live spiders all feature), but as the narrative trots (or, rather, plods) along, its men are revealed to be endearingly less so.

The end result shows the strengths and weaknesses of that way of working: powerful characterisations and zippy dialogue set in a hash-bash structure.
Director Laurence Boswell makes the most of the pluses, deftly orchestrating tensions and deploying a cracking cast to maximum advantage. Stella Feehily‚Äôs adaptation (set, for reasons unexplained, in the Republic of Ireland) gives the actors punchy, rhythmic language to play with - they seize it with relish (special mention to Laoisha O‚ÄôCallaghan‚Äôs Mary and Rowan Polonski‚Äôs Marko).
Under one roof, three adult generations of the socially disadvantaged Coleman family live lives that are described as ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù if you are poor and hungry, but ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù if you are rich and starving yourself thin. As one character puts it: ‚ÄúWe are a normal family ‚Äì with issues.‚Äù Granny, her daughter Mary, Mary‚Äôs twins, Damian and Gaby, and their half-brother, Marko (who has particular ‚Äúbehavioural issues‚Äù) express their shifting antagonisms through horseplay bordering on violence.
Only Granny commands the love and respect of all, including Marko‚Äôs sister: separated from the family by her father while a baby, raised in affluent circumstances and now a successful businesswoman, Veronica is an occasional visitor to the family home-cum-battlefield. When Granny is taken to hospital, the quasi-farcical action, now spliced with melodrama, becomes increasingly mechanical and plot-driven. The impression that the characters are being manipulated for the benefit of a well-fed audience is intensified by a forced-feeling ending aiming at Chekhovian pathos.
