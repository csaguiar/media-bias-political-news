Lessons learned at Delta State should pay dividends for Jeremy McClain at Southern Miss,mississippitoday.org,Rick Cleveland,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://mississippitoday.org/2019/04/05/lessons-learned-at-delta-state-should-pay-dividends-for-jeremy-mcclain-at-southern-miss/,"Lessons learned at Delta State should pay dividends for Jeremy McClain at Southern Miss By Subscribe to Sports
The late, especially great Boo Ferriss was the man who introduced me to Jeremy McClain, just hired Thursday as athletic director at Southern Miss.
McClain was an All American pitcher for Delta State and getting batters out as few have before or since. This was in the late ’90s, long after Ferriss had retired from coaching and become DSU’s No. 1 fan.
“You need to see this Jeremy McClain pitch,” Ferriss told me. “He doesn’t overpower you. He moves the ball around, in and out, up and down. Changes speeds. Little of this, little of that. Throws strikes. He pitches smart. Got a lot of Greg Maddux in him.”
McClain laughed Friday morning when I repeated Ferriss’ description of him. Said McClain, “Well, if you don’t have any talent you have to figure out something.” Rick Cleveland
McClain figured out a lot. He was 45-9 over four Delta State seasons, 15-0 as a senior – a little of this, a little of that and a whole lot of winning. He ranks No. 2 all-time in NCAA Division II in career victories. If McClain directs USM athletics as well as he pitched college baseball, Golden Eagle fans will have much to cheer in the coming years. Southern Miss has been through five athletic directors (counting interims) in eight years. Some stability is badly needed. This is one time, seems to me, they got it right. Southern Miss media relations Jeremy McClain, left, with former Southern Miss athletic director Bill McGillis.
A Houlka native, McClain knows Mississippi. He knows Southern Miss having served as deputy athletic director for three years before becoming the athletic director at Troy in 2015. More importantly, he knows how to do a lot with a little. He has been doing that his entire career in athletic administration, first as athletic director at Delta State, then at USM and for the last nearly four years at Troy.
“None of the places I’ve worked have been flush with resources,” McClain said. “You have to be innovative. You have to find new revenue sources and optimize what you have. You have to outwork people. That’s what we’ll do.”
At Troy, McClain completed a $24 million football stadium renovation that included new locker room facilities, new training facilities, a new meeting room and a new club seating area. The Troy football program won 31 games over the past three seasons. Neal Brown, the head coach for all that winning, left Troy for West Virginia. McClain hired former USM offensive coordinator Chip Lindsay to succeed Brown. Support Mississippi Today Donate
McClain had a track record on hiring football coaches before that. He chaired the search committee that hired Todd Monken as head coach at Southern Miss. Monken took a program that was winless the year before he got there and won nine games three seasons later.
“I know what the challenges are at Southern Miss but I also know the winning tradition we have,” McClain said. “I can’t wait to get started.”
It should not be difficult to prioritize tasks. No. 1: Raise money. No. 2: Raise more money. No. 3: Raise more money still.
Yes, McClain said, he will rely on lessons he learned from Boo Ferriss and Mike Kinnison at Delta State.
“Coach Ferriss was the best I’ve ever seen at dealing with people,” McClain said. “He made everyone he encountered feel special. He just had that knack. He made you want to be a better person. I know I can’t be like him but we should all strive to be more like he was.”
And Kinnison?
“I learned work ethic and attention to detail from Mike,” McClain said. “Nobody outworks Mike Kinnison or one of his teams. No detail is too small.”
The task ahead will be difficult at cash-strapped Southern Miss. McClain has the background – and people skills learned from the best – to succeed. Listen to the Latest Episode of our Podcast About Rick Cleveland

Andy Taggart says family tragedy helped fuel his race for attorney general,mississippitoday.org,Bobby Harrison,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://mississippitoday.org/2019/04/05/andy-taggart-says-family-tragedy-helped-fuel-his-race-for-attorney-general/,"Andy Taggart says family tragedy helped fuel his race for attorney general By Subscribe to Election 2019 Andy Taggart campaign Andy Taggart will face state Treasurer Lynn Fitch and Rep. Mark Baker in the Republican primary of the attorney general’s race.
Hours before the deadline on March 1 to qualify to run for political office, Andy Taggart sat in his truck in the parking lot of the state Republican Party headquarters for about one hour discussing with his wife of 36 years, Karen, whether he should enter the campaign for attorney general.
Taggart, age 61, said he “was comfortable” in his life, practicing law out of his Ridgeland office, duck hunting, riding his motorcycle and traveling with his wife, especially to Houston to see their new granddaughter.
By the same token, since 2003 he had thought about running for the office of attorney general and now the tragic death of their son, Brad, who took his own life in 2012 during the midst of a battle with drugs, only fueled his desire to enter the campaign.
“The bottom line is we suffered a front line casualty in the drug wars in the loss of our son. For the last seven years now we have been trying to find effective ways to redeem that in a way that helps save other young people and equips other families for the battles they face,” said Taggart, a Madison resident. “And I have not been able to shake the conviction that service in the attorney general’s office is a key way to be able to do that.“
In recent years, the Taggarts have spoken to church groups, civic groups, drug court graduations and just about anyone who would listen about the dangers of drugs and about their son.
Now Taggart is running for the open seat of attorney general against Republicans state Treasurer Lynn Fitch and Rep. Mark Baker of Rankin County . On the Democratic side, Jennifer Riley-Collins , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union state chapter, is vying to replace incumbent Jim Hood.
Hood, the only statewide elected Democrat, is running for governor.
Sitting at a table in a common area of Banner Hall, a Jackson shopping/restaurant area, Taggart said he wants to make battling drugs, punishing the “predators” and providing help to the “victim,” a priority. He said Hood had focused on battling cyber crimes, which Taggart said he did not “begrudge him for,” just that he would have a different focus. Support Mississippi Today Donate
He added, though, that does not mean his office, if elected, would not pursue cyber crimes.
Taggart previously served as a supervisor in Madison County and ran unsuccessfully in 1988 for the old 4th U.S. Congressional District.
While never holding statewide, or even districtwide elected office, he has been a fixture of Republican politics for decades.
He served as Gov. Kirk Fordice’s chief of staff. And he ran Fordice’s 1995 statewide re-election campaign. Fordice, of course, was the first Republican governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction and the first governor of the state to serve consecutive terms. At one point, the state’s Constitution limited governors to one term.
In 1980, a young Taggart worked in the state on the campaign of Ronald Reagan.
And, of course, in recent times he has been co author and political commentator with his friend and political opposite – long-time Democratic campaign consultant Jere Nash – talking about both state and national politics.
Taggart enters the campaign as perhaps more vocal on the issue of changing the embattled state flag than any other Republican running this year for statewide office.
“I really think we need an attorney general who is as passionate about Mississippi’s future as an awful lot of people are about our past,” he said. “And one component of that which I think would help us in retaining young people in our state and recruiting their peers to come across state lines and stay here is to give our current state flag a dignified retirement.” Listen to the Latest Episode of our Podcast
The current flag contains the Confederate battle emblem as a significant portion of its design.
Taggart said he would not support ending the practice of using outside attorneys under certain circumstances to help the AG’s office in civil lawsuits, such as against large corporations. But he said the private attorneys who get those cases should be chosen by some type of bid process to prevent what he said is a perception of “pay to play.”
In addition, Taggart said he believes the attorney general should be a “practicing attorney” who can actually try cases representing the state in court. He said he has much more experience in that area than the other candidates vying for the post this year.
He cited representing Fordice during his tenure as governor in court as well as other instances, such as representing then-state auditor Phil Bryant. About Bobby Harrison

Advertisement WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to designate Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization, three U.S. officials told Reuters, marking the first time Washington has formally labeled another country’s military a terrorist group.
The decision, which critics warn could open U.S. military and intelligence officials to similar actions by unfriendly governments abroad, is expected to be announced by the U.S. State Department, perhaps as early as Monday, the officials said. It has been rumored for years.
The Pentagon declined comment and referred queries to the State Department. The State Department and White House also declined to comment.
The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a strident Iran hawk, has advocated for the change in U.S. policy as part of the Trump administration’s tough posture toward Tehran.
The announcement would come ahead of the first anniversary of President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran and to reimpose sanctions that had crippled Iran’s economy.

Quote: : A Pennsylvania judge was sentenced to 28 years in prison in connection to a bribery scandal that roiled the state's juvenile justice system. Former Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella Jr. was convicted of taking $1 million in bribes from developers of juvenile detention centers. The judge then presided over cases that would send juveniles to those same centers. The case came to be known as ""kids-for-cash.""
The AP adds:
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court tossed about 4,000 convictions issued by Ciavarella between 2003 and 2008, saying he violated the constitutional rights of the juveniles, including the right to legal counsel and the right to intelligently enter a plea.
Ciavarella, 61, was tried and convicted of racketeering charges earlier this year. His attorneys had asked for a ""reasonable"" sentence in court papers, saying, in effect, that he's already been punished enough.
""The media attention to this matter has exceeded coverage given to many and almost all capital murders, and despite protestation, he will forever be unjustly branded as the 'Kids for Cash' judge,"" their sentencing memo said.

Left-Wing Cities Going LAWLESS,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120421.html,"Post: #1 Left-Wing Cities Going LAWLESS
Advertisement Left-Wing Cities Going LAWLESS
Leftist policies are reaching new levels of insanity in Massachusetts, as Suffolk County DA Rachael Rollins pushes her highly contested “no-prosecute” list into action. The “list” gives a green light to a number of arrest-worthy offenses — including trespassing, shoplifting, disorderly conduct, and “wanton or malicious destruction of property.” In other words, local law enforcement is being directed by the district attorney to stand idly by while miscreants steal and destroy property. The directive from Rollins also orders police to refuse to cooperate with ICE in the arresting of illegal immigrants at the courthouse — no matter the severity of their crimes. What could go wrong?
It is no surprise this new “policy,” also known as the “Rollins Memo” has been met with substantial scrutiny. While Rollins may say her memo is about creating an “equal” justice system, the victims of these now-permissible crimes aren’t likely to feel they are being treated equally. But of course, that’s really the goal here, isn’t it? No one cares about the shopkeepers and homeowners that are victimized. Under far-left dogma, criminals are the true victims, we’re just too “hateful” to see it. This is doublethink at its finest.
Rollins pushes far-left memo: no arrests for shoplifting, trespassing and more
As Gateway Pundit contends, the Rollins Memo serves to hamper law enforcement and aid criminals. In addition to issuing the controversial “no-prosecute” list, the memo orders local law enforcement to refuse working with ICE on the arrest of illegal immigrants — and it also compels judges to issue lighter sentences for illegal aliens so they don’t get deported.
“This is a roadmap to a criminal justice system that works equally for everyone, based on research, data, and input from across the spectrum of stakeholders,” Rollins said of her memo in a recent press release.
Surely anyone who is a victim of shoplifting, larceny or property destruction would disagree that this “system” works for “everyone.”
A former police officer told the Boston Herald, ““If everybody knows they’re going to get a pass, decorum will go out the window. These are basic, quality-of-life issues. It’s the absolute antithesis of broken windows.”
The “broken windows” theory posits that toughening up on smaller crimes helps prevent more serious offenses, the Herald explains.
Rafael Mangual, a criminal justice expert at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, agrees that softening up on “small” offenses will lead to bigger problems.
“Criminals are going to respond to incentives. They’ll do more of something if they won’t get in trouble for it,” Mangual said.
“It’s a recipe for a public safety disaster. It strikes me as troubling and I think it should trouble the whole city,” he stated further.

March 2019 Bid Protest Roundup,govcon.mofo.com,Jennifer Reda,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://govcon.mofo.com/protests-litigation/march-2019-bid-protest-roundup/,"March 2019 Bid Protest Roundup By: Caitlin Crujido
This month’s bid protest round-up includes decisions from the Court of Federal Claims and the Government Accountability Office regarding the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) automatic stay, agency responsibility and discretion, and the importance of complying with solicitation requirements.
Technica LLC v. United States and Aviation Security Management LLC , No. 18-2003C, February 22, 2019.
Technica LLC involved the United States Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration’s (the “Agency”) decision to override the automatic stay of contract performance required by the Competition in Contracting Act (“CICA”). Technica LLC (“Technica”) alleged that the Agency’s override decision was arbitrary and capricious and asked the Court of Federal Claims (“COFC”) to enjoin the Agency and awardee from performing.
When the TSA authorized the override of the automatic stay of performance, the contracting officer cited “urgent and compelling circumstances” and supported its decision using the four‑part test established in Reilly’s Wholesale Produce v. United States . 73 Fed. Cl. 705, 711 (2006). The test provides relevant factors the Agency should consider when asserting urgent and compelling circumstances: (1) “whether significant and adverse consequences will necessarily occur if the stay is not overridden”; (2) “whether reasonable alternatives to the override exist”; (3) “how the potential cost of proceeding with the override, including the costs associated with the potential that the GAO might sustain the protest, compare[s] to the benefits associated with the approach being considered for addressing the agency’s needs”; and (4) the impact of the override on competition and the integrity of the procurement system, as reflected in CICA.
Nortel Gov’t Sols., Inc. v. United States , 84 Fed. Cl. 243, 247 (2008) (citing Reilly’s Wholesale , 73 Fed. Cl. at 711). Although the Agency is not required to apply the Reilly factors, the COFC has often used them to determine whether an override was arbitrary and capricious. Here, the Agency urged the COFC to simply make a finding rather than analyzing the factors, arguing that the factors were not dispositive. Instead, the COFC looked to the Agency’s substantive use of the Reilly factors and deemed it logical to evaluate its decision using the same analytical framework. The COFC’s evaluation revealed that none of the factors weighed in favor of the override.
To preserve the integrity of the competitive procurement process, Technica’s motion for preliminary injunction was granted and stayed contract performance.
Takeaway: The agency has a rather hefty burden to overcome in terms of circumventing a statutorily prescribed process geared toward maintaining a fair procurement. The decision to override a CICA stay is not one the Agency should take lightly, and while it is not required to use the Reilly factors, the COFC has historically applied the analytical framework to determine whether the majority weighs in favor of the override and will likely continue to do so.
OGSystems LLC , B-417026, January 22, 2019
We are often reminded of the vast discretion the agency retains in selecting an awardee. With that discretion, however, comes a responsibility to, at the very least, support the basis for its determination.
OGSystems, LLC (“OGS”) protested the award of a support services task order on several grounds. Of relevance to this article was the allegation that the agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee’s technical proposal. The GAO agreed.
Under a fair opportunity proposal request (“FOPR”), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (the “Agency”) issued a solicitation to firms holding one of its multiple-award indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts for support for day-to-day operations at an Agency campus. Proposals would be evaluated using two factors: technical and price. The technical evaluation was divided into three equally weighted subfactors: (1) east operations division support, (2) space and interiors division support, and (3) property division support. The Solicitation provided the technical factor was “significantly more important than price.”
Upon receipt and review of the first final proposal revisions (“FPR”) from two offerors, OGS and Higgins, Hermansen, Banikas, LLC (“HHB”), the Agency concluded the Performance Work Statement (“PWS”) needed revision. The Agency issued a revised PWS and requested a second FPR. The Agency assigned the following ratings for each element of the technical subfactors: significant benefit, major benefit, minor benefit, meets the standard, minor risk, major risk, or significant risk. OGS received a “major benefit” rating for all twelve elements of the evaluation subfactors, and HHB received two “major benefit” ratings, five “minor benefit” ratings, and five “meets the standard” ratings. In selecting HHB for award, the source selection authority (“SSA”) concluded that HHB’s proposal provided the best overall value to the Government, and the added value of the OGS’s experience was not worth the 20% price premium. OGS protested shortly thereafter.
In its review of the Agency Record, OGS discovered that HHB’s first FPR received concerning ratings, including six major risks, one minor risk, and one significant risk. OGS argued that the Agency failed to adequately address any of the risks assigned to HHB’s first FPR or how they were resolved. The Agency simply suggested that it considered the revisions made to the first FPR reflected in the second and employed the Agency’s broadened understanding of the terms “risk” and “benefit,” as used in the FOPR.
The contemporaneous record, however, does not address the rating revisions or the evolved understanding of the terms. The Agency attempted to explain the revisions by citing to a statement from the technical evaluation team (“TET”), where it suggested HHB’s revised proposal “met all PWS requirements and was in accord with the historical staffing levels” referenced in the PWS. The TET’s explanation of the broadened view of risk and benefit, which the Agency relied upon, was equally vague and suggested that it was fair because it applied the new view to both proposals.
The GAO found that the Agency’s general explanations failed to provide any meaningful detail, even at the protest stage. At no point did the Agency adequately address which risks or aspects of the risks identified in HHB’s initial proposal were resolved through revisions or the alternative understanding of the terms. In fact, the GAO repeatedly concluded that the agency’s evaluation of HBB’s FPR “did not explain the basis for concluding that this major weakness had been resolved.” As such, it was unable to find that the Agency’s determination was reasonable and thus justified selection of a less expensive, but also presumably less capable, awardee.
Takeaway: The Agency is required to at least support its findings, especially when an offeror’s ratings drastically change between revisions. The Agency wields a lot of power, but it may not sleep on its responsibilities.
People, Technology & Processes LLC , B-417208, March 21, 2019
There is a fine line between agency obligation and agency discretion. For some, that line may become blurred when the agency disagrees with what one might consider obviously obligatory.
In this protest, People, Technology & Processes, LLC (“PTP”) challenged its exclusion from the competitive range. The United States Special Operations Command (the “Agency”) issued a solicitation contemplating award of a single contract to provide intelligence services. The proposals would be evaluated on a best-value trade-off basis considering five evaluation factors: (1) qualifying criteria, (2) transition plan, (3) management plan, key personnel, and oral presentations, (4) past performance, and (5) price. Factor 1, qualifying criteria, would be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. The Agency would then conduct a trade-off analysis with the remaining factors.
The Agency informed offerors that it would establish a competitive range including those proposals that received the highest ratings after the initial evaluation. The source selection evaluation board (“SSEB”) conducted the initial evaluation and submitted a report to the source selection authority (“SSA”) summarizing each proposal and recommending a competitive range. The SSEB did not include PTP’s proposal in its competitive range, and the SSA accepted the SSEB’s recommendations.
PTP argued that the Agency abused its discretion by not seeking clarification on PTP’s proposal before excluding it from the competitive range. The key personnel subfactor required offerors to submit resumes for three key personnel positions. The SSEB would review the resumes against the required and desired qualifications in the statement of work, and then assess how similar the prior experience or position listed in the resume was to the contract requirements. In reviewing PTP’s submitted resumes, the SSEB could not determine the experience of the proposed program manager and deputy program manager. As a result, PTP received a significant weakness under the key personnel subfactor because the submitted resumes “inadequately demonstrated experience managing personnel on an effort of this magnitude.”
PTP challenged the Agency’s decision, suggesting its omission could have been corrected had the Agency sought clarification. The Agency argued that it was not required to seek clarifications and the significant weakness could not have been resolved through clarifications. The GAO has held previously that an agency may “but is not required to engage in clarifications that give offerors an “opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals . . . or to resolve minor or clerical errors.” FAR § 15.306(a)(2); Valkyrie Entr., LLC , B-414516, June 30, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 212 at 5. The only required communication pertains to offerors whose past performance is the determining factor in its exclusion from the competitive range, which did not apply to PTP. FAR § 15.306(b)(1)(i). As such, PTP was not entitled to or guaranteed an opportunity to clarify.
Takeaway: The agency is only required to engage in clarification communications when an offeror’s past performance is the determining factor in its exclusion from the competitive range. When this is not the case, the agency maintains its discretion to request clarifications.
Graham Technologies LLC , B-413104.25, February 25, 2019
We have written before about the importance of responding to solicitation requirements; however, it seems to be a recurring protest theme .
Here, the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Health (the “Agency”) issued a request for proposals (“RFP”) for information technology supplies and services. The solicitation provided that the Agency would evaluate the proposals in two phases. Phase 1 evaluated proposals under four go/no-go requirements: (1) compliant proposal, (2) verification of an adequate accounting system, (3) IT services for biomedical research, health sciences, and healthcare, and (4) domain-specific capability in a health-related mission. If the proposal was found unacceptable in any of these requirements, it would be ineligible for further consideration. Those proposals found acceptable would then move on to Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a best-value trade-off methodology in which the Agency considered price and three additional factors.
Graham Technologies, LLC (“Graham”) submitted a proposal, which the Agency rated Unacceptable in Phase 1 under the verification of an adequate accounting system subfactor, and thus eliminated it from further consideration. Graham protested the Agency’s decision, arguing that its proposal did, in fact, comply with the solicitation.
Graham cites to the following solicitation language in defense of its protest: As such , the Offeror must provide in its proposal a contact name and contact information . . . of its representative at its cognizant DCAA [Defense Contract Auditing Agency], DCMA [Defense Contract Management Agency], federal civilian audit agency, or third party accounting firm and submit, if available , a copy of the Pre-Award Survey of Prospective Contracting Accounting System (SF 1408), provisional billing rates, and/or forward pricing rate agreements.
Graham argues that this language meant the verification requirement would be satisfied by providing contact information for the offeror’s representative of the cognizant federal audit agency and no additional information was necessary. The Agency, however, argued that the solicitation required more than just contact information. The Agency cited to additional language in the solicitation requiring “evidence that the [o]fferor . . . ha[s] an adequate accounting system” and failure to provide verification will result in an unacceptable rating.
Additionally, and potentially most importantly, the Agency specifically addressed questions regarding the accounting verification requirement during the question and answer period. It reminded offerors that “[v]erification of an adequate accounting system is required to be submitted with the proposal.”
As such, the GAO concluded that when reading the solicitation as a whole, and taking into consideration the Agency’s prior warning, the Agency’s interpretation of the verification requirement was reasonable.
Takeaway: When the Agency specifically responds to questions regarding a solicitation requirement, it is in the contractor’s best interest to heed the Agency’s advice and ensure compliance with solicitation requirements. Share This"

Obviously that would require more than just castration, it would require sex reassignment surgery (if that is where that individual is at).

The U.S. will impose even more sanctions on Venezuela after recognizing the rival of socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro in January, Vice President Mike Pence announced Friday at Rice University in Houston.
The U.S. is targeting 34 vessels owned or operated by the nation’s state-run oil firm PDVSA and two companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba, Pence said.
“The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, but freedom has the momentum. … Nicolas Maduro must go,” Pence said. Advertisement - story continues below
President Donald Trump shunned Maduro and recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido in January , as did other countries, including Brazil and Canada.
“Thousands of Venezuelan children are starving at this very hour,” Pence said. TRENDING: TV Star Praises Trump, Slams Obama over Prison Reform Legislation
He also was heavy-handed in his criticism of Cuba.
“Cuba’s leaders are the real imperialists in the Western Hemisphere. The truth has to be told. … Cuba’s influence has driven Venezuela’s failure,” Pence said. Advertisement - story continues below
U.S. sanctions already in place to pressure Maduro include those on BANDES, the country’s national development bank exploited by Maduro’s “inner circle,” and on Minerven, its state-owned gold-mining company.

Pence said Friday the U.S. is considering additional sanctions on Venezuela’s financial sector.
Members of the military still loyal to Maduro have blocked shipments of aid into the country , and Maduro and his subordinates in March blamed the country’s widespread power outages on sabotage, cyberattacks and even Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
Pence and Trump met with Guaido’s wife, Fabiana Rosales, in the White House on March 27. “It’s a question of life and death. And we want life.”

“I said to her then we know that the Venezuelan people will never be intimidated and neither will we. She’s a remarkable young woman standing beside her courageous husband,” Pence said Friday. RELATED: Pence Slams Ilhan Omar, Calls for Her Removal from House Committee
