(photo credit: REUTERS)
The extent of antisemitism raging in the British Labour party was displayed once more on Sunday morning, when The Sunday Times published an article exposing shocking messages Labour members shared online without being sanctioned. The report titled ""Labour’s hate files expose Jeremy Corbyn’s anti‑semite army"" revealed how Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's office actively interfered, delayed and disrupted the inquiry into the hate-filled and conspiratorial posts by many Labour members. Some examples of such posts include ""Heil Hitler,"" Jewish MPs being accused of being ""Zionist infiltrators,"" and blaming Israeli Jews for the 9/11 attacks. Complaints about these posts have been filed a year ago, yet none of the authors of these posts have been suspended from the party. According to internal documents obtained by the paper, Cobyn's office interfered in 101 of such complaints. The confidential emails and database which was last updated March 8, brought to light the antisemitic messages and the handling, or lack thereof, of the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership. One Labour member was returned to the party ranks after his message blaming Jews for the 9/11 attacks was exposed. In another case, a council member candidate who said that Jewish MPs are ""Zionist infiltrators"" was marked as having met the criteria for suspension, but it was later decided that he would not be suspended because ""he is a candidate.""In total, 863 cases were opened, yet only 409 of them led to decisions. In 191 cases of these 409, the decision said that there was no need for further action, 145 cases ended in formal warnings and in only 30 cases a suspension was executed. The other 454 cases did not lead to any decision, with 249 of them not even warranting an investigation by the party. The Labour Party responded by saying the emails and documents were leaked selectively and were taken out of context. They also said that the party was committed to uproot antisemitism in the party.

Recently, all Wikipedia pages in German, Danish, Czech and Slovak were blacked out. This wasn’t a technical error. It was Wikipedia’s protest against the European Parliament for once doing something debatably useful: updating copyright laws to stop people from stealing digital intellectual content. [ Why Four Versions of Wikipedia Have Deliberately Gone Dark, By David Meyer, Fortune, March 21, 2019] It should be no surprise that the controllers of Wikipedia, and even more so its woke competitor Rational Wiki, should object to such outdated and likely racist concepts as law and private property: to a fatal extent, they are crazed Social Justice Warriors—and a growing threat to political and scientific discourse.
In the ongoing war between reasonable people and Leftism, there is a vital battle being waged on Wikipedia, which, like it or not, is a latter-day oracle of information. Control the fourth-most popular website in the Western world ( according to Wikipedia itself) and you, at least partly, control the Western mind. For this reason, online skirmishes over Wikipedia’s non-PC topics are particularly vicious, and the murky manipulators prepared to devote their time to the struggle take fanaticism, and even insanity, to levels that defy belief.
Of course, most of us like to think that we’re above relying on something as obviously untrustworthy as an anonymously-written encyclopedia dependent on non-expert contributors. But scientists really do read Wikipedia entries and reuse the citations in their peer-reviewed articles. [ Science is Shaped by Wikipedia: Evidence From a Randomized Control Trial , by Neil Thompson & Douglas Hanley, MIT Sloan Research Paper, 2017] Which means that the SJWs who control Wikipedia actually help to shape science itself.
It’s fiendishly difficult for thinking people to edit articles on areas like as “race” so that they conform to scientific standards, because Wikipedia’s gatekeepers have instituted a raft of tendentious rules in order to stop this happening. [ Wikipedia Is Shockingly Biased: 5 Lessons From An Admin, by Mark Hill, Cracked , July 11, 2016]
Wikipedia both reflects and drives a society that seems to be decreasingly interested in empirical truth . As Mark Hill noted in Cracked , Wikipedia also attracts a very specific kind of person. In order to get anywhere in the Wikipedia Wars, you have to be highly computer-literate. The editor must be prepared to spend inordinate amounts of time fighting with anonymous enemies, who will alter his changes, and with “vandals,” who will play around with entries they dislike to make them seem ridiculous.
These petty rivalries have sometimes gotten completely out of hand, with editors using their computer wizardry to work out who their opponents are and then “doxing” them; revealing their true identities and everything they can discover about them. [‘ Despicable lies’: Rep. Maxine Waters denies her staff doxed Republicans on Wikipedia, b y Alex Horton and Reis Thebault, Washington Post, September 30, 2018]
For some SJWs, controlling Wikipedia is simply not good enough, because Wikipedia does at least maintain something vaguely akin to academic standards—see Wikipedia’s own list of “Reliable Sources” . Accordingly, in 2007, they created a rival, the ironically-named Rational Wiki.
Rational Wiki is a nakedly Cultural Marxist project, its entries openly mocking their subjects, not even pretending to be neutral. According to RationalWiki: What is a RationalWiki article? , [accessed January 11, 2019] they have instead of an NPOV or “Neutral Point Of View” (as claimed, but not achieved, by Wikipedia itself), they have an SPOV, with the “S” standing for either Scientific or Snarky.
But because of search engine optimization tricks Rational Wiki entries appear very high on Google’s rankings. If a “controversial” scientist lacks a Wikipedia entry, then his Rational Wiki combination of lampoon and defamation will rank first when his name is Googled; potentially damaging his reputation. And the entry is also likely to be taken seriously by less skeptical readers.
So, who are these Nerdish Leftists who dedicate their spare time to anonymously fighting in our increasingly violent Culture War?
A particularly diligent and prolific one has been revealed to be a 28-year-old Englishman called Oliver D. Smith. [ Rationalwiki’s (Oliver D. Smith’s) attack page about me , by Emil Kirkegaard, Clear Language, Clear Mind, January 10, 2018]. Smith is a truly amazing character; you really couldn’t make him up.
According to British public records, “Oliver Dean Smith” lives with his father, Peter Smith, and Peter’s wife, Sandra, in the picturesque village of Radlett in Hertfordshire; specifically, in “ Primrose Cottages.” This “listed (historically important) building” is opposite an old “pub” called The Red Lion. [ Google Maps Link ] Hertfordshire is a wealthy county in the southeast of England and Smith’s father—whom birth and marriage records mysteriously imply has different forenames from those on the property records—is the director of a construction company .
Oliver D. Smith, who is unemployed, has a twin brother called “Darryl” and appears to sometimes write under his brother’s name. One of Smith’s internet enemies has actually been in direct contact with Smith’s mother (or possibly step-mother; the public records are confusing) about her son’s online behavior [ Oliver Smith, Autistic Legion of Doom , Encyclopedia Dramatica, accessed January 11, 2019]
In 2013, Smith graduated with a degree in “Classical Civilization” from London’s Roehampton University , a relatively mediocre school, ranked 70 th in the UK. Various nerds with whom Smith has clashed seem to have spent a great deal of time using their “weaponized autism” to work out, from his “sock puppets” (internet false identities), exactly who he is. [ The Smiths’ Dark Entanglement, a criminal report, WikipediaWeHaveAProblem.com, March 17, 2017] It is geeks and faceless internet obsessives, albeit on our side of the lines, who have exposed Smith, but they are open about the sources and reasoning that have led them to him.
Smith wields a particular grudge against a Danish computer type, 29-year-old Emil Kirkegaard. Kirkegaard runs the online academic journal Open Psych and has published in high-impact journals, such as Intelligence [ Are Headstart gains on the g factor? , by Jan te Nijenhuis, Birthe Jongeneel-Grimen & Emil Kirkegaard, Intelligence, 2014]. Smith’s fury with Kirkegaard extends to anyone who, like his Danish nemesis, attended the London Conference on Intelligence at University College London, on which I’ve reported before, meaning that Smith has created Rational Wiki articles about most of the academics involved. The Rational Wiki page London Conference on Intelligence [accessed January 11, 2019] starts “London Conference on Intelligence were a series of controversial pseudoscientific [3] conferences held annually at University College London (UCL) from 2014-2017, attended by far-right speakers, including white supremacists and most notoriously, Emil Kirkegaard …” and gets worse from there.
Kirkegaard’s own summary of the research into Smith’s background is most enlightening. Smith first appears online, at the age of about 15, with the posting on a forum whose administrators, for whatever reason, added the word “pedophile” to the user description on his name. The following year, Smith wrote of the Columbine killers that , “It’s not their fault at all i mean if you were bullied all day by non-whites of course you would join a right wing organisation online [ sic. ]”.
In various online forums, Smith has admitted to being a pathological liar who suffers from schizophrenia , though he has then used sock puppets to claim he made this up. Schizophrenia is strongly consistent with his Leftist bias, as schizophrenics tend to be very low in systematizing but so high in “empathy”—reading signals of people’s minds—that they become paranoid and delusional [ Mentalism and Mechanism , by Christopher Badcock, Human Nature and Social Values, 2003]
Early in his online career, Smith posted about his “autism” on the radical Right website Stormfront. Some symptoms of autism cross ,over with those of schizophrenia meaning that certain kinds of autistic are sometimes wrongly diagnosed with a mild form of schizophrenia, known as a schizotypal disorder. [ Autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and diagnostic confusion, by Marc Woodbury-Smith et al., Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, 2010] Smith also denied the Holocaust, advocated a bizarre form of white supremacy, claimed to be a “conservative Christian” and wrote for assorted right-wing online encyclopedias.
It seems, however that he became an SJW at the beginning of 2012. Numerous Wikipedia accounts of his have ended up being shut down leading him to move on to Rational Wiki. (See Encyclopediadramatica.se/Oliver_D._Smith_Brothers , July 13, 2012.) Autistics are prone to an unstable and weak sense of self and thus to dramatic identity changes. [ Poor recognition of ‘self’ found in high functioning people with autism , Medical Express, February 6, 2008].
Smith is interested in Atlantis, to the extent of having publishing academic articles on it. [ Oliver D. Smith , Independent Scholar, Google Scholar Page, accessed January 11, 2019]. Atlantis-fascination is an example of a “Sensational Interest.” Having sensational interests seems to be associated with aspects of “psychopathic” personality [ Sensational interests and general personality traits , by Vince Egan et al, Journal of Forensic Psychiatry, 1999] which correlates with proneness to schizophrenia [ Psychopathy and violent behavior among patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, by K. Nolan et al., Psychiatric Services, 1999] and autism. [ Comorbid Psychopathology in Autism Spectrum Disorder , by Arlene Mannion et al., Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 2014]
Smith has claimed to be, in a nuanced way, asexual (see Emil O. W. Kirkegaard’s lies and defamation about me, AtlantisOliver.wordpress.com November 25, 2018], though he has a passion for violent and sexual movies such as Cannibal Holocaust , and also for pornographic videos such as Naked Tomb Raider. [ Sites with evidence and claims , Anglo Pyramidologist – Cold Fusion Community, May 2, 2018]. Hyposexuality is common among schizophrenics, a side effect of the medications they take [ Sexual disorders in non/acute psychiatric outpatients , by G. Kockott et al. Comprehensive Psychiatry, 1996]
Clearly, Oliver D. Smith is, well, odd. He would seem to exemplify the phenomenon of “negative Social Epistasis,” whereby, in our world of weakened selection against the accumulation of deleterious mutations, mutants attain positions of social influence and are able to potentially corrupt the norms of civilization, causing others to behave in a maladaptive way in the process.
Online, these disturbed individuals can potentially involve very large numbers of people who, ordinarily, would never come into contact with them, in their delusions. When such “spiteful mutants” become numerous, the rapid collapse of complex societies ensues. I have written previously about the research of a group of scientists who have linked this with the work of John Calhoun, and the rapid collapse of his Mouse Utopia, through new experimental data.
And there’s reason to think that Smith may actually be an—albeit exaggerated to the point of satire—archetype of a “Wikipedean.” Research on Wikipedeans has found they are substantially motivated by “ideology,” specifically of an egalitarian kind [ What Motivates Wikipedeans? by Oded Nov, Communications of the ACM, 2007]. They are lower than are non-Wikipedeans in the personality traits of Openness (which fits, because Openness predicts being ‘arty’ rather than a Nerd) but also in Agreeableness (altruism) and Conscientiousness (impulse control) [ Personality characteristics of Wikipedia members , by Y. Amichai-Hamburger et al., Cyberpsychological Behavior, 2008].
When these psychopathic personality traits are put together with a childlike rejection of authority and of traditional purity rules based around sex [ Jonathan Haidt: The moral roots of liberals and conservatives, by Jonathan Haidt, TED , 2008], then you have the typical Wikipedia writer.
In other words, the store of human knowledge is now being—at least to some extent—censored, manipulated, and even directed by anonymous, mentally unstable malcontents, quite a few of them literally living in their moms’ basements. And many of them, are likely, only marginally less bizarre than Oliver D. Smith.
Such people can spend all of their spare time focused on their own little contribution to destroying Western civilization, facing no consequences whatsoever. In contrast, a patriot who makes a throwaway remark online can lose his job.
In this war, we need to know our enemies and Smith’s targets have done an excellent job in unearthing exactly who is directing a particular “Black Op” of the many that are underway. Hopefully more of this will follow.
And hopefully, as these counter-operations continue, people will increasingly realize that Wikipedia and similar Wiki-type projects must be treated with caution. These are not “Democratic Encyclopedia(s).” They are a democracy that has been overthrown by schizophrenics, psychopaths, deviants, and people who’ve never really grown up."
THE CULTURE OF AI: The Automated Life of the Future Is Considered,www.vdare.com,Brenda Walker,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/the-culture-of-ai-the-automated-life-of-the-future-is-considered,"April 06, 2019, 08:52 PM A+ | a-
Below is an excerpt from a new book, The Culture of AI, Everyday Life and the Digital Revolution . Unlike most books now available about the coming technological transformation , it is written by a sociologist rather than a Silicon Valley type. So it may address the cultural effects that arise from automation and smart machines taking a bigger place in the workplace and society generally.
The enormous changes about to descend upon the modern world should be considered more carefully by political leaders in Washington who now seem mostly asleep. America’s jobs economy is booming now, but tech experts think that a more widespread use of robots, automation and artificial intelligence is coming in a few years.
It’s likely that the US won’t need an extra million low-skilled Hondurans (which is current rate of inflow through America’s open border, more or less) in a decade or so when the smart machines become less expensive to hire than even the cheapest illegal alien.
Robotics and jobs: Where do we stand? , The Adelaide Review , By Anthony Elliott, March 25, 2019
With the AI-powered workplace of tomorrow arriving sooner than expected, what does this mean for us?
The debate about robotics on the future economy and job market is one divided squarely between transformationalists and sceptics, but that debate has in fact been increasingly undermined by the dynamics of AI and its relentless acceleration. Recent evidence indicates that robotics and AI are heavily impacting the economy, destroying low-wage jobs and increasingly eating away at higher-skill occupations as people are increasingly replaced by intelligent algorithms. There is evidence that the workplace of tomorrow, powered by AI and accelerating digital technology, is about to arrive much sooner than anticipated by many analysts.
A 2017 report from the World Economic Forum estimates the net loss of over 5 million jobs across 15 developed countries by 2020. Another report, published by the International Labor Organization, predicts that over 137 million workers in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia are likely to be replaced by robots in the near future. Moreover, as this tipping point in robotic job deployment is reached, advancing technology is driving many developed economies towards higher inequality. The global digital economy is generating more monopolies and resulting in greater income gaps between rich and poor, with many workers ending up unemployed and many highly skilled professionals increasing their wealth.
Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs has explored the stunning historical impact of machines in reducing the overall burden of work, and also their adverse distributional consequences on wealth. Drawing on US census data, Sachs notes that, whilst agricultural workers comprised 36% of the American labor force in 1900, they made up less than 1% of the labor market in 2015.
There has also been a sharp decline in the numbers of production workers (those working in mining, construction and manufacturing), from 24% in 1900 to 14% in 2015 of the US labor force. For Sachs, mechanization and machines lie at the core of the global shift from rural to urban life.
“Machines”, writes Sachs, “have dramatically eased the toil of most Americans and extended our lives, in stark contrast to the hard, long toil and lower life expectancies that continue for hundreds of millions of people around the world who are still trapped in subsistence agriculture”. Sachs argues that there is a clear disconnect between ongoing labor productivity growth and wages, which is leading to a decline in the share of labor in national income, and one principal reason for this is the displacement of workers by robots and smart machines. Workers most impacted by the astonishing growth in automation, according to Sachs, are those in jobs which are repetitive, predictable, and requiring only low to moderate levels of expertise.
But automation as a system should not be held to involve the progressive displacement of employment in toto. Sceptics have been quick to caution that robots cannot (at least as yet) reprogram or service their own operations. This point is often made by sceptics to underscore that technological innovation creates new, high-skilled jobs. The argument is that robotic automation, in fact, generates job creation for technicians, computer programmers and other newly generated digital workers. But the evidence for this claim looks increasingly brittle. Futurist Martin Ford convincingly shows that the US economy, for instance, has become progressively less effective at creating new jobs. This is largely because disruptive technological shifts are driving people out of the labor force. Most significantly, recent evidence demonstrates that every new robot entering the workplace leads to at least six job losses.
So, are massive layoffs and entrenched unemployment the way of the future as intelligent algorithms increasingly appear on the workplace frontier? Many argue so. But supercomputers, big data, automated technology and advanced robotics can already perform many different kinds of jobs. We must acknowledge that robots are already displacing and replacing jobs, however important the debate over digital upscaling and educational retraining might be.
The vision of a jobless future, and social futures more generally in which robots “unpeople” societies, is today far more commonplace than some years ago. One reason is that, in current economic circumstances, sophisticated machines are fast outpacing jobs and the large bulk of data indicates that AI will continue to substitute jobs with technological automation. Another is that public opinion largely sides with the notion of robots replacing people rather than augmenting skills and thus facilitating people to do things which they could not otherwise do. In other words, AI erodes rather than bolsters talent. A third reason, perhaps the most significant, is what I have called the illusion of new individualism.
In the era of AI and pervasive digital technologies, jobs have become increasingly changeable and multifaceted. The consequences for employees are that new jobs require different skills from those required in the recent past, and many average workers engaged in routine, predictable forms of employment do not have those skills. As a result, many economists, policy think-tanks and politicians have called for improving education (especially the development and deepening of digital literacy) and retraining opportunities.
In this new individualist scenario, workers of the future will be highly adaptable, endlessly pliable, effortlessly juggling both technological and social demands, and continually keeping up-to-date with new digital skills. A faith in self-fashioning, reinvention, reflexivity, the power of lifelong learning – all this, whilst undoubtedly in tune with the ecosystems of Industry 4.0 and global digital transformations, also denotes a distinctively Western culture of individualism and the ethos of advanced globalization. This is an activist account of human skills, in which the singular individual undertakes a kind of relentless self-fashioning new individualism in order to update their talent for jobs of the moment.
However, the truth, at least for millions of average workers around the globe, is that technology often results in a significant deskilling effect. The automation of many lower-skilled jobs has not necessarily produced more opportunities for advancing education levels or retraining, and recent evidence indicates that the idea of continuous retraining is optimistic at best."
"“Our Immigration System Is a Joke,” Says Tucker Carlson",www.vdare.com,Brenda Walker,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.vdare.com/posts/our-immigration-system-is-a-joke-says-tucker-carlson,"April 06, 2019, 08:05 PM A+ | a-
So much of TV commentary concerns news-of-the-day trivia that it’s nice occasionally to have reflections on the Big Picture. Tucker Carlson did just that during his opening monologue on Thursday about the ways that immigration anarchy is changing America’s future — and not for the better.
In particular, extreme population growth fueled by foreigners (what’s happening now) will change the culture, since the newbies come only for the dollars, not to become Americans.
Assimilation is generally expected by citizens of new residents , but the topic is little discussed by the current crop of Democrats vying for a White House slot. In fact some, like Julian Castro , embrace invasion via open borders even though traditional citizens once took pride in America as a “nation of laws.” Now, the left demands Diversity above all else, more than any other value.
The United States used to value educated immigrants who could help with the work that needed done. Instead, we are now helpless to stop a million uneducated Hondurans and other Central Americans from illegally entering the country this year. They will supply cheap, simple labor for a while to insatiable business owners, but that will end soon when the smart machines take their jobs, as described on this blog for years and observed by Tucker in his remarks.
Experts agree: fundamental technological change is coming to all sorts of workplaces , and official Washington would be wise to pay attention.
You could slide over to 3:05 minutes in the video below to avoid a couple nonsense clips from AOC delivered from the floor for some odd reason:
TUCKER CARLSON (3:05): Negativity. That’s what the activist left now calls disagreement. They are not interested at all in what anyone outside their tiny little world has to say. Every day, you see Democratic presidential candidates endorsing some new policy that has pretty much zero public support, but it sounds like something woke baristas in Brooklyn would be excited about.
Banning ICE, ignoring federal immigration law, giving amnesty to millions. Decriminalizing illegal border crossings which is to say totally open borders. Anyone can come. When they get here, give them free stuff. Nobody really wants any of this even most of the people saying know, it wouldn’t work.
The public would revolt if you tried it. If half of Guatemala moved here tomorrow, which is exactly what would happen, it wouldn’t help anyone. This is all fantasy.
Countries have borders. That’s what makes them countries. Someday, the AOC moment will pass. It’s too stupid to continue. And at that point, sober Democrats will wake up and rejoin the adult conversation and progress. What do we want from our immigration system?
Well, here are some of the questions they should have to answer when that happens. First and most obvious, how many immigrants should we admit every year? What’s the ideal number? We currently take a little over a million every year, legally. Should we double that to over two million? How about 10 million immigrants a year? How about 20 million? Is there any number that’s too high? And if so, why?
While we are at it, what’s the ideal population of the United States? Immigration effects population size more than any other factor. We’re at about 325 million people in the United States today and that’s a lot.
Our highways are crumbling, many of our cities are painfully overcrowded. How big should we get? Four hundred million? Six hundred million? A billion people? And if you are pushing to increase the size of our population and they are, what’s your plan for keeping our natural environment pristine?
Crowded countries are polluted. Every single one of them. Tell us why we should want that here? What sort of skills and education should we look for in immigrants? Not all immigrants are the same? Some start wildly successful companies. Many others go on food stamps. They are not interchangeable widgets, they are human beings. Who should we prefer? What’s the ideal level of education an immigrant to this country should have?
Big business doesn’t want you to ask this question, they like their immigrants low-skilled and cheap. Ocasio-Cortez does, too. But what happens when technology kills their jobs? And it will. All the major Democrats running for president take money from the technology barons, many of them support self-driving cars. So what do you do with hundreds of thousands of unemployment immigrant cab drivers? Do they all go on welfare?
And speaking of, what sort of government services are immigrants entitled to exactly? Democrats promise universal healthcare. Do immigrants get that, too? Who pays for it? How many immigrants can our system support? Do we have enough doctors and nurses and hospitals to treat the number of immigrants we want to admit? Same question for schools.
The real answer is, of course, nobody knows. Because as of today, we have no idea how many immigrants live illegally in the United States. Shouldn’t we find out before we make more plans? And once we do find out, what do we do with them? Who gets deported? Anyone? Or do all of them get to stay? What if the real number of people living here illegally is north of 25 million? And that’s entirely possible. That’s bigger than the population of 48 out of 50 states. It’s enough to change this country completely and forever.
Do all of them get citizenship and voting rights? What about gun rights? And do they immediately start paying into the Reparations for Slavery Fund that Democrats are now promoting? How do you explain that to them? Can we watch that conversation?
And finally what about America’s ideals? Democrats are always talking about values when the subject of immigration comes up. They quote from the poem on the Statue of Liberty and tell you about their grandparents.
Well, previous waves of immigrants were asked to buy into this country’s most basic ideals — religious pluralism, free speech, political freedom, equality under the law. Our schools made them learn English and tried to instill patriotism. We called it assimilation. We thought it was critical to our social cohesion. Are we still for that? Do we still think we have values to impart or do we imagine that huge groups of people with nothing in common can share the same country without fighting each other?
It’s an important question — maybe the most important question of all. We never hear anyone ask it. Anyone who dares ask it is banned from Twitter. Instead, you hear the endless drone of self-righteous children barking about racism. That’s not enough. The decisions we make today about immigration are irreversible. It will help determine the health of the country we leave to our grandchildren. We should be a lot more serious than we are."
