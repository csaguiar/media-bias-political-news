Con Edison warns of NYC gas moratorium if controversial pipeline is rejected,www.politico.com,mfrench@politico.com (Marie J.

ALBANY — Con Edison says that it may have to limit new natural gas service in New York City if a controversial pipeline is not built, potentially expanding a moratorium in Westchester that is drawing harsh criticism.
The Williams Northeast Supply Enhancement project is intended primarily to supply National Grid and faces strong opposition from environmentalists and many city and state lawmakers . Opponents warn the 24-mile natural gas pipeline could damage the sensitive Raritan Bay and New York Bay, and argue the state needs to rapidly move away from fossil fuel infrastructure.
Con Ed, in a letter to elected officials in its service territory who oppose the pipeline, said if it’s not built it could affect new, uninterruptible service in the city. National Grid has also warned that it may have to impose a moratorium on new customers in parts of New York City and Long Island if the project is not approved, raising concerns from business groups and local officials worried about future economic growth.
""National Grid has been clear about their potential inability to serve new gas customers absent new interstate pipeline infrastructure, and Con Edison shares those concerns,"" wrote Con Ed executive Kyle Kimball, in the letter.
If the pipeline or other new infrastructure is not built, Kimball warns, “We would have to move quickly to declare a moratorium on new gas connections in our New York City service area.”
Con Ed has already imposed a moratorium on new gas customers in parts of Westchester County, sparking backlash from local officials. The utility also serves 868,000 gas customers in the Bronx, northern Queens and Manhattan. The letter states the utility has no role in the Williams pipeline but shares transmission infrastructure to bring natural gas into New York City.
Con Ed has previously indicated it forecasts growing demand for natural gas in the city in the coming years and, absent new supplies, moratoriums are possible. The letter makes an explicit connection between the proposed pipeline, which environmentalists are pressuring Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration to reject next month, and possible moratoriums.
There’s no forecasted date for any moratorium, said Con Edison spokesperson Michael Clendenin. But if the Williams pipeline is not built, it will happen sooner than if the pipeline is constructed.
The two companies will be competing for a limited supply of natural gas as demand grows, he said, presenting significant challenges.
The letter is circulating to elected officials ahead of a Monday hearing held by the City Council’s Committee of Environmental Protection on the environmental impacts of the proposed pipeline, which will include a vote on a resolution calling on state officials to reject its Water Quality Certification permit to begin construction."
Trump’s health care blundering soothes Democratic infighting,www.politico.com,ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/trumps-health-care-democrats-1348891,"House Democrats disagree sharply over where to take the nation’s health care system, but the infighting has eased — and for that they can thank President Donald Trump.
The Trump administration’s renewed assault on Obamacare has quelled for the moment the simmering tensions over ""Medicare for All"" between Democrats’ vocal progressive wing and more moderate members and leaders.
Even the most ardent single-payer advocate knows it’s not happening overnight — and that in the meantime, they need to rally around Obamacare, both because they want to prevent millions of people from losing their insurance and because the Affordable Care Act and its protection for people with pre-existing conditions has become one of Democrats’ most potent political messages.
“I haven’t seen a single Democrat who isn’t committed to supporting the ACA,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a prominent and devoted supporter of Medicare for All. “And there's nothing inconsistent with saying that we’re going to defend the Affordable Care Act to the hilt but we’re also going to fight for Medicare for All.”
Yet Democratic differences over how far and how fast to expand health coverage persist below the surface, and Republicans are eager to exploit them. The Republican-led Senate is considering a vote on Medicare for All purely to divide and embarrass Democrats — as they recently tried to do on the Green New Deal. And from the White House on down, the GOP is looking for every opportunity to paint Democrats as reckless socialists in the lead-up to the 2020 election.
But the ACA, which was incredibly divisive when the Democrats last held the House nearly a decade ago, is now the glue party leaders are hoping will hold the caucus together well into 2020.
“We’ve got to save what we’ve got,” said freshman Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), former President Bill Clinton’s health secretary and a close ally to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “The message [from leadership] is: We need to band together now. We’re open to other discussions, but step one is to defend the Affordable Care Act.""
The renewed legal battle, coupled with Trump’s recent pledges to repeal and replace the law after the 2020 elections, has been a gift to Democrats, who spent much of the year’s first three months hampered by infighting and straining to making concrete headway on the party’s top health care priorities.
House Democrats flipped 40 seats in November on vows to protect pre-existing conditions and lower prescription drug costs, a message that resonated in red and blue districts alike. But it’s proven difficult to follow through on those policies.
Now, about 100 days into power, the party has little to show for its efforts beyond passing a few toothless resolutions condemning Trump’s health agenda and a slate of bills that even Democratic lawmakers concede are “low-hanging fruit.”
“Who anticipated a 35-day shutdown? It’s actually been a fairly long recovery,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), echoing caucus-wide frustrations that the monthlong impasse over border funding set back Democrats’ agenda. “I think after this break, you’re going to see more action.”
Democrats have yet to agree on how to pay for the hundreds of millions of dollars their legislation would pour into shoring up the ACA and expanding subsidies for health coverage. And on drug pricing, Democrats remain split over how aggressively to tackle the issue, and how much to collaborate with Trump, who has outlined some steps of his own that break with Republican orthodoxy.
Many progressive Democrats want to force drug companies to negotiate their prices with Medicare or risk harsh penalties. Other policies are also in the mix, and Democratic leaders have sought discussions with the White House, touching off a fresh round of grumbling among the chamber’s liberals .
“We certainly have not yet delivered on our promise with reference to pharmaceuticals,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who authored an ambitious Medicare negotiation plan that’s won endorsement from the chamber’s progressives. “I hope that we can.”
But Trump’s surprise legal attack on Obamacare has shifted the spotlight off Democrats’ struggles and back onto the GOP’s yearslong attempts to gut the law, easing pressure on top Democrats who have spent much of the year trying to keep the fractious caucus together.
The Trump Justice Department had originally backed only a portion of the Texas-led lawsuit to gut the law; it recently threw full support behind a judge’s ruling that the entire statute is unconstitutional and should be scrapped. That decision is now on appeal and could reach the Supreme Court smack in the middle of the 2020 campaign. Yet Republicans have so far shrugged off the need to develop a contingency plan if Obamacare falls.
“In the years I’ve been here, Republicans have never agreed on a health care plan. Not once,” said Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who has faced intense pressure from activists over his reluctance to hold a hearing on Medicare for All. “If he wants to have this battle over health care, I’m in.”
Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), who chairs the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee and had heard similar criticism from the left over her ties to major drug industry donors and her biotech-heavy home district, appeared visibly relieved at the chance to turn public attention back on Republicans.
“Nice to start the day with a smile,” she said when asked about health care .
House Democratic leaders are hoping to regain their footing on health care after the April recess, when the chamber will tee up votes on its first set of drug pricing bills. And a package expanding Obamacare’s benefits and reversing major Trump health priorities could hit the floor by early summer, giving vulnerable members real legislative accomplishments to talk up on the campaign trail.
Centrist Democrats, frustrated by the publicity given to the party’s liberal wing, are counting on those actions to refocus attention toward a pragmatic agenda that plays the strengths of the swing-district moderates who flipped dozens of seats in 2018 on vows to protect Obamacare.
“You gotta love activists: They’re so passionate, they feel so strongly about it and it’s great,” said Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.). “But those of us who are in elected positions also have to deal in the world of reality and just what is feasible at the moment.”
Yet more disagreements on policy and strategy are certain to rear up in the months to come.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) angered some Democrats just this week with a high-profile rollout of his revised single-payer bill, right in the middle of efforts in the House and Senate to focus attention on drug pricing and the Trump administration's Obamacare attacks.
“We were winning,” one senior Democratic aide complained to POLITICO the day of Sanders’ announcement. “This is just like when we were trying to save DACA [immigration protections for Dreamers] and some Democrats started calling for abolishing ICE.”
The progressive wing in the House is also determined to keep pushing the party left, rallying support for Medicare for All and encouraging activists to pressure committee leaders to hold hearings — much to the frustration of establishment Democrats.
But just about every Democrat, from the die-hard devotees of Medicare for All to centrists from swing districts wary of single-payer, has voiced support for Pelosi’s efforts to defend Obamacare in federal court, shore up its markets, and roll back the Trump administration’s executive orders aimed at weakening the law — even if they disagree about where to go from there.
“Nancy’s great at this, keeping us together,” said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.), an advocate for Medicare for All. “ On health care, you can have it both ways, but it’s a question of when. And the first thing is to do no harm.”"

Happy Friday afternoon. It’s been a whirlwind week to say the least, but now things in the Capitol are expected to slow down as the Senate and House go on recess for the next two weeks. All signs point to the Mueller report not coming out this week, but then again, who knows. So, we wait.

“But there’s no trace of the money raised that night, as required by law, The Palm Beach Post has found. … One man in charge of raising money for the event told The Post that the host, the National Committee of Asian American Republicans, collected between $5,000 and $15,000 each from up to 20 listed sponsors. It also took in hundreds of smaller contributions.

“But there is a difference in the changeover now under way. The department doesn’t have a presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed defense secretary or deputy secretary of defense … and has at least a half dozen high-level civilians also serving in an acting capacity, including the comptroller, the deputy comptroller, the undersecretary, and the deputy for personnel and readiness.

THE LATEST ON THE IMMIGRATION FRONT -- SF CHRONICLE’S TAL KOPAN: “Trump’s new attorney general launches fresh changes to immigration courts”: “Last week, the Justice Department revived a proposed regulation originally initiated during the George W. Bush administration to allow the 21-judge appeals court system that hears immigration cases more latitude to issue cursory opinions without explanation.
“It would also allow the court to set precedents with only a small minority of appeals judges participating, which could sharply accelerate the administration’s ability to make changes to immigration law that wouldn’t require congressional action. The proposed regulation has been sent to the White House for review before being made final … The Justice Department declined to comment other than to confirm that it hopes to finalize the rule this year.” SF Chronicle

“Discussions this week, at the White House meeting and afterward, have included the suggestion that troops may be needed to run the tent city detention camps once immigrants are being housed there.” NBC

He’s looked to renegotiate Chinese oil-backed loans and signed a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund to shore up a troubled economy.
“The new president described Mr. Assange as a ‘stone in our shoe’ that was hurting Ecuador’s relations with other countries. … Vice President Mike Pence visited Mr. Moreno in Quito [in 2018] to discuss trade and a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Ecuadorean officials continued to hold regular meetings with their U.S. counterparts in recent days. … Ecuadorean business leaders hope removing Mr. Assange from the embassy will speed up talks for a trade agreement with Washington.” WSJ

“But come Election Day, Democrats flipped three House seats and 16 more in the state General Assembly. [Gov. Tom] Wolf easily won reelection, as did Democratic Sen.

Trump rejects government intervention in 5G wireless networks,www.politico.com,MARGARET HARDING MCGILL,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/trump-government-intervention-5g-wireless-networks-1352763,"President Donald Trump finally took sides Friday in a fight among his advisers about the best way to advance super-fast 5G wireless networks in the U.S., backing administration officials who want to keep the federal government from grabbing a bigger role from industry.
“In the United States, our approach is private sector-driven and private sector-led. The government doesn’t have to spend lots of money,” Trump said at the White House alongside Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai.
""As you probably heard, we had another alternative of doing it that would be through government investment and leading through the government,"" he said. ""We don’t want to do that because it won't be nearly as good, nearly as fast.""
The comments offered a sign that Trump is siding, at least for now, with officials like Pai and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who want to allow telecommunications giants like AT&T and Verizon to take the lead in developing and out rolling the technology. They have been feuding with Trump-world figures like Newt Gingrich and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale, who favor a more government-heavy model that critics liken to ""nationalization.""
The Gingrich-Parscale faction has promoted a concept that would see the government share 5G airwaves, via a third-party operator, with wireless companies on a wholesale basis. Major proponents of that approach include Rivada Networks, a politically connected firm backed by Trump ally and venture capitalist Peter Thiel that counts GOP operative Karl Rove as an investor and adviser.
Such talk has spooked the wireless industry, administration officials and a number of lawmakers from both parties, who want to stick with the traditional, industry-led approach.
Looming over the debate are fears that China, which has mounted an aggressive effort to develop 5G, will beat the United States in the race to develop the next-generation networks, which promise a super-fast internet expected to fuel innovations ranging from self-driving cars to precision agriculture to remote surgery.
As the Trump-world feud has heated up — Gingrich called it a ""knock-down, drag out fight"" this week — key figures have been making their case directly to Trump. Those include Pai, the FCC chairman, and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who held separate meetings with Trump at the White House last week. Gingrich, the former House speaker and informal Trump adviser, said he also discussed the issue with the president.
Ahead of Friday's event at the White House, Pai announced Dec. 10 as the date for his agency's next 5G airwaves auction and touted a $20.4 billion fund to support rural broadband over the next decade. The announcements, however, appeared to track with previous FCC plans. The 5G auction had already been scheduled for the second half of 2019, and the newly named ""Rural Digital Opportunity Fund"" is part of an established program for underserved areas.
""The market, not government, is best positioned to drive innovation and investment in the wireless field,"" Pai told reporters on a call Friday morning. ""I think the wholesale network would be the wrong answer for American consumers.""
Parscale has been a vocal advocate for the wholesale network, with the Trump campaign publicly embracing the idea as a way to woo rural voters who have long lacked decent internet service because wireless companies don't have a financial incentive to offer high-speed coverage outside the biggest cities. (The campaign later downplayed its split with the White House and said the administration sets policy.)
In recent days, both Parscale and Gingrich have attacked AT&T over its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, with Gingrich saying the company could have better spent the money on building out its network. AT&T has a fraught history with Trump; the administration waged an unsuccessful court battle to block the company's Time Warner deal, and Trump frequently attacks CNN, a Time Warner unit that is now part of AT&T.
""The old order has failed rural America, which is the base of the Trump coalition, and has no plan to help rural America before the next election, which makes perfect sense if you’re the owner of CNN,” Gingrich said in an interview Thursday.
Inside the administration, Kudlow, the head of Trump's National Economic Council, has been a cheerleader for the traditional, private sector-led model for wireless development, saying last week that ""what we’re doing is the right way.""
“I believe that the principles that we’ve worked to rebuild the economy will be applied to the telecom sector and to the whole issue of 5G, and 6G and however many G’s we’re going to go through in my lifetime,"" Kudlow said. ""They’re free-market principles.”"

Trump immigration shakeup lowers DHS morale,www.politico.com,TED HESSON,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/trump-immigration-shakeup-lowers-dhs-morale-1345681,"Morale at the Department has long ranked lowest among federal agencies. President Donald Trump’s purge of top homeland security officials is making it worse.
Workers, from entry-level staffers to managers, have begun sending around their resumes, desperate to exit a leaderless workplace where they expect soon be ordered to implement legally questionable policies pushed by the White House. Some are even willing to take pay cuts.
Until this week, loyalty to departing Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen got you ahead at DHS. Now it puts you on the firing line, with those who worked most closely with Nielsen most likely to get the boot. Claire Grady, Nielsen's acting deputy, resigned Wednesday. Miles Taylor, Nielsen's chief of staff, may get pushed out, too, according to two former DHS officials who worked under Trump.
“They’re taking the fall for the president’s frustrations,” one current department official told POLITICO. “It’s not what you read about good leadership.”
The turmoil could pitch a Cabinet department already struggling with a staffing shortage at the border further into crisis, even as a rising tide of Central American migrants overwhelms the Trump administration's ability to respond.
At least six department employees, from entry-level staffers to managers, are inquiring about outside opportunities, according to one former DHS official who worked in the Trump administration. “For them to be looking to leave, and maybe take a pay cut and almost start over, that’s surprising,” this person said.
A second former official said he also has spoken with multiple DHS employees who are now eyeing the exit. “I’ve been getting calls like, ‘Hey, I want to talk to you about what I can do next,“ the person said.
“I think it’s the full turnover of senior staff,” said a current DHS official. “We put in countless hours, everyone here, and then just having the quick turnover. … It doesn’t help morale when we’re in the trenches trying to solve this immigration problem.”
The DHS shakeup comes on the heels of a 35-day partial government shutdown in December and January that required most department personnel to remain on the job even though they weren't getting paid. The paycheck delays were particularly painful at DHS's Transportation Security Administration, where some workers were already struggling to pay bills. TSA workers responded by calling in sick en masse and considering a possible strike, an illegal move that could have prompted mass firings.
“People vote with their feet,” said David Lapan, a former DHS spokesperson under Trump who left in October 2017. “If they’re unhappy, they’ll go elsewhere.”
Roughly 150 Homeland Security Department staffers gathered Wednesday in what one official described as “grim fascination” to welcome the first wave of staffers to move to the department’s new headquarters in southeast Washington, D.C. — and, it turned out, to bid Nielsen farewell.
It was, said the aforementioned DHS official, ""a little surreal."" The Gothic Revival campus was built in the mid-19th century to house the Government Hospital for the Insane, later renamed St. Elizabeths. In the current environment, the irony of the move has not escaped notice.
“I think it’s fitting given the state of things right now,” said one of the former DHS officials. ""I’m going through the stages of grief.”
Nielsen ticked through her accomplishments at DHS, then cut a ribbon with acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady — another casualty of Trump’s shakeup. More departures are expected in the coming week.
“Once you get two layers deep below the secretary, deputy, under secretary level, most of these folks have their heads down,” the official said. “They’ve got actual jobs that they’re doing.”
The division that's arguably most rattled by the DHS purge is U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. USCIS's director, Francis Cissna, is praised by immigration restrictionists for taking a hard line. But his legally meticulous approach has put him crosswise with White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, and people familiar with the situation have said he'll be pushed out, too.
The White House, POLITICO reported earlier this week, is considering for Cissna’s replacement the former executive director of an immigration restrictionist group that the left-leaning Southern Poverty Law Center has identified as a “hate group.” That possibility would stun parts of the USCIS workforce, which prides itself on facilitating the legal immigration process. The job candidate is current USCIS Ombudsman Julie Kirchner, who previously worked for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to reduce legal immigration by more than two-thirds.
“There is definitely potential that [USCIS employees] will question the integrity of the leadership they’re getting,” said one former senior Obama administration official.
Workers in USCIS's already-marginalized asylum division (by which is meant government employees who work with refugees, not government employees relocated to St. Elizabeths) wondered this week whether the top-level changes would imperil their mission further, according to Michael Knowles, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924.
Trump routinely refers to asylum laws as “loopholes,” and he's portrayed migrants arriving at the border indiscriminately as criminals or “illegals,” a viewpoint that makes some USCIS employees fearful of the White House’s intentions, according to Knowles.
“When we see our whole department shaken up up over this issue, it’s kind of hard not to conclude that we’re viewed as a problem,” he said. “It’s made out that we’re admitting hordes of people and not knowing what we’re doing.”"
Fed mandate to use opioid data-sharing technology angers states,www.politico.com,DARIUS TAHIR,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/opioid-data-sharing-angers-states-1320532,"The Trump administration is forcing states that want millions in federal grants to use relatively untested technology to share prescription data that is key to combating the opioid crisis.
Using the software, many state officials worry, could mean turning over patient data to law enforcement and invading patients’ privacy. And it would override an already proven system used by doctors in 46 states plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
The dispute is over prescription drug monitoring programs, which track all the drugs dispensed in a given state. While handy for doctors seeing whether patients might be receiving too many opioids, or for law enforcement looking for pill mills, it’s inherently limited: An affected patient might easily receive prescriptions from multiple states. Hence the need to share data across state lines. If states use competing systems that don’t communicate, the data-sharing work falls apart.
The dispute is particularly acute given the overdose crisis that’s claiming tens of thousands of lives each year in the U.S. Getting the data-sharing right could help doctors detect patients’ problems sooner and solve them faster.
But opioid prescribing data is already being shared across most of the U.S. That adds to states’ puzzlement that the CDC and Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance are requiring grant applicants to provide patient information through a competing data hub called RxCheck, funded by the Bureau.
RxCheck helps pass requests from doctors and pharmacists for prescription history across state lines. The government says RxCheck, which is managed by member states’ prescription drug monitoring boards, will introduce competition in the market.
Officials in 14 states said in a series of letters last fall that the RxCheck hub is being foisted upon them to solve a problem they don’t have. The hub, with its relatively untested technical capacity, could lead to privacy invasions and incapacitate the established data-sharing system most use now, some worry.
“When you have a good thing going, to go and jump into a system that isn’t widely used — it’s kind of like, nonsense,” said Joe Fontenot, assistant executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy.
The Bureau’s grants, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to each winning state, were awarded in September. In order to use the money, states had to connect to RxCheck. But the bigger prize is the upcoming CDC grants, worth as much as $9.1 million per state, which also come with the requirement that states use RxCheck. States need to decide on the CDC grants by a May 4 deadline.
A competing technology, backed by a firm called Appriss, has dominated the prescription drug monitoring program market since its entry in 2014. Since 2011, Appriss has also led interstate data-sharing through a system called PMP InterConnect, developed with the nonprofit National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. The federal government thinks that Appriss’ twin dominance puts RxCheck at an unfair disadvantage.
The federal government has been trying to encourage the use of RxCheck since at least May 2012, but only with this latest round of grants has it required the use of the technology.
For affected states, the preference for PMP InterConnect reflects its superiority — and a reason not to dabble with RxCheck.
“We may move from a system that works extremely well to one that has a lot of unknowns and is of uncertain capability,” said David Brown, director of Virginia’s Department of Health Professions.
Brown’s concerns about RxCheck and the grant requirements are shared by many other states. They say the language in the Bureau’s grant requirements opens the door for access by law enforcement contrary to state law. The grant requires software, data, “or other intangible property … designed, developed, acquired, or produced under this award” to be provided upon request.
That leaves open the possibility that state prescription data “owned” by the participating states will be subject to sharing without a review process, New Jersey’s attorney general wrote in an Oct. 31 letter.
Michigan won’t accept the grant money if it requires the state to “violate its own laws,” said Pardeep Toor, spokesperson for the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. North Dakota may follow suit, although Sen. John Hoeven's office said he is working to address the state’s concerns.
The CDC grants pose slightly different concerns, mandating that states have archiving plans for their data. That requirement, some states say, would clash with their privacy laws, which require them to scrub old data.
The CDC's money is perceived as a powerful form of leverage, because it doesn’t specifically flow to drug monitoring programs but rather to state departments of health. A monitoring program director’s concerns might not override a state’s broader interest in the money.
“They’re basically strong-arming the states to say if you want this money for the state, the whole state overall, not just the PDMP, you need to accept this condition,” said Mark Hardy, executive director of the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy.
Only four states use RxCheck, a state of affairs the agencies blame on Appriss, which blocks access through “influence over both the cost and timing of connections that are made at the state level,” said Tara Kunkel, an adviser to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance.
Kunkel said the federal government had received complaints from 11 states who say the vendor has abused its market position. The states said they’d been unable to access their data without paying extra fees and faced prohibitively high costs to connect providers serving poor or rural areas to PDMPs through their electronic health records, she said.
But not all states agree with the complaint. Cost “has not been a barrier at all,” said North Dakota’s Hardy.
States aren’t sure they can afford to maintain RxCheck and InterConnect at the same time. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy’s director, Carmen Catizone, says his organization may have to close InterConnect if the government continues to push RxCheck.
Justice and the CDC have attempted to calm such concerns with letters, webinars and FAQs. They say they don’t intend to circumvent relevant laws and that the provisions are methods of combating competitive abuses.
But states also worry that the RxCheck hub may be incapable of handling the demands of data-sharing. Some 20 million transactions per month pass through PMP Gateway, the EHR integration tool, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy says. RxCheck’s EHR integration only moved out of the pilot phase last fall.
Kunkel also claimed Appriss is using its competitive position to block RxCheck and to choke off provider and government use of prescription data for things like analyses to detect over-prescribing “hot spots.”
Rob Cohen, president of Appriss’ health division, denied the government’s complaints. He said Appriss provides several tools to analyze state data, and only has minimal charges in rare circumstances.
The federal government said RxCheck enables doctors to cheaply access PDMP information directly through their computer systems. In Kentucky, state officials can provide RxCheck to doctors who want a low-cost option, according to Dave Hopkins, a program manager at Kentucky’s PDMP. The Gateway alternative has more features but costs more, he said.
But only a tiny number of doctors have connected their EHRs to PDMPs through RxCheck, Cohen said, while Appriss has connected hundreds of thousands in the state.
RxCheck, he claimed, lacks important features such as robust audit trails that allow administrators to see what user accessed data. While RxCheck may not charge for the integrations, he said, maintenance functions like call centers will get “pushed out to the states, or the vendors to the states, or the EHRs."""

An increase in payroll taxes for all employees and more than 2x that increase for employers. As if forcing a $15 minimum wage isn't going to impact employment numbers he wants to do this too. Doctors as employees? That means they can unionize and strike. That would be wonderful right? And citizens being forced to pay for illegals? I think the man is certifiable. This is a non-starter.

Private, for-profit insurance companies would be (should be) relegated to only offering Medicare supplement coverage plans. A lot of office folk and their abilities to deny coverage will be left to seek new employment. Also, too often the ""where does the money come from"" crowd ignores that every American already pays a percentage of their pay for Medicare. We pay from our earliest job, through our career and are paying into the system so that when we reach 65, we're vested. Currently, at age 65, the monthly premium taken from Social Security is $135. per month! No a bad deal, huh? I think the proper approach would be to open up Medicare to everyone starting at age 60. Perhaps a higher premium can be paid intially, until age 65, but open up the current system to anyone 60 or older. See how many (or how fast!) folks would drop their private coverage (averaging over $10k per year) and choose the Medicare path. Do this for perhaps 3 to 5 years and see how the system adjusts. Taking an older age group out of the private market should actually lower insurance coverage to the remaining younger pool. After the 3 to 5 year period, if all is going well, open Medicare up to 55+. Again, adjust the buy-in premiums accordingly. But if a 60-year old were able to sign on for Medicare and it would cost perhaps $300. per month, or even $500. per month, it would be very popular. The Medicare coverage is high quality, broad based and portable."

First, the more they're charged, the higher they can raise your premiums. The 10% annual premium raise back in 1989 was only about $25/mo. In 2019, it's now $165/mo. Still just 10%, but much bigger profits--a cost plus bonanza for them, so they welcome the higher bills. Second, and the most evil, is that insurance companies refer to the amount they're charged when justifying higher premiums but try to hide that they completely control how much they pay--and usually that's about 28-32% of what they're charged. And between deductibles, co-pays, co-insurances and denied services, pay about 10 cents on the dollar of a typical outpatient bill."

Currently, employers pay about $4k-10k per year, per employee for medical insurance coverage for their employees and often these same employees also have taken from their paychecks an additional $3k-8k towards this same medical insurance coverage. That's about $7k-18k per year being paid for private, for-profit corporate insurance. That's a lot of money that under ""Medicare-For-All"" doesn't demand from every citizen in its implementation. Personally, I think Bernie and others who propose a ""zero-cost, zero-deductable"" concept are wrong to do so. I think the solution is right in front of our faces: When a citizen turns 65, they're allowed to receive Medicare and the basic plan (Part A, Part B (80%) and Part D). We should simply open Medicare up in stages, first allowing age 60+ to join and perhaps have a slightly higher monthly premium (currently about $135. per month to those 65+). Then after perhaps a 3 to 5 year period of this 60+ system, open it up to 55+. See how the system handles this growth in ""membership"". Private, for-profit insurance corporation will not like losing customers from their $7k-18k annual money-train but expansion and taking 60+ people should actually have a cost impact to lower private coverage, as we'd be taking a (presumed) sicker population subgroup out of the private marketplace and leaving a relatively younger, healthier population remaining in the private marketplace. The same effect would be in play when 55+ are then covered."

It's not a sticking point but a benefit since the existing system, which excludes nearly 30 million people, costs much more. ""U.S. Health Care Spending Hit $3.65 Trillion in 2018 | Fortune fortune.com › Briefing › Health Care"" So, assuming a modest 5% increase a year, the cost of the current inadequate system, which has the US ranked 35th in child mortality, life expectancy, and percentage of those covered among 35 advanced nations, would be over 40 Trillion. Why should saving 10 trillion be ""a sticking point."" Among the savings: 150 billion a year in private overhead (Medicare overhead is about 80% less expensive); another 150 billion saved in expensive emergency room service (about 90% more expensive than conventional doctor visits) for the uninsured, and another 150 billion saved by doctors who no longer need several clerks to manage the multiple payer system. This is more than enough to cover the 30 million currently uninsured."

While it did provide insurance to people who couldn't obtain it previously, and did away with lifetime caps and preexisting conditions, it did nothing to constrain the greed of the entire industry. They had the opportunity to add a public option but opted not to. That was truly needed to bring down costs. Single payer will force those prices down and cut those crooks out of the game. But they won't go down easily!"

This begs the question: "" If you believe the ACA does not work why did you adamantly refuse to work across the aisle to fix its exorbitant premiums and deductibles?""

They take a cut of it and profit handsomely. They tell you which doctors you can see and what procedures they will actually cover. Its so opaque you never know how much it will cost! Instead... Less money than you were paying before will go to a Social Security like fund. Because the government is the only source of payment for the drugs and medical procedures, they can set limits on what those drugs should cost. Then you go to the doctor whenever you need to... Get prescriptions as needed. Dentistry. Eye appointments... Whatever. Just like in any other developed country."
