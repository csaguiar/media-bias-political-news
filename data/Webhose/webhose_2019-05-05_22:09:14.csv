The British authorities and senior opposition figures had been meeting Thursday in quest of a new strategy on how the country leaves the European Union, as from breaking up her Party Prime Minister Theresa May attempted to stop her shift.
After she agreed to discussions with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who favors a softer form of Brexit than that advocated by the 31,, may confronted fury. Get alerts:
May and Corbyn met for two hours Wednesday, with both sides calling talks”constructive.” Labour and government teams planned detailed negotiations Thursday. Even the cross-party talks are risky together with every party split down the middle over Brexit.
Labour is officially dedicated to enacting the voters’ decision to leave the EU, but lots of the lawmakers of the party want. They’ll be mad if the party knowingly helps lead to the U.K.’s departure.
Pro-Brexit Conservatives are angry at the prospect of a Brexit that keeps Britian jump closely into EU trade rules and rules.
Treasury leader Philip Hammond stated both parties required to be more flexible to violate the Brexit impasse.
“When you enter a negotiation like this to find a compromise way ahead, both parties need to give something up,” he told ITV television. “There will be pain on both sides.”
Britain’s governmental paralysis across Brexit has left the country facing a potential departure from the EU in just a week.
Following U.K. lawmakers three times rejected an agreement struck between the bloc and might late last season, the EU gave Britain until April 12 to approve a withdrawal agreement, alter course and seek a further delay to Brexit, or wreck out of the bloc free of deal to cushion the shock.
Business leaders and economists warn that a no-deal Brexit would cause huge disruption to travel and trade, together with tariffs and customs tests resulting in gridlock at shortages of merchandise and ports.
Lawmakers desperate to avert a exit have captured control of the parliamentary agenda to pass a drafted bill that compels May to ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline when a no-deal departure is looming.
The bill was being debated Thursday at the upper chamber, the House of Lords of Parliament, and had been approved by the House of Commons by a vote.
Pro-Brexit lawmakers condemned the bill in an attempt to frustrate Brexit.
Members of the House of Lords were anticipated to filibuster and utilize delaying tactics to try and impede the development of the bill during the chamber.
The Brexit spokeswoman from the Lords of Labour, dianne Hayter, stated she was ready to debate all night and day if would like to get through it.
“If that’s what it takes to do exactly what the elected House of Commons asked us to do, that is what we can do,” she said.
If the bill passes into law, May will need to attend a EU Brexit summit in Brussels on April 10 to look for a delay.
The EU isn’t forced to agree. Leaders of this bloc, exasperated by the chaos in London, say they’ll only grant a delay if Britain includes a new plan that is viable.
Worries about a no-deal Brexit are particularly acute in Ireland, the only EU member country to share a land border with the U.K. Any habits checks or other barriers along the imperceptible frontier would hammer the Irish economy, and may undermine Northern Ireland’s peace process.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Dublin Thursday for Brexit discussions with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.
With passions running high both inside and outside Parliament, authorities warned politicians to tone down their rhetoric.
Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said that the mood was”amazingly febrile.”
“But I think there’s a responsibility on those individuals that have a stage and also have a voice, to communicate in a means that is temperate and isn’t at all moving to inflame people’s perspectives,” he said.

White House pushes back request for Trump tax Types,www.dailypolitical.com,Tyrone Williams,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/06/white-house-pushes-back-request-for-trump-tax-types.html,"Zacks Investment Research Upgrades PBF Logistics (PBFX) to “Hold” White House pushes back request for Trump tax Types April 6th, 2019 - Comments Off on White House pushes back request for Trump tax Types - Filed Under - by Tyrone Williams Tweet
The White House said Thursday that Democratic attempts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax documents are”political games.”
A House committee chairman formally asked as Democrats try to shed light on his complicated financial dealings and conflicts of interest, the IRS Wednesday to provide six years of Trump’s individual tax returns and the yields for a number of his companies rates. Get alerts:
The request Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, who directs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is the very first such requirement for a sitting president’s taxation advice in 45 years. The unprecedented move is likely to put off a massive legal battle involving Democrats controlling the House and the Trump government. Neal made the petition Wednesday in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, asking for company returns and Trump’s private for 2013 through 2018. He requested for the documents at seven days, placing.
Trump told reporters Wednesday he”would not be inclined” to supply his tax returns to the committee. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday morning that the White House”is not interested in playing a lot of political games such as the Democrats in Congress definitely want to spend their time performing “
Asked again later to Neal’s demand, Trump didn’t supply an immediate response.
“They will talk to my attorneys; they’ll speak to the attorney general,” Trump said at the White House, referring to Attorney General William Barr, whom he said.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec fell to comment.
Democrats insist that obtaining Trump’s tax filings falls within their mandate of oversight. Republicans have denounced this as a political witch hunt and privacy concerns that were invoked.
“We have completed the necessary groundwork for a request of this size, and I am sure we are within our legitimate legislative, legal and supervision faith,” Neal said in a statement Wednesday evening.
Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the senior Republican on the Ways and Means panel, denounced the move as”a misuse of this tax-writing committees’ statutory authority.”
“Weaponizing our nation’s tax code by targeting political foes puts a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans’ privacy rights,” Brady wrote in a letter Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who oversees the IRS. “As you know, by legislation all Americans have a fundamental right into the privacy of the personal information found in their own tax returns”
Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House GOP leader, said”lots of Americans are shocked” which Congress can examine tax returns,”whether it’s a blue collar employee or president of the USA.”
The legal battle set to ensue could take years to solve, possibly extending beyond the 2020 presidential elections.
Trump broke with years of tradition by refusing to release his income tax filings throughout his 2016 campaign. He’s said they won’t be released by him because he is being audited, even though IRS officials also have stated citizens under audit are free to release their returns. Trump maintained at a news conference after the November election which the figures are too complicated for individuals to understand.
The IRS has a coverage of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents,”however little is understood about the efficacy of this application,” Neal said in the announcement. “Despite the American people, the Ways and Means Committee must ascertain whether this policy is being followedclosely, and if so, whether these audits are conducted completely and appropriately”
Neal continued,”To be able to fairly make that determination, we have to obtain President Trump’s tax returns and also examine if the IRS is doing out its duties.”
Neal is one of just three congressional officers authorized to make a request to the Treasury secretary for anyone’s tax returns. A rarely used 1924 law says that the Treasury chief”shall furnish” the requested material to members of the Ways and Means Committee for them to examine closed doors.
A spokesman for Mnuchin did not respond to requests for comment.
Mnuchin suggested in testimony to Congress last month he would shield the privacy of Trump when the House Democrats asked his tax returns. “We shall inspect the petition and we’ll adhere to the law… and we’ll protect the president as we’d protect any citizen” regarding their right to privacy, Mnuchin said.

Zacks Investment Research downgraded shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a report issued on Tuesday morning, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “In the past three months, 3M's shares have underperformed the industry. Also, it looks significantly overvalued compared with the industry over the same time frame. For 2019, the company lowered the earnings projection from $10.60-$11.05 to $10.45-$10.90 per share and net sales growth guidance from 2-4% to 1-4%. Foreign currency translation is predicted to adversely influence sales by 1%. In addition, we believe that rising costs, if not checked, will continue to weigh over the company's profitability in the upcoming quarters. Also, the company invests significantly in R&D to locally develop and manufacture products, which in turn is likely to put pressure on its finances and hence might impact profitability. Further, analysts have become increasingly bearish on the company in the past 7 days.” Get 3M alerts:

"Little known Czech biotech’s cell therapy greatly increases survival in ovarian cancer. Sotio’s potential breakthrough and another pipeline cancer candidate taking on checkpoint inhibitors, like Keytruda.",mondaymorning.com,Steve Walker,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://mondaymorning.com/2019/04/05/little-known-czech-biotechs-cell-therapy-greatly-increases-survival-in-ovarian-cancer-sotios-potential-breakthrough-and-another-pipeline-cancer-candidate-taking-on-checkpoint-inhibi/,"April 5, 2019 April 5, 2019 PDPics / Pixabay
The News:
SOTIO AS (Prague) has shown in a Phase 2 trial that its cellular immunotherapy can decrease the risk of a patient dying from ovarian cancer by 62%. The cell therapy was tested in people with the most severe stages of recurrent ovarian cancer, in combination with second-line chemotherapy when cancer returned after a first-line treatment. The trial recruited a total of 71 patients in the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland, according to Labiotech.eu . After 2 years, 73% of those treated with the combination survived, compared to 41% for those treated only with chemotherapy.
The overall survival of the patients increased by 13.4 months when receiving Sotio’s cellular immunotherapy. This immunotherapy makes use of the patient’s own dendritic cells–a kind of immune cell that is responsible for signaling the immune system to attack a threat. The cells are extracted from the patients and exposed to killed ovarian cancer cells. This primes the immune cells against the characteristics of ovarian cancer cells before being returned to the patient.
Following the encouraging results of this Phase 2 study, Sotio is now planning a Phase 3 trial to test the treatment on a larger number of patients across the world. With the first FDA approval of a CAR-T cell therapy just over one year ago, cell therapies that harness the power of the immune system to fight cancer are gaining recognition as an effective treatment for cancer.
Treatments already in the market, like Novartis AG’s (Basel CHE) Kymriah, make use of immune T cells, engineering them to target a specific cancer antigen. With its dendritic cell therapy, Sotio aims to target different kinds of cancer by just changing the type of tumor cells they are exposed to. The company is already testing this approach in prostate and lung cancer.
But Sotio is not the only one seeking to harness dendritic cells against cancer. Companies such as Immunicum AB (Stockholm) in and CiMaas BV (Maastricht) in the Netherlands are developing their own cancer treatments based on these promising immune cells.
Steve’s Take:
While Sotio’s news about a successful Phase 2 for its ovarian cancer cell therapy caught many US-based biotech observers by surprise, there is another mostly overlooked news item from last summer I stumbled upon that is perhaps making even titans Merck and Bristol-Myers a wee bit nervous.
The August, 2018 headline , which didn’t explain much, was “PPF Group and Sotio complete acquisition of Cytune.”
The slightly more detailed introductory paragraph of this the mystery event was Sotio’s announcement that it and “parent PPF Group NV” had completed their acquisition of Cytune Pharma SAS (Nantes FRA).
Under terms of the practically invisible acquisition, Sotio will continue to develop Cytune’s lead pipeline molecule SO-C101 (RLI-15) and intends to initiate first-in-human clinical trials early this year. Sotio is fronting all of privately held investment powerhouse PPF’s activities in the biotech sector and was closely involved in Cytune’s acquisition process. Additionally, all of Cytune’s projects are now being developed as part of Sotio’s pipeline.
“We are excited about the completion of the acquisition and welcome Cytune to the PPF Group. Cytune and Sotio have been closely and very successfully collaborating over the course of the last few years and we very much look forward to initiating the first clinical trials with SO-C101 in a few months,” commented Radek Spisek, CEO of Sotio . “SO-C101 will become a core programme of our pipeline, together with our clinical programmes in ovarian, lung and prostate cancer based on our autologous dendritic cell therapy platform DCVAC.”
David Bechard, president and COO of Cytune said at the time, “I’m proud that our products, originating from INSERM and the University of Nantes and supported by Bpifrance and Atlanpole Biotherapies, hold the potential to lead to new therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer patients. Such IL-2/IL-15Rβγ agonists represent a new and very promising class of drugs in the immune-oncology segment as they have shown to re-induce responses in patients after failure to checkpoint inhibitors treatment .”
Okay, Merck and BMS. Did you hear that? In addition to its ovarian cancer candidate, Sotio is now developing Cytune’s promising cell-therapy approach in a variety of other cancers where your checkpoint inhibitors Keytruda and Opdivo don’t work. And Sotio’s parent, the diversified Amsterdam-based investment conglomerate PPF Group, with some €6.506 billion in annual revenue and total assets of over €38.222 billion, can easily fund the necessary remaining research to bring the two cell treatments all the way through to possible regulatory clearance and eventually commercialization.
You see the point of my little rant. Hiding in plain sight over there in Europe are two potentially explosive cancer treatments that could compete for the many thousands of cancer cases where checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda and Opdivo ultimately don’t work. And that’s far more than half of the total such cases.
It’s my guess that PPF Group is cultivating a diamond in the rough there in Czech Republic, and Sotio may someday bring a fat payday to anyone remotely involved in an investment position with it. With the help of my Berlin-based biotech colleagues at Labiotech.eu, I’ll keep an eye out for any important developments in Prague and Amsterdam. Stay tuned.

"""Here's What It's Like To Be A Bear In A Rigged Market"" | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/heres-what-its-be-bear-rigged-market,"
Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,
Central bankers and media handlers must be laughing at how easy it is to slaughter the Bears and doubters with another fake-news round of trade-deal rumors and another Fed parrot being prompted to repeat some dovish mumbo-jumbo.
It's not just tough being a Bear in a market rigged by trade deal rumors, Federal Reserve dovishness, a tsunami of Chinese liquidity and $270 billion in stock buy-backs in the first quarter--it's impossible. Even ""smarter than the average Bear"" Yogi couldn't beat the market, and so he ended up taking one for the Jellystone team so other Bears might live to fight another day:
Perhaps the best way to describe the impossibility of being a Bear in a rigged market is to employ an analogy. (Not that a rigged market is actually a market; it's been transformed into a simulacrum ""market"" that's the one signifier of economic well-being: if the ""market"" continues lofting higher, all is well with the economy and indeed, the entire status quo.)
Let's start with a sports analogy.
Imagine you're on a basketball court.
You're being guarded by Myles Turner, the NBA's leader in blocked shots.
You make it to the half court line and find a chain-link fence blocks the court a few feet from the line, meaning your only shot is from half court.
When you manage to release a Hail Mary shot, a steel plate slams down on top of the rim, blocking any ball that might have lucked into the net.
That's what being a Bear in a rigged market is like.
Here's another analog , courtesy of my friend and colleague Adam T.:
You are David, armed only with a sling and a projectile, entering the arena to face the fearsome Goliath.
Instead of a rock, you're given a foam ball.
Meanwhile Goliath has a bazooka.
Let the contest begin!
You get the idea. Bears don't have a prayer in a market this rigged.
Now by all rights, declaring the Death of Bears should top-tick the rally and trigger a reversal, much like the infamous magazine cover curse or the hubris of constructing the tallest-building-in-the-world ushers in a massive global reversal of fortune.
But even black magic and portents appear powerless against a market completely rigged to melt up regardless of external realities , especially economic-financial data that isn't itself fully rigged.
Pretty much the only factors that could give Bears a tiny sliver of hope that the rigged market might collapse under its own weight are:
1. an invasion organized by the Central Bank of Mars to take control of Earth's resources and assets, or
2. Goldman Sachs has built a massive short position and is poised to flush the market lower to reap some quick profits from the panic-stricken decline.
Absent a miracle, the steel plate will block any Bear's lucky half-court shot, just as David's foam projectile will bounce right off Goliath's forehead.
Central bankers and media handlers must be laughing at how easy it is to slaughter the Bears and doubters with another fake-news round of trade-deal rumors and another Fed parrot being prompted to squawk some dovish mumbo-jumbo.

The Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence ( RICAGV ) partnered with the Cranston Action Network to host two speakers on preventing gun violence on Thursday evening.
Dr Megan Ranney , is the founder of AFFIRM , a coalition of leading United States medical associations working to curb the tide of indifference to the normalization of gun violence in America through research. Ranney is an emergency room doctor and served as co-chair of Governor Gina Raimond o’s commission on gun violence.
Ranney spoke on her perspective of gun violence as a public health problem rather than as a criminal problem.
“Who’s at risk of being shot?” asked Dr Ranney. “We have young minority men, 15 to 34, firearm injury is the second leading cause of death or children and adolescents in this country, and the leading reason for adolescents to die in this country. It is a disease process that disproportionately affects minorities, and it’s something that we must talk about as such…”
Cranston resident Lisa Pagano , founder of the Lieutenant Jim Pagano Foundation , will speak about how she helped her family rebound after the devastating murder of her brother in 2008 by his neighbor, a concealed carry permit holder. Pagano’s story is heartbreaking. Lisa Pagano
After her brother was murdered by a neighbor in full view of the children and parents attending a family birthday party, “the neighborhood children were questioned about all that they saw that day. Five year olds, seven year olds, ten years olds… Kids were traumatized that Sunday and until this day struggle and try to find ways to cope with what they saw…”

Lyft Threatens To Sue Uber's Lead Underwriter For Helping To Crash Its Stock | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/lyft-threatens-sue-ubers-lead-underwriter-helping-crash-its-stock,"0 SHARES
Desperate to explain the debacle following its recent IPO, when its stock crashed from its opening print of $87, tumbling below the $72 IPO price and then sliding some more for good measure to enter a bear market within 2 days of opening for trade, the newly public Lyft has found a scapegoat: the lead underwriter for the upcoming IPO of its biggest competitor, Uber.
After reading an unverified article in the NY Post, which said that Morgan Stanley was marketing a short-selling product that ""appeared to offer Lyft’s pre-IPO shareholders a way to get around lockup agreements that prevent them from selling for at least six months after the IPO"" and was allegedly depressing the Lyft stock price according to the Information, and facing investor ire for a bungled IPO, Lyft threatened the Times Square-based investment banking giant with legal action, demanding in an April 2 letter that the bank stop marketing the controversial product.
Whether or not Morgan Stanley was doing anything illegal, or anything at all for that matter, is unclear: according to the original Post report, ""Morgan Stanley, a lead underwriter for Lyft rival Uber, is one of the brokerages selling a “short” product to pre-IPO investors.""
What is even more ironic is that the swap was only made possible due to deficiencies in the Lyft IPO lockup terms:
Driving the unusual bets is language in Lyft’s lock-up agreements that has hedge funds and other early Lyft investors giving themselves a green light to make limited “short” bets, which make money on a stock’s decline.
The goal is to position the bets in such a way that investors don’t benefit from a decline or a rise in the stock. But simply to lock in their IPO gains, which were significant.
“If I can lock in $70 now, I’m going to do that,” said an investor.
“Lyft made a mistake,” one investor who bought into Lyft shares prior to the IPO told The Post. “ People who own the stock are allowed to hedge their positions. You are not allowed to reduce your economic interest.”
In other words, while not explicitly selling, many of the investors - confident the stock would tumble - precipitated precisely such a tumble with their own hedging actions, reportedly facilitated by Morgan Stanley. The result, according to Lyft, was the plunge in the stock. in the hours and days following its IPO.
We say ""supposedly"" because Morgan Stanley denies: bank spokesman Mark Lake told TechCrunch that the New York Post report was flat-out wrong:
""Morgan Stanley did not market or execute, directly or indirectly, a sale, short sale, hedge, swap, or transfer of risk or value associated with Lyft’s stock for any Lyft shareholder identified by the company or otherwise known to us to be the subject of a Lyft lock-up agreement.
Our firm’s activities have been in the normal course of market making, and any suggestion that Morgan Stanley engaged in an effort to apply short pressure to Lyft is false.”
So to summarize: having read an anonymously sources and unconfirmed piece (in the NY Post of all places) that gave Lyft management a possible explanation for the stock drop, an explanation that relied on management's own sloppy lockup language, the car-hailing company could barely wait before sending out an angry letter to Morgan Stanley, lead underwriter of the upcoming IPO of Uber, demanding it cease and desist doing... whatever it was doing. Which according to Morgan Stanley was nothing.
As TechCrunch notes, whether the story ends here remains to be seen. The Information has updated its original post to include part of Morgan Stanley’s statement of denial, but it continues to report that, according to one of its sources, Morgan Stanley had been calling early Lyft investors for weeks during its roadshow and pitching them on a short-selling transaction that would enable them to lock in gains, regardless of the lockup.
Assuming Morgan Stanley is telling the truth - which is very likely with its on-the-record denial - the question then is who were the ""three sources close to the situation"" that fed the NY Post the misinformation.
As for the suggestion that Uber somehow tried to sabotage the Lyft IPO (which apparently Lyft management was quite capable to do on its won with its sloppy S-1 drafting), that may be a stretch considering the very bitter taste in investors mouths following the biggest ""decacorn"" IPO in years, and the fact that this will surely reflect quite poorly on demand for Uber's own (Morgan Stanley-managed) upcoming IPO, which will reportedly be valued at over $100 billion despite losing $1.8 billion in 2018, and amount that is growing with every passing quarter.
As for Lyft, its damage control scramble may be too late: the good news is that for now, the cost of shorting LYFT stock is about 100%, which makes it prohibitively costly to engage in a lengthy short. The bad news is that the cost of shorting LYFT stock is about 100% because everyone wants to do it; and somehow we doubt Lyft can sue all the shorts. Tags "
Community groups and Rhode Island residents react to Mayor Elorza’s water announcement,upriseri.com,UpriseRI,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://upriseri.com/2019-04-06-water/,"Home News Community groups and Rhode Island residents react to Mayor Elorza’s water announcement Community groups and Rhode Island residents react to Mayor Elorza’s water announcement April 6, 2019 UpriseRI News
Community groups and indigenous leaders rejoice as the mayor, responding to public opposition, cancels plans to privatize the regional water system.
Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza announced that he is backing away from a plan to privatize the city’s water system. The Land and Water Sovereignty Campaign , along with community activists across the state, have led the call to keep Providence’s water in public hands.
Since February, the Rhode Island state legislature has considered legislation to enable the privatization of the Providence Water Supply Board . With his announcement today, the mayor requested that the bill sponsors remove it from consideration.
“We are glad to hear of Mayor Elorza’s decision to stop all legislative efforts towards monetization and privatization of our water,” said Cristina Cabrera , AKA Chunchip Deer Spirit , Core Team Member, Water Is Life – Land & Water Sovereignty Campaign & Environmental Justice Director of Indigenous Affairs, Pocasset Pokanoket Land Trust . “As Indigenous People, our care and our responsibility lies in protecting our land and water from any form of commodification, capitalization or privatization. This is the beginning of a long road to ensure that our water remains protected for future generations. We welcome the opportunity to work with the City of Providence on a participatory budgeting process for its financial concerns, but Water is not up for lease or sale. Mni Wiconi .”
“As a member of the core group of the Land and Water Sovereignty Campaign, a Standing Rock water protector, and 30 year resident of Rhode Island, I would like to thank everyone who diligently participated to stop the monetization of our water supply, that provides 60 percent of Rhode Islanders with potable drinking water,” said John Gonzalez of the Pimicikamak Cree Nation . “This is not the end. This is only the beginning for Land and Water Sovereignty, our indigenous and most heavily impacted communities.”
“We are glad to be working in collaboration with the Land & Water Sovereignty Campaign to protect the interest of our water,” said Sequan Pijakì , aka Chief George Spring Buffalo , Chief Executive Officer, Pocasset Pokanoket Land Trust. “The purpose of the Pocasset Pokanoket Land Trust is to advocate for indigenous lands to ensure rightful stewardship and protection of our territorial lands and water. We celebrate the mayor’s decision to stop all legislative efforts towards monetization and privatization of our water. It is of utmost importance to hear the cries of our Mayan Ancestors in support of indigenous land and water sovereignty.”
“Water is a human right, and efforts to commodify it run counter to the public good and do great harm to all, but especially the most vulnerable in our communities,” said Gillian Kiley , Cranston resident. “I am grateful for the leadership of City Council members like Rachel Miller , Kat Kerwin , and Seth Yurdin on this issue, and am pleased that Mayor Elorza heard the broad opposition voiced by the community and responded by withdrawing support for these bills. Going forward, the City of Providence and the state of Rhode Island must recognize that water is a precious, essential public resource that cannot be commodified.”
“Leasing or selling water is just a roundabout way of making Rhode Island residents pay for a problem they didn’t cause with their water bills, housing stability, and health,” said Janice Gan , resident of Providence. “A better approach would come from the ground up, through the leadership of the Indigenous Peoples who have long managed this watershed and the front line communities who are already being harmed by poor infrastructure, toxic facilities, and an ongoing history of extraction and exclusion.”
“We are glad that the mayor has listened to the community, and hope this will be the beginning of a process in which Rhode Islanders, the region’s Indigenous people, and city, town and state legislators will work together to ensure safe, clean, accessible and affordable water for all for years to come,” said Providence resident Kate Schapira .
“We applaud Mayor Elorza for listening to the overwhelming community opposition to privatization, and for making the right decision to be a champion for public water,” said Food & Water Watch Senior Northeast Organizer N isha Swinton . “The city’s water system is too vital to lease off to the highest bidder. These privatization deals result in higher rates and diminished service, and leave ratepayers paying off what is essentially a high-interest loan for decades to come. Providence should seize this opportunity to find a solution to its financial challenges that protects its public water system and honors its commitments to public workers.”
“This is a clear victory for people in Providence and across the state. It’s just the latest in a string of cities around the globe that have cast out privatization and affirmed the human right to water,” said Corporate Accountability Senior Water Organizer Alissa Weinman . “Given the industry’s track record of rate hikes, labor abuses, and corner cutting that jeopardizes public health, privatization in Providence threatened both communities and the city,all in the name of profits. From Lagos to Pittsburgh to Providence, people are sending a clear message to the private water industry: ‘Water is for people, not for profit.’”
The Poor People’s Campaign Organizing Committee released this statement: “We are committed to lifting up and deepening the leadership of those most affected by systemic racism, poverty, the war economy, and ecological devastation and to building unity across lines of division. In this spirit we join in support of the Water Is Life — Land and Water Sovereignty Campaign to protect the interest and indigenous sovereignty of territorial land and water. Water is life and neither water nor people are up for lease or sale.”

Today’s version is titled “ A need for natural gas .” Everyone who is paying attention realizes that we need to reduce emissions by to zero in the next 15 to 20 years, and that our infrastructure is more than adequate to handle our gas needs as we dramatically reduce the use of gas and all other fossil fuels in the next 10 to 15 years so as to avert disasters of a scale never before seen by humanity. If our society builds gas infrastructure designed to last 40 or 50 years, we either lock in massive warming and the fires, storms, famines, and wars that will accompany a much warmer planet, or we lock in massive debt for useless infrastructure.

Peter Nightingale: Warped priorities mark the Department of Energy’s FY 2020 budget,upriseri.com,Peter Nightingale,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://upriseri.com/2019-04-05-peter-nightingale/," Environment Climate Change Peter Nightingale: Warped priorities mark the Department of Energy’s FY 2020 budget Peter Nightingale: Warped priorities mark the Department of Energy’s FY 2020 budget April 6, 2019 Peter Nightingale Climate Change , Peace , Poverty Boeing B-47B rocket-assisted take off on April 15, 1954.

In a March 11 press release highlighting its FY 2020 budget, the Department of Energy ( DOE ) claims that it will fulfill its obligation to clean up the environmental pollution legacy of the Cold War. Nuclear Watch , in its March 25 response, explains what DOE really means:
Cleanup at DOE’s nuclear weapons sites is cut by 9.8% to $6.47 billion. According to a recent Government Accountability Office Report, DOE now estimates that future nation-wide cleanup of Cold War legacy radioactive and toxic wastes will cost at least $377 billion – $109 billion more than last year’s estimate. In that sense, DOE’s cleanup programs are going backwards, while NNSA ’s [ National Nuclear Security Administration ‘s] nuclear weapons research and production programs that made the mess are being expanded.
One of the biggest superfund sites in the United States is in located in Hanford, Washington. This is where Fat Man , the code name of the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki, was built. The decommissioned Hanford facility is releasing significant amounts of radioactive material into the air and into the water of the Columbia River.
There is more than radioactivity. American negotiators insisted on excluding military greenhouse gas pollution from the Kyoto Protocol . As Nick Buxton wrote in the run-up to the 2015 UN climate negotiations in Paris :
The history of how the military disappeared from any carbon accounting ledgers goes back to the UN climate talks in 1997 in Kyoto. Under pressure from military generals and foreign policy hawks opposed to any potential restrictions on US military power, the US negotiating team succeeded in securing exemptions for the military from any required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Even though the US then proceeded not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the exemptions for the military stuck for every other signatory nation. Even today, the reporting each country is required to make to the UN on their emissions excludes any fuels purchased and used overseas by the military.
The United States military, as the world’s largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels , is a main contributor to global warming. Nevertheless, the FY 2020 budget cuts programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy by a whopping 86 percent.
Of course, none of this even begins to scratch the surface of the ecological devastation for which the United States military is responsible. Wikipedia lists 143 military superfund sites . This list does not include the pollution due to the high-yield Castle Bravo thermonuclear test that was carried out in 1954, virtually without consideration of the ecological impact on the Marshall Islands . There also were the human radiation experiments that took advantage of vulnerable groups such as institutionalized children, seriously ill and sometimes comatose patients, African-Americans, and prisoners .
The common thread in much of this is the disrespect for all but straight white males that comes with Christian nationalism and follows in the footsteps of the Doctrine of Discovery of 1493. That certainly covers the uranium mining that has a serious impact on the health of Indigenous Peoples of the Northern Great Plains and the Southwest. Oglala Sioux Tribe keeps up fight against uranium mine, an integral, enabling part of the United States’ war machine
Gravely immoral as all of the above may be, there is no comparison with the threat to life on earth posed by nuclear weapons. Their development has been growing unchecked across administrations, as shown in a plot made by the Los Alamos Study Group . From Los Alamos Study Group AEC: Atomic Energy Commission; ERDA: Energy (read Nuclear Weapons) Research and Development Administration; DEO: Department of Energy (read Nuclear Weapons); and NNSA: National Nuclear Security (read Destabilization) Administration.
The dynamics of the growth of the nuclear war industry has been studied and understood for decades. As Richard Rhodes writes in the epilogue of his authoritative Dark Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb written in 1996),
“The arms race,” Nincic [a political scientist] summarized, “is imbedded in circumstances proper to the domestic political and economic systems of the superpowers in addition to dynamics inherent in the interaction between the two nations.” Having worked the numbers, Nincic concluded that all the high claptrap of arms strategy was essentially decorative: “Strategic doctrines are designed, in large part, to justify the weaponry that the arms race has imposed on both the United States and the Soviet Union.”
On April 4, 1967, Dr Martin Luther King , exactly a year before he was assassinated, delivered his famous Beyond Vietnam address, and said:
Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism.
These words remain true today. But ecological devastation ranges from the radioactive pollution in Hanford to the threats to life on earth posed by a nuclear holocaust followed nuclear winter and by a climate catastrophe caused by run-away global warming. Given these circumstances, the choice between “nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation” is starker than it was in 1967. Indeed, just a month ago, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan came close to war. This is exactly one of Bill Perry’s nuclear nightmare scenarios .
Today’s Poor People’s Campaign , which builds upon the campaign of the same name of 1967-68, has added a new item to the list of three mortal enemies of morality named by Dr King 52 years ago.
The demands of today’s Poor People’s Campaign are to end poverty, racism, militarism, and ecological devastation. Share this article:"
Wyatt Board suspends ICE contract for 90 days; Detainees need to be moved out in seven days,upriseri.com,Steve Ahlquist,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://upriseri.com/2019-04-06-wyatt/," Civil Rights Prison Wyatt Detention Center Wyatt Board suspends ICE contract for 90 days; Detainees need to be moved out in seven days Wyatt Board suspends ICE contract for 90 days; Detainees need to be moved out in seven days April 6, 2019 Steve Ahlquist Wyatt Detention Center Joseph Molina Flynn New Board Chair Joseph Molina Flinn says Warden overstepped in signing contract; cites human rights and fiduciary concerns
The meeting at the Wyatt Detention Facility Training Building gymnasium was attended by over 100 people, including elected officials, community members and prison staff. The new Central Falls Detention Facility Corporation ( CFDFC ) board, which oversees operations at the Wyatt, was sworn in and immediately went to work. Newly appointed board member Joseph Molina Flynn , an immigration lawyer and President of the Rhode Island Latino Political Action Committee ( RILPAC ) was unanimously elected chair. Then Board member Agostinho Silva , who is President Preo-Tempore of the Central Falls City Council , recused himself and left the room.
The City Council has been alarmed by revelations two weeks ago that the Wyatt had reached an agreement with the United States Marshall Service to house up to 225 United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) detainees under a recent Zero Tolerance Southern Border Policy instituted under President Donald Trump . Several members of the City Council, including Council President Maria Rivera and the Mayor of Central Falls, James Diossa , have publicly stated that they wish to see the facility closed for good.
The four remaining CFDFC Board members then voted to go into executive session to discuss the contract. Some in the room, unfamiliar with the way the Open Meetings Act works, were confused. Under the law, public boards and commissions may hold certain discussions, specifically concerning contract negotiations, potential ligation and labor disputes, out of view of the public. After executive session, the Board is required to report back to the public any decisions made and votes taken. The board was in executive session with Wyatt staff including Warden Daniel Martin , Wyatt legal council Kerry Walsh from the law firm of Pannone, Lopes, Devereaux and O’Gara , and Wyatt Spokesperson Christopher Hunter for about 45 minutes.
When the CFDFC Board returned, Chair Molina Flynn immediately issued two decisions, addressing issues that had not yet been on the public’s radar, but displayed in some ways the depth of the structural problems at the Wyatt.
“It has come to my attention that our legal council has been in coordination with the attorney for the bondholders,” said Molina Flynn to Attorney Kerry Walsh. “I will remind you council that we are the corporation. We are the client. As chair, I instruct you to not have any contact with the bondholders or their attorney without my approval or my presence. Is that understood?”
The bondholders, who funded the renovations at the Wyatt, are represented by a law firm out of Boston.
Attorney Walsh is the Wyatt l egal council who denied portions of my Access to Public Records Act ( APRA ) request.
“Similarly it has come to my attention that our public relations consultant, Chris Hunter , has been drafting media statements with the bondholder’s attorney and Pannone Lopes with no involvement or approval from this Board. That is unacceptable and I am instructing you that I, as chair, must be involved in all communications with the media and drafting of all statements and that bondholders and their lawyer are not to be involved without my consent.”
That business out of the way, Molina Flynn reiterated that the CFDFC Board has the power to enter into and terminate all contracts. The contract to house ICE detainees, said Molina Flynn, “was never vetted or approved by this board.”
“Despite the protests and the counterprotests and the letters back and forth between the bondholders and the City, I want to be very clear,” said Molina Flynn. “This board is an independent governing body of this corporation… This board, under the oath we just took, is required to uphold the Constitution and laws of this State and the Constitution of the United States.
“The Constitution gives citizens, residents and asylum seekers alike basic due process rights that are incumbent on us to support… among other important legal rights.”
Molina Flynn noted the death of immigrant detainee Hiu Lui “ Jason ” Ng who died at the Wyatt in 2008 from negligent medical care. Since
“There are currently no regulations or rules to ensure the basic due process rights, human rights and human dignity for our detainees so that another immigrant death will not happen again.
“This board has been provided no proof that Rhode Island based legal services have been provided and/or are available to these detainees,” continued Molina Flynn. “This board has been provided no proof that Rhode Island based mental health services have been provided and/or are available to these detainees. This board has been provided no proof that Rhode Island based medical care physical examinations have been provided and/or are available to these detainees, nor have we been provided any proof that Rhode Island based religious liberties and religious services have been provided and/or are available to these detainees. This board has been provided no proof that Rhode Island based interpreting, translating an consulate services have been provided and/or are available to these detainees.” Brooke Conley , Aniece Germain and Lilian Calderon . Calderon was a Rhode Island resident detained by ICE .
“Finally, it has come to this Board’s attention that many of these detainees, currently being held, appear to be under the age of 18. This board has been provided no proof the facility has an age verification process in place to ensure that these detainees are being provided their adequate legal rights depending on their age.”
Given that the contract under review is for $2.5 million per year, Molina Flynn and the Board concluded that the financial burden would not be undue given the Board’s obligation to uphold due process rights.
The board then unanimously decided to suspend the contract with ICE for 90 days. All detainees are to be returned to ICE and the United States Marshall Service within seven days. The Warden and legal consul must draft rules and regulations to guarantee the rights cited by Molina Flynn above. These rules need to be presented to the Board in July. The 90 day suspension shall remain in effect until the Board approves the new rules and regulations.
“It’s bittersweet,” said Central Falls City Councilor Jessica Vega (Ward 5). “I’m glad that we as a Council fought for this, we had our voices heard, we marched, we continue to make noise, we were adamant about what we thought was right. It’s bitter because we don’t know where these people are going. We know that they are being sent back to ICE custody, and that my understanding is back to Arizona, but that doesn’t fix the issue.” Jessica Vega and Maria Rivera
Councilor Vega has been a strong voice for closing the Wyatt Detention Facility entirely.
“The larger issue,” said Vega, “that this country has when it comes to the treatment of black and brown people and black and brown immigrants…
“This is a start,” said Vega. “I’m glad this was done, but long term goals, that’s what we need to think about.”

Former GOP Arizona State Rep: 'I Don't Like To Demonize' Child Sex Trafficking | Crooks and Liars,crooksandliars.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/former-gop-arizona-state-rep-i-dont,"Image from: AZ Central
Law enforcement should be investigating this man, not just the Arizona House of Representatives ethics committee.
This report from AZ Central is beyond disturbing: David Stringer on child sex trafficking, 'I don't like to demonize it'
Former Arizona Rep. David Stringer made disturbing comments about child sex trafficking and his interactions with children within the past few years, two Prescott women told ethics investigators.
Those statements are included in new records the state House of Representatives released Wednesday from its ethics investigation into complaints against Stringer, who resigned last week over accusations that he raped children in the 1980s .
Among the new records are notes about a conversation Stringer had with an activist during a 2018 Republican Women of Prescott meeting, where he disputed that child sex trafficking is a problem.
According to investigators' notes of the exchange, Stringer and Merissa Hamilton, an activist who works to protect child victims of trafficking, were seated next to each other watching a speech from a Border Patrol agent at the event.
Their discussion can be overheard in a video, which Hamilton recorded as she live-streamed the event on Facebook.
In the video, Stringer and Hamilton discuss what issue he should ask the speaker about, and she suggests Stringer ask about child trafficking.
He responds by saying that he doesn't think sex trafficking is a concern and said, ""I don't like to demonize it.""
Stringer also said while he doesn't think there is much child sex trafficking there are ""a lot of 15-year-old prostitutes."" He laughed after making that comment. The 1980s charges included accusations that Stringer paid for sex with one child who was 15 for part of the time.
The authorities should be interviewing every child this man has ever come into contact with.
Ashton Pittman summarized the report on Twitter: Report: Rep. David Stringer on child sex trafficking: “I don't like to demonize it”""If an uncle takes his niece or nephew to a playground, & they go on the merry-go-round & have some ice cream, & then do their thing, that’s just part of the experience."" https://t.co/hEVy2HoNLk ↓ Story continues below ↓

Voters re-elected him in Nov.A few weeks later, he told ASU students that African Americans ""don't blend in.” https://t.co/Qs0knjsWAK
— Ashton Pittman (@ashtonpittman) April 5, 2019 “Police arrested Rep. David Stringer was arrested in 1983 on suspicion of paying two children to have sex with him...One of the boys had a developmental disability, according to the report.” https://t.co/hEVy2HoNLk
— Ashton Pittman (@ashtonpittman) April 5, 2019 More about Rep. David Stringer’s racism in the report: He apparently said ""'Mexicans'& poor students should not be educated past the 8th grade, as this was a waste of education funding” & that Mexicans &""special ed"" students won’t ever contribute to their communities.

Florida mayor draws scrutiny after proposing 'Confederate Memorial Day',thehill.com,Rachel Frazin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/437698-florida-mayor-draws-scrutiny-after-proposing-confederate-memorial-day,"Florida mayor draws scrutiny after proposing 'Confederate Memorial Day' By Rachel Frazin - 04/06/19 12:30 PM EDT
A central Florida mayor has come under fire after proposing a ""Confederate Memorial Day"" celebration later this month.
Ocala Mayor Kent Guinn (R) on Tuesday signed a proclamation making April 26 ""a time in which to honor the memories of those who sacrificed their lives in the War Between States,"" The Washington Post reported Friday.
The paper noted that such language is often used to minimize Confederate wrongdoings. After Guinn signed the order, which was not required to go through a vote, Ocala City Council President Mary Sue Rich dissented. ""I’m not proud of you doing a Confederacy proclamation standing up here in front of all these people in the city of Ocala. That turns my stomach,"" Rich said at the meeting's end. ""I don’t think you deserve to be the mayor of Ocala. I hope somebody runs against you.""
She told reporters that she believes Confederate history belongs in museums.
""I don't think we need to have a special day in 2019 declaring Confederate Day in the city of Ocala,"" she said. Ocala City Councilwoman Mary Rich is speaking out. She was not happy that the mayor presented a proclamation for Confederate Memorial Day, during last nights’ council meeting. pic.twitter.com/pUdYPPb0j3 — Myrt Price (@MPriceWFTV) April 3, 2019
Rich also referenced allegations that Guinn has ties to the Ku Klux Klan, an accusation he has vehemently denied. ""I am not — repeat, not — in the KKK,"" he said during a press conference . ""I never have been. I never will be, and I despise and hate everything that organization stands for.""
Guinn told the Post that the proclamation is ""simply a memorial for Confederate soldiers who were veterans.""
But Civil War scholar Kevin Levin criticized Guinn for the language of the proclamation, saying it amplified a revisionist history.
""This is pure cowardice,"" Levin wrote on Twitter . ""Ocala, Florida Mayor Kent Guinn signs a proclamation for Confederate Memorial Day, but no effort is made to say what the war was about or what it resolved.""
Guinn said he has signed similar declarations in recent years and added that other county lawmakers also had done so. Confederate Memorial Day is an official holiday in Mississippi and Alabama and is considered a legal holiday by the state of Florida, the Post notes."
Big Dem names show little interest in Senate,thehill.com,Reid Wilson,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/437623-big-dem-names-show-little-interest-in-senate,"Big Dem names show little interest in Senate By Reid Wilson - 04/06/19 12:10 PM EDT Senate Democrats had the opportunity to recruit a murderers' row of popular and tested candidates with proven fundraising abilities in a handful of key states up for election next year as they seek a path back to the majority. But virtually all of those candidates have taken themselves out of the running, either because they see a bigger prize on the horizon — the White House — or because the allure of serving in the world’s greatest deliberative body is no longer what it once was. ADVERTISEMENT In spite of lobbying from allies in Washington and at home, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) is planning a possible presidential bid rather than challenging Sen.

Democrats are also optimistic about Georgia, where Stacey Abrams (D) continues to mull a long-shot bid for the White House or a run against Sen. David Perdue (R). Abrams said Thursday she is considering both races. ""I am thinking about it. I truly am,"" Abrams said of running for president on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""I think that the timing for me is first deciding about the Senate because I do think you cannot run for an office unless you know that’s the job you want to do."" Some Democrats have been frustrated that some of their best candidates would opt for a long-shot presidential bid over helping their team retake the Senate. But most strategists insist they are not concerned with the number of high-profile candidates who have taken a pass. ""We haven’t had to find this many candidates since that period. It’s still the first week in April,"" said J.B. Poersch, who runs the Senate Majority PAC, which backs Democrats running for Senate. ""Democrats are going to have great Senate candidates in many states."" Republicans say top-tier Democrats taking a pass on Senate bids bodes well for their narrow majority. ""I think it’s a testament to the strength of Republican senators that are up for reelection in each of those states,"" said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""I think they’ve done a tremendous job of appealing to their constituents' needs and finding the right issues to work on in the Senate, and these Democrats recognize that connection with these constituents and are deathly afraid of challenging them in 2020."" The hesitation about running for Senate is a common thread among several Democrats who have opted out. Some who have said no or are leaning against running don’t see the Senate as an attractive place to serve — either because the White House is a more appealing idea or, in several cases, because the institution itself is diminished. ""Currently the Senate is broken. Unfortunately there is not sufficient self-awareness on the part of senators to know it is broken, and there is no appetite to fix it,"" said an adviser to one of the Democrats who has said no to a Senate bid. ""Many of those who aren’t running for Senate are people who like to get things done. They would wither and die as junior members of the current Senate."" Former governors who come to Washington routinely feel stymied by the Senate’s slow pace. Some even express the sentiment publicly. Sen. Tom Carper Thomas (Tom) Richard Carper Big Dem names show little interest in Senate More than 30 Senate Dems ask Trump to reconsider Central American aid cuts Long-shot goal of nixing Electoral College picks up steam MORE (D), who spent eight years governing Delaware, once said his worst day as governor was still better than his best day as a senator. For others such as Abrams and O’Rourke, who harnessed the energy of the Democratic base to become stars even though they lost, becoming one of 100 senators — and possibly serving in the minority, at that — is no longer as intriguing. Those who have said no aren’t worried about the strains of raising money or mounting a campaign. Abrams is a darling of the small-dollar base that has fueled eye-popping fundraising reports. Bullock and Hickenlooper both have dedicated fundraising bases of their own. O’Rourke raised a mind-boggling sum in his failed bid against Sen. Ted Cruz"
