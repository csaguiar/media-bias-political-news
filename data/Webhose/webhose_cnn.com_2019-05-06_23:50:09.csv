Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting: PSG striker with the worst miss ever?,edition.cnn.com,"Ben Church, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/football/psg-eric-maxim-choupo-moting-miss-football-ligue-1-strasbourg-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Leading French club Paris Saint-Germain is starting to make a habit of fluffing its lines.
Last month, PSG somehow managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory against Manchester United in the Champions League. Fast forward to Sunday and the French club had been widely expected to be basking in the glory of its sixth Ligue 1 title in seven seasons. Instead all the talk after a 2-2 draw with Strasbourg -- ensuring PSG's title celebrations were put on ice -- was arguably the worst miss in the history of football courtesy of Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. With the score at 1-1, Choupo-Moting's teammate Christopher Nkunku had produced a wonderful piece of skill to chip Strasbourg goalkeeper Matz Sels and his shot looked to be rolling harmlessly over the line. Then Cameroon international Choupo-Moting needlessly took a touch and somehow diverted the ball onto the foot of the post from less than a yard out to prevent his side from regaining the lead. Is this the worst miss of all time? üòÇ

""I wondered if I was offside and it all happened very fast. I touched the ball, it hit the post and, well, it's a real shame because the ball was going in. Sorry about that,"" Choupo-Moting, who had put PSG ahead in the first half, told Canal+ after the match. After second-placed Lille drew with Reims earlier on Sunday, PSG had needed three points to clinch the title but could only manage a 2-2 draw against Strasbourg courtesy of a late equalizer from Presnel Kimpembe. The reigning champions remain 20 points clear at the top of the table with just eight games remaining so Thomas Tuchel's side will have plenty of chances to retain its crown.

Lion bite rugby player pays tribute to surgeon who saved his hand,edition.cnn.com,"Nick Friend, for CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/sport/scott-baldwin-lion-ospreys-cheetahs-surgeon-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Bitten by a lion, but biting back against the Cheetahs; Welsh rugby player Scott Baldwin has paid tribute to the surgeon who saved his hand.
As he returned to South Africa on Saturday as part of the Ospreys team that beat the appropriately named Bloemfontein-based outfit, Baldwin took the opportunity to thank Faf Weyers, who led the operation following his perilous run-in. During a 2017 trip to the city to take on the same opposition, Baldwin's team had visited the Weltevrede Game Lodge on Bloemfontein's outskirts, only for the lion to gnaw at the hooker after he ignored advice by getting too close to the predator as he tried to stroke its head. Baldwin has regained fitness since the unusual injury, starting Saturday's 31-14 victory over the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein - his first visit to the city since being bitten by the lion. Since then, however, Baldwin has made a full recovery. He started Saturday's 31-14 Pro14 victory over the same opposition, before seeking out Weyers to present him and his family with his match jersey. Following the reunion, Baldwin tweeted a photo, saying: ""Faf literally saved my hand. Thank you my man! it was a pleasure to give you my March jersey after the game tonight.""

Trump's strategy with Jewish community won't work (Opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Julian Zelizer,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/trump-jewish-community-strategy-zelizer/index.html,"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, and author, with Kevin Kruse, of the new book "" Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.

(CNN) President Donald Trump told the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas Saturday that Democrats ""are advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history.""
In his ongoing effort to win over a bigger percentage of the American Jewish vote in 2020, the president highlighted his support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and criticized Congresswoman Ilhan Omar in asking American Jews to support the GOP. The strategy won't work. Traditionally, solid majorities of American Jews have voted for Democratic presidential candidates. The only Republicans who made some progress against this trend were Ronald Reagan, with 39% of the Jewish vote in 1980, and Mitt Romney, with 30% in 2012. Normally, the numbers look more like they did in 2016 -- when Hillary Clinton won 71% of the Jewish vote and Trump got 23%, despite his efforts to use Israel as a wedge issue. Trump belittles Democrats, says asylum seekers look like they're 'fighting for the UFC' In 2019, the numbers don't look good for Trump. According to Gallup, 71% of Jewish respondents disapprove of the president. In 2018, only 16% of American Jews identified as Republicans. In the 2018 midterms, 79% of American Jewish voters supported Democratic candidates. In other words, what the Conservative Political Action Conference has called ""Jexodus"" isn't likely to happen. Read More Most American Jewish voters remain liberal. They don't support the reactionary agenda that President Trump has championed. For instance, a sizable majority of American Jews hold liberal views about immigration. As a community that has spent much of its history seeking safe harbor and fleeing persecution -- a history that Jews will be talking about in their homes over the upcoming Passover seders -- they are not on board with the President's efforts to build border walls and shut down the asylum seekers. There is good reason why all of the Jews currently serving in the Senate are Democrats and only two of the Jewish Representatives are Republican. The pre parties have more work to do to fight anti-Semitism When it comes to Israel, polls from the American Jewish Committee have shown that most American Jews don't support Prime Minister Netanyahu's positions on the conflict with Palestinians. By large numbers, American Jews continue to support a two-state solution, they want to curtail settlements, and they believe in the peace process. The American Jewish Committee found that only 34% of American Jews support how Trump is handling American-Israeli relations. The notion that being ""pro-Israel"" means endorsing the Netanyahu government is a myth propagated by the right, one which most American Jewish voters don't agree with. To be sure, President Trump's hardline rhetoric about the current government of Israel does play with some minority parts of the American Jewish community. The President has also been exploiting concerns that exist over the rhetoric used by Congresswoman Omar and other progressives in their criticism of AIPAC, such as her tweeting out ""All About the Benjamins"" and making statements that, some believed, implied Jews have a dual loyalty to the United States and Israel. Although Omar apologized for this and other issues, Democrats have not been able to quell the concerns about renewed anti-Semitism on the left. But as the President finds some sympathetic audiences with his cynical deployment of the issue, he has not been able to grow support within the GOP. Then there is President Trump himself. There is now a long and well-documented record of his willingness to use anti-Semitic tropes and images, even as he claims to be the best President for American Jews. He has retweeted out anti-Semitic imagery on several occasions, while he has consistently refused to come down hard on white nationalist forces within the United States who are the champions of the most lethal forms of anti-Jewish sentiment. The infamous neo-Nazis at Charlottesville chanted ""The Jews Will Not Replace Us!"" He has joked about Jews enjoying bargaining and money. Even in the speech to the Jewish Republicans, he employed the dual loyalty rhetoric that Republicans have been deriding with Congresswoman Omar when he spoke about ""your Prime Minister."" Indeed, the entire notion that American Jewish voters can be won over simply through hardline positions about Israel plays directly into the worst stereotypes about the community. The hypocritical way in which he manipulates this issue is an insult to voters. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Despite his predictions, President Trump is actually one of the worst things to happen to Republicans who have been working to increase their hold on the American Jewish electorate. Putting aside his own bluster, he has done a great deal to isolate, marginalize and even scare American Jewish voters who might have been giving some thought to switching their historic allegiance from the party of Franklin Roosevelt. If they think that large numbers are going to be bolting to the party of Trump, they should take a harder look at the President's actual record."
Europe's best sleeper trains,www.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/best-european-sleeper-trains/index.html,"The best European sleeper trains Francesca Street, 26 Pictures (CNN) ‚Äî As the train pulls out of the station, you slowly drift off to sleep. Several hours later, you wake up in another country, exciting new scenes speeding past the windows. A world away from the experience of a stressful budget flight, you arrive refreshed and ready to discover a new destination . Welcome on board the sleeper train service. Once a stalwart of international travel , sleeper trains were the go-to for travelers crisscrossing Europe in the mid to late 20th century. In more recent years, thanks to the ease and price of air travel, there have been far fewer trains whisking sleeping passengers from country to country through the night. But things are changing -- for one, sleeper train travel comes hand-in-hand with connotations of romance and adventure -- and we live in an era where collecting experiences is covetable travel currency. Plus, there's the eco-impact -- carbon footprints of train travel are way lower than flying. ""They've always had a romance,"" says train travel expert Mark Smith, founder of popular train website The Man in Seat 61 . ""Sometimes the romance is built up -- even the romance of the Orient Express has been exaggerated beyond the reality. ""But, of course, romance is not something you buy, it's something that happens. It's in the eyes of the beholder, as it were."" Intrigued? These are some of the sleeper services you can currently hop on to traverse Europe. Caledonian Sleeper -- London, England to Fort William, Scotland The Calendonian Sleeper whisks passengers from London to Scotland. Courtesy Caledonian Sleeper It's only an hour flight from London to Scotland 's main cities -- including cultural hub Glasgow and beautiful capital Edinburgh. But why battle airport security at Heathrow when you could fall asleep in the bustling city center of London and awaken on Rannoch Moor, surrounded by spectacular Scottish scenery? ""You wake up at 30 miles an hour on a single track in the middle of the West Highlands, with deer bounding away from the train,"" says Smith. l The romance of the Scottish sleeper train The Man in Seat 61 says the Caledonian Sleeper is his favorite sleeper train, spotlighting those stunning views, plus the addition of a lounge car. There are two trains that depart London nightly and both split to take passengers to their various destinations. Depending on the route you pick, you can head to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Aberdeen, Fort William, Perth or Aviemore. The Inverness train also makes stops at Gleneagles, home to golf and whisky -- and the Fort William service includes a stop off at Corrour, known as the UK's most remote station. These luxury suites will be introduced on the Caledonian Sleeper later in 2019. Courtesy Caledonian Sleeper Traveling London to Fort William takes just shy of 8 hours. The Caledonian Sleeper is currently undergoing a makeover, with new trains set to replace the current carriages -- built in the 1980s -- in summer 2019. They will include Caledonian Double Rooms with an en-suite toilet and shower and double bed. Club Rooms are the next ring down, with en-suite toilet and shower. Those staying in Club Room or Caledonian Double will have access to the club car. There are also classic rooms and comfort seats.

If you want to splash out, enjoy Grand Class and get an en suite too, plus free newspapers and use of the club lounge. One of the other advantages of sleeper train travel is arriving in the middle of the city center, in this case, Lisbon's beautiful Santa Apolonia Station. As Smith says, it's the savviest travelers who choose sleeper trains over budget flights: even if the journey takes longer -- and is potentially a little pricier -- it's a more economical use of time. ""Flying even a one hour flight ends up taking four hours -- by the time you get to the airport, you check in and you check out the other end, and so forth. So a sleeper train can save four daytime hours straight away,"" says the Man in Seat 61. Thello sleeper train -- from Paris, France to Rome, Italy Thello will take you from Paris to Venice and back. Courtesy Giuseppe Senese Leave Paris Gare de Lyon in the evening, speed through the Italian countryside, stop in chic Milan and wake up to views of gondolas and watery streets in Venice. On board this Thello service , there's no regular seats -- you'll either be in a sleeping berth or a couchette car that sleeps four to six people. There's a premium cabin option, which gives you maximum privacy and access to a shower. The service also has a waiter service restaurant car, but the Man in Seat 61 clarifies that it's not exactly Orient Express level. Sleeper trains are fun for all the family. Courtesy mostras.net The best hotels in Venice from luxury to budget Sometimes, Smith says, it's preferable to bring your own snacks. ""It's much better to bring a bottle that you choose yourself and then crack it open -- have a midnight feast."" One of his other top tips is picking a good restaurant near your departure station: ""Researching a good restaurant can often fill the waiting time before a late night sleeper departure -- and it gives you somewhere to wait and it just transforms that part of the experience."" Tolstoy -- Helsinki, Finland to Moscow, Russia There's a variety of sleeper options on Russian Railways overnight trains. Courtesy Russian Railways The Russian Railways Tolstoy service takes you from Helsinki in Finland to Moscow in Russia, with a variety of sleeping options -- from a second class four-berth sleeper to a deluxe business class sleeper with en suite. The restaurant car is kitted out in rich red curtains and seating, which is an experience. Oh, and for added drama -- the train is named after Russia's most famous writer, Leo Tolstoy. The train takes roughly 15 hours to cross Northern Europe.

Still, you can currently catch the French intercit√©s de nuit train to the city of Toulouse and picturesque Latour de Carol. You can also depart the train at Rodez and Briancon, in the Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur region. There's the budget reclining seat option, six-bed couchette choice or four-bed sleeper. For Smith, this journey was his first ever sleeper train experience, on a high school French exchange. The students were sleeping in couchettes, but he sneaked a look inside the sleeping cars: ""I thought, 'This Is the way I want to travel in future,'"" recalls Smith. ""So when I did my first Interrail a couple of years later, I splurged on paying for a proper bed in the sleeper -- and I have never really looked back."" On board, expect a sleeping bag rather than blanket. You also get a bottle of water, ear plugs and tissues, which sets you up nicely for the night. Related content Russian Railways -- Moscow, Russia to Nice, France Some of the sleeper compartments on this train are pretty swanky. Courtesy Russian Railways Some of the journeys on this list are fairly short and sweet, but this Russian Railways train travels an incredible 2,164 miles across the European continent, from Paris to Moscow. It's one of the longest passenger trains in Europe -- and also makes stops in Berlin, Germany and Warsaw, Poland. The train's a spiritual successor to the Nord Express, recognizable from its striking Art Deco posters. This iconic service operated until the World War II, stopping off at cities across Eastern Europe before terminating in Russia. There's a restaurant car on board too. Courtesy Russian Railways Trans-Siberian railway: Alternative routes and other secrets The cars are pretty modern by sleeper train standards. As you might expect for a journey of this length, there's a restaurant car -- and for added excitement it switches halfway through the journey. For the first part it's a Polish restaurant car. When the train reaches Brest, a Russian dining car is added. If you really want to splash out, you can travel in a VIP First Class deluxe sleeper -- which Smith muses is probably for Russian oligarchs. It's got an en suite shower and toilet, flat-screen-TV and a hot breakfast included. Related content Santa Claus Express -- Helsinki, Finland to Rovaniemi, Finland When a train's called the Santa Claus Express , you know it's going to be an exciting experience. This double-decker train travels north into a snowy winter wonderland, across Scandinavia from Helsinki, Finland to Lapland -- taking less than 15 hours. On board, there's a restaurant car and you can opt for the economy seat, a double sleeper, single sleeper or a double/single sleeper with private bathroom. Hurtling through the snowy scenes is an unforgettable experience and the double-decker views offer incredible views -- you might even spot the Northern Lights.

That's a lot of countries, so the Nightjet logo is one of the most omnipresent on continental European train stations. According to Smith, that's largely because the Austrian train service has made the sleeper trains economically viable. ""The Austrians have worked out a way to run sleeper trains that makes economic sense and they've got the political -- with a small 'p' -- will to do so,"" he says. The train expert also explains sleeper trains can only run successfully when track access fees are reasonable. Nightjet operates on train tracks spanning Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.

Telsa is helping Fiat Chrysler meet emissions targets - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Charles Riley,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/tesla-fiat-chrysler-eu-emissions/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Tesla is selling emissions credits to Fiat Chrysler as the Italian automaker tries to avoid steep EU fines on carmakers who fail to meet tough new pollution standards.
The companies have formed an ""open pool"" that allows their fleets to be counted together under new rules that restrict emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to documents published by the European Union. The auto industry needs to slash CO2 emissions of vehicles sold in Europe by 25% to meet the aggressive caps by 2021, according to UBS. The Swiss bank's analysts estimate that will reduce EU carmaker profits by ‚Ç¨7.4 billion ($8.3 billion) combined. Companies that are investing heavily in hybrid or electric vehicle technology, such as Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) , are well positioned to meet the new standards. Laggards will need to find other ways of avoiding fines. London gets world's first 24-hour air pollution charge zone UBS analysts warned last week that Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) was the automaker with the ""highest risk of not meeting the target."" Read More ""Fiat Chrysler is facing the biggest challenges to comply with CO2 targets due to a period of under-investment in electrification,"" the UBS analysts wrote, adding that it's ""starting almost from scratch."" Joining forces with Tesla ( TSLA ) was one way for the company to reduce the risk of fines. Japanese automakers Toyota ( TM ) and Mazda ( MZDAF ) have also formed a pool. EU targets Fiat Chrysler said Monday that EU rules allowing carmakers to join forces to meet fleet CO2 targets provide ""flexibility to deliver products our customers are willing to buy while managing compliance."" ""The whole point of a CO2 credit market is to leverage the most cost-effective ways to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in the market,"" the company said in a statement. The Financial Times, which was first to report the arrangement , said that Fiat Chrysler was paying Tesla ( TSLA ) hundreds of millions of euros for its emissions credits. Fiat Chrysler did not comment Monday on the financial details. EU accuses German carmakers of colluding to delay clean air technology It's not the first time that Tesla has received a financial windfall from its traditional competitors. The company brought in millions of dollars earlier this decade by selling credits tied to its electric cars in the United States, where carmakers were struggling to meet sales targets for zero-emissions vehicles. Tesla could use the cash infusion from Fiat Chrysler. It reported a sharp drop in deliveries during the first quarter, heightening concerns about its ability to pay down its sizable debts. In March, Tesla paid off a $920 million bond that took a big chunk out of the $3.7 billion in cash it had on hand at the start of the quarter. That followed a $230 million payment the company made in November. Its next big payment is a $566 million debt issue that is due in November, followed by another $1.4 billion in notes that is due in two years."

J√∂rg Meuthen, co-president of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, was at the meeting, along with Olli Kotro, head of the Finns Party (ECR), and Anders Vistisen from the Danish People's Party. 'Natural allies' Ahead of the conference, Salvini told Italian newspaper La Stampa, ""We share the same objectives, the same ideals and values. We are natural allies."" Those objectives center on Salvini's hardline approach to migration from North Africa. In June 2018, Salvini made good on a campaign promise to close Italy's ports -- which had seen more than 600,000 migrants and refugees enter the country since 2012 -- to rescue boats. ""The goal is not to redistribute those who enter Europe clandestinely,"" Salvini said. ""We have a platform to protect our borders and national identities."" Trumpesque alt-right nationalism must be defeated in Europe Among the alliance's aims is a plan to bolster the European Union's border protection agency, Frontex, by as many as 10,000 people. ""Europe is lacking behind on both national security and immigration. European Union security must have a higher priority than in the past,"" Vistisen from the Danish People's Party said during the meeting. Steve Bannon, U.S. President Donald Trump's former White House chief strategist, has been vocal in his support for Salvini, meeting him in Italy last September. On a recent trip to Rome, Bannon said Italy was especially important in the global power struggle. ""It's the center of the universe because of, really, the rise of Salvini and what Salvini means for Europe and what he means as a political figure for the world,"" Bannon told journalists at a press conference in Rome last month. Bannon is one of the founders of a group he calls The Movement, a far-right organization based in Brussels that provides support to European right-wing nationalist parties, including Salvini's party. Salvini has kept his distance -- at least in public -- but often uses the same rhetoric as Bannon against globalists, Brussels and the ""elite."" Bannon said all eyes were on the European elections, and on Salvini and other European nationalist parties' possible victory. ""I just think there is real momentum,"" he told CNN, following strong performances by right-wing parties in southern Italy and the Netherlands. Populist momentum There is ""real momentum on the populist nationalist side, a sovereignty movement,"" Bannon said. ""I think people are coming to this cause and I think it is going to have tremendous support."" Salvini's party, the League (formerly known as the Northern League), is already part of the ENF coalition in the European Parliament. But Salvini and other members are hoping to increase their number of seats to give them a greater voice in European affairs. JUST WATCHED Comment: Europe on the ropes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Comment: Europe on the ropes 02:05 The League has enjoyed considerable success in recent regional elections in Italy; opinion polls suggest it has a lead over its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S). In recent polls, Salvini's party has not run with the Five Star Movement, headed by the party's charismatic 32-year-old leader, Luigi Di Maio, who shares the title of Deputy Prime Minister and is also Italy's Economic Development and Labor Minister. Nadia Urbinati, a political science professor at Columbia University, says part of Salvini's success has been his visible role as Italy's Interior Minister, which allows him to campaign while on the job -- particularly on the issues of migration and national security. ""He can strengthen his popularity on immigrants and by using arguments of security in order to appear he is acting in favor of the Italian public,"" Urbinati says. ""So, showing himself that he is doing his politics is quick, easy and costless."" The League's regional election campaign focused on nationalist, populist and anti-migrant rhetoric. Salvini has spearheaded a series of anti-immigrant policies and has implemented law and order measures reminiscent of Italy's fascist past, such as dismantling migrant and Roma camps."
Timmothy Pitzen's dad hopes news about his missing son creates new leads in the case - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Joe Sterling, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/timmothy-pitzen-case/index.html,"(CNN) Reports that missing boy Timmothy Pitzen had turned up nearly eight years after he disappeared proved to be a cruel hoax.
But James Pitzen, the boy's father, says a week's fresh coverage of the mystery surrounding his son's 2011 disappearance could turn out to have a silver lining. ""Exposure helps get his face back out there,"" he told NBC News in an interview aired this weekend. ""Get a description of what he may look like at this time out."" James Pitzen, Timmothy Pitzen's father The father said he believes his son, who would be around 14, is probably around 145 or 150 pounds and between 5 feet 10 inches and 6 feet 3 inches tall. Last week, a man in Kentucky said he was Timmothy and his claim raised hopes that the boy, who vanished at age 6, had finally been found. Read More But a DNA test showed that the man, Brian Rini of Medina, Ohio,was an imposter. Rini faces charges of making false statements to federal agents and, if convicted, could be sentenced to up to eight years in prison. But James Pitzen said he still believes his son is ""alive somewhere. I know he is."" ""He's probably in the middle of nowhere being homeschooled someplace,"" Pitzen said. ""Away from the media and TVs and new technology."" In May 2011, when Timmothy was 6, his mother Amy Fry-Pitzen checked him out of his elementary school. They went on a road trip, stopping at a zoo and a Wisconsin water park. Where's the real Timmothy Pitzen? A week of hope and heartbreak leaves many questions unanswered Three days later, the mother's body was found in a hotel room in Rockford, Illinois, about 73 miles northwest of Aurora. She had died by suicide, leaving behind a note that said her son was with people who love him. ""You'll never find him,"" the note said. ""I lost my whole family that day,' James Pitzen said. Timmothy's aunt Kara Jacobs said the news of the hoax was ""like reliving that day all over again"" and she said Timmothy's father is devastated once again."" But the father told NBC he won't lose hope. ""As soon as you give up hope, then what should I do declare him dead? I'm not going to do that."""
Syria dserves to live - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Mouaz al-Khatib,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/khatib-syria-deserves-to-live/index.html,"Mouaz al-Khatib is founding and former president of the Syrian National Coalition and a former imam of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinions on CNN.
(CNN) It's not easy to defuse a crisis complicated by tens of thousands of foreign fighters , many affiliated with ISIS , over 100,000 Iranian-sponsored militiamen , and the armies and intelligence agencies of myriad states . Nor can the horrific humanitarian crises plaguing many Syrian refugee and internally displaced persons camps , where aid gets siphoned off and manipulated by the Assad regime, be easily managed. One trembles to hear every few days of children freezing to death and parents burning themselves or killing their children out of humiliation, poverty, and hunger .
Score-settling between Iran and Israel, Turkey and the Gulf, and the US and Russia stands to come at an inestimable cost for Syrian civilians. As bad as that already is, the clashing is not limited to geopolitics. The first shots of the war over reconstruction spoils have already been fired; over time, their blasts could drown out even the din of Russia's military assault on civilian-packed Idlib , already underway. Mouaz al-Khatib, founding president of the Syrian National Coalition Inside Syria, unbearable misery is omnipresent nationwide amid rising opioid addiction, high crime rates, and a pervasive lack of security. A recent sobering study found that over 40% of Syrian refugee children no do not attend school. But while previous diplomatic and political initiatives have failed to end Syria's suffering, history offers a potential roadmap. The Rwandan , Bosnian , and even Polish experiences could inspire a reasonable solution for Syria: Poland-style roundtable talks bringing together ruling elites and opposition and grassroots leaders, for example, have not been seriously explored but should be considered. Read More ISIS has lost its final stronghold in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces says Syria is one mighty tragedy, but tragedies are bound to eventually end. Mustering the international political will for a solution can nudge the Syrian tragedy closer to a solution. One way to do that is through the adoption of a pre-transitional phase centered on a pre-transitional presidential council to be established by mutual consensus. The six-member PTPC could include President Bashar al-Assad, but would acquire his powers within a year. By the end of the established time-frame, Assad would be completely transitioned out, a condition without which the bloodletting would not stop. Such a negotiated council could lay the groundwork for stabilization by releasing political detainees, issuing a general amnesty, and ensuring a proper environment for political talks. While accommodating Russian fears about total state collapse, it would restructure the military and intelligence agencies. Municipal elections, followed by parliamentary elections under international monitoring, could follow, allowing Syrians to finally choose a new constitution. A new parliament could elect a new president, who would dissolve the pre-transitional council and establish a transitional justice process, to help Syria confront crimes committed during the war, and a truth and reconciliation commission to pave the way for a new dawn for Syria. Why would Assad agree to any of this? He probably would not, but his sponsors, especially Russia, have an interest in pressuring him to get on board with such a face-saving initiative before Syria completely disintegrates and all end up losing. I know from my own outreach that pressure could also come from within the regime. If encouraged, goaded, and offered a credible alternative, the scale of the Syrian catastrophe may yet prompt leaders within the regime to overcome their fear of meeting with opposition leaders for frank discussions in search of a common way out before their whole ship goes down. Equally important, such an initiative has the potential to galvanize grassroots support across the Syrian divide and bring Syrians from across the spectrum together. Journey to safety was more terrifying than Aleppo, activists say The failure of all other avenues means a path like this one could succeed. Previous diplomatic proposals, including the tortured Geneva process, have failed to bridge the gulf between conference rooms and the crushing realities on the ground. Eight years on, a political solution does not seem near; rather than focusing on a governing body to transition Syria away from dictatorship, Syrians are being distracted by a constitution-drafting committee that will do nothing to stanch the bleeding. Some UN envoys to Syria have performed disgracefully , operating as little more than mail carriers without any creativity, and humoring the states that dominate the war-torn country without a credible proposal to see Syrians through their ordeal. Meanwhile, Syria slips away. The Assad regime is fast decaying. Pro-regime social media sites clearly show the extent of frustration among regime loyalists on whose behalf the regime declared a hollow ""victory"" only to lose its own supporters by failing to provide the most basic services . Things do not look better in opposition-controlled areas, either, where civilian-run councils are hobbled by lack of support and burgeoning military factions -- greedy for money and power. These treacherous conditions have recently prompted the head of the Syrian Opposition Interim Government, Dr. Jawad Abu Hatab, to tender his resignation. Gasping for life: Syria's merciless war on its own children While maintaining unfettered levels of military, diplomatic, and political support to Assad, the Russians have placed before the Syrian political opposition the daunting challenge of competing in presidential elections two years away, a suggestion I've heard in conversations with senior Russian officials. The Syrian opposition, in the meantime, preoccupies itself by jostling over tiny crumbs of ""power"" they hope to gain from future unempowered positions, with many opposition groups in the Astana and Sochi conferences operating more as expressions of regional agendas than as a national Syrian project. All competing powers are seeking to turn a catastrophe to their advantage with no regard for the Syrian people. Russia seeks to reassert itself on the world stage as a superpower and to build up its influence in the Middle East; the Iranians are playing a long game to reach the Mediterranean by entrenching themselves politically and socially in Syria ; the Israelis lobby tirelessly for recognition of their annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights; Turkey seeks control over northern Syria fearing Kurdish separatism; the Kurds seek an independent entity; and the United States seeks continued military presence. Syria has become a cauldron for strategic conflicts pitting state and sub-state actors with competing interests against each other. The bill is footed by Syrians. But this does not have to be Syria's kismet. Top US general refutes report that military could keep nearly 1,000 US troops in Syria Such an approach, to move toward a new government following historical models of conflict resolution and post-conflict transition, based on intra-Syrian outreach and communication, buttressed by coercive international diplomacy, especially by the United States and Russia, could bring Syria back to life from its dying gasps. A credible road map is the only guarantee for arresting state collapse, stopping the brain drain and capital flight, and encouraging Syrians to return to help rebuild their country. Neither Bashar al-Assad's recent speech that all is well in Syria, nor the unceremonious visit to Iran that was arranged for him will keep Syria from going down an abyss spawned by fifty years of fascist rule. Many countries have come apart only to return much stronger, their people born anew thanks to the lessons they learned from their bitter experiences. The Syrian people are known for their entrepreneurship and vim and vigor; they certainly deserve to see their country return to life. Getting there will not be easy, but it is not mission impossible."
ULEZ: London gets world's first 24-hour air pollution charge zone - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/ulez-london-emissions-scli-intl-gbr/index.html,"London (CNN Business) London is the first city in the world to implement a 24-hour, seven day a week Ultra Low Emission Zone, inside which vehicles will have to meet tough emissions standards or face a charge.
Monday's introduction of the zone, known as the ULEZ, aims to reduce toxic air pollution and protect public health, according to a press release from the office of Sadiq Khan, mayor of London. Vehicles are responsible for around half of harmful nitrogen oxide air emissions in the British capital, contributing to a toxic air health crisis that increases the risk of asthma, cancer and dementia as well as causing thousands of premature deaths every year, the release says. ""This is a landmark day for our city. Our toxic air is an invisible killer responsible for one of the biggest national health emergencies of our generation,"" Khan said in the statement. ""The ULEZ is the centerpiece of our plans to clean up London's air -- the boldest plans of any city on the planet, and the eyes of the world are on us."" Read More Under new rules introduced April 8, polluting vehicles will be discouraged from entering the ULEZ thanks to a daily charge of ¬£12.50 (around $16) for some cars, vans and motorbikes and ¬£100 ($130) for trucks, buses and coaches. The zone will cover the same area as the existing Congestion Charge -- collected from drivers in the city center -- until 2021, when it will be expanded to cover the area between the major orbital roads known as the North and South Circular. Drivers can check whether their vehicle meets ULEZ emission standards using an online tool provided by travel authority Transport for London. The ULEZ is the next stage in a plan to clean up London's air, which started with the so-called T-charge -- an extra charge for highly polluting vehicles in the city center -- introduced in February 2017. Since then, the number of vehicles entering the zone has fallen by around 11,000 per day, according to official figures, and there has been a 55% increase in emissions-compliant vehicles in the zone. London's famous red bus fleet is also being updated as part of these efforts, and all 9,200 vehicles will meet or exceed ULEZ standards by October 2020, according to the mayor's office. As things stand, some 2 million Londoners live in areas where nitrogen dioxide levels are above legal limits set by the European Union. However, these measures will ensure that air pollution will meet legal requirements in six years, according to an analysis by academics at King's College London. The toxic air health crisis causes thousands of premature deaths per year, the Mayor of London said. Air pollution disproportionately affects less wealthy city dwellers, according to Khan. ""This is also about social justice -- people in the most deprived parts of London, who are least likely to own a car, suffer the worst effects of harmful air pollution."" And young children will also see major health benefits. ""Air pollution can have major health implications on the developing child, with early exposure proven to increase the risk of asthma and lung infections, and these can be life-threatening,"" said Professor Jonathan Grigg of the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health in the press release. London's low-emission zone ineffective in improving child lung health, study says However, a November 2018 study questioned the effectiveness of low-emission zones introduced in 2008, finding no evidence of a decline in the number of children with reduced lung capacities or asthmatic symptoms since the implementation of the low emission zones in London. The authors called for more ambitious control measures to improve childhood respiratory health. And Daniela Fecht -- a lecturer in geospatial health at Imperial College London, who worked on a study looking at asthma and air pollution in the city on behalf of the Greater London Authority -- told CNN the ULEZ is expected to bring benefits, but results should be closely monitored. ""The ULEZ is a very good initiative which is needed to bring down traffic-related air pollution levels in London,"" Fecht said in an email. ""The effectiveness will have to be carefully evaluated as previous schemes both in London and internationally did not bring down air pollution concentrations as much as expected due to various factors."" Fecht says she believes the benefits will be felt even by those who do not live or spend a lot of time in the ULEZ, particularly vulnerable populations such as children going to school in central London; individuals with pre-existing health conditions that are worsened by air pollution; and people working, traveling through or exercising in inner London. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo are also working on a congestion pricing model that aims to reduce traffic and fund improvements to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority public transportation network. Details were announced in late February."
Pinterest could be worth nearly $12 billion according to IPO filing - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/investing/pinterest-ipo/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Pinterest wants to sell its shares at between $15 and $17 when it goes public. That could value the company at nearly $12 billion.
Still, that is less than some recent private valuations of the company. The IPO by Pinterest would follow the recent public offering by ride-hailing service Lyft ( LYFT ) . Several other privately held start-ups worth at least $1 billion are also preparing offerings later this year, including Uber, Slack and Postmates. Pinterest plans to sell 86.3 million shares as part of its initial offering, which would raise between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Pinterest files to go public. Its not-so-secret weapon: Moms The company was founded in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra, the last of whom parted ways with the company early in its history. Over the years, Pinterest has tried to evolve from being a digital scrapbooking service to a visual discovery tool, positioning it as a potential competitor to products like Google Search. Read More More than 250 million people now use Pinterest each month to bookmark or ""pin"" images ranging from recipes to home designs. While it's an impressive figure by many standards, it falls well behind other social platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which measure their audience in billions. Unlike Facebook ( FB ) , Twitter ( TWTR ) and Snapchat, Pinterest is not disclosing the number of people who use its service on a daily basis, which could raise concerns about user engagement. ""We do not anticipate that most of our users will become daily active users,"" the company said in its IPO prospectus. Pinterest posted $766 million in sales last year, an increase of 60% from the year prior, fueled by its advertising business. But like many other start-ups planning IPOs, it has never reported a profit. It lost $63 million last year, though that was smaller than earlier annual losses. It's also considerably less than $911 million and $1.8 billion lost last year by Lyft and Uber, respectively. This IPO market is nothing like late 1990s craziness Lyft ( LYFT ) went public on March 29 with an IPO price of $72 , but it has struggled to remain above that price many days since the first trade. It's relative weak early performance may have put a damper on the initial pricing range offered by Pinterest. ""It didn't help,"" said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. The mixed reception to Lyft's Wall Street debut ""showed that public investors are somewhat cautious toward highly valued, unprofitable companies."" Pinterest expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker ""PINS."""

"Meghan, Harry and the royal baby's US tax dilemma - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Max Foster,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/uk/meghan-harry-royal-baby-us-tax-intl-gbr/index.html,"London (CNN) As first-time parents-to-be, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have plenty to worry about already -- but thanks to the US tax system, there could be one more thing keeping Harry and Meghan and their new baby awake at night.
Since the royal couple announced their pregnancy last October, all eyes have been on Meghan and her emerging bump -- and it seems even the palace accountants are taking interest. That's because as US citizens, both Meghan and her baby -- who will be seventh in line to the British throne -- will be liable to pay US taxes, which could potentially open up the notoriously private royal accounts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Meghan and Harry's royal baby: What we know so far ""The United States has -- unique among nations -- a citizenship-based taxation (system), so as long as Meghan is a citizen of the United States she is taxed,"" explained David Treitel, the founder of American Tax Returns Ltd., which provides taxation advice to US expats. The law means US tax inspectors could scrutinize Harry and Meghan's royal wealth, and the income of their newborn child. Read More ""The baby is being born to a United States citizen and that baby, little boy or girl, who comes along in the next few weeks, will automatically be a citizen of the United States simply because her mother is,"" Treitel told CNN. ""There is no other precedent of anybody else in the Royal Family who's been American. So nobody else has ever faced this circumstance before."" Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, may face scrutiny from US tax inspectors. As a US citizen, regardless of where she lives, Meghan will be obliged to file a US tax return and to report any foreign accounts, assets over $200,000 and gifts valued more than $15,797 ""regardless of whether it is actually in your possession,"" according to the IRS. Meghan may have to declare items like the wedding ring gifted by the Queen from a nugget of Welsh gold from the Royal Collection, the priceless diamond in her engagement ring taken from Princess Diana's world famous jewelry collection, wedding presents from international royalty and A-list friends. Then there's the biggest gift of all -- the multi-million-dollar newly renovated home , Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor where the couple got married. ""The Queen has got to sit there and her advisers have to sit there thinking: well if I lend Meghan a tiara, if I have the baby use a beautiful silver rattle that was used by Queen Victoria, how much is that worth? What's the value of it? How much is to be reported to the States? It's a tough question, it's not easy,"" Treitel said. Meghan may have to declare valuable gifts such as her wedding and engagement rings. Not only will Meghan have to declare gifts but if she considers selling any of them, she would be taxed on any rise in their value -- and with her name attached to them, the jump in value is likely to be great. While all of this could create a big tax headache for the royal couple, it won't have come as a surprise. Treitel believes Harry and Meghan will have been considering potential tax troubles, ""long before they were married, when they were dating, just in case a baby came along because they knew if they had a child that the baby would be American.""

Hide Caption 21 of 21 The only way for Meghan to avoid paying US taxes would be to renounce her US citizenship once she becomes a British citizen. However, even if she does so, the couple's baby will still be liable for US taxes until the age of 18. According to the US Department of State , in the case of the royal baby, he or she will acquire US citizenship because s/he was born in wedlock abroad to an American citizen who has lived in the US for a period of five years, at least two of which were after the age of 14. That means that throughout the child's life, he or she will also have their assets and income exposed to US taxes -- including any ""unearned income"" over $2,100 -- until they are 18 years old, and have the opportunity to renounce their citizenship, if they choose to do so. Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, set up Instagram account Treitel believes that as soon as the royal baby is born, he or she will inherit investments which will generate income that will be reportable and taxable in the US. ""One would expect because the Queen comes from a wealthy family, Diana came from a wealthy family, we would expect that they've put aside some investments for future generations, presumably to future unnamed children and grandchildren and so on,"" Treitel explained. To add to this, the baby will likely receive a trust fund that enables the Royal Family to pass money down the royal line. According to Treitel, this would fit the description of a foreign trust, wherein Americans receive money from a trust fund set up abroad, and therefore can be taxed in the US.

How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-last-days-dhs/index.html,"(CNN) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left Washington last Sunday for what was supposed to be a week-long trip to Europe. While there, Nielsen planned to discuss cybersecurity and terror threats with senior UK and Swedish government officials, and attend a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris -- providing her a temporary respite from the tense situation at the US Southern border, where a recent rise in migrant apprehensions had drawn the intense ire of President Donald Trump.
Instead, the trip proved to be a miscalculation on her part, one that began a week-long descent into limbo for Nielsen that ended with her abrupt resignation on Sunday evening after meeting with Trump in the White House. Nielsen did not resign willingly, a person close to her told CNN, but was under pressure to do so. Nor did she fight or plead to keep her job, the source said. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster exposes Trump's immigration crisis The resignation ends months of speculation over her possible departure. It also demonstrates the power of immigration hardliners inside the White House, including national security adviser John Bolton and senior adviser Stephen Miller, who, despite her defense of the administration's controversial policies, still deemed Nielsen insufficiently tough when it came to stemming the flow of migrants to the border. According to multiple administration officials, over the past few months it had become clear to many inside the White House that Nielsen had few allies left in the West Wing, particularly following last year's departure of chief of staff John Kelly, widely seen as her biggest advocate in the White House. Read More Nielsen butted heads with Kelly's replacement Mick Mulvaney. Miller openly complained about her to the President. She was also a target of Bolton's, according to four people familiar with their relationship. Bolton often criticized Nielsen for how she was handling immigration issues and had no hesitation about expressing his reservations openly in front of President Trump. Nielsen had no ally in the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner either, who has become more involved in immigration talks recently, according to one administration official. In a sense, Nielsen had become an island unto herself inside the West Wing, and the people who talk to Trump the most were openly against her. By early Sunday, Nielsen knew how the day would likely go and that she would likely be forced to resign, according to a source familiar with her thinking. Shortened Trip In the weeks leading up to her Europe trip, Nielsen had been increasingly on thin ice in the eyes of the President. She apparently did not realize how tenuous her standing was when she left for Europe, but once there quickly realized her mistake and abruptly returned after her first day of meetings in London. Nielsen hastily left to travel to the US southern border, where she visited three border regions, ending at a stop in Calexico, California, to join the President. Scramble inside the West Wing over Trump's threat to close the border During the week, Nielsen did interviews -- including on CNN -- to try and improve the President's souring view of her, a source close to Nielsen said, but to little avail. Last week, she also convened an emergency call with members of Trump's Cabinet to discuss migration at the border. ""We are going to treat it as if we have been hit by a Cat 5 hurricane,"" Nielsen said on the call, a participant told CNN. The call took White House officials by surprise, according to a person familiar with the matter. Neither Miller nor Trump cared for Nielsen's decision to treat the situation at the border as a hurricane, the person said. ""People were caught off guard"" by the Thursday call, they added. It appears Miller did not know what Nielsen was up to, a major problem according to this person. At the end of the day, the source said, Nielsen could not make Trump happy with her performance on the border. This source said Trump might as well name Miller as the next DHS secretary. ""He's the one driving the policy,"" the source added. Miller was also behind the sudden withdrawal of the nomination of Ron Vitiello for director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which caught both Congress and the Department of Homeland Security by surprise. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination was pulled, a person familiar with the news said. Nielsen's resignation also follows plans to cut aid to some Central American countries, marking a sudden reversal after Nielsen had, days earlier, visited Honduras to sign a regional compact agreement with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Tenuous relationship Trump hired Nielsen as DHS secretary, based on a strong recommendation from his former chief of staff John Kelly, but the President was rarely happy with her, a source told CNN. Despite Trump's displeasure, she remained in place thanks to Kelly's ability to divert some of Trump's anger over immigration away from her and onto others, like former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to one source. There was also no clear replacement lined up in the event of Nielsen's departure. A key moment came in May 2018, when Trump and Nielsen got into a lengthy, heated argument during a Cabinet meeting focused on immigration. Trump was furious with Nielsen, telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground, citing the law in certain instances, the source said. Nielsen increasingly pushed back when the President lashed out at her department for not doing more to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants. A senior administration official said that in recent days Trump and Nielsen had again clashed over the issue. He accused her of not doing her job, and she responded forcefully. Around the midterm elections in November, it was expected that Trump would ask Nielsen to resign. After the departure of Kelly as White House chief of staff, speculation increased that she would soon be following him out the door. But by last December, sources told CNN that Trump had warmed to Nielsen, at least temporarily easing the tension in an explosive relationship that was once seen as untenable. Trump soon began praising her repeatedly behind closed doors, which surprised officials who were used to hearing his frequent criticism of her. ""People overplayed this idea that Gen. Kelly was her protector and that after she left the White House, she would leave,"" said a former DHS official. ""The very active and leading role that she took on immigration, re-established her with the President in ways that maybe when General Kelly was still there wasn't possible,"" added the former DHS official. But it wasn't enough to mend their relationship. And over the past three months, the surge of migrants continued to rise despite a slew of aggressive immigration policies. Child Separations Under Nielsen's leadership, thousands of families along the southern border were separated, sparking an uproar across the country last year. Though it was the result of a policy implemented last year by Sessions, Nielsen was often cast as the face of family separations, and endured withering criticism as a result. While frustrated, one of the reasons Nielsen decided to stick it out was to repair her image, a source familiar with her thinking told CNN. Incoming acting secretary of Homeland Security 'not an ideologue or fire breather' Still, that policy and others that make it harder for migrants to claim asylum appear to have done little to deter migrants from journeying to the US-Mexico border. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who is taking over DHS in an acting capacity, warned late last month that the US was on pace to encounter more than 100,000 migrants in March alone, making it ""the highest month since 2008."" Relief and exasperation A source familiar with Nielsen's thinking told CNN Nielsen is taking this as a relief. Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable"" with Trump ""becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. In California on Friday, a senior administration official tells CNN, Trump told border agents he wanted them to stop letting people cross the border, despite the fact that Central American asylum seekers according to US law can do so. It's unclear what Trump will look for in a permanent successor. For now, he has named McAleenan, the current CBP Commissioner, as acting secretary. Nielsen leaves behind a bare bones department that not only oversees immigration issues but also cybersecurity, infrastructure protection, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""We had a Secretary who knew cyber, knew FEMA, knew immigration,"" said an administration official. ""Now you'll get someone who knows border and immigration, but may not know the rest of DHS."" ""Secretary [Nielsen] worked harder than any cabinet person I know of, but probably had the most difficult job,"" the official added. Asked about the mood at DHS following Nielsen's resignation, one DHS official told CNN there was, ""some exasperation,"" adding that the department doesn't ""have enough depth"" to fill longtime vacancies. ""We are losing leadership faster than we can get it confirmed or even hired permanently,"" the official said, noting the number of acting officials in place heading units inside the department. DHS has had at least three positions filled by people in an acting capacity in senior roles. ""Now this is going to cause a massive move up the chain everywhere and it's rare an acting executive permanently selects anyone for those jobs so we'll be without permanent leaders that much longer."""
Warren Buffett has weighed in on what kind of CEO Wells Fargo should hire - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/investing/wells-fargo-warren-buffett-ceo/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Warren Buffett, Wells Fargo's largest and most powerful shareholder, doesn't want the troubled bank to hire a CEO from Wall Street.
Recruiting a Wall Street executive is ""automatically going to draw the ire of a significant percentage"" of the US Senate and House of Representatives, Buffett told the Financial Times in an interview that published on Sunday. ""And that's just not smart."" The comments from Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) owns nearly 10% of Wells Fargo, underline the deep political and reputational troubles at one of America's largest banks. Tim Sloan stepped down abruptly as CEO late last month after failing to stop the bank's two-and-a-half-year crisis. Wells Fargo ( WFC ) pledged to find an outsider to replace Sloan, a three-decade veteran of the bank who despite efforts to fix the bank was stained by its cultural problems. ""They just have to come from someplace [outside Wells] and they shouldn't come from Wall Street,"" Buffett told the FT. ""They probably shouldn't come from JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs."" Read More That would exclude several individuals who have emerged in press reports or analyst chatter as replacements for Sloan. For instance, former Goldman Sachs ( GS ) execs Gary Cohn and Harvey Schwartz have been linked in media reports to the Wells Fargo job. Both have denied interest. And analysts have floated the possibility of Marianne Lake, the well-respected CFO of JPMorgan ( JPM ) , as a replacement for Sloan. Lake would be the first woman to lead one of the big US banks. Wells Fargo's CEO is out. Here's how the bank can end its crisis Buffett's comments do not rule out the possibility that San Francisco-based Wells Fargo could turn to another rumored name: Richard Davis, the former CEO of US Bancorp ( USB ) . Davis doesn't come from Wall Street and he's even got roots in California. Wells Fargo declined to comment. Buffett continues to express optimism in Wells Fargo's underlying business despite the harm done by the fake-accounts scandal that erupted in September 2016. ""If you look at Wells, through this whole thing they're uncovering a whole lot of problems, but they aren't losing any customers to speak of,"" said Buffett, whose firm at the end of 2018 owned more than 400 million Wells Fargo shares currently worth about $21 billion. But Wells Fargo's business has been hurt by rising legal fees, a tarnished reputation and tough sanctions from federal regulators."
Peter Bergen: Kirstjen Nielsen had the toughest job in the government - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Peter Bergen,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/kirstjen-nielsen-had-toughest-job-in-government/index.html,"Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University and the author of ""Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad.""

(CNN) Running the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may be the toughest job in the federal government.
The DHS is a sprawling giant of 22 agencies that merged together in the wake of 9/11. The department's 240,000 employees handle everything from hurricanes to cyber security to border security to terrorism. As secretary of homeland security, a lot of things can happen on your watch: A botched response to a hurricane, or a serious cyber attack, or a major terrorist assault, or rising numbers of migrant families trying to cross the southern border. That's why in the past the top job at DHS has gone to a party elder skilled in politics, such as the former governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano, who served in the role during President Obama's first term or, the former governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, who served under George W. Bush. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen If it wasn't a skilled politician who took the top DHS job, it went to officials who had served at the highest levels of policy-making or the US military such as the Bush-appointed Michael Chertoff, who ran the criminal division at the Department of Justice where he oversaw the investigation of the 9/11 attacks. Read More During his second term Obama appointed Jeh Johnson , who had been the top lawyer at the Pentagon, while Trump appointed Gen. John Kelly, the former four-star general in charge of Southern Command, which is responsible for all US military operations in Latin America. Kirstjen Nielsen was neither a political heavyweight nor had she served in senior policy or military roles when she took over DHS. Nielsen had worked at the George W. Bush White House in a relatively junior role for three years and then had gone into the private sector for more than a decade. When Kelly was tapped by Trump to run DHS, Nielsen was appointed to be his ""sherpa"" during his confirmation process. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster exposes Trump's immigration crisis Kelly was impressed and made Nielsen his chief of staff at DHS. When Kelly moved to the White House to serve as Trump's chief of staff, Kelly brought Nielsen over to be his deputy. Kelly then pushed for Nielsen to take over DHS. Like so many other top Trump officials, Kelly was eventually forced out and in December he left the White House. Kelly had served as a heat shield for Nielsen, who sometimes bore the brunt of Trump's ire. The President blew up at her at a Cabinet meeting last spring because she was hesitant to sign a memo ordering migrant children to be separated from their parents, according to the New York Times. In October, Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton had a curse-laden shouting match at the White House about the rising number of migrant crossings at the southern border. Bolton told Kelly that Nielsen needed to do her job, which led to the heated argument in which Kelly defended his former deputy, according to CNN. With Kelly gone, Nielsen no longer had an advocate at the White House. She became Trump's scapegoat for the rising number of migrant families trying to cross the southern border in recent months. Many of those families are fleeing the violence and economic travail of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and there isn't much that any DHS secretary can do to try to stem the flow of migrants willing to leave everything behind to seek a better future in the United States.

Almost a century ago one such desperate migrant, Mary Anne MacLeod, left the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Europe, to find work as a servant in New York. Mary later married Fred Trump. They had five children, including a son named Donald. Trying to dissuade migrants such as Mary Anne MacLeod from leaving countries where they see no future to seek their fortune in the United States is likely beyond the ken of any secretary of homeland security."
"Senators' scathing letter to Juul demands answers about tactics targeting youth, ties to Big Tobacco - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Michael Nedelman, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/juul-senators/index.html,"(CNN) Leading e-cigarette company Juul Labs is under the microscope again, with 11 senators demanding answers from the company at the center of the youth vaping ""epidemic"" whose business practices have been shrouded in ""immense secrecy,"" the senators said in a letter to Juul on Monday.
They are requesting data, plans and other information from Juul related to its popularity among youth and its relationship with tobacco giant Altria, which invested nearly $13 billion in the company late last year. The Altria deal signaled that Juul is ""more interested in padding its profit margins than protecting our nation's children,"" says the letter, signed by Democrats including Dick Durbin of Illinois, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Juul ramped up nicotine levels, and competitors followed, study says ""Altria has a long and sordid history of spending billions to entice children to smoke through targeted campaigns that intentionally lied about the science and health effects from cigarettes,"" the letter says. The move comes as Dr. Scott Gottlieb -- who took a strong stance against underage vaping as commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration -- stepped down Friday, prompting questions about how aggressively the agency will continue to pursue the issue under new leadership. Read More ""Incoming Acting FDA Commissioner [Dr. Ned] Sharpless must, on day one, work to protect our nation's children from a lifetime of nicotine addiction by putting the full force of FDA behind this effort,"" Durbin said in a statement. ""An epidemic must be dealt with immediately, not months or years from now,"" he said. The senators are pressing Juul for detailed information on its sales and ad spending; how the company plans to keep underage people from seeing its ads or buying its products; new business dealings that emerged after the Altria announcement; how the company plans to verify ages and prevent people from ordering in bulk online; and what financial ties the company has to the ""conservative-leaning and anti-regulation organizations "" that wrote to President Trump in February, hoping to hamper the FDA's crackdown. #JUUL: How social media hyped nicotine for a new generation In addition, the lawmakers requested a complete list of ""social media influencers"" paid by Juul to publicize its brand. A CNN investigation in December shed light on Juul's influencer program and identified several of the social media users who participated. At the time, a representative for Juul said that the company had abandoned that program, describing it as small and short-lived. But now the senators want to know whether the company conducted this business in line with Federal Trade Commission regulations. The company's response to the letter -- addressed to its CEO, Kevin Burns -- is requested by April 25. In an emailed statement Monday, Juul said ""we welcome the opportunity to share information regarding JUUL Labs' commitment to curbing underage use of our products while fulfilling our mission to eliminate combustible cigarettes,"" promising to continue to work with various elected officials and authorities. The company added it has taken steps to curb underage use, such as halting most retail sales of flavored products and shutting down some of its social media accounts. Juul also said its deal with Altria ""will help us switch adult smokers off of combustible cigarettes by helping us get our product in their hands"" -- by including Juul inserts in cigarette packs, for example. FDA investigates reports of seizures after vaping Juul has maintained that its products are intended to convert adult former smokers to what it describes as a less-harmful alternative. But in the wake of the Altria deal, the senators say, Juul ""has lost what little remaining credibility the company had when it claimed to care about the public health."" The FDA revealed in November that vaping had increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since the year before. Public health experts say that Juul has largely propelled the rise, holding about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States. Experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs. The FDA has been conducting its own investigation into e-cigarette companies in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy. The agency also conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's San Francisco headquarters in October, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.

Most of the same senators also wrote to Juul last year , pressing the company to take swift action to keep its nicotine-filled products out of kids' hands -- but they have been disappointed by the lack of progress made since then, the lawmakers said. ""While you and your investors may be perfectly content with hooking an entire new generation of children on your tobacco products in order to increase your profit margins,"" the letter says, ""we will not rest until your dangerous products are out of the hands of our nation's children."""
"She lived for 99 years with organs in all the wrong places, and never knew it - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Sandee LaMotte, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/99-year-old-backward-organs-medical-oddity/index.html,"(CNN) On an early spring day in 2018, the faint smell of formaldehyde floating in the air, 26-year-old medical student Warren Nielsen and four of his classmates prepped a cadaver in the chilly dissection lab at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.
Similar groups of five gathered around bodies on the other 15 tables in the anatomy class, all eager to explore the mysteries of the human body they had seen only in textbooks. The cadaver assigned to Nielsen's team was a 99-year-old woman who had died of natural causes. Her name was Rose Marie Bentley, but the students didn't know that then. To honor and respect the privacy of those who offer their bodies to science, no further details are given medical students about the person who had once inhabited the body lying on the silvery slab before them. Rose Marie Bentley, not long before she died and donated her body to science. But as the students and their professors were soon to find out, Bentley was special, so special she deserved her own unique spot in medical literature and history books. The reason? A condition called situs inversus with levocardia, in which most vital organs are reversed -- almost like a mirror inside the body. That, along with a host of other weird but wonderful abnormalities, made Bentley a sort of medical unicorn. Read More ""I think the odds of finding another person like her may be as remote as one in 50 million,"" said assistant professor Cameron Walker, who teaches the Foundations of Clinical Anatomy class at Oregon Health and Science University. ""I don't think any of us will ever forget it, honestly."" 'This is totally backwards' On this March day, the assignment was to open the body's chest cavity to examine the heart. It wasn't long before Nielsen's group began to question their fledgling medical knowledge. ""Her heart was missing a large vein that's normally on the right side,"" Nielsen said. Bewildered, he and his team called the professors over and asked: ""Where's the inferior vena cava? Are we missing it? Are we crazy?"" ""And they kind of rolled their eyes,"" Nielsen said, ""Like, 'how can these students miss this big vessel?' And they come over and that's when the hubbub starts. They're like 'Oh, my God, this is totally backwards!' "" A typical body has a large vein called the vena cava that follows the right side of the vertebral column, curving under the liver and emptying deoxygenated blood into the heart. Bentley's vein was on the left, and instead of terminating directly into the heart, which is typical, ""her vein continued through her diaphragm, along the thoracic vertebrae, up and around and over the aortic arch and then emptied into the right side of her heart,"" Walker said. ""Normally speaking, none of us have a vessel that does that directly,"" he added. That wasn't the only irregularity Walker and his students found in Bentley's body. Numerous veins that typically drain the liver and other parts of the chest cavity were either missing or sprouting from an unusual spot. Her right lung had only two lobes, instead of the standard three, while the right atrium of her heart was twice normal size. ""And instead of having a stomach on the left, which is normal, her stomach was on the right,"" Walker said. ""Her liver, which normally occurs predominantly on the right, was predominantly on the left. Her spleen was on the right side instead of its normal occurrence on the left. And then the rest of her digestive tract, the ascending colon, was inverted as well."" The mutations in situs inversus with levocardia occur early, Walker explained, possibly between 30 and 45 days into the pregnancy. No one knows why. The condition occurs in only 1 out of 22,000 babies and is invariably associated with severe congenital heart disease. Because of the heart defects, only 5% to 13% live past the age of 5; case reports mention one 13-year-old boy and a 73-year-old who at the time was the second-longest survivor. But Bentley was an anomaly, one of the few born with the condition that didn't have heart defects, Walker said. ""That is almost certainly the factor that contributed most to her long life,"" he said. And that, along with all her other exceedingly rare anatomical abnormalities, is what makes Bentley 1 in 50 million, Walker estimated. 'Mom would have been so tickled' Rose Marie Phelps was born in 1918 in Waldport, a small town on the Oregon coast. The youngest child of four, ""she was babied,"" said daughter Patti Helmig, who at 78 is the oldest of her five children. ""She would admit she was spoiled."" A hairdresser by trade, Bentley was always fascinated by science, Helmig remembered, and she believes her mother would have made a fine nurse if she had been given the opportunity to train. ""She volunteered during World War II for one of the nurse's aid corps,"" Helmig said. ""And she was thrilled when someone reached out to her about doing a study on smallpox survivors, which she had as a child."" Rose Marie Bentley with a big catch. Despite chronic heartburn (which would have been explained by her unusual gastric anatomy), Bentley never showed any negative effects from her flip-flopped innards, said 76-year-old Ginger Robbins, the third of Bentley's children. ""We had no reason to believe there was anything like that wrong,"" Robbins said. ""She was always very healthy. She was always doing something, taking us to Campfire Girls, fishing, swimming. She was an excellent swimmer."" The only clue anything might be unusual came when Bentley's appendix was removed, said 66-year-old Louise Allee, the fourth-born child and youngest of the daughters. ""The surgeon made a note that her appendix wasn't in the right spot when they took it out,"" Allee said, ""but never said anything to us. Nobody said a thing when they took her gallbladder out and did a hysterectomy, either.""

The decision to become a body donor began with Jim Bentley, Rose Marie's husband, but she too ""thought it was the greatest thing,"" Allee remembers. ""There was a poem that my dad found, and it was all about donating your parts,"" she said. ""You know, 'give my eyes to a man who has never seen the sunrise' and the like. He kept showing us the poem. It was really important to them."" The poem, written by Robert Test, opens with the line: ""Give my sight to the man who has never seen a sunrise, a baby's face, or love in the eyes of a woman,"" and ends with ""If, by chance, you wish to remember me, do it with a kind deed or word to someone who needs you. If you do all I have asked, I will live forever."" The couple's beliefs about donation made an impact. All three daughters plan to donate their bodies for research. Rose Marie Bentley, a one in 50 million gal. Jim Bentley kept his promise and donated his body when he died of pneumonia more than a dozen years before his wife's death. His daughters know that he would have loved to have known about his wife's peculiar insides so he could have teased her about it. ""He also would have been tickled they could teach medical students something so different and really make some great use of her body,"" Allee said. And what would Bentley have said about being a one in 50 million kind of gal? ""She would've just thought it was funny,"" Robbins said. Allee agreed: ""She would have had a big smile on her face."""
Mother of girl who died after school fight says she'd complained of bullying in past - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliott C.

Speaking to ""Good Morning America"" on Monday, Ashley Wright said she had complained to Forest Hills Elementary School in the past about the girl involved in the altercation. Raniya's classmates to wear pink and purple ""I notified the school and I also spoke with her teacher at the time about this same person,"" she told the morning show. ""She would just always come home saying this one girl picking on her."" JUST WATCHED Fifth-grade girl dies after being injured in fight Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Fifth-grade girl dies after being injured in fight 01:36 Wright told the teacher she was ""leaving it in her hands to do something about it,"" but when Raniya got home, she said her teacher hadn't raised the issue. The mother further told ""GMA"" she had been complaining about the girl since Raniya was in the fourth grade, and Raniya's grandmother, who gets the kids ready for school while Wright is working, said Raniya had been asking to stay home from school the last couple of weeks, ABC reported . Read More ""My frustration is really towards the school system because I sent my child to school feeling like she can be protected while she's not in my care anymore,"" Wright said, according to ABC. Though school officials have released sparse details about the circumstances leading to Raniya's death, Ashley Wright said that her daughter's classmates told her the bully had been ""bothering Niya all day, wanting to fight her."" ""They were in the class,"" the mother said. ""The girl came up behind her and was hitting her all in the head. How long, I don't know. She pushed her or rammed her head or something into the bookshelf."" Raniya had no prior health issues, Wright said. School officials said there were no weapons involved in the March 25 fight. The school nurse called the mother around lunchtime, Wright told ""GMA,"" and told her that Raniya had ""been in an accident, a fight."" She was OK, the nurse told her, but she was complaining about dizziness and having a headache, Wright recalled. She didn't get a call back when Raniya's condition worsened, she said. Wright arrived at the hospital to find her daughter unresponsive and hooked up to machines, she said. Raniya's parents are still awaiting the official report on what happened to their daughter. ""I had to sleep by my baby the night before she passed, and that was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life,"" she said. ""It's just hard."" Officials said they stopped the fight, and Raniya was taken to the school nurse's station. She was unconscious when paramedics arrived, and they took her to a nearby hospital, according to a sheriff's office report. She was later airlifted to the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, where she died two days after the fight . From the state Senate podium last week, Sen. Margie Bright Matthews of Walterboro said she's spoken to officials -- including the substitute teacher in charge -- and wanted to correct rumors surrounding Raniya's death. ""I've heard a lot of people say, 'Oh, they were kicking her. They ganged her.' None of that. That's so far from the truth -- not even the banging of (her) head. The head was not even an issue,"" she said. Mark Peper, an attorney for the girl's father, responded, ""We are still awaiting official disclosures from the school district, police department and all other public entities, none of whom have provided our client with any pertinent information to date. If the events alleged by the senator (Tuesday) turn out to be factual, so be it, but our client deserves to know what happened to his daughter in a timely fashion."" A law firm representing Wright said, ""We are disappointed that Sen. Matthews would use the South Carolina Senate as the backdrop for her statements less than 24 hours before Raniya Wright is laid to rest."" Mourners brought balloons and stuffed animals to Raniya's school in her honor. Sean Gruber, a spokesman for the Colleton County School District, has declined to provide details, saying the district will not comment until police investigators release their findings. ""We realize and appreciate that people want to know exactly what happened in this incident. However, it is important for us as a school district to make sure that the Colleton County Sheriff's Office's thorough investigation, relying on all of the facts available, is concluded before we comment publicly."" A student was suspended, but it's unclear if the student was involved in the fight. Dozens of mourners stood outside a South Carolina church as the horse-drawn carriage with Raniya's casket arrived Wednesday for a celebration of life at Walterboro's Saints Center Ministries.

Kelly's first post-jail performance was 28 seconds long - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/entertainment/r-kelly-performance/index.html,"(CNN) R. Kelly has given his first performance since getting out of jail and reportedly it was brief.
According to CNN affiliates WICS and WRSP , the singer made an appearance at Dirty South Lounge in Springfield, Illinois, early Sunday morning. Kelly reportedly arrived around 1:30 a.m. where he spent a little over half an hour taking selfies, chatting, dancing and smoking cigars with those who had gathered to see him. He then grabbed a microphone, thanked his supporters and sang 28 seconds of one of his songs before the venue closed at 3 a.m., WICS and WRSP reported. The fee had been $100 for the event, but that was reduced to $50 after Kelly arrived, it was reported. Read More Hours before he was set to appear Kelly announced the event on his official Instagram account and appealed to the media.

""I want the media to take it easy on me man,"" Kelly said in the video. ""This is how I got to get paid right now, for right now."" The singer was released on bail last month for in case in which authorities have said he failed to pay his ex-wife child support of $161,000. Kelly also faces 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse -- a Class 2 felony -- involving four alleged victims. Kelly has vehemently denied any allegations of sexual misconduct. Last month his legal team filed a request asking the court to grant Kelly permission to travel to Dubai to perform shows as they argued he needs to work to pay child support and other bills. That request was later put on hold by Kelly's attorneys. Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, told CNN in a statement about his Dirty South Lounge appearance that ""Months ago a show was scheduled in Springfield, and this was the ""aftershow"" party."" ""Although the show was canceled the nightclub asked him to still appear,"" Greenberg said. ""Because a commitment is a commitment he lived up to his, made the 3 hr drive, and appeared. Promoting and pricing were up to the club."""

Trump designates Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/iran-us-irgc-designation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced Monday the US will formally designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a move some in the administration had opposed over concerns about potential risks to US troops in the Middle East.
The step ""recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" Trump said in a statement that described the IRGC as ""the Iranian government's primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign."" Administration officials said the move is a response to Iran's destabilizing behavior across the Middle East, including support for the regime in Syria, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as for assassination plots in Europe and the US. The announcement aims to drive a stake through the heart of a central institution in Iran. Formed after the Islamic revolution in 1979, the IRGC is not only Iran's most powerful military institution, it holds deep influence over domestic politics and the economy, with interests extending to and beyond the construction, telecommunications, auto and energy industries. Iran responds Read More Beyond the internal dissent the designation triggered within the US government, the move could also increase tensions with allies, particularly Iraq , where the IRGC has ties to militias and officials, and Lebanon, where it backs Hezbollah, which is part of the government. Iran's Supreme National Security Council responded Monday by declaring the US a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" and American troops operating in the region as ""terrorist groups,"" according to IRNA, Iran's state-run news agency. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran declares itself in reciprocity against the unlawful and unreasonable action of the United States today, considering the United States as a terrorist sponsored government and the Central Command of the United States, CENTCOM, and all its affiliated forces as terrorist groups,"" the National Security Council of the Islamic Republic of Iran said in a statement, IRNA reported. ""Obviously, the US regime will take all the responsibility for the dangerous consequences of this undertaking,"" the statement said. The IRGC designation marks the first time that the United States has ever named a part of another government as a foreign terrorist organization.

‚Äî Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) April 8, 2019 It takes effect on April 15, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the State Department Monday. Economic and travel sanctions on the elite military group mean any group or individual that does business with the IRGC could face criminal prosecution for providing material support to a terrorist organization. ""This historic step will deprive the world's leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world,"" Pompeo said. He warned that businesses with a presence in Iran or engaged with its companies will have to take extra steps to ensure they are not violating US sanctions. Brian Hook, a senior policy adviser to Pompeo, said Monday that the IRGC controls ""up to half Iran's economy."" ""It is absolutely the case that the IRGC amounts to a significant amount of the Iranian economy through pure kleptocracy,"" Pompeo said. ""Businesses and banks around the world now have a clear duty to ensure that companies with which they conduct transactions are not connected to the IRGC in any material way."" Concerns about troops Senior officials said the designation decision, formally under the State Department's purview, represents the next step in the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign against Iran, but the move had met with internal resistance because of concerns about American troops in the Middle East. Defense officials have told CNN that US troops in Syria and Iraq often find themselves operating in close proximity to members of the IRGC. The US has about 5,000 troops in Iraq and close to 2,000 in Syria. Last year, CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats cautioned the administration that designating the IRGC could pose dangers to US forces, according to one source familiar with the matter. Asked about the risks to US troops in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq, Hook told reporters at the State Department that ""the decision leading up to this process was a full interagency process that included every member of the NSC. We have taken all measures that are appropriate and prudent in the context of this designation."" He added that ""whenever we and other nations call out and expose the regime for what it is, it behaves like a mafia organization increasing its threats. We will not be deterred by their threats."" 'Prepared' Nathan Sales, the State Department's Coordinator for Counterterrorism, said the agency would not discuss details of measures being taken to ensure the safety of US personnel. ""I can assure you that we take force protection very, very seriously. And that is why we have run a robust interagency process to make sure that all interested parties are prepared for whatever the Iranian regime might throw at us,"" he said, speaking alongside Hook Monday. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, Pentagon spokeswoman, said Monday that ""the Department of Defense is prepared to implement the President and Secretary of State's decision to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization."" ""As a matter of policy, we do not discuss adjustments to force protection levels or measures for operational security reasons,"" Rebarich continued. ""As always, DoD has taken prudent measures to ensure the safety of our forces around the world, and maintain our readiness to carry out our missions."" #NetanyahuFirsters who have long agitated for FTO designation of the IRGC fully understand its consequences for US forces in the region. In fact, they seek to drag US into a quagmire on his behalf. @realDonaldTrump should know better than to be conned into another US disaster. pic.twitter.com/i4bcfgxybT
‚Äî Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 7, 2019 Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said it was ""fitting that the most dangerous terrorist group in the world, responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents and backed by a massive state apparatus and vast energy wealth, is being designated finally as a foreign terrorist organization."" The designation now means ""the US government can truly unleash its full economic, prosecutorial and political powers"" to punish Iran, Dubowitz said. Trita Parsi, the author of ""Losing an Enemy - Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy,"" warned that the designation carries significant political implications and ultimately will not serve US security interests. ""This move closes yet another potential door for peacefully resolving tensions with Iran,"" Parsi said. ""Once all doors are closed, and diplomacy is rendered impossible, war will essentially become inevitable ... this decision does not in any way shape or form serve US national security. On the contrary, it makes America less safe by making war more likely."" ""Even if future administrations would want to resolve tensions with Iran, the spiderweb of sanctions and terrorism designations makes any meaningful movement towards a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran politically unfeasible in Washington,"" Parsi said. Israeli reaction The move was warmly welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who thanked Trump in a tweet and appeared to take some credit for the move, which comes a day before Israeli elections. ""Thank you, my dear friend, President of the United States Donald Trump, for your decision to declare Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terror organization,"" Netanyahu wrote. ""Thank you for responding to another one of my important requests, that serves our interests and the interests of regional countries."" The IRGC designation follows Trump's March 21 announcement that the US would recognize Israeli control of the Golan Heights, a step that counters United Nations resolutions against land being seized by force. Like the President's decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognize the city as Israel's capitol, the Golan decision reversed decades of US policy and countered international norms."
Univision sells Gizmodo Media Group to private equity firm - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Tom Kludt,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/media/univision-sells-gizmodo/index.html,"New York (CNN Media) Univision made good on a promise to sell its online properties on Monday when it announced that it has sold Gizmodo Media Group, which includes the family of websites formerly known as Gawker Media.
GMG, which includes former Gawker properties Gizmodo, Jezebel and Deadspin, among others, as well as Splinter and the satirical site The Onion, is being sold to Great Hill Partners, private equity firm. Terms of the sales were not disclosed. ""Today's announcement is the culmination of a very thorough process, as part of Univision's broader strategic realignment and return to its core strengths in Hispanic media and marketing,"" Univision CEO Vince Sadusky said in a statement. ""Our aim from the outset of this process was to sell these assets as one, and we are pleased to have found a terrific buyer in Great Hill Partners that is committed to growing these properties. We are grateful to our colleagues at GMG and The Onion for all of their high-quality journalism and achievements as part of our company and we wish them and Great Hill Partners tremendous success."" The newly acquired assets will form a company called ""G/O Media Inc.,"" Great Hill said Monday. Univision put most of its online properties on the block last year and enlisted Morgan Stanley to ""explore the sale"" of the digital asset -- a dramatic departure from the ambitious digital strategy outlined by the company when it acquired the GMG sites nearly three years ago. Read More Univison, a primarily Spanish-language media company, bought The Onion and its sibling websites, ushering in a new effort to reach English-language consumers. The deal was struck in January 2016. Later that year, Univision won the Gawker Media assets, which were rebranded as Gizmodo Media Group, through a bankruptcy auction. When the company announced that it was exploring a sale last summer, Sadusky said he had ""no doubt"" that the sites ""can thrive even more as part of a company whose focus aligns better with theirs."" ""Likewise, it is important for Univision to exit a business which does not enhance our core mission, and instead refocus on our strengths,"" Sadusky said at the time. Whether a private equity firm shares the same vision as the journalists at GMG's fiercely progressive network of sites remains to be seen."
"More than half of UK voters want a 'strong leader willing to break the rules,' says new survey - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Tara John, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/uk/hansard-strong-leader-brexit-poll-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) More than half of the British voters questioned in a new survey want ""a strong leader willing to break the rules,"" according to a report on political engagement released on Monday.
The audit by the Hansard Society also found that faith in the UK political system has dropped to a 15-year low amid a Brexit-induced political crisis. There is an intensifying feeling of public ""powerlessness and disengagement"" towards Britain's system of governance, according to the report, for which 1,198 adults were interviewed in the last two months of 2018. Ruth Fox, director of the non-partisan charity which promotes parliamentary democracy, said the appetite for ""radical solutions"" has clearly increased among Brits. The survey found that 54% of those polled calling for a strong, rule-breaking leader; 66% said politicians should be able to say what is on their mind regardless of what anyone else thinks about their views; and 42% think many of the country's problems could be dealt with more effectively if the government didn't have to worry so much about votes in Parliament. Read More ""Preferring a strong leader who is willing to break the rules, or thinking that the government should be able to tackle the country's problems without worrying about the approval of Parliament, would challenge core tenets of our democracy,"" Fox said in a statement. Theresa May gambles it all in last-ditch bid to deliver Brexit The audit found 56% of those polled believe Britain is in decline, 63% said the system of government is rigged to benefit the rich and powerful, and around two-thirds of those questioned think that most big issues facing the country does not have clear solutions. While the public does not appear to be politically apathetic, satisfaction with the system of government is on a downward trend. According to the audit, faith in the political system is lower than it was in the aftermath of the 2009 expenses scandal -- which shocked the country when Members of Parliament were found to have billed taxpayers for items and services including a ¬£1,600 ($2,000) ornamental duck house on a pond, and the costs of resurfacing tennis courts and cleaning swimming pools, as well as smaller items such as dog food and Christmas decorations. ""Although the core indicators -- including certainty to vote -- remain stable, pessimism about the country's future combines worryingly with anti-system sentiment,"" Fox added. More than 70% of respondents said the system of governing needs ""quite a lot"" or ""a great deal"" of improvement and just 25% said they have confidence in British lawmakers handling of Brexit. Meanwhile 75% of those surveyed said the internal divisions in the main political parties means they cannot serve the best interests of the country. ""Unless something changes, this is a potentially toxic recipe for the future of British politics,"" Fox said."

Edwards said Facebook enabled genocide in Myanmar, because of efforts on the social network to whip up hatred against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority group in the Southeast Asian country . He also said Facebook helped undermine democratic institutions. Edwards said in another tweet that ""They #DontGiveAZuck,"" according to the Herald . He later deleted the tweets, ""because of the volume of toxic and misinformed traffic they prompted,"" Edwards explained in another tweet . Read More Facebook ( FB ) was engulfed in controversy after a shooter in New Zealand livestreamed the March 15 attack on two mosques in Christchurch on the social network using its video tools. The shooter killed 50 people. Facebook later admitted its systems failed to catch and delete the video. The company explained that the shooter's video did not trigger Facebook's automatic detection systems because its artificial intelligence did not have enough training to recognize that type of video. The shooting was viewed live by fewer than 200 people and later viewed 4,000 times before it was taken down. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack in the first 24 hours. ""We are deeply committed to strengthening our policies, improving our technology and working with experts to keep Facebook safe,"" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business Monday. In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said a delay ""might"" have limited the number of views of a livestreamed video. A delay on livestreamed videos ""would also fundamentally break what livestreaming is for people,"" Zuckerberg said. He said livestreaming is more than broadcasting -- it's ""communicating,"" because people comment in real time. ""So if you had a delay that would break that,"" he explained. ""That was a really terrible event,"" Zuckerberg said about the terror attack. ""We need to build our systems to be able to identify livestream terror events more quickly."" Edwards criticized Zuckerberg's explanation as ""disingenuous"" in a radio interview Monday because the company wouldn't disclose to him how many suicides, murders or sexual assaults are livestreamed. ""I've asked Facebook exactly that last week and they simply don't have those figures or won't give them to us,"" he said, according to the Herald."
"Nearly 1 in 13 US males reported having sex before age 13, study says",edition.cnn.com,Jacqueline Howard,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/sex-health-statistics-teen-boys-study/index.html,"(CNN) The percentage of boys who start having sex at a young age can vary based on factors such as where they live and their mothers' education level, according to a new study. Yet among those boys, only about half described their first time as something they fully ""wanted.""
The study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics on Monday, found that 3.6% to 7.6% of boys and young men in the United States -- nearly 1 in 13 -- report having had sex for the first time before they turned age 13. The researchers are calling for more education, care and conversations about supporting healthy sexual development in boys. ""Too often, the sexual health needs of young men are overlooked. These findings have major implications for the timing of sex education and sexual and reproductive health care,"" said Laura Lindberg, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank, and first author of the study. In general, about age 17 is when most boys and girls have sex for the first time -- but boys are more likely than girls to have sex for the first time before 13, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Only these 8 states require sex education classes to mention consent Read More The new study included data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System from 2011, 2013 and 2015 and from the National Survey of Family Growth from 2006 to 2015. Data in the first system was collected in questionnaires completed by students in grades nine to 12 and involved 19,916 male students. The family growth survey data was collected through in-person interviews with 15- to 24-year-olds and involved 7,739 males. The researchers analyzed that data with a close eye toward demographic factors, where the boys lived and how much respondents wanted that first experience to happen. To measure ""wantedness,"" the National Survey of Family Growth asked the respondents to describe how much they wanted the encounter to happen, choosing between ""I really didn't want it to happen at the time,"" ""I had mixed feelings -- part of me wanted it to happen at the time and part of me didn't"" and ""I really wanted it to happen at the time."" Fewer teens having sex and using drugs, CDC survey finds The researchers found that sex before 13 was reported by 7.6% of the male high school students in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data and 3.6% of the respondents in the National Survey of Family Growth data. The National Survey of Family Growth data showed that among those who reported having sex before 13, 8.5% described it as ""unwanted,"" 37% had mixed feelings about it, and 54.6% described it was ""wanted."" Most described their first sexual partner as a friend. That was similar to findings among males who had sex later than 13, the study found, which was that 5.4% reported it as ""unwanted,"" 31.3% had mixed feelings, and 63.3% described it as ""wanted."" The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data showed that, across 15 metropolitan areas in the United States, the percentage of male students reporting having sex before 13 varied widely: 5% in San Francisco to 25% in Memphis, Tennessee. The researchers also found that respondents whose mothers had a college degree or higher educational level were less likely, by a statistically significant amount, to report having sex before 13, and reports of having sex before 13 were higher among black males. The study had some limitations, including that the younger the survey respondent the more likely they were to report having sex before age 13, and the data focused only on male-female sexual intercourse, not other types of sexual experiences.

Dr. David Bell, pediatrician and associate professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center , and Samantha Garbers, an associate professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health , wrote an editorial published alongside the study in JAMA Pediatrics . They called for improvements in sex education and screening for sexual activity in youth. ""Any messaging, whether from clinicians or schools or parents, must recognize pressures that 'manhood is something that boys must make happen, by passing certain social milestones,' such as having sex. It is critical to engage young men in self-reflection about the real pressures US society places on them that affect their overall health and well-being,"" Bell and Garbers wrote. ""Any discussions associated with pressures should include topics of 'what it means to be a man' and soliciting and giving consent,"" they wrote. ""With the support of caring adults, led by existing national guidelines that call for developmentally appropriate interventions early in life, boys can achieve healthier milestones without ambivalence or societal risk."""
"Number of children going to ER with suicidal thoughts, attempts doubles, study finds",edition.cnn.com,"Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/child-teen-suicide-er-study/index.html,"(CNN) The number of children and teens in the United States who visited emergency rooms for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts doubled between 2007 and 2015, according to a new analysis.
Researchers used publicly available data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , administered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention every year. From the 300 emergency rooms sampled, the researchers tracked the number of children between 5 and 18 who received a diagnosis of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts each year. Diagnoses of either condition increased from 580,000 in 2007 to 1.12 million in 2015, according to the study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics . The average age of a child at the time of evaluation was 13, and 43% of the visits were in children between 5 and 11. Suicides under age 13: One every 5 days ""The numbers are very alarming,"" said Dr. Brett Burstein, the lead study author and a pediatric emergency room physician at Montreal Children's Hospital of McGill University Health Centre. ""It also represents a larger percentage of all pediatric emergency department visits. Where suicidal behavior among the pediatric population was just 2% of all visits, that's now up to 3.5%."" The findings come as no surprise to child psychiatrists. Read More ""We know that suicide and depression have been rising significantly,"" said Dr. Gene Beresin, executive director of The Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. Depression and a prior suicide attempt are the two biggest risk factors for suicide, and with rates of suicide on the rise, it makes sense for risk factors to increase as well, he explained. The reason? It's complicated One reason for the increase in depression and suicidal behaviors may be more stress and pressure on kids, Beresin said. ""Kids are feeling more pressure to achieve, more pressure in school, and are more worried about making a living than in previous years,"" he said. Parents and caregivers are also more stressed, Beresin said, adding that rates of suicides have increased in all age groups over the past 20 years and that the stress is passed down to children and teens. Another reason may be the rise of social media and increasing rates of cyberbullying that have come with it, Beresin said. Suicide rate hit 40-year peak among older teen girls in 2015 Approximately 15% of US high school students report that they've been bullied online in the past year, according to the CDC . A Pew Research Center survey found that the number could be even higher: 59%. ""Cyberbullying can be especially difficult for kids,"" explained Dr. Neha Chaudhary, child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and co-founder of Brainstorm: Stanford Lab for Brain Health Innovation and Entrepreneurship. ""Unlike in settings like schools, it can fly under the radar without anyone knowing it's happening and without the same repercussions for the bullies."" In isolation, none of these factors has been proven to lead to an increase in suicidal behaviors and ultimately suicide, but taken together, a pattern begins to emerge, Beresin said. And the country may not be adequately equipped to deal with the problem. Families left waiting According to data from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the majority of the United States faces a severe shortage of practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists, with fewer than 17 providers available per 100,000 children. This means many families face long wait times, which can lead to worsening of a child's underlying mental health condition and an eventual need for more treatment sessions than if the condition had been addressed in its early stages, explained Jennifer Mautone, a psychologist in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The available qualified providers face another challenge: communicating with other systems caring for children. Nearly 1 in 7 US kids and teens has a mental health condition, and half go untreated, study says Many systems are aimed at caring for children, including the education, health care, juvenile justice and child welfare systems, said Dr. Barbara Robles-Ramamurthy, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Long School of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio who was not involved in the study. ""All of these systems that are supposed to be caring for children oftentimes are not talking to each other,"" she said. ""A lot of times, kids fall through the cracks, and families are not getting the appropriate support they need.""

According to a study published in JAMA Pediatrics in February, half of kids in the United States with mental health conditions like depression and anxiety go untreated. Rising rates of mental health conditions in youth coupled with difficulties accessing care and long waiting lists is a bad combination, Beresin said. Burstein, who regularly sees children and teens in the emergency department with suicidal behaviors, worries that the rates will continue to increase. ""We are seeing an acceleration of this issue, and I worry that we have not yet seen the peak,"" he said."
US skyscrapers kill up to 600 million birds each year,edition.cnn.com,"Lianne Kolirin, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/americas/bird-building-collisions-scli-intl-scn/index.html,"(CNN) Around 600 million birds die every year in the United States after striking tall buildings -- with Chicago, Houston and Dallas being especially deadly, according to research from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology .
Attracted to the artificial light in high-rise blocks, birds can become disorientated and crash into walls -- many of which are made of glass -- suffering injury and often death. The issue is particularly stark during migratory seasons in spring and fall, when billions of birds pass through the central United States on their way between Canada and Latin America, according to the ornithology lab, which has just issued a list of the most dangerous cities for migrating birds. It estimates that well over half a billion birds are dying in this way every year in America. Birds in Minnesota keep crashing into things and police think it's because they're drunk Chicago is the most dangerous place for birds during both seasons, closely followed by Houston and Dallas. There, accidents kill birds that have covered thousands of miles on their journeys only to perish in seconds as they collide with glass buildings. Kyle Horton is the lead author of the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment last week. Read More ""Chicago, Houston, and Dallas are uniquely positioned in the heart of North America's most trafficked aerial corridors. This, in combination with being some of the largest cities in the US, make them a serious threat to the passage of migrants, regardless of season,"" he said in a statement posted online by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology. An American redstart killed in a building collision It is hard to quantify the exact number of casualties, but research published by The Condor: Ornithological Applications in 2014 suggested that as many as 1 billion birds die as a result each year in the US alone. ""This magnitude of mortality would place buildings behind only free-ranging domestic cats among sources of direct human-caused mortality of birds,"" that report concluded. Loss of the night: Light pollution rising rapidly on a global scale Skyscrapers are at the heart of the problem, according to New York City Audubon , which aims to protect wild birds and their natural habitat in the city -- which ranked seventh-worst for the spring migration and was the fifth-worst during the fall. The problem is exacerbated by the migration's timing, as many birds fly at night. Attracted by the glow of skyscrapers in the dark, they are vulnerable to collision -- either with each other or the buildings. For some, the light can prove so disorientating that they flutter around for hours, eventually becoming exhausted and landing in inhospitable environments. 2,000 snow geese drop dead from the sky in Idaho Birds can also become confused by windows with plants behind them, mistaking them for a safe landing spot. Reflective glass next to gardens and parkland can also prove problematic, promising a safe haven where none exists, according to New York City Audubon, which runs Project Safe Flight. Started in 1997, Project Safe Flight relies on volunteers to prevent collisions, rescue injured birds and count those that have perished. Meanwhile, an affiliate program, Lights Out New York, encourages owners of tall buildings to turn off lights during the two migration seasons to help protect the birds and reduce energy costs. Awe-inspiring animal migrations that send people flocking Homeowners in the most affected areas can also play their part, according to Horton. ""If you don't need lights on, turn them off,"" he recommends. ""It's a large-scale issue, but acting even at the very local level to reduce lighting can make a difference. While we're hopeful that major reductions in light pollution at the city level are on the horizon, we're excited that even small-scale actions can make a big difference."""

Habana has spent his final day here racing kids, getting tackled and throwing a ball around as part of sevens series sponsor HSBC's Try Rugby initiative. Alongside the Hong Kong Rugby Union, the scheme is designed to get the game on more school curriculums here and encourage more children to play the game. Over the last few years, Try Rugby has introduced some 20- to 30,000 kids to the sport, according to Habana.

""You watch this tournament on TV, growing up, and you saw the greats -- the Jonah Lomus, the Christian Cullens, the Eric Rushes and Waisale Serevis -- who became icons of this tournament. ""Hong Kong is the home of (modern) sevens rugby and to see the sport grow since the tournament has been on the go, to experience the atmosphere, that South Stand madness, has been special.

The Bok great has been impressed by the athletes involved in the sporting spectacle -- and it is an historic leg of the Sevens World Series, with Fiji men winning here for the fifth year in a row and Brazil women displaying true legacy by winning their qualifier event to be on the full-time circuit next season, almost four years after hosting the Olympic Games in Rio. Ireland men also win their qualifier, an emotional moment for a national side that spent years in the sevens wilderness. The action is often jaw-slackeningly frenetic. Habana never had the chance to play here, but there is a hint of jealousy. Yet as the South African mentions the South Stand there, you may get a flash of recognition -- isn't that the crazy, packed-out stand, with everyone in costume? Is it noisy? You don't know the half of it. 'Bucket list' As he is asked whether he's seen anything like this before, a smile darts across athletics icon Michael Johnson's face. ""I follow the sevens and I've been to Dubai before, but no, this is my first time at the Hong Kong Sevens.""

""Nothing really matters"" seems like an all-too-fitting lyric for the carefree crowd.

When Habana says visiting Hong Kong ""has been pretty high on the bucket list for some time"" he mentions the South Stand in the same breath (him, O'Driscoll and Gregan all downed pints on front of that raucous crowd, naturally). By 9.30am on the Saturday of the sevens, the South Stand is full. No more room. But the queue to get in -- should anyone wish to opt out of the party in there -- has already formed. At 10am, we talk with 'Brad', who won't reveal his real name, but is identifiable by the Where's Wally costume he has on. There are a few other Wallys peppered through the line. It's Brad's first time. He is prepared to be at the back, just to say he's been in there. He is optimistic the wait won't be long. But some of his mates were preparing for this South Stand visit at 6.30am. For the teams that get knocked out of the tournament, in either the main event or the qualifiers, the initial instinct for many is to head towards that stand. When Ireland win their qualifier, many zero in on the section as quickly as possible. Second division? The Little Magician, Serevi, is here, trying to coach the Russian men's team back into the Sevens World Series. Arguably the greatest sevens player of all time, Serevi knows a thing or two about the game.

Hide Caption 9 of 9 He is right; Hong Kong often feels like the engine for sevens. Yet, if you are hunting a place at the top of the sport for a full season, as Serevi's Russia hope to be, there is only one option. Hong Kong hosts the only stand-alone qualifying event. You can plan a whole season around one event that decides your fate for the next term. Many want a second division of the Sevens World Series. Including World Rugby vice-chairman and chairman of sevens, Gus Pichot. ""The biggest objective for the next cycle is to have a second competition, and we are working very hard for that,"" says Pichot on the second day of competition. ""Where it is going to be held is still under discussion and it is part of a broader discussion but we decided in the Executive Committee (ExCo) strategic plan that part of the resources, money, is there to cover the expansion of the circuit for a second tier. ""I don't like to call it a second tier but it would be a different tournament that will provide access to other countries that don't play regularly and they have a sevens program."" As World Rugby prepare for key strategic meetings in Dublin, many hope that the lesser visited sevens nations get their shot as host. Going green In the Laureus box, Johnson smiles again when he says that clearly he would like the USA men to win this event. After all, the Eagles have shaken up the established order this season, leading the table in a season where the top four automatically qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. As you can tell from the accounts of those above, new experiences have become a bit of a theme. Fitting, then, that at this event we see innovative light-up rugby posts that turn green when a conversion, penalty kick or even drop-goal is successful. The Hong Kong union want to go greener still, with revelers encouraged to purchase reusable pint mugs, rather than collecting and then chucking away plastic tumblers. They want to significantly reduce waste. And yet, some things here never change. Newbies and first-time fans may not know exactly how it will feel, but they know they are in for a good time. And everyone knows that Fiji come to play. In the final there are offloads over the head, yellow cards dished out and mighty runs from players like Aminiasi Tuimaba. After their 21-7 over France, Fiji coach Gareth Baber dedicates the victory to the victims of the atrocities in New Zealand in March, in which 50 people perished and 50 more were injured. During the game the Flying Fijians are just as classy. They are just seven points behind USA in the standings and with three legs left to play, the rest of the season should be just as energetic as a sing along to Queen."

New York State Democrats make their own push for Trump's taxes,edition.cnn.com,"Evan Simko-Bednarski, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/new-york-state-trump-taxes/index.html,"(CNN) New York legislators are making a new push for the release of President Donald Trump's taxes under state law, a move that could offer Democrats an end run around fights in Washington over the President's federal returns.
A bill introduced on Monday in the New York State Senate would authorize the state's tax commissioner to release state tax returns to Congress upon request. Trump is a New York resident, and the state is home to the headquarters of his family business, the Trump Organization. Though the legislation would only enable the release of the President's state returns, the fact that much of the President's business has been conducted in New York means that such returns could be nearly as telling as his federal returns. The measure is being sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman. Read More If passed, the bill would authorize the commissioner of the state's Department of Taxation and Finance to hand over tax returns at the request of the US House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee, the US Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation, Hoylman's spokeswoman Avery Cohen told CNN. She added that the bill would stipulate that the request be ""for a specified and legitimate legislative purpose."" A spokesman for New York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins told CNN Monday that the bill is under consideration. ""It is something we will be discussing as Conference to decide if and when to move forward on this legislation,"" said Mike Murphy, the spokesperson for Stewart-Cousins, said. Republican State Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb called the bill ""political grandstanding."" ""New York has some of the highest, most oppressive taxes in America and people are leaving in droves because of it,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""President Trump's return isn't the tax conversation New York Democrats should be having."" ""Ultimately, the scrutiny of anyone's tax returns, whether private citizen or public official, is between the taxpayer, the IRS or New York State Tax and Finance Department -- not the legislature,"" Kolb added. Jed Shugerman, a professor of law at Fordham University who specializes in constitutional law, told CNN that he believes the proposed legislation would stand up to legal challenge -- but that New York legislators should still be prepared for a fight to get the returns. ""Anything can end up in the courts,"" he said. Hoylman has a history of pursuing legislation to uncover Trump's financial history. Last year, Hoylman sponsored a bill that would have required any presidential or vice presidential candidate who wished to appear on the ballot in New York to file five years of federal income tax returns with the state Board of Elections. That bill, known as the ""tax returns uniformly made public"" -- or TRUMP -- act, was defeated in committee. Hoylman is currently sponsoring a similar bill which is before the state senate's elections committee. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, the first president in over 40 years to do so. He has claimed that ongoing Internal Revenue Service audits prevent him from doing so, despite the fact that no such audit would prohibit their release."
Kirstjen Nielsen just got pushed out of the most impossible job in Trump's Washington,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/donald-trump-kirstjen-nielsen-stephen-miller/index.html,"(CNN) The abrupt resignation of Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen ends a tumultuous two-ish year tenure in the job in which one simple fact just kept popping up: No one on earth could do this job to the satisfaction of President Donald Trump.
The reporting coming out of Nielsen's resignation speaks to the impossibility of the DHS job under Trump. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
There's this from CNN : ""Trump was furious with Nielsen [in May 2018], telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground, citing the law in certain instances, the source said. ""Nielsen increasingly pushed back when the President lashed out at her department for not doing more to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants. Read More ""A senior administration official said that in recent days Trump and Nielsen had again clashed over the issue. He accused her of not doing her job, and she responded forcefully."" And this from The New York Times : ""The president called Ms. Nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country, including doing things that were clearly illegal, such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum. She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws, court settlements and international obligations. ""Those responses only infuriated Mr. Trump further. The president's fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms. Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained."" There's a few things to think about here: 1) Trump believes to his core -- and he's not wrong -- that if there was one reason he won in 2016 it was because of his pledge to a) build a wall along our southern border and b) broadly toughen America's immigration policies. If there is ANY campaign promise that he is absolutely and totally committed to keeping, it's to be the toughest president ever when it comes to the border. One needs look no further than Trump's decision -- against his own party's wishes -- to declare a state of emergency on the southern border in order to re-appropriate money to build his wall. Or his push behind the scenes, reported by CNN Monday, to reinstate the policy of family separation at the border that led to a slew of very young children taken from their parents without any real way to track their whereabouts. 2) Trump has very little understanding of -- or care for -- boundaries of any sort. And that goes double for immigration and border issues because of everything I mentioned above. This is his issue. This is the issue his people care about. And he'll be damned if he's told by some bureaucrat that he can't do what he wants on the border. That Trump would instruct Nielsen to block all migrants from entering the country and then blame her when she told him that was, in a word, illegal, speaks to the detachment from reality that President has on this issue. Combine those two factors and you get this, from a senior administration official on Nielsen's thinking : ""[She] believed the situation was becoming untenable ... [with the President] becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests."" Think of this in your own life. Your boss calls you in. She tells you to go find a Woolly Mammoth -- and to make it snappy. (You are an assistant zookeeper in this scenario.) When you come back to her empty-handed and explain that the Woolly Mammoth went extinct around 1700 BC, she tells you that you are not working hard enough to find one. And that if she was in your job, she would have found a Woolly Mammoth hours ago. And that everyone knows that you can find a Woolly Mammoth if you look hard enough. Look. There are a LOT of very tough jobs in the Trump administration: chief of staff, communications director and press secretary all jump to mind. But there is NO job more impossible than running the Department of Homeland Security. Nielsen made mistakes, sure. But focusing on her mistakes overlooks the real story here: Donald Trump wants impossible (and, at times, illegal) things done by DHS to address the border crisis. And if you aren't willing to bend (or break) the rules, he thinks you have failed him. And he might think you've failed him anyway; remember that Nielsen enforced a zero-tolerance policy at the border on family separations -- becoming the face of a deeply unpopular policy that Trump eventually walked away from. In short: It doesn't really matter who Trump names as Nielsen's successor. That person could be the hardest of hard immigration hard-liners. But that person will still be dealing with a Congress less than willing to greenlight some of Trump's more extreme border policies and, well, the rule of law. And no one person can change one of those realities, much less both."
Stephen Miller wants Trump to oust more senior leaders at Homeland Security,edition.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/miller-nielsen-trump-immigration-homeland-security/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is cleaning house in the Department of Homeland Security.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles have been ousted, and at least two officials have been named as possibly heading out the door: US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick. ""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" an official told CNN. At least some of the sudden personnel changes come at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who played a key role in Nielsen's ouster. The President in recent weeks empowered Miller to lead the administration's border policies ""and he's executing his plan"" with what amounts to a wholesale decapitation of the department's leadership, an official said. RELATED: How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen Read More The President has also pushed in recent weeks to reinstate the family separation policy, which Nielsen resisted, a source familiar with the discussions says. Trump rescinded that policy amid public outrage and scrutiny from the courts last summer. Miller's heightened influence within the West Wing has been aided by the President, who recently told aides in an Oval Office meeting that Miller was in charge of all immigration and border-related issues in the White House, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Trump administration officials say Miller wants the President to dismiss Cissna and Mitnick. Miller has always informally been one of the leading hardliner voices on immigration in the West Wing. But this change formalizes that role and gives him the ability to call and chair meetings on immigration issues. The change was first reported by The Washington Post . The sudden shift in personnel is indicative of the White House trying to redirect immigration policy following a surge of migrant apprehensions at the southern border in recent months. Kirstjen Nielsen just got pushed out of the most impossible job in Trump's Washington Additionally, after Trump walked back his threat to close the US-Mexico border and praised Mexico for doing more to stop the flow of immigrants, he has since soured on his own walkback. By the end of the week, the President became frustrated once again about the issues at the border, dissatisfied that Mexico was not doing enough and looking for his aides to take tougher steps to address the problem. The changes have left the department in limbo, which has had at least three positions filled by people in an acting capacity in senior roles. A senior administration official said that under the law, DHS Under Secretary of Management Claire Grady, the current acting deputy secretary, is next in line of succession to be acting secretary. That means there are questions as to whether she will need to be fired as well in order to make Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan the acting DHS secretary, as Trump tweeted Sunday night. Late last week, the White House abruptly withdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello for director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which caught Congress and the department by surprise. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination was pulled, a person familiar with the news said. ""It's pretty somber over here,"" said an ICE official, adding that there are still questions about why Vitiello's name was withdrawn. 'You've got a hard job' Nielsen had been on thin ice for some time. After the 2018 midterm elections, she and her advisers strongly suspected that she would not survive long. The President had long talked about making changes to his Cabinet after the midterms, and Trump was increasingly calling for drastic action to curb migration at the southern border. Nielsen realized that optics were what mattered most to Trump -- that's when she began to adopt a harder line and make a more public case for the President's immigration policies. In private, she also tried to adjust her style when talking to Trump, offering him workarounds to existing laws rather than simply telling him what he wanted at the border was not possible. It all ingratiated her to Trump, according to multiple sources, and the President began to believe Nielsen might be the right person to implement his agenda despite the challenges of the job. ""You've got a hard job,"" the President told her at the time, a source familiar with the comments said. At the same time, Nielsen worked with one of the President's closest advisers, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to broker a deal with Mexico that would allow some asylum seekers to wait in that country while their claims were processed. Nielsen also felt that forging a closer relationship with Kushner could help her get more stability in the job. She entered 2019 feeling that she had earned that stability. In February, she reshuffled her senior staff and began to eye additional senior hires. But the ground shifted under her faster than she could adjust. She began to grow concerned that her position might be in danger last week, when a newly empowered Miller indicated there would be a shake-up in several deputy-level positions at DHS. Nielsen tried to find solutions to the administration's chaotic response to the situation at the border that would allow her to remain in her position. She started to talk to White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney about bringing on an immigration czar to coordinate the administration's response -- and take some of the heat off herself. Ultimately, neither that nor her attempts to turn up the volume on her rhetoric were enough. ""The situation at the border just deteriorated super quickly,"" one source close to Nielsen said. RELATED: It may take 2 years to identify thousands of separated families, government says Asked about the mood at DHS following Nielsen's resignation, one DHS official told CNN there was ""some exasperation,"" adding that the department doesn't ""have enough depth"" to fill longtime vacancies. ""We are losing leadership faster than we can get it confirmed or even hired permanently,"" the official said."
"Pete Buttigieg to Mike Pence: 'Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator'",edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/pete-buttigieg-mike-pence/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg on Sunday again took on Vice President Mike Pence -- whose stances on LGBTQ issues have faced criticism from gay rights activists -- saying that if Pence has ""a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.""
Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, made the comments while speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington. He reflected on his personal struggles with his sexuality, his decision to come out in 2015 and the fact that his being gay is not the result of a personal decision. ""If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,"" Buttigieg said. ""And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."" Buttigieg's comments came hours after he made critical comments about evangelical voters' support of President Donald Trump during an appearance on ""Meet The Press."" ""It's something that really frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable,"" Buttigieg said. ""Here you have somebody who not only acts in a way that is not consistent with anything that I hear in scripture in church."" Read More Pete Buttigieg's not-so-secret weapon is his husband, Chasten During his Victory Fund speech, Buttigieg said that, while he was growing up, he wished he wasn't gay, but his marriage to his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, has made him a better person and has brought him closer to God. The two started dating four years ago and got married last June. Pence has drawn the ire of members of the LGBTQ community in the past for his positions on various LGBTQ issues. A staunch conservative Christian, he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act while he was governor of Indiana. Critics of the law contend that individuals and businesses could use it to discriminate against the gay community on the basis of religion. Pence also signaled support for federal funds to be allocated for gay ""conversion therapy"" on his 2000 US House campaign website, where it said ""resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."""
Exclusive: Anna Wintour says it's time to 'stand up for what you believe in',www.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/anna-wintour-interview/index.html,"CNN Exclusive: Anna Wintour says it's time to 'stand up for what you believe in' Updated 9th April 2019 Written by Fiona Sinclair Scott , CNN; Interview by Christiane Amanpour , CNN New York CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour interviewed Anna Wintour in New York on Friday April 5, 2019. Anna Wintour's omnipresent status, crafted over a three-decade-long career at the helm of Vogue, is unrivaled in the fashion industry. Her reputation has transcended that of the magazine she edits, her image -- immaculately sliced bob, sunglasses -- now instantly recognizable in silhouette or line sketch.

Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images North America/Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows If the late Karl Lagerfeld was fashion's commander-in-chief, Wintour is its head of state, enigmatically presiding over matters of style and culture far above the average Vogue reader's head. She acts as a tastemaker and strategic adviser for the CEOs of luxury companies, uses her platform for philanthropic good (AIDS research in particular) and has transformed the Met Gala -- an annual benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute -- into a night of Oscar-level red carpet excitement and serious fundraising. In 2015, the New York Times reported that the gala had raised over $145 million under Wintour's reign, a figure that will likely surpass $200 million after next month's event .

Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Wintour will turn 70 this year and, if Vogue's assertion that she'll stay on is to be believed, she may be embarking on the most challenging years of her career. Like many legacy media businesses, Vogue and its parent company Cond√© Nast are undergoing a moment of reckoning. The publisher has recently shuttered a number of publications in its portfolio, including the print editions of Glamour, Teen Vogue and Self magazine. Yet, the Cond√© Nast offices in London -- often pitched as a ""digital hub"" for many of its titles, including Vogue -- have grown dramatically in size and scale over the last 18 months. New digital-only publications, including Vogue Business, have also been launched. Nonetheless, in the same way that steering a ship is entirely different from driving a speedboat, media giant Vogue can't adapt as quickly as some of its younger, smaller, digitally native competitors. 1/10 November 1988: Michaela Bercu photographed by Peter Lindbergh Wintour's first cover is considered the most groundbreaking. Staring model Michaela Bercu, it featured a couture Christian Lacroix jacket with a beaded cross, paired with stonewashed Guess jeans. The mix, styled by Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, had never been seen on a Vogue cover, and the magazine's printers wondered if it was a mistake. Credit: Vogue Speaking exclusively to CNN's Christiane Amanpour in New York, Wintour expressed optimism about the changing media landscape she now finds herself in. ""I think we're so fortunate today to have so many different channels in which to speak to our audiences,"" she said. ""If you go back to when I was a young girl growing up in Britain, and (when) I went for my first job, it was considered a great thing if we reached an audience of 90,000 people with a monthly magazine. Now we have, I believe, 22 million followers on Instagram alone at Vogue US. So we are talking to men and women all over the world ... in so many different ways (and) in a way that we couldn't possibly have imagined even 10 years ago, 15 years ago."" Anna Wintour on her Met Gala 2019 outfit Wintour was speaking the day after Cond√© Nast appointed Roger Lynch , former CEO of the music streaming service Pandora, as its first global chief executive. The news came less than six months after the publisher announced that it would merge Cond√© Nast International (headquartered in London) with Cond√© Nast (the US arm), a restructuring that also saw the company's CEO, Bob Sauerberg, step down. Rumors around Wintour's potential exit predate the latest upheavals -- and they swirled again last summer. Wagging tongues were once again silenced by Sauerberg's insistence that Vogue's editor-in-chief would stay on ""indefinitely."" 1/34 Anna Wintour attends the 72nd annual Tony Awards in New York City in June 2018. Credit: Walter McBride/WireImage/Getty Images ""Anna Wintour is an incredibly talented and creative leader whose influence is beyond measure,"" Sauerberg's statement read. ""She is integral to the future of our company's transformation and has agreed to work with me indefinitely in her role as editor-in-chief, Vogue and artistic director of Cond√© Nast."" Everybody is concerned about the climate crisis The fashion industry, in all its parts, is currently facing a number of profound challenges: its contribution to the climate crisis, the fur debate and issues around diversity and inclusion. While serious collective action to tackle climate change and pursue sustainable fashion has been slow to come within the sector (historically, advocacy has been left to a handful of outspoken figures like Stella McCartney), there seems to be a greater sense of urgency coming from the most powerful players across the luxury and high street fashion markets today. ""I had a CEO of a major European company in my office just yesterday to discuss (the environment),"" noted Wintour. ""Everybody is concerned about the climate crisis and what should be done to help. And obviously we're very aware, as other industries are, that we have been at fault and what can we do in the relatively short amount of time we have to course correct."" Interestingly, despite a number of luxury brands announcing they will no longer use fur in their collections ( Burberry , Chanel , Gucci ), Wintour doesn't reject its use entirely. Within the context of sustainability she asserted that ""fake fur is obviously more of a polluter than real fur,"" adding that it's up to the houses to work to make sure they are following best practices and are ""being ethical in their treatment."" Anna Wintour on fur and the climate crisis The issues attracting the most widespread attention today are, perhaps, those surrounding race and cultural insensitivity. In recent months, a spate of very uncomfortable and revealing mistakes have been made across the luxury fashion sector, with Gucci, Prada and Dolce and Gabbana all issuing apologies for racially and culturally questionable decisions. The spate of gaffs began late last year, when D&G created a series of videos to promote ""The Great Show,"" the fashion house's ""tribute to China."" The 40-second spots, which were posted on the brand's Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, depicted model Zuo Ye struggling to eat pizza, pasta and cannoli with chopsticks to the sound of stereotypical Chinese music. In the following months, Gucci and Prada were both called out for releasing clothing items and accessories that appeared to resemble ""blackface."" Vogue has been diligent in reporting brands' misdemeanors. But its judgment has also, at times, been found lacking. The magazine's US edition had to apologize to journalist and activist Noor Tagouri after it mistakenly identified her as a different Muslim woman in a photo caption. And in February, Vogue Brazil's style director Donata Meirelles was forced to step down after images from her birthday party showed black women in traditional dress welcoming guests and posing next to a throne -- scenes criticized for evoking slavery. Such incidents have forced the industry to reflect on the attitudes it produces and promotes. Today's readers and consumers demand more from the companies they engage with, and brands are expected to make their values known and be prepared to publicly account for their actions. You have to stand up for what you believe in and you have to take a point of view To this end, Vogue has made noteworthy efforts to diversify. In 2017, Edward Enninful replaced Alexandra Shulman as editor-in-chief of British Vogue, becoming the first non-white (and first male) editor to hold the role in the magazine's history. Then, last August, Tyler Mitchell became the first black photographer to shoot a cover story for Vogue, with his image of Beyonc√© gracing the cover of the US edition. Vogue Arabia's latest cover features a shot of three black hijabi models. ""Edward is a brilliant editor,"" said Wintour. ""And I think he's really, in his fearless style of editing, brought a completely different point of view to British Vogue -- with no disrespect to the editor that was there for many years before Edward. ""I think that he's very passionate about race. He's very passionate about politics ... He is taking a stand and he is not trying to please everybody, because you can't in this day and age."" Michelle Obama photographed by Annie Leibovitz Credit: Vogue Beyonc√© photographed by Tyler Mitchell for Vogue. Credit: Tyler Mitchell Wintour revisited the idea of ""taking a stand"" several times throughout the interview. Her engagement with US politics, most notably her support for Hillary Clinton during the last presidential election, is well documented. She put Michelle Obama on Vogue's cover three times, and the magazine has recently profiled Senator Kamala Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Asked what she was trying to say through Vogue's forays into politics, Wintour said: ""I don't think it's a moment not to take a stand ... I believe, as I think those of us who work at Cond√© Nast believe, that you have to stand up for what you believe in and you have to take a point of view."" She also addressed the fact that many of the political figures profiled are Democrats: ""I think it's very, very important to have a point of view, and we profile women in the magazine that we believe in ... After the defeat of Secretary Clinton in 2016 (in particular), we believe that women should have a leadership position and we intend to support them.""

Credit: Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Speaking about Michelle Obama, Wintour praised the former first lady for her fearlessness and for transforming the role. ""She was just so inspiring to so many women. And obviously -- on a very selfish note, speaking as the editor-in-chief of Vogue -- she did wonders for fashion. She loved fashion. ""We always had a tradition at Vogue to photograph the first ladies when they first came in to office -- some extraordinary, wonderful women, and it was an honor to photograph them. But they were always super cautious about what they wanted to wear and the image that they wanted to present: Nearly always a jacket, maybe some pearls if you were Mrs. Bush. But with Mrs. Obama, she was fearless and it was just such a joy for all of us that work in fashion."" New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who has been widely praised for her response to the terror attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, is another female politician who has been featured in the magazine. ""I think that she's an exceptionally direct, articulate person,"" Wintour said of Ardern. ""And there is no sense that she's ever on message. ""She truly brought the country together in such a remarkable way that I haven't seen many other leaders achieve. And she was just so moving, and when she said, 'we are all one country,' it was a message that a lot of other leaders could learn from."" Sometimes there has been a certain level of personal criticism directed at me that, possibly, might not have been (used against) a man in a similar position While clearly a supporter of strong female leaders and role models, Wintour also credited her father for inspiring her at an early age and guiding her towards journalism. The editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper for nearly 20 years, ""Chilly Charlie,"" as he was nicknamed, may have influenced Wintour in more ways that one. But rather than his notoriously inscrutable persona, she cited his ""decisiveness"" and ""passion"" as traits that rubbed off. Anna Wintour on her father Charles Wintour Throughout Wintour's career, her image has been a constant source of intrigue and mythification. Whether people believe she is simply a little frosty or capable of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" levels of tyranny unleashed by Miranda Priestly (a character said to be modeled on Wintour) on her staff, it's her sharpness that has enraptured the media and fashion worlds. ""Sometimes there has been a certain level of personal criticism directed at me that, possibly, might not have been (used against) a man in a similar position,"" she said. Her physical appearance, for instance, has been a regular source of discussion. Bringing up her weight herself, Wintour said she's often criticized for being too thin. Yet, she doesn't feel she's been greatly disadvantaged for being a woman. ""I'm very focused,"" she said. ""So I, maybe because of my clarity and my focus, haven't let it in."" Anna Wintour on her emblematic sunglasses With no personal social media presence, Wintour has succeeded in keeping her personal life private, forcing media speculators to lean on hints, rumors and deductions from her appearances in documentaries like ""The September Issue"" and ""The First Monday in May."" Sunglasses are perhaps the most obvious way she defends herself against attempts to deconstruct her. Worn throughout the entire interview, her eyewear is, she said, ""incredibly useful because you avoid people knowing what you're thinking about."" ""They help me when I'm feeling a bit tired or sleepy,"" she added. ""And maybe they've just become a crutch in part of who I am. But today I really did need them."" Offering a rare snippet of personal information, she admitted to feeling under the weather: ""I'll be brutally frank: I have been unbelievably ill all week. And, plus, I just had eye surgery, so those are the real reasons I'm wearing them today.""

United States Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles is being removed from his position, multiple administration officials tell CNN.
President Trump instructed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to fire Alles.
Alles remains in his position as of now but has been asked to leave.
The Secret Service director reported directly to the former Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned on Sunday amid growing pressure from the President. The director oversees the Secret Service's work on both protection and investigations. ""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" this official says.
US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick are expected to be gone soon, and the White House is eyeing others to be removed.
The President in recent weeks empowered Stephen Miller to lead the administration's border policies ""and he's executing his plan"" with what amounts to a wholesale decapitation of the Department of Homeland Security leadership, the official says.
Alles previously served in Customs and Border Protection leadership and also led that agency's Air and Marine Operations. He is a 35-year veteran of the Marine Corps.
It was not immediately clear what prompted his firing, but the Secret Service recently came under scrutiny after a Chinese woman illegally entered the President's Mar-a-Lago club carrying Chinese passports and a flash drive containing malware. 43 min ago She was next in line to be the head of DHS.

Claire Grady is currently serving as the acting deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. She‚Äôs technically next in line to be acting secretary. But President Trump said Sunday that Kevin McAleenan ‚Äî the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection ‚Äî is going to replace Kirstjen Nielsen in an acting capacity.
So, what happens to Grady? A source close to the situation said that Grady is, at this point, not expected to resign on her own.
If she was going to step down, another person close to her believes she would have done it yesterday. She is likely to force the administration to fire her from her position, which they have to do by Wednesday in order to make room for McAleenan.
So keep an eye on her. She's well liked inside DHS, too. 1 hr 8 min ago This is who is replacing Kirstjen Nielsen (for now) From CNN's Kate Sullivan, Geneva Sands and Jim Acosta Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images
Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, will step in as acting secretary of Homeland Security after the departure of Kirstjen Nielsen.
Here's what we know about him: His background: McAleenan is a career official who previously served as the deputy commissioner during President Barack Obama's administration. Where he stands on immigration: He was described by a senior DHS official as ""not an ideologue or fire breather"" on immigration. He has shared some of Nielsen's frustrations with Trump over his demands for DHS, said two US officials familiar with his thinking. Last month, he said the ""breaking point has arrived"" for the immigration system, and announced he was moving 750 officers to help Border Patrol care for migrants. His new job: He is expected to serve as the acting secretary ""in the short term,"" according to a White House official. Line of succession: Putting McAleenan in charge skips over acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady, which raises questions about her future.

She also thanked her DHS colleagues and said she has spent the last day working with officials on a smooth transition.

Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security who has become a face of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration push, is leaving the administration. ""Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service,"" Trump announced yesterday on Twitter.
Nielsen did not resign willingly, a person close to her told CNN, but was under pressure to do so.
Trump had grown increasingly frustrated with the situation at the border, which has seen an influx in migrants.
He has vented privately that Nielsen hasn't adequately secured the border or enacted stricter immigration rules, even as she became the face of policies that administration critics called heartless and illegal.
Meanwhile, Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable with the President becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official tells CNN.

AI guidelines: EU is making AI rules now to avoid a new tech crisis - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ivana Kottasov√°,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/tech/ai-guidelines-eu/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Social media faces a crisis of trust. Europe wants to make sure artificial intelligence doesn't go the same way.
The European Commission on Monday unveiled ethics guidelines that are designed to influence the development of AI systems before they become deeply embedded in society. The intervention could help break the pattern of regulators being forced to play catch up with emerging technologies that lead to unanticipated negative consequences. The importance of doing so was underscored Monday when Britain proposed new rules that would make internet companies legally responsible for ridding their platforms of harmful content. ""It's like putting the foundations in before you build a house ... now is the time to do it,"" said Liam Benham, the vice president for regulatory affairs in Europe at IBM ( IBM ) , which was involved in drafting the AI guidelines. People need to be informed when they are in contact with an algorithm and not another human being.""
EU Commissioner Mariya Gabriel
Read More The European Union has taken the global lead on tech regulation, introducing a landmark data privacy law last year while going after big tech companies for anti-competitive behavior and unpaid taxes. AI, which has captured the public's imagination and produced dire warnings on the potential for misuse, is the latest regulatory front for the bloc. It's not an easy topic. Google ( GOOGL ) , for example, shuttered its new artificial intelligence ethics council last week after a swarm of employees demanded the removal of the president of a conservative think tank from the group. Google scraps its controversial AI ethics council days after it was announced The European Commission has crafted seven principles for guiding AI development and building trust. While the guidelines are not binding, they could form the basis of further action in coming years. Transparency is key Mariya Gabriel, Europe's top official on the digital economy, said companies using AI systems should be transparent with the public. ""People need to be informed when they are in contact with an algorithm and not another human being,"" said Gabriel. ""Any decision made by an algorithm must be verifiable and explained."" An insurance company that rejects a claim based on an algorithm, for example, should ensure the customer knows how and why the decision was made. A human should be able to step in and reverse the decision. Amazon must let shareholders vote on limiting facial recognition sales, SEC says The European Commission said that future AI systems need to be safe and reliable for their entire life cycle. It also said that data protection must be a priority, with users in control of their own information. The guidelines put responsibility squarely on those who build and deploy the AI systems. ""If a company puts in an AI system, that company is responsible for it ... this is very important if there is any accident,"" said Gabriel. Avoiding discrimination Gabriel also said companies need to ensure their AI systems are fair. She said, for example, that an algorithm used in the hiring process that was produced using data from a company that employed only men would likely reject women candidates. ""If you have biased input data, that really can be a problem,"" said Gabriel. Who should get the credit for AI art? AlgorithmWatch, a non-profit group, said that while it's a good idea to put guidelines in place, there are problems with Europe's approach. ""The guidelines center around the idea of 'trustworthy AI' and that is problematic because it's not a well-defined term,"" said Matthias Spielkamp, the group's co-founder. ""Who is to trust and who is to be trusted?,"" he added. He also said that it is not yet clear how future oversight will be handled. Thomas Metzinger, a philosopher and professor at the University of Mainz, helped draft the guidelines but criticized them for not prohibiting the use of AI to develop weapons. New Zealand's privacy commissioner calls Facebook 'morally bankrupt' Others are worried about the impact the guidelines will have on innovation. ""We are concerned that the granularity of the guidelines, would make it difficult for many companies particularly [small and medium sized businesses], to implement,"" said Antony Walker, deputy CEO of TechUK, an industry group. The European Union will now try to work through these questions and others in a pilot program with Big Tech companies."
"Stanford expels student linked to $500,000 donation to sailing program - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/college-admission-stanford/index.html,"(CNN) Stanford University expelled a student who put false material in their college application and was linked to a $500,000 donation from the charity at the heart of the college admissions scam.
""We determined that some of the material in the student's application is false, and, in accordance with our policies, have rescinded admission,"" Stanford said in an update on its website. ""Any credits earned have also been vacated. The student is no longer on Stanford's campus."" The student is not named in the statement or in court documents. Stanford sailing coach John Vandemoer pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to commit racketeering for arranging bribes of $110,000 and $160,000 to the sailing program in exchange for falsely designating two applicants as sailing recruits. Neither of the students had competitive sailing experience, the criminal complaint states. The money was funneled from wealthy parents to a charity run by Rick Singer, who then directed the payments to Vandemoer, according to the complaint. Read More However, neither of those students completed the application process, so neither were admitted nor enrolled at the school, Stanford said. USC says students connected to cheating scheme will be denied admission A third student, though, was associated with a contribution to Stanford's sailing program from the charity central to the scam, known as Key Worldwide Foundation, Stanford said. ""The contribution was made several months after the student was admitted to Stanford. The student had no recommendation from the former sailing coach, or any other coach, and has not at any time had an affiliation with the Stanford sailing program or any other Stanford athletic team,"" Stanford said. Stanford said KWF contributed a total of $770,000 to the sailing program in the form of three separate gifts. Given that the two students who did not enroll were associated with gifts of $110,000 and $160,000 to the sailing program, the third student was therefore associated with a gift of $500,000. Stanford is the second school to expel a student as part of the fallout of the college admissions scam. Yale University kicked out a student two weeks ago whose family paid $1.2 million to get her admitted as a fake soccer player."
"Glaciers could disappear from several mountain ranges this century, study says - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Nina Avramova, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/world/global-glaciers-sea-levels-study-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Most glaciers in Central Europe, Western Canada and the United States would vanish in the second half of this century under the current rates of ice loss, according to a new report.
Glaciers have lost over 9,000 billion tons of ice between 1961 and 2016, according to a research letter published in the journal Nature on Monday. This amounts to a block of ice the size of Germany and almost 100 feet thick, or the size of the United States and 4 feet thick, said lead author Michael Zemp. How climate change is revealing, and threatening, thawing relics ""Under current loss rates we are going to lose glaciers -- basically all glaciers -- in several mountain ranges,"" said Zemp, who is a lecturer in glaciology at the University of Zurich. This ice loss has also meant global sea levels increased by up to 27 millimeters over the time period, said the letter, which was authored by 15 international scientists. This accounts for between 25% to 30% of the observed increase in global sea levels. In this latest research, the team used data from over 19,000 glaciers, including satellite observation and 450 field visits. That's far more than previous studies, which Zemp said relied on data from around 500 glaciers. Read More Glaciers are ""icons of climate change,"" the authors said, and the research suggests glacier loss may be larger than previously reported. In addition to raising sea levels, Zemp said that melting glaciers can destabilize mountain ridges. Glaciers can also be an important water source for agriculture. For example, in the Peruvian Andes, he said, households depend on local glacier water in dry seasons. Greenland's most critical glacier is suddenly gaining ice, but that might not be a good thing By comparing current ice loss rates with remaining ice volume the researchers found that glaciers in several regions, including in the European Alps, New Zealand and Western Canada, will disappear within this century. ""But behind that there is a second bad message,"" said Zemp. That mesage? In more heavily glaciated regions, such as the Canadian Arctic, the melting of glaciers has only just ""kicked in,"" meaning that these glaciers will continue to raise sea levels beyond 2100. Glaciers in other regions, such as the European Alps and New Zealand, also saw significant ice losses, the study said, but they played a small role when it comes to rising global sea levels because of the regions' small glacierized areas. Currently, up to 335 billion tons of ice are lost each year, the study found. This translates into an increase in sea levels of nearly 1 millimeter per year, according to the calculations. Calculations of changes in global glacier mass can be further improved, the researchers noted. One way to do this would be to have more observational data, especially from regions that are more likely to contribute to future sea level increases, such as Alaska, Arctic Canada and the Russian Arctic.

Martin Siegert, co-director at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and Environment at Imperial College London said that the research confirmed what glaciologists had expected for some time -- ""that glaciers around the world are contributing as much to sea level rise as the Greenland Ice Sheet."" Siegert was not involved in the new research. ""At the moment, their state of health is critical to how sea levels will rise over the coming decades,"" he said in an email. ""The outlook is bleak for these glaciers, however, with melting entirely over the coming century."""

"Measles: 78 new cases reported nationwide since last week, CDC says - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Debra Goldschmidt, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/measles-2019-cdc-update-bn/index.html,"(CNN) At least 465 cases of measles have been reported in the United States since January 1, according to the latest numbers shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday.
That's 78 more cases than the number reported last week and includes cases reported to the CDC by state health departments as of April 4; it therefore does not include cases reported since then. Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts and Nevada reported their first cases of measles this year, bringing the total number of states reporting cases to 19. The other states that have reported measles cases this year are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington. The total number of measles cases nationwide this year ""is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000,"" the CDC says. That threshold was reached last week when the national total for the year surpassed last year's total of 372. The largest outbreak was in 2014, when there were 667 cases reported nationwide due to several large outbreaks. Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable respiratory illness characterized by a rash of flat red spots. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Judge stops NY county from barring unvaccinated minors in public places as measles outbreak continues Read More As of Thursday, 17 cases were reported in California . New Jersey health officials reported 13 cases for the year as of Friday. Seven cases have now been reported in Illinois . Michigan reported 39 cases as of Friday, all but one of them in Oakland County. Florida , New Hampshire , Nevada and Arizona each reported one case in March. Indiana health officials reported the first case of measles there on Friday. Massachusetts health officials also reported that state's only 2019 case last week. Washington state reported 78 cases in an outbreak that began in January. That includes individuals in Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and Georgia who all became infected in Washington. (Hawaii is not included on the CDC list of states reporting cases because the cases there were reported by Washington.) Her son died. And then anti-vaxers attacked her Oregon has also reported seven other cases that are not linked to that outbreak. In February, Colorado , Kentucky , Connecticut and Texas all reported cases of measles. There is also an ongoing outbreak in observant Jewish neighborhoods in New York that began in October when, according to health officials, an unvaccinated child became infected with the illness while visiting Israel. ""Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn and Rockland County ,"" the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene website says. According to case counts from local health departments, at least 468 cases of measles have been reported in the state since October as part of this outbreak. On Monday, the New York City health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, ordered all yeshivas, which are Orthodox Jewish schools, in Williamsburg to prohibit unvaccinated students from attending. In December, Barbot issued the same order for yeshivas in affected parts of Brooklyn. Also on Monday, Rockland County Executive Ed Day released a statement to ""vehemently disagree"" with a judge's order issued late Friday that prohibits the county from enforcing a ban put in place last month barring unvaccinated children from public places. The ban was established in an effort to contain the outbreak there. ""I absolutely do not agree with the judge's opinion that this measles crisis does not rise to the level of an emergency, when, in fact, we are facing the longest lasting current outbreak in the nation, and the largest outbreak in New York State in 30 years,"" Day said in a statement. He noted that the judge's ruling does not apply to a separate December order that prohibits those who are not vaccinated or have not had both doses of the preventive measles, mumps and rubella vaccine from attending school.

Measles is endemic in many countries other than the United States. It is brought in when people who are unvaccinated or undervaccinated visit from a place where the virus is circulating or when people living in the United States visit such a place and return with an infection. Health officials have said that the proliferation of anti-vaccine rhetoric has, in part, fueled an increase in the number of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States."

Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, made the comments while speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington. He reflected on his personal struggles with his sexuality, his decision to come out in 2015 and the fact that his being gay is not the result of a personal decision. ""If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,"" Buttigieg said. ""And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."" Buttigieg's comments came hours after he made critical comments about evangelical voters' support of President Donald Trump during an appearance on ""Meet The Press.""

The two started dating four years ago and got married last June. Pence has drawn the ire of members of the LGBTQ community in the past for his positions on various LGBTQ issues. A staunch conservative Christian, he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act while he was governor of Indiana. Critics of the law contend that individuals and businesses could use it to discriminate against the gay community on the basis of religion. Pence also signaled support for federal funds to be allocated for gay ""conversion therapy"" on his 2000 US House campaign website, where it said ""resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."""

AI guidelines: EU is making AI rules now to avoid a new tech crisis - CNN,us.cnn.com,Ivana Kottasov√°,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/tech/ai-guidelines-eu/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Social media faces a crisis of trust. Europe wants to make sure artificial intelligence doesn't go the same way.
The European Commission on Monday unveiled ethics guidelines that are designed to influence the development of AI systems before they become deeply embedded in society. The intervention could help break the pattern of regulators being forced to play catch up with emerging technologies that lead to unanticipated negative consequences. The importance of doing so was underscored Monday when Britain proposed new rules that would make internet companies legally responsible for ridding their platforms of harmful content. ""It's like putting the foundations in before you build a house ... now is the time to do it,"" said Liam Benham, the vice president for regulatory affairs in Europe at IBM ( IBM ) , which was involved in drafting the AI guidelines. People need to be informed when they are in contact with an algorithm and not another human being.""
EU Commissioner Mariya Gabriel
Read More The European Union has taken the global lead on tech regulation, introducing a landmark data privacy law last year while going after big tech companies for anti-competitive behavior and unpaid taxes. AI, which has captured the public's imagination and produced dire warnings on the potential for misuse, is the latest regulatory front for the bloc. It's not an easy topic. Google ( GOOGL ) , for example, shuttered its new artificial intelligence ethics council last week after a swarm of employees demanded the removal of the president of a conservative think tank from the group. Google scraps its controversial AI ethics council days after it was announced The European Commission has crafted seven principles for guiding AI development and building trust. While the guidelines are not binding, they could form the basis of further action in coming years. Transparency is key Mariya Gabriel, Europe's top official on the digital economy, said companies using AI systems should be transparent with the public. ""People need to be informed when they are in contact with an algorithm and not another human being,"" said Gabriel. ""Any decision made by an algorithm must be verifiable and explained."" An insurance company that rejects a claim based on an algorithm, for example, should ensure the customer knows how and why the decision was made. A human should be able to step in and reverse the decision. Amazon must let shareholders vote on limiting facial recognition sales, SEC says The European Commission said that future AI systems need to be safe and reliable for their entire life cycle. It also said that data protection must be a priority, with users in control of their own information. The guidelines put responsibility squarely on those who build and deploy the AI systems. ""If a company puts in an AI system, that company is responsible for it ... this is very important if there is any accident,"" said Gabriel. Avoiding discrimination Gabriel also said companies need to ensure their AI systems are fair. She said, for example, that an algorithm used in the hiring process that was produced using data from a company that employed only men would likely reject women candidates. ""If you have biased input data, that really can be a problem,"" said Gabriel. Who should get the credit for AI art? AlgorithmWatch, a non-profit group, said that while it's a good idea to put guidelines in place, there are problems with Europe's approach. ""The guidelines center around the idea of 'trustworthy AI' and that is problematic because it's not a well-defined term,"" said Matthias Spielkamp, the group's co-founder. ""Who is to trust and who is to be trusted?,"" he added. He also said that it is not yet clear how future oversight will be handled. Thomas Metzinger, a philosopher and professor at the University of Mainz, helped draft the guidelines but criticized them for not prohibiting the use of AI to develop weapons. New Zealand's privacy commissioner calls Facebook 'morally bankrupt' Others are worried about the impact the guidelines will have on innovation. ""We are concerned that the granularity of the guidelines, would make it difficult for many companies particularly [small and medium sized businesses], to implement,"" said Antony Walker, deputy CEO of TechUK, an industry group. The European Union will now try to work through these questions and others in a pilot program with Big Tech companies."
How US border hardliners nudged out Nielsen - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-last-days-dhs/index.html,"(CNN) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left Washington last Sunday for what was supposed to be a week-long trip to Europe. While there, Nielsen planned to discuss cybersecurity and terror threats with senior UK and Swedish government officials, and attend a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris -- providing her a temporary respite from the tense situation at the US Southern border, where a recent rise in migrant apprehensions had drawn the intense ire of President Donald Trump.
Instead, the trip proved to be a miscalculation on her part, one that began a week-long descent into limbo for Nielsen that ended with her abrupt resignation on Sunday evening after meeting with Trump in the White House. Nielsen did not resign willingly, a person close to her told CNN, but was under pressure to do so. Nor did she fight or plead to keep her job, the source said. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster exposes Trump's immigration crisis The resignation ends months of speculation over her possible departure. It also demonstrates the power of immigration hardliners inside the White House, including national security adviser John Bolton and senior adviser Stephen Miller, who, despite her defense of the administration's controversial policies, still deemed Nielsen insufficiently tough when it came to stemming the flow of migrants to the border. According to multiple administration officials, over the past few months it had become clear to many inside the White House that Nielsen had few allies left in the West Wing, particularly following last year's departure of chief of staff John Kelly, widely seen as her biggest advocate in the White House. Read More Nielsen butted heads with Kelly's replacement Mick Mulvaney. Miller openly complained about her to the President. She was also a target of Bolton's, according to four people familiar with their relationship. Bolton often criticized Nielsen for how she was handling immigration issues and had no hesitation about expressing his reservations openly in front of President Trump. Nielsen had no ally in the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner either, who has become more involved in immigration talks recently, according to one administration official. In a sense, Nielsen had become an island unto herself inside the West Wing, and the people who talk to Trump the most were openly against her. By early Sunday, Nielsen knew how the day would likely go and that she would likely be forced to resign, according to a source familiar with her thinking. Shortened Trip In the weeks leading up to her Europe trip, Nielsen had been increasingly on thin ice in the eyes of the President. She apparently did not realize how tenuous her standing was when she left for Europe, but once there quickly realized her mistake and abruptly returned after her first day of meetings in London. Nielsen hastily left to travel to the US southern border, where she visited three border regions, ending at a stop in Calexico, California, to join the President. Scramble inside the West Wing over Trump's threat to close the border During the week, Nielsen did interviews -- including on CNN -- to try and improve the President's souring view of her, a source close to Nielsen said, but to little avail. Last week, she also convened an emergency call with members of Trump's Cabinet to discuss migration at the border. ""We are going to treat it as if we have been hit by a Cat 5 hurricane,"" Nielsen said on the call, a participant told CNN. The call took White House officials by surprise, according to a person familiar with the matter. Neither Miller nor Trump cared for Nielsen's decision to treat the situation at the border as a hurricane, the person said. ""People were caught off guard"" by the Thursday call, they added. It appears Miller did not know what Nielsen was up to, a major problem according to this person. At the end of the day, the source said, Nielsen could not make Trump happy with her performance on the border. This source said Trump might as well name Miller as the next DHS secretary. ""He's the one driving the policy,"" the source added. Miller was also behind the sudden withdrawal of the nomination of Ron Vitiello for director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which caught both Congress and the Department of Homeland Security by surprise. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination was pulled, a person familiar with the news said. Nielsen's resignation also follows plans to cut aid to some Central American countries, marking a sudden reversal after Nielsen had, days earlier, visited Honduras to sign a regional compact agreement with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Tenuous relationship Trump hired Nielsen as DHS secretary, based on a strong recommendation from his former chief of staff John Kelly, but the President was rarely happy with her, a source told CNN. Despite Trump's displeasure, she remained in place thanks to Kelly's ability to divert some of Trump's anger over immigration away from her and onto others, like former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to one source. There was also no clear replacement lined up in the event of Nielsen's departure. A key moment came in May 2018, when Trump and Nielsen got into a lengthy, heated argument during a Cabinet meeting focused on immigration. Trump was furious with Nielsen, telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground, citing the law in certain instances, the source said. Nielsen increasingly pushed back when the President lashed out at her department for not doing more to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants. A senior administration official said that in recent days Trump and Nielsen had again clashed over the issue. He accused her of not doing her job, and she responded forcefully. Around the midterm elections in November, it was expected that Trump would ask Nielsen to resign. After the departure of Kelly as White House chief of staff, speculation increased that she would soon be following him out the door. But by last December, sources told CNN that Trump had warmed to Nielsen, at least temporarily easing the tension in an explosive relationship that was once seen as untenable. Trump soon began praising her repeatedly behind closed doors, which surprised officials who were used to hearing his frequent criticism of her. ""People overplayed this idea that Gen. Kelly was her protector and that after she left the White House, she would leave,"" said a former DHS official. ""The very active and leading role that she took on immigration, re-established her with the President in ways that maybe when General Kelly was still there wasn't possible,"" added the former DHS official. But it wasn't enough to mend their relationship. And over the past three months, the surge of migrants continued to rise despite a slew of aggressive immigration policies. Child Separations Under Nielsen's leadership, thousands of families along the southern border were separated, sparking an uproar across the country last year. Though it was the result of a policy implemented last year by Sessions, Nielsen was often cast as the face of family separations, and endured withering criticism as a result. While frustrated, one of the reasons Nielsen decided to stick it out was to repair her image, a source familiar with her thinking told CNN. Incoming acting secretary of Homeland Security 'not an ideologue or fire breather' Still, that policy and others that make it harder for migrants to claim asylum appear to have done little to deter migrants from journeying to the US-Mexico border. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who is taking over DHS in an acting capacity, warned late last month that the US was on pace to encounter more than 100,000 migrants in March alone, making it ""the highest month since 2008."" Relief and exasperation A source familiar with Nielsen's thinking told CNN Nielsen is taking this as a relief. Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable"" with Trump ""becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. In California on Friday, a senior administration official tells CNN, Trump told border agents he wanted them to stop letting people cross the border, despite the fact that Central American asylum seekers according to US law can do so. It's unclear what Trump will look for in a permanent successor. For now, he has named McAleenan, the current CBP Commissioner, as acting secretary. Nielsen leaves behind a bare bones department that not only oversees immigration issues but also cybersecurity, infrastructure protection, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""We had a Secretary who knew cyber, knew FEMA, knew immigration,"" said an administration official. ""Now you'll get someone who knows border and immigration, but may not know the rest of DHS."" ""Secretary [Nielsen] worked harder than any cabinet person I know of, but probably had the most difficult job,"" the official added. Asked about the mood at DHS following Nielsen's resignation, one DHS official told CNN there was, ""some exasperation,"" adding that the department doesn't ""have enough depth"" to fill longtime vacancies. ""We are losing leadership faster than we can get it confirmed or even hired permanently,"" the official said, noting the number of acting officials in place heading units inside the department. DHS has had at least three positions filled by people in an acting capacity in senior roles. ""Now this is going to cause a massive move up the chain everywhere and it's rare an acting executive permanently selects anyone for those jobs so we'll be without permanent leaders that much longer."""
Sen. Cory Booker to introduce reparations commission bill in the Senate - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Rebecca Buck,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/cory-booker-reparations-senate-bill/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Cory Booker announced Monday he will take the lead in the Senate on a proposal that would establish a commission to study possible reparations, an idea that has emerged as a key policy question in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and won broad support from the candidates.
Such a commission would seek to remedy generations-worth of discrimination as a result of ""overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed African-Americans economically for generations,"" the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement, in addition to policies ""that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class"" but ""systematically excluded blacks."" ""This bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white supremacy and implicit racial bias in our country,"" Booker added. ""It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed."" 2020 Democrats vow to sign House reparations study bill The bill, originally introduced by former Rep. John Conyers of Michigan and currently sponsored in the House by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, has emerged as a key issue for 2020 Democrats -- and an area of consensus. At the National Action Network Conference in New York last week, Rev. Al Sharpton questioned one presidential hopeful after another on the measure and the candidates vouched their support. Now, Booker seems poised to emerge as the legislative leader on the issue. Read More The New Jersey senator has previously vented frustration that the question of reparations has been ""reduced to a box to check on a presidential list, when this is so much more of a serious conversation,"" as he told CNN's Don Lemon during a recent town hall in Orangeburg, South Carolina. ""Do I support legislation that is race-conscious about balancing the economic scales?"" Booker said. ""Not only do I support it, but I have legislation that actually does it."" On the campaign trail, Booker has promoted a ""baby bonds"" proposal that would give each child a savings account, with money added annually based on a family's wealth -- touting a Columbia University study that concluded such a program would ""dramatically reduce racial wealth inequality."""
Trump designates Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/iran-us-irgc-designation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced Monday the US will formally designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a move some in the administration had opposed over concerns about potential risks to US troops in the Middle East.
The step ""recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" Trump said in a statement that described the IRGC as ""the Iranian government's primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign."" Administration officials said the move is a response to Iran's destabilizing behavior across the Middle East, including support for the regime in Syria, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as for assassination plots in Europe and the US. The announcement aims to drive a stake through the heart of a central institution in Iran. Formed after the Islamic revolution in 1979, the IRGC is not only Iran's most powerful military institution, it holds deep influence over domestic politics and the economy, with interests extending to and beyond the construction, telecommunications, auto and energy industries. Iran responds Read More Beyond the internal dissent the designation triggered within the US government, the move could also increase tensions with allies, particularly Iraq , where the IRGC has ties to militias and officials, and Lebanon, where it backs Hezbollah, which is part of the government. Iran warned this weekend that if the US went ahead with the designation, Tehran would retaliate by designating the US military as a terrorist organization in return. On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif proposed that President Hassan Rouhani add American troops operating under the umbrella of CENTCOM to Iran's list of terrorist groups that includes ISIS and al Qaeda, Iran's state-run news agency said. The designation will be the first time that the United States has ever named a part of another government as a foreign terrorist organization. In an important step to counter the Iranian regime's terrorism, the U.S. has designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, incl. Qods Force, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

‚Äî Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) April 8, 2019 It takes effect on April 15, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the State Department Monday. Economic and travel sanctions on the elite military group mean any group or individual that does business with the IRGC could face criminal prosecution for providing material support to a terrorist organization. ""This historic step will deprive the world's leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world,"" Pompeo said. He warned that businesses with a presence in Iran or engaged with its companies will have to take extra steps to ensure they are not violating US sanctions. Brian Hook, a senior policy adviser to Pompeo, said Monday that the IRGC controls ""up to half Iran's economy."" ""It is absolutely the case that the IRGC amounts to a significant amount of the Iranian economy through pure kleptocracy,"" Pompeo said. ""Businesses and banks around the world now have a clear duty to ensure that companies with which they conduct transactions are not connected to the IRGC in any material way."" Concerns about troops Senior officials said the designation decision, formally under the State Department's purview, represents the next step in the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign against Iran, but the move had met with internal resistance because of concerns about American troops in the Middle East. Defense officials have told CNN that US troops in Syria and Iraq often find themselves operating in close proximity to members of the IRGC. The US has about 5,000 troops in Iraq and close to 2,000 in Syria. Last year, CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats cautioned the administration that designating the IRGC could pose dangers to US forces, according to one source familiar with the matter. Asked about the risks to US troops in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq, Hook told reporters at the State Department that ""the decision leading up to this process was a full interagency process that included every member of the NSC. We have taken all measures that are appropriate and prudent in the context of this designation."" He added that ""whenever we and other nations call out and expose the regime for what it is, it behaves like a mafia organization increasing its threats. We will not be deterred by their threats."" 'Prepared' Nathan Sales, the State Department's Coordinator for Counterterrorism, said the agency would not discuss details of measures being taken to ensure the safety of US personnel. ""I can assure you that we take force protection very, very seriously. And that is why we have run a robust interagency process to make sure that all interested parties are prepared for whatever the Iranian regime might throw at us,"" he said, speaking alongside Hook Monday. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, Pentagon spokeswoman, said Monday that ""the Department of Defense is prepared to implement the President and Secretary of State's decision to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization."" ""As a matter of policy, we do not discuss adjustments to force protection levels or measures for operational security reasons,"" Rebarich continued. ""As always, DoD has taken prudent measures to ensure the safety of our forces around the world, and maintain our readiness to carry out our missions."" #NetanyahuFirsters who have long agitated for FTO designation of the IRGC fully understand its consequences for US forces in the region. In fact, they seek to drag US into a quagmire on his behalf. @realDonaldTrump should know better than to be conned into another US disaster. pic.twitter.com/i4bcfgxybT
‚Äî Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 7, 2019 Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said it was ""fitting that the most dangerous terrorist group in the world, responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents and backed by a massive state apparatus and vast energy wealth, is being designated finally as a foreign terrorist organization."" The designation now means ""the US government can truly unleash its full economic, prosecutorial and political powers"" to punish Iran, Dubowitz said. Trita Parsi, the author of ""Losing an Enemy - Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy,"" warned that the designation carries significant political implications and ultimately will not serve US security interests. ""This move closes yet another potential door for peacefully resolving tensions with Iran,"" Parsi said. ""Once all doors are closed, and diplomacy is rendered impossible, war will essentially become inevitable ... this decision does not in any way shape or form serve US national security. On the contrary, it makes America less safe by making war more likely."" ""Even if future administrations would want to resolve tensions with Iran, the spiderweb of sanctions and terrorism designations makes any meaningful movement towards a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran politically unfeasible in Washington,"" Parsi said. Israeli reaction The move was warmly welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who thanked Trump in a tweet and appeared to take some credit for the move, which comes a day before Israeli elections. ""Thank you, my dear friend, President of the United States Donald Trump, for your decision to declare Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terror organization,"" Netanyahu wrote. ""Thank you for responding to another one of my important requests, that serves our interests and the interests of regional countries."" The IRGC designation follows Trump's March 21 announcement that the US would recognize Israeli control of the Golan Heights, a step that counters United Nations resolutions against land being seized by force. Like the President's decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognize the city as Israel's capitol, the Golan decision reversed decades of US policy and countered international norms."
Trump is removing US Secret Service director - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jake Tapper,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/randolph-tex-alles-secret-service-director/index.html,"(CNN) United States Secret Service director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles is being removed from his position, multiple administration officials tell CNN.
President Donald Trump instructed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to fire Alles. Alles remains in his position as of now but has been asked to leave. The USSS director was told two weeks ago there would be a transition in leadership and he was asked to stay on until there was a replacement, according to a source close to the director. Secret Service officials have been caught by surprise with the news and are only finding out through CNN, according to the source. Stephen Miller wants Trump to oust more senior leaders at Homeland Security A source familiar with the the director said his ouster was not related to the recent scrutiny the Secret Service got after a Chinese woman illegally entered the President's Mar-a-Lago club carrying Chinese passports and a flash drive containing malware. Read More Just five days ago, Trump said he ""could not be happier with Secret Service"" following the Mar-a-Lago incident. ""Secret Service has done a fantastic job from Day 1. Very happy with them,"" Trump said during a White House event when asked by reporters about the Mar-a-Lago trespasser. The Secret Service director reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned on Sunday amid growing pressure from the President. The director oversees the Secret Service's work on both protection and investigations. ""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" one senior administration official says. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen United States Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick are expected to be gone soon, and the White House is eyeing others to be removed. The President in recent weeks empowered Stephen Miller to lead the administration's border policies ""and he's executing his plan"" with what amounts to a wholesale decapitation or the Department of Homeland Security leadership, the official says. Neither the USSS nor the White House immediately responded to CNN's request for comment. Alles previously served in Customs and Border Protection leadership and also led that agency's Air and Marine Operations. He is a 35-year veteran of the Marine Corps."

There's this from CNN : ""Trump was furious with Nielsen [in May 2018], telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground, citing the law in certain instances, the source said. ""Nielsen increasingly pushed back when the President lashed out at her department for not doing more to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants. Read More ""A senior administration official said that in recent days Trump and Nielsen had again clashed over the issue. He accused her of not doing her job, and she responded forcefully."" And this from The New York Times : ""The president called Ms. Nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country, including doing things that were clearly illegal, such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum. She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws, court settlements and international obligations. ""Those responses only infuriated Mr. Trump further. The president's fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms. Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained."" There's a few things to think about here: 1) Trump believes to his core -- and he's not wrong -- that if there was one reason he won in 2016 it was because of his pledge to a) build a wall along our southern border and b) broadly toughen America's immigration policies. If there is ANY campaign promise that he is absolutely and totally committed to keeping, it's to be the toughest president ever when it comes to the border. One needs look no further than Trump's decision -- against his own party's wishes -- to declare a state of emergency on the southern border in order to re-appropriate money to build his wall. Or his push behind the scenes, reported by CNN Monday, to reinstate the policy of family separation at the border that led to a slew of very young children taken from their parents without any real way to track their whereabouts. 2) Trump has very little understanding of -- or care for -- boundaries of any sort. And that goes double for immigration and border issues because of everything I mentioned above. This is his issue. This is the issue his people care about. And he'll be damned if he's told by some bureaucrat that he can't do what he wants on the border. That Trump would instruct Nielsen to block all migrants from entering the country and then blame her when she told him that was, in a word, illegal, speaks to the detachment from reality that President has on this issue. Combine those two factors and you get this, from a senior administration official on Nielsen's thinking : ""[She] believed the situation was becoming untenable ... [with the President] becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests."" Think of this in your own life. Your boss calls you in. She tells you to go find a Woolly Mammoth -- and to make it snappy. (You are an assistant zookeeper in this scenario.) When you come back to her empty-handed and explain that the Woolly Mammoth went extinct around 1700 BC, she tells you that you are not working hard enough to find one. And that if she was in your job, she would have found a Woolly Mammoth hours ago. And that everyone knows that you can find a Woolly Mammoth if you look hard enough. Look. There are a LOT of very tough jobs in the Trump administration: chief of staff, communications director and press secretary all jump to mind. But there is NO job more impossible than running the Department of Homeland Security. Nielsen made mistakes, sure. But focusing on her mistakes overlooks the real story here: Donald Trump wants impossible (and, at times, illegal) things done by DHS to address the border crisis. And if you aren't willing to bend (or break) the rules, he thinks you have failed him. And he might think you've failed him anyway; remember that Nielsen enforced a zero-tolerance policy at the border on family separations -- becoming the face of a deeply unpopular policy that Trump eventually walked away from. In short: It doesn't really matter who Trump names as Nielsen's successor. That person could be the hardest of hard immigration hard-liners. But that person will still be dealing with a Congress less than willing to greenlight some of Trump's more extreme border policies and, well, the rule of law. And no one person can change one of those realities, much less both."
Mick Mulvaney is simply wrong about Donald Trump's taxes - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/donald-trump-mick-mulvaney-taxes/index.html,"(CNN) Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" whether congressional Democrats will ever get to see President Donald Trump's tax returns. Here's how he responded:
""Oh no, never, nor should they. Keep in mind that that's an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the President could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn't, and they elected him anyway, which of course is what drive the Democrats crazy."" This is wrong. You can debate whether Trump should be forced to reveal his taxes under a 1924 IRS law, but you simply cannot successfully argue that the 2016 election was a referendum -- even in a small way -- on the President's unwillingness to release his taxes. It's also not the first time someone in Trump's inner circle has made this argument. Way back in January 2017, White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said of Trump's taxes that ""we litigated this all through the election."" Added Conway: ""People didn't care. They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
The fundamental logic flaw in the arguments put forward by Mulvaney and Conway is that any and all of Trump's flaws, transgressions or abnormalities are fully and completely exonerated -- TOTAL EXONERATION -- by the fact that he won. Read More Under that line of thinking, people who voted for Trump fully approve of how he behaves toward women -- more than a dozen of whom said during the 2016 campaign that Trump had behaved inappropriately -- and worse -- around them. And we know that's not true, since 70%(!) of the electorate said that Trump's treatment of women bothered them, according to exit polling . Painting with such an overly broad brush -- a la Mulvaney and Conway -- drastically oversimplifies why voters do what they do. Elections are never about one thing or one person. It's a choice, always, between at least two candidates. And voters are motivated by lots of different things at the same time. A look at the 2016 exit polling suggests that the primary motivation for voters who chose Trump was electing someone who could change Washington in fundamental ways, and they saw Trump much more in that light than Hillary Clinton. Four in 10 voters said that the most important quality they were looking for in a candidate was someone who could bring about change; Trump won that group 82% to 14% over Hillary Clinton. There were a total of zero -- that's 0 -- questions about Trump's taxes and his refusal to release them (making him the first president to do so since Watergate) on the exit poll . Zilch. Not a one. It is possible to make the argument that in voting for change, Trump voters saw his unwillingness to release his returns as somehow indicative of just how radically different Trump was than not only Clinton but also everyone who had held the office before him? I mean, I gue but almost certainly not. The most likely explanation is that while they didn't love that Trump refused to release his taxes, voters made their final choice on other issues -- again with his perceived power as a change agent right at the top of that list. Most polling since the election, in fact, shows a clear majority of Americans believe Trump should release at least some of his tax returns. In a Quinnipiac University poll released in February, a whopping 67% said they wanted Trump to release his taxes while just 24% said he shouldn't. That same poll showed a majority of Americans (52%) said Trump wasn't releasing his returns because he had ""something to hide."" (Nota bene: It's important to distinguish between people who say they want Trump to release his taxes and those who will vote against him for not doing so. The former number is high; the latter number not so much.) The argument over Trump's tax returns will turn into a legal one sometime very soon. The IRS isn't going to turn the returns over, at which point House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal will have to decide whether he wants to subpoena the returns. If he does that, we are likely headed to the Supreme Court. (Make sure to read this great explainer by CNN's Lauren Fox on what's next in the tax return fight .) But from a purely political perspective, the argument being forward by Mulvaney is nonsense. There is NO evidence to suggest that voters approved of Trump's refusal to release his taxes in 2016 -- and there's plenty to suggest that they were not (and are not) happy with that decision."
Pinterest files for an IPO and could be worth nearly $12 billion - CNN,us.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/investing/pinterest-ipo/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Pinterest wants to sell its shares at between $15 and $17 when it goes public. That could value the company at nearly $12 billion.
Still, that is less than some recent private valuations of the company. The IPO by Pinterest would follow the recent public offering by ride-hailing service Lyft ( LYFT ) . Several other privately held start-ups worth at least $1 billion are also preparing offerings later this year, including Uber, Slack and Postmates. Pinterest plans to sell 86.3 million shares as part of its initial offering, which would raise between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Pinterest files to go public. Its not-so-secret weapon: Moms The company was founded in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra, the last of whom parted ways with the company early in its history. Over the years, Pinterest has tried to evolve from being a digital scrapbooking service to a visual discovery tool, positioning it as a potential competitor to products like Google Search. Read More More than 250 million people now use Pinterest each month to bookmark or ""pin"" images ranging from recipes to home designs. While it's an impressive figure by many standards, it falls well behind other social platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which measure their audience in billions. Unlike Facebook ( FB ) , Twitter ( TWTR ) and Snapchat, Pinterest is not disclosing the number of people who use its service on a daily basis, which could raise concerns about user engagement. ""We do not anticipate that most of our users will become daily active users,"" the company said in its IPO prospectus. Pinterest posted $766 million in sales last year, an increase of 60% from the year prior, fueled by its advertising business. But like many other start-ups planning IPOs, it has never reported a profit. It lost $63 million last year, though that was smaller than earlier annual losses. It's also considerably less than $911 million and $1.8 billion lost last year by Lyft and Uber, respectively. This IPO market is nothing like late 1990s craziness Lyft ( LYFT ) went public on March 29 with an IPO price of $72 , but it has struggled to remain above that price many days since the first trade. It's relative weak early performance may have put a damper on the initial pricing range offered by Pinterest. ""It didn't help,"" said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. The mixed reception to Lyft's Wall Street debut ""showed that public investors are somewhat cautious toward highly valued, unprofitable companies.""

McLaughlin,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/south-carolina-student-death-mom-gma/index.html,"(CNN) The mother of Raniya Wright, the Walterboro, South Carolina, girl who died after a classroom fight, says Raniya's friends told her that a bully had been baiting the 10-year-old into a fight and caused her to hit her head on a bookshelf before she died.
Speaking to ""Good Morning America"" on Monday, Ashley Wright said she had complained to Forest Hills Elementary School in the past about the girl involved in the altercation. Raniya's classmates to wear pink and purple ""I notified the school and I also spoke with her teacher at the time about this same person,"" she told the morning show.

Fifth-grade girl dies after being injured in fight 01:36 Wright told the teacher she was ""leaving it in her hands to do something about it,"" but when Raniya got home, she said her teacher hadn't raised the issue. The mother further told ""GMA"" she had been complaining about the girl since Raniya was in the fourth grade, and Raniya's grandmother, who gets the kids ready for school while Wright is working, said Raniya had been asking to stay home from school the last couple of weeks, ABC reported . Read More ""My frustration is really towards the school system because I sent my child to school feeling like she can be protected while she's not in my care anymore,"" Wright said, according to ABC. Though school officials have released sparse details about the circumstances leading to Raniya's death, Ashley Wright said that her daughter's classmates told her the bully had been ""bothering Niya all day, wanting to fight her."" ""They were in the class,"" the mother said. ""The girl came up behind her and was hitting her all in the head. How long, I don't know. She pushed her or rammed her head or something into the bookshelf."" Raniya had no prior health issues, Wright said. School officials said there were no weapons involved in the March 25 fight. The school nurse called the mother around lunchtime, Wright told ""GMA,"" and told her that Raniya had ""been in an accident, a fight."" She was OK, the nurse told her, but she was complaining about dizziness and having a headache, Wright recalled. She didn't get a call back when Raniya's condition worsened, she said. Wright arrived at the hospital to find her daughter unresponsive and hooked up to machines, she said. Raniya's parents are still awaiting the official report on what happened to their daughter. ""I had to sleep by my baby the night before she passed, and that was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life,"" she said. ""It's just hard."" Officials said they stopped the fight, and Raniya was taken to the school nurse's station. She was unconscious when paramedics arrived, and they took her to a nearby hospital, according to a sheriff's office report. She was later airlifted to the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, where she died two days after the fight . From the state Senate podium last week, Sen. Margie Bright Matthews of Walterboro said she's spoken to officials -- including the substitute teacher in charge -- and wanted to correct rumors surrounding Raniya's death. ""I've heard a lot of people say, 'Oh, they were kicking her. They ganged her.' None of that. That's so far from the truth -- not even the banging of (her) head. The head was not even an issue,"" she said. Mark Peper, an attorney for the girl's father, responded, ""We are still awaiting official disclosures from the school district, police department and all other public entities, none of whom have provided our client with any pertinent information to date. If the events alleged by the senator (Tuesday) turn out to be factual, so be it, but our client deserves to know what happened to his daughter in a timely fashion."" A law firm representing Wright said, ""We are disappointed that Sen. Matthews would use the South Carolina Senate as the backdrop for her statements less than 24 hours before Raniya Wright is laid to rest."" Mourners brought balloons and stuffed animals to Raniya's school in her honor. Sean Gruber, a spokesman for the Colleton County School District, has declined to provide details, saying the district will not comment until police investigators release their findings. ""We realize and appreciate that people want to know exactly what happened in this incident. However, it is important for us as a school district to make sure that the Colleton County Sheriff's Office's thorough investigation, relying on all of the facts available, is concluded before we comment publicly."" A student was suspended, but it's unclear if the student was involved in the fight. Dozens of mourners stood outside a South Carolina church as the horse-drawn carriage with Raniya's casket arrived Wednesday for a celebration of life at Walterboro's Saints Center Ministries. ""Your wings were ready, but our hearts were not,"" said a message on the carriage's windows."
New York State Democrats make their own push for Trump's taxes - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,"Evan Simko-Bednarski, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/new-york-state-trump-taxes/index.html,"(CNN) New York legislators are making a new push for the release of President Donald Trump's taxes under state law, a move that could offer Democrats an end run around fights in Washington over the President's federal returns.
A bill introduced on Monday in the New York State Senate would authorize the state's tax commissioner to release state tax returns to Congress upon request. Trump is a New York resident, and the state is home to the headquarters of his family business, the Trump Organization. Though the legislation would only enable the release of the President's state returns, the fact that much of the President's business has been conducted in New York means that such returns could be nearly as telling as his federal returns. The measure is being sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman. Read More If passed, the bill would authorize the commissioner of the state's Department of Taxation and Finance to hand over tax returns at the request of the US House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee, the US Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation, Hoylman's spokeswoman Avery Cohen told CNN. She added that the bill would stipulate that the request be ""for a specified and legitimate legislative purpose."" A spokesman for New York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins told CNN Monday that the bill is under consideration. ""It is something we will be discussing as Conference to decide if and when to move forward on this legislation,"" said Mike Murphy, the spokesperson for Stewart-Cousins, said. Senate Republican leadership did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hoylman has a history of pursuing legislation to uncover Trump's financial history. Last year, Hoylman sponsored a bill that would have required any presidential or vice presidential candidate who wished to appear on the ballot in New York to file five years of federal income tax returns with the state Board of Elections. That bill, known as the ""tax returns uniformly made public"" -- or TRUMP -- act, was defeated in committee. Hoylman is currently sponsoring a similar bill which is before the state senate's elections committee. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, the first president in over 40 years to do so. He has claimed that ongoing Internal Revenue Service audits prevent him from doing so, despite the fact that no such audit would prohibit their release."
"Stanford expels student linked to $500,000 donation to sailing program - CNN",us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/college-admission-stanford/index.html,"(CNN) Stanford University expelled a student who put false material in their college application and was linked to a $500,000 donation from the charity at the heart of the college admissions scam.
""We determined that some of the material in the student's application is false, and, in accordance with our policies, have rescinded admission,"" Stanford said in an update on its website. ""Any credits earned have also been vacated. The student is no longer on Stanford's campus."" The student is not named in the statement or in court documents. Stanford sailing coach John Vandemoer pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to commit racketeering for arranging bribes of $110,000 and $160,000 to the sailing program in exchange for falsely designating two applicants as sailing recruits. Neither of the students had competitive sailing experience, the criminal complaint states. The money was funneled from wealthy parents to a charity run by Rick Singer, who then directed the payments to Vandemoer, according to the complaint. Read More However, neither of those students completed the application process, so neither were admitted nor enrolled at the school, Stanford said. USC says students connected to cheating scheme will be denied admission A third student, though, was associated with a contribution to Stanford's sailing program from the charity central to the scam, known as Key Worldwide Foundation, Stanford said. ""The contribution was made several months after the student was admitted to Stanford. The student had no recommendation from the former sailing coach, or any other coach, and has not at any time had an affiliation with the Stanford sailing program or any other Stanford athletic team,"" Stanford said. Stanford said KWF contributed a total of $770,000 to the sailing program in the form of three separate gifts. Given that the two students who did not enroll were associated with gifts of $110,000 and $160,000 to the sailing program, the third student was therefore associated with a gift of $500,000. Stanford is the second school to expel a student as part of the fallout of the college admissions scam. Yale University kicked out a student two weeks ago whose family paid $1.2 million to get her admitted as a fake soccer player."
"Woman accused of illegal entry to Mar-a-Lago had numerous electronic devices, thousands in cash - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/mar-a-lago-yujing-zhang/index.html,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) Yujing Zhang, the woman who allegedly breached security at President Donald Trump's private Florida club while carrying Chinese passports and a flash drive containing malware late last month, had a signal detector, other electronic devices and thousands of dollars in cash in her hotel room, federal prosecutors said Monday, suggesting the possibility she was trying to spy on the US.
Zhang appeared at a detention hearing in a Florida federal court Monday afternoon looking shaken and anxious in her jail uniform and handcuffs, her defense attorney presenting a receipt that she had paid $20,000 dollars to a private businessman to attend a canceled Chinese-American ""friendship"" event at the private club. Prosecutors say they found multiple electronic devices in her hotel room, including a signal detector that can seek out and detect hidden cameras, another cell phone, nine USB drives and five SIM cards. There were also several credit cards in her name in the room--at the upscale Colony Hotel a block from the beach. She also had more than $8,000 in US and Chinese currency, with $7,500 of it in $100 bills. Prosecutors have called Zhang a flight risk because she has next to no ties to the US. The federal magistrate judge who held the hearing Monday will decide next week if Zhang should stay in jail until she is tried, or be released to live in the US as she awaits trial. Zhang, 32, has not yet entered a plea to the criminal charges she faces, and prosecutors said they plan to formally indict her in the coming week. Read More ""She lies to everyone she encounters,"" prosecutor Rolando Garcia said. ""Her ties are all in China,"" he later added. Zhang arrived in Newark on a flight from Shanghai on March 28, Garcia said. She went to Mar-a-Lago on March 30. This wasn't the first time she visited the country in recent years. Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security Zhang arrived at Mar-a-Lago via taxi-to ""acquaint"" herself with club grounds, her defense attorney said, before the planned private but canceled event, which promoters had pledged the President's sister would attend. After giving the Secret Service her last name and showing her passports, making it through two security checkpoints and taking a golf cart ride with a club staffer, the Secret Service found she was carrying a thumb drive with malware, as well as a laptop, an external hard drive and four cell phones. She was charged with two counts -- making false statements to federal authorities and a misdemeanor offense of entering a restricted area without authorization. She has not been charged with any offenses that nod to international spying. However, the FBI has been investigating the Zhang incident as part of a Chinese espionage effort. Secret Service missteps In the first hour of the hearing, Zhang's defense attorney focused on how the Secret Service let her on the property, determined Zhang may have lied, and steps they took in questioning her that afternoon and night. ""The only thing Ms. Zhang did was give a very common Chinese name"" to gain access to Mar-a-Lago, public defender Robert Adler said in court. ""And, it was decided she be let in. I don't understand how this could support a trespassing charge."" The agent who questioned her, Samuel Ivanovich, testified on Monday for about an hour about what happened that day. Adler used Ivanovich's testimony to show flaws in the Secret Service's procedures. For instance, a Secret Service agent who spoke Mandarin was called in to help with translations hours into Zhang's questioning. Adler also had Ivanovich admit that the agency that protects the President largely relied on Mar-a-Lago staff to determine whether to admit Zhang, didn't see red flags in the devices she carried when they showed up at a metal detector checkpoint inside the club, and asked no further questions of Zhang when she first arrived once they believed she was related to another club member with the same last name. Adler pointed out her name was extremely common in China--one of the three most common last names in the country. The Secret Service has no audio security recordings of its interactions with her and what she said on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago, Ivanovich also said. Ivanovich, being questioned about the malware allegedly found on Zhang's thumb drive, said the agent examining the drive found a malicious ""file"" that began to install onto an agent's computer, and the agent looking at it said that had never happened before, and it was ""very out of the ordinary"" when conducting a criminal analysis. The agent looking at the drive had to stop the analysis and shut down his computer. Mar-a-Lago security Trump has described the Zhang case as a ""fluke situation,"" but the case so far has highlighted the possibility of security flaws at Trump's private club. Zhang talked her way into the club, carrying a large number of electronic devices including malware on a thumbdrive. At first, she told a special agent at Mar-a-Lago she wanted to visit the pool at the beach club--even though she wore a long gray dress and had no bathing suit. The Mar-a-Lago beach club manager then noted her last name matched that of a club member, and the club waved her in, believing her to be the club member's daughter, and ""due to a potential language barrier issue,"" authorities wrote in her criminal complaint. A golf cart shuttle driver then took her to the club's main reception area, where Zhang told a Secret Service agent she sought to attend a ""United Nations Friendship Event"" on the premises. Adler showed in court fliers that advertised in Chinese a similar-sounding event for that day. The fliers included a photo of Trump's sister, and may have come from a Florida businesswoman and a Chinese businessman who promoted events and attempted to profit off of political heavyweights he met in America. In essence, Adler said, the businesswoman Cindy Yang ""bundled"" the Mar-a-Lago event, then a man named Charles Lee ""repackaged"" the event, collecting $20,000 from Zhang so she could attend. Adler had a wire transfer receipt from Chinese contacts that showed this, he said to the judge. Trump is removing US Secret Service director Zhang had told authorities who were questioning her that her Chinese friend ""Charles,"" whom she communicated with over a chat app, had sent her from Shanghai to speak with the President's family about Chinese and American foreign economic relations, according to the complaint. The case comes as Democrats in Congress press for more information about security at Mar-a-Lago and, separately, for an FBI investigation into Florida businesswoman Li ""Cindy"" Yang's efforts to interact with Trump, after she appeared to have pitched to Chinese clients the opportunity to interact with the President and spend time at Mar-a-Lago with the President at a Super Bowl party. Previous hearing Zhang's two court appearances have run unusually long, with more details than usual about her and her case being presented to the judge. At the previous hearing, she admitted to owning a BMW and a home in China worth more than 1 million American dollars, and asked extensively about how she may get in contact with an attorney or find phone numbers of contacts in America if she were detained in a Florida jail. She said she worked as an investor and consultant who sought to develop business contacts in the US, but kept some money in a Wells Fargo account here--thousands less than what she actually had in her hotel room, the prosecutors say. She has been in jail since her arrest, with a court-appointed public defender representing her. The federal magistrate judge, William Matthewman, even noted the astuteness of her questions and her intelligence at the previous hearing. There's been some dispute over how well Zhang speaks and understands English, and the court has provided her with a language interpreter at both court hearings."
Stephen Miller wants Trump to oust more senior leaders at Homeland Security - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/miller-nielsen-trump-immigration-homeland-security/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is cleaning house in the Department of Homeland Security.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles have been ousted, and at least two officials have been named as possibly heading out the door: US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick. ""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" an official told CNN. At least some of the sudden personnel changes come at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who played a key role in Nielsen's ouster. The President in recent weeks empowered Miller to lead the administration's border policies ""and he's executing his plan"" with what amounts to a wholesale decapitation of the department's leadership, an official said. RELATED: How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen Read More The President has also pushed in recent weeks to reinstate the family separation policy, which Nielsen resisted, a source familiar with the discussions says. Trump rescinded that policy amid public outrage and scrutiny from the courts last summer. Miller's heightened influence within the West Wing has been aided by the President, who recently told aides in an Oval Office meeting that Miller was in charge of all immigration and border-related issues in the White House, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Trump administration officials say Miller wants the President to dismiss Cissna and Mitnick. Miller has always informally been one of the leading hardliner voices on immigration in the West Wing. But this change formalizes that role and gives him the ability to call and chair meetings on immigration issues. The change was first reported by The Washington Post . The sudden shift in personnel is indicative of the White House trying to redirect immigration policy following a surge of migrant apprehensions at the southern border in recent months. Kirstjen Nielsen just got pushed out of the most impossible job in Trump's Washington Additionally, after Trump walked back his threat to close the US-Mexico border and praised Mexico for doing more to stop the flow of immigrants, he has since soured on his own walkback. By the end of the week, the President became frustrated once again about the issues at the border, dissatisfied that Mexico was not doing enough and looking for his aides to take tougher steps to address the problem. The changes have left the department in limbo, which has had at least three positions filled by people in an acting capacity in senior roles. A senior administration official said that under the law, DHS Under Secretary of Management Claire Grady, the current acting deputy secretary, is next in line of succession to be acting secretary. That means there are questions as to whether she will need to be fired as well in order to make Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan the acting DHS secretary, as Trump tweeted Sunday night. Late last week, the White House abruptly withdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello for director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which caught Congress and the department by surprise. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination was pulled, a person familiar with the news said. ""It's pretty somber over here,"" said an ICE official, adding that there are still questions about why Vitiello's name was withdrawn. 'You've got a hard job' Nielsen had been on thin ice for some time. After the 2018 midterm elections, she and her advisers strongly suspected that she would not survive long. The President had long talked about making changes to his Cabinet after the midterms, and Trump was increasingly calling for drastic action to curb migration at the southern border. Nielsen realized that optics were what mattered most to Trump -- that's when she began to adopt a harder line and make a more public case for the President's immigration policies. In private, she also tried to adjust her style when talking to Trump, offering him workarounds to existing laws rather than simply telling him what he wanted at the border was not possible. It all ingratiated her to Trump, according to multiple sources, and the President began to believe Nielsen might be the right person to implement his agenda despite the challenges of the job. ""You've got a hard job,"" the President told her at the time, a source familiar with the comments said. At the same time, Nielsen worked with one of the President's closest advisers, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to broker a deal with Mexico that would allow some asylum seekers to wait in that country while their claims were processed. Nielsen also felt that forging a closer relationship with Kushner could help her get more stability in the job. She entered 2019 feeling that she had earned that stability. In February, she reshuffled her senior staff and began to eye additional senior hires. But the ground shifted under her faster than she could adjust. She began to grow concerned that her position might be in danger last week, when a newly empowered Miller indicated there would be a shake-up in several deputy-level positions at DHS. Nielsen tried to find solutions to the administration's chaotic response to the situation at the border that would allow her to remain in her position. She started to talk to White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney about bringing on an immigration czar to coordinate the administration's response -- and take some of the heat off herself. Ultimately, neither that nor her attempts to turn up the volume on her rhetoric were enough. ""The situation at the border just deteriorated super quickly,"" one source close to Nielsen said. RELATED: It may take 2 years to identify thousands of separated families, government says Asked about the mood at DHS following Nielsen's resignation, one DHS official told CNN there was ""some exasperation,"" adding that the department doesn't ""have enough depth"" to fill longtime vacancies. ""We are losing leadership faster than we can get it confirmed or even hired permanently,"" the official said."
ULEZ: London gets world's first 24-hour air pollution charge zone,us.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN Business",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/ulez-london-emissions-scli-intl-gbr/index.html,"London (CNN Business) London is the first city in the world to implement a 24-hour, seven day a week Ultra Low Emission Zone, inside which vehicles will have to meet tough emissions standards or face a charge.
Monday's introduction of the zone, known as the ULEZ, aims to reduce toxic air pollution and protect public health, according to a press release from the office of Sadiq Khan, mayor of London. Vehicles are responsible for around half of harmful nitrogen oxide air emissions in the British capital, contributing to a toxic air health crisis that increases the risk of asthma, cancer and dementia as well as causing thousands of premature deaths every year, the release says. ""This is a landmark day for our city. Our toxic air is an invisible killer responsible for one of the biggest national health emergencies of our generation,"" Khan said in the statement. ""The ULEZ is the centerpiece of our plans to clean up London's air -- the boldest plans of any city on the planet, and the eyes of the world are on us."" Read More Under new rules introduced April 8, polluting vehicles will be discouraged from entering the ULEZ thanks to a daily charge of ¬£12.50 (around $16) for some cars, vans and motorbikes and ¬£100 ($130) for trucks, buses and coaches. The zone will cover the same area as the existing Congestion Charge -- collected from drivers in the city center -- until 2021, when it will be expanded to cover the area between the major orbital roads known as the North and South Circular. Drivers can check whether their vehicle meets ULEZ emission standards using an online tool provided by travel authority Transport for London. The ULEZ is the next stage in a plan to clean up London's air, which started with the so-called T-charge -- an extra charge for highly polluting vehicles in the city center -- introduced in February 2017. Since then, the number of vehicles entering the zone has fallen by around 11,000 per day, according to official figures, and there has been a 55% increase in emissions-compliant vehicles in the zone. London's famous red bus fleet is also being updated as part of these efforts, and all 9,200 vehicles will meet or exceed ULEZ standards by October 2020, according to the mayor's office. As things stand, some 2 million Londoners live in areas where nitrogen dioxide levels are above legal limits set by the European Union. However, these measures will ensure that air pollution will meet legal requirements in six years, according to an analysis by academics at King's College London. The toxic air health crisis causes thousands of premature deaths per year, the Mayor of London said. Air pollution disproportionately affects less wealthy city dwellers, according to Khan. ""This is also about social justice -- people in the most deprived parts of London, who are least likely to own a car, suffer the worst effects of harmful air pollution."" And young children will also see major health benefits. ""Air pollution can have major health implications on the developing child, with early exposure proven to increase the risk of asthma and lung infections, and these can be life-threatening,"" said Professor Jonathan Grigg of the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health in the press release. London's low-emission zone ineffective in improving child lung health, study says However, a November 2018 study questioned the effectiveness of low-emission zones introduced in 2008, finding no evidence of a decline in the number of children with reduced lung capacities or asthmatic symptoms since the implementation of the low emission zones in London. The authors called for more ambitious control measures to improve childhood respiratory health. And Daniela Fecht -- a lecturer in geospatial health at Imperial College London, who worked on a study looking at asthma and air pollution in the city on behalf of the Greater London Authority -- told CNN the ULEZ is expected to bring benefits, but results should be closely monitored. ""The ULEZ is a very good initiative which is needed to bring down traffic-related air pollution levels in London,"" Fecht said in an email. ""The effectiveness will have to be carefully evaluated as previous schemes both in London and internationally did not bring down air pollution concentrations as much as expected due to various factors."" Fecht says she believes the benefits will be felt even by those who do not live or spend a lot of time in the ULEZ, particularly vulnerable populations such as children going to school in central London; individuals with pre-existing health conditions that are worsened by air pollution; and people working, traveling through or exercising in inner London. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo are also working on a congestion pricing model that aims to reduce traffic and fund improvements to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority public transportation network. Details were announced in late February."
Matteo Salvini seeks to unite Europe's far-right ahead of EU elections,us.cnn.com,"Hada Messia and Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/europe/matteo-salvini-far-right-european-elections/index.html,"Milan, Italy (CNN) Italy's Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, has launched what amounts to a ""Make Europe Great Again"" campaign, in an attempt to unite far-right political parties across the continent ahead of parliamentary elections next month.
""For many Europeans, the EU (European Union) is a nightmare,"" he told reporters after the leaders of some of Europe's far-right parties met in Milan on Monday to form an alliance called ""Towards a Europe of Common Sense."" The group hopes to form a majority bloc in the European Parliament, following elections from May 23 to 26. Slovakia's 'Erin Brockovich' elected first female president, in rebuke of populism ""We are ready to take on Europe,"" Salvini told reporters and supporters in Milan, the city where his party was, until recently, based. Notably missing from the meeting were France's National Front party leader Marine Le Pen, whom Salvini met in Paris on Thursday, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Le Pen's spokesman, Alain Vizier, said in a statement that she was ""busy with her election campaign."" Read More When asked why Le Pen did not attend the conference, Salvini said: ""I represent the whole (Europe of Nations and Freedom) ENF group,"" he said. ""I speak for the French, the Austrians, the Dutch members."" J√∂rg Meuthen, co-president of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, was at the meeting, along with Olli Kotro, head of the Finns Party (ECR), and Anders Vistisen from the Danish People's Party. 'Natural allies' Ahead of the conference, Salvini told Italian newspaper La Stampa, ""We share the same objectives, the same ideals and values. We are natural allies."" Those objectives center on Salvini's hardline approach to migration from North Africa. In June 2018, Salvini made good on a campaign promise to close Italy's ports -- which had seen more than 600,000 migrants and refugees enter the country since 2012 -- to rescue boats. ""The goal is not to redistribute those who enter Europe clandestinely,"" Salvini said. ""We have a platform to protect our borders and national identities."" Trumpesque alt-right nationalism must be defeated in Europe Among the alliance's aims is a plan to bolster the European Union's border protection agency, Frontex, by as many as 10,000 people. ""Europe is lacking behind on both national security and immigration. European Union security must have a higher priority than in the past,"" Vistisen from the Danish People's Party said during the meeting. Steve Bannon, U.S. President Donald Trump's former White House chief strategist, has been vocal in his support for Salvini, meeting him in Italy last September. On a recent trip to Rome, Bannon said Italy was especially important in the global power struggle. ""It's the center of the universe because of, really, the rise of Salvini and what Salvini means for Europe and what he means as a political figure for the world,"" Bannon told journalists at a press conference in Rome last month. Bannon is one of the founders of a group he calls The Movement, a far-right organization based in Brussels that provides support to European right-wing nationalist parties, including Salvini's party. Salvini has kept his distance -- at least in public -- but often uses the same rhetoric as Bannon against globalists, Brussels and the ""elite."" Bannon said all eyes were on the European elections, and on Salvini and other European nationalist parties' possible victory. ""I just think there is real momentum,"" he told CNN, following strong performances by right-wing parties in southern Italy and the Netherlands. Populist momentum There is ""real momentum on the populist nationalist side, a sovereignty movement,"" Bannon said. ""I think people are coming to this cause and I think it is going to have tremendous support."" Salvini's party, the League (formerly known as the Northern League), is already part of the ENF coalition in the European Parliament. But Salvini and other members are hoping to increase their number of seats to give them a greater voice in European affairs. JUST WATCHED Comment: Europe on the ropes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Comment: Europe on the ropes 02:05 The League has enjoyed considerable success in recent regional elections in Italy; opinion polls suggest it has a lead over its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S). In recent polls, Salvini's party has not run with the Five Star Movement, headed by the party's charismatic 32-year-old leader, Luigi Di Maio, who shares the title of Deputy Prime Minister and is also Italy's Economic Development and Labor Minister. Nadia Urbinati, a political science professor at Columbia University, says part of Salvini's success has been his visible role as Italy's Interior Minister, which allows him to campaign while on the job -- particularly on the issues of migration and national security. ""He can strengthen his popularity on immigrants and by using arguments of security in order to appear he is acting in favor of the Italian public,"" Urbinati says.

US skyscrapers kill up to 600 million birds each year,us.cnn.com,"Lianne Kolirin, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/americas/bird-building-collisions-scli-intl-scn/index.html,"(CNN) Around 600 million birds die every year in the United States after striking tall buildings -- with Chicago, Houston and Dallas being especially deadly, according to research from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology .
Attracted to the artificial light in high-rise blocks, birds can become disorientated and crash into walls -- many of which are made of glass -- suffering injury and often death. The issue is particularly stark during migratory seasons in spring and fall, when billions of birds pass through the central United States on their way between Canada and Latin America, according to the ornithology lab, which has just issued a list of the most dangerous cities for migrating birds. It estimates that well over half a billion birds are dying in this way every year in America. Birds in Minnesota keep crashing into things and police think it's because they're drunk Chicago is the most dangerous place for birds during both seasons, closely followed by Houston and Dallas. There, accidents kill birds that have covered thousands of miles on their journeys only to perish in seconds as they collide with glass buildings. Kyle Horton is the lead author of the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment last week. Read More ""Chicago, Houston, and Dallas are uniquely positioned in the heart of North America's most trafficked aerial corridors. This, in combination with being some of the largest cities in the US, make them a serious threat to the passage of migrants, regardless of season,"" he said in a statement posted online by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology. An American redstart killed in a building collision It is hard to quantify the exact number of casualties, but research published by The Condor: Ornithological Applications in 2014 suggested that as many as 1 billion birds die as a result each year in the US alone. ""This magnitude of mortality would place buildings behind only free-ranging domestic cats among sources of direct human-caused mortality of birds,"" that report concluded. Loss of the night: Light pollution rising rapidly on a global scale Skyscrapers are at the heart of the problem, according to New York City Audubon , which aims to protect wild birds and their natural habitat in the city -- which ranked seventh-worst for the spring migration and was the fifth-worst during the fall. The problem is exacerbated by the migration's timing, as many birds fly at night. Attracted by the glow of skyscrapers in the dark, they are vulnerable to collision -- either with each other or the buildings. For some, the light can prove so disorientating that they flutter around for hours, eventually becoming exhausted and landing in inhospitable environments. 2,000 snow geese drop dead from the sky in Idaho Birds can also become confused by windows with plants behind them, mistaking them for a safe landing spot. Reflective glass next to gardens and parkland can also prove problematic, promising a safe haven where none exists, according to New York City Audubon, which runs Project Safe Flight. Started in 1997, Project Safe Flight relies on volunteers to prevent collisions, rescue injured birds and count those that have perished. Meanwhile, an affiliate program, Lights Out New York, encourages owners of tall buildings to turn off lights during the two migration seasons to help protect the birds and reduce energy costs. Awe-inspiring animal migrations that send people flocking Homeowners in the most affected areas can also play their part, according to Horton. ""If you don't need lights on, turn them off,"" he recommends. ""It's a large-scale issue, but acting even at the very local level to reduce lighting can make a difference. While we're hopeful that major reductions in light pollution at the city level are on the horizon, we're excited that even small-scale actions can make a big difference."""
"Facebook: New Zealand official calls the company ""morally bankrupt""",us.cnn.com,"Jordan Valinsky, CNN Business",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/tech/facebook-new-zealand/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) A top New Zealand official blasted Facebook in a series of now-deleted tweets, calling the company ""morally bankrupt pathological liars.""

New Zealand Privacy Commissioner John Edwards He added that they ""allow the live streaming of suicides, rapes, and murders, continue to host and publish the mosque attack video, allow advertisers to target 'Jew haters' and other hateful market segments, and refuse to accept any responsibility for any content or harm."" Edwards said Facebook enabled genocide in Myanmar, because of efforts on the social network to whip up hatred against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority group in the Southeast Asian country . He also said Facebook helped undermine democratic institutions. Edwards said in another tweet that ""They #DontGiveAZuck,"" according to the Herald . He later deleted the tweets, ""because of the volume of toxic and misinformed traffic they prompted,"" Edwards explained in another tweet . Read More Facebook ( FB ) was engulfed in controversy after a shooter in New Zealand livestreamed the March 15 attack on two mosques in Christchurch on the social network using its video tools. The shooter killed 50 people. Facebook later admitted its systems failed to catch and delete the video. The company explained that the shooter's video did not trigger Facebook's automatic detection systems because its artificial intelligence did not have enough training to recognize that type of video. The shooting was viewed live by fewer than 200 people and later viewed 4,000 times before it was taken down. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack in the first 24 hours. ""We are deeply committed to strengthening our policies, improving our technology and working with experts to keep Facebook safe,"" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business Monday. In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said a delay ""might"" have limited the number of views of a livestreamed video. A delay on livestreamed videos ""would also fundamentally break what livestreaming is for people,"" Zuckerberg said. He said livestreaming is more than broadcasting -- it's ""communicating,"" because people comment in real time. ""So if you had a delay that would break that,"" he explained. ""That was a really terrible event,"" Zuckerberg said about the terror attack. ""We need to build our systems to be able to identify livestream terror events more quickly."" Edwards criticized Zuckerberg's explanation as ""disingenuous"" in a radio interview Monday because the company wouldn't disclose to him how many suicides, murders or sexual assaults are livestreamed. ""I've asked Facebook exactly that last week and they simply don't have those figures or won't give them to us,"" he said, according to the Herald."
Warren Buffett has weighed in on what kind of CEO Wells Fargo should hire,us.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/investing/wells-fargo-warren-buffett-ceo/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Warren Buffett, Wells Fargo's largest and most powerful shareholder, doesn't want the troubled bank to hire a CEO from Wall Street.
Recruiting a Wall Street executive is ""automatically going to draw the ire of a significant percentage"" of the US Senate and House of Representatives, Buffett told the Financial Times in an interview that published on Sunday. ""And that's just not smart."" The comments from Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) owns nearly 10% of Wells Fargo, underline the deep political and reputational troubles at one of America's largest banks. Tim Sloan stepped down abruptly as CEO late last month after failing to stop the bank's two-and-a-half-year crisis. Wells Fargo ( WFC ) pledged to find an outsider to replace Sloan, a three-decade veteran of the bank who despite efforts to fix the bank was stained by its cultural problems. ""They just have to come from someplace [outside Wells] and they shouldn't come from Wall Street,"" Buffett told the FT. ""They probably shouldn't come from JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs."" Read More That would exclude several individuals who have emerged in press reports or analyst chatter as replacements for Sloan. For instance, former Goldman Sachs ( GS ) execs Gary Cohn and Harvey Schwartz have been linked in media reports to the Wells Fargo job. Both have denied interest. And analysts have floated the possibility of Marianne Lake, the well-respected CFO of JPMorgan ( JPM ) , as a replacement for Sloan. Lake would be the first woman to lead one of the big US banks. Wells Fargo's CEO is out. Here's how the bank can end its crisis Buffett's comments do not rule out the possibility that San Francisco-based Wells Fargo could turn to another rumored name: Richard Davis, the former CEO of US Bancorp ( USB ) . Davis doesn't come from Wall Street and he's even got roots in California. Wells Fargo declined to comment. Buffett continues to express optimism in Wells Fargo's underlying business despite the harm done by the fake-accounts scandal that erupted in September 2016. ""If you look at Wells, through this whole thing they're uncovering a whole lot of problems, but they aren't losing any customers to speak of,"" said Buffett, whose firm at the end of 2018 owned more than 400 million Wells Fargo shares currently worth about $21 billion. But Wells Fargo's business has been hurt by rising legal fees, a tarnished reputation and tough sanctions from federal regulators."
Univision sells Gizmodo Media Group to private equity firm,us.cnn.com,Tom Kludt,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/media/univision-sells-gizmodo/index.html,"New York (CNN Media) Univision made good on a promise to sell its online properties on Monday when it announced that it has sold Gizmodo Media Group, which includes the family of websites formerly known as Gawker Media.
GMG, which includes former Gawker properties Gizmodo, Jezebel and Deadspin, among others, as well as Splinter and the satirical site The Onion, is being sold to Great Hill Partners, private equity firm. Terms of the sales were not disclosed. ""Today's announcement is the culmination of a very thorough process, as part of Univision's broader strategic realignment and return to its core strengths in Hispanic media and marketing,"" Univision CEO Vince Sadusky said in a statement. ""Our aim from the outset of this process was to sell these assets as one, and we are pleased to have found a terrific buyer in Great Hill Partners that is committed to growing these properties. We are grateful to our colleagues at GMG and The Onion for all of their high-quality journalism and achievements as part of our company and we wish them and Great Hill Partners tremendous success."" The newly acquired assets will form a company called ""G/O Media Inc.,"" Great Hill said Monday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Read More Univision put most of its online properties on the block last year and enlisted Morgan Stanley to ""explore the sale"" of the digital asset -- a dramatic departure from the ambitious digital strategy outlined by the company when it acquired the GMG sites nearly three years ago. The decision to put the portfolio of sites on the block was a recognition by Univision that it needed to reshape its business, in part to placate its own private equity owners. Univison, a primarily Spanish-language media company, bought The Onion and its sibling websites in January 2016, ushering in a new effort to reach English-language consumers. Later that year, Univision won the Gawker Media assets, which were rebranded as Gizmodo Media Group, through a bankruptcy auction. When the company announced that it was exploring a sale last summer, Sadusky said he had ""no doubt"" that the sites ""can thrive even more as part of a company whose focus aligns better with theirs."" ""Likewise, it is important for Univision to exit a business which does not enhance our core mission, and instead refocus on our strengths,"" Sadusky said at the time. Whether a private equity firm shares the same vision as the journalists at GMG's fiercely progressive network of sites remains to be seen. James Spanfeller, who will oversee the newly-formed company, said the collection of youthful GMG sites are ""already the leader among digital media companies speaking to the 10-to-34-year-old market, and we are confident and excited to see that lead expand."" ""This opportunity comes at a time when the entire digital media category is beginning to be recognized again for its unique ability to meet the diverse content and delivery needs of consumers and advertisers,"" Spanfeller said in a statement. ""As the largest player in our space, G/O Media is in an ideal position to capitalize on this dynamic, and I am excited to collaborate with a great team that boasts an incredible track record to further expand our reach, add value to our advertisers and enrich our visitors' lives."" In a memo to staff sent Monday, Spanfeller gave a sense of how he intends to run the new company. ""I believe in the power of content, yes even in these platform nuanced times, and the idea of editorially driven businesses. And I am very excited to work with the wonderful brands that make up our company and all of you, the professionals who drive these brands day in and day out,"" he said. ""I also believe in the partnership that must work between both sides of the house to make media companies successful. While editorial independence is critically important, there needs to be a healthy and productive partnership with the business side for the company to be truly successful. Without an audience we have nothing to offer advertisers, eCommerce partners or subscription efforts. And without the revenue from those sources we have no way to fund the content and those who create it that attracts that audience in the first place."""
Telsa is helping Fiat Chrysler meet emissions targets,us.cnn.com,Charles Riley,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/tesla-fiat-chrysler-eu-emissions/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Tesla is selling emissions credits to Fiat Chrysler as the Italian automaker tries to avoid steep EU fines on carmakers who fail to meet tough new pollution standards.
The companies have formed an ""open pool"" that allows their fleets to be counted together under new rules that restrict emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to documents published by the European Union. The auto industry needs to slash CO2 emissions of vehicles sold in Europe by 25% to meet the aggressive caps by 2021, according to UBS. The Swiss bank's analysts estimate that will reduce EU carmaker profits by ‚Ç¨7.4 billion ($8.3 billion) combined. Companies that are investing heavily in hybrid or electric vehicle technology, such as Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) , are well positioned to meet the new standards. Laggards will need to find other ways of avoiding fines. London gets world's first 24-hour air pollution charge zone UBS analysts warned last week that Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) was the automaker with the ""highest risk of not meeting the target."" Read More ""Fiat Chrysler is facing the biggest challenges to comply with CO2 targets due to a period of under-investment in electrification,"" the UBS analysts wrote, adding that it's ""starting almost from scratch."" Joining forces with Tesla ( TSLA ) was one way for the company to reduce the risk of fines. Japanese automakers Toyota ( TM ) and Mazda ( MZDAF ) have also formed a pool. EU targets Fiat Chrysler said Monday that EU rules allowing carmakers to join forces to meet fleet CO2 targets provide ""flexibility to deliver products our customers are willing to buy while managing compliance."" ""The whole point of a CO2 credit market is to leverage the most cost-effective ways to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in the market,"" the company said in a statement. The Financial Times, which was first to report the arrangement , said that Fiat Chrysler was paying Tesla ( TSLA ) hundreds of millions of euros for its emissions credits. Fiat Chrysler did not comment Monday on the financial details. EU accuses German carmakers of colluding to delay clean air technology It's not the first time that Tesla has received a financial windfall from its traditional competitors. The company brought in millions of dollars earlier this decade by selling credits tied to its electric cars in the United States, where carmakers were struggling to meet sales targets for zero-emissions vehicles. Tesla could use the cash infusion from Fiat Chrysler. It reported a sharp drop in deliveries during the first quarter, heightening concerns about its ability to pay down its sizable debts. In March, Tesla paid off a $920 million bond that took a big chunk out of the $3.7 billion in cash it had on hand at the start of the quarter. That followed a $230 million payment the company made in November. Its next big payment is a $566 million debt issue that is due in November, followed by another $1.4 billion in notes that is due in two years."
Trump is removing US Secret Service director - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Jake Tapper,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/randolph-tex-alles-secret-service-director/index.html,"(CNN) United States Secret Service director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles is being removed from his position, multiple administration officials tell CNN.
President Donald Trump instructed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to fire Alles. Alles remains in his position as of now but has been asked to leave. The USSS director was told two weeks ago there would be a transition in leadership and he was asked to stay on until there was a replacement, according to a source close to the director. Secret Service officials have been caught by surprise with the news and are only finding out through CNN, according to the source. Stephen Miller wants Trump to oust more senior leaders at Homeland Security In an email to employees at his agency obtained by CNN's Jim Acosta , Alles told the workforce he was not fired, but was told weeks ago that the administration would be making ""transitions in leadership"" at the Department of Homeland Security. Read More ""The President has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction,"" he wrote. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said later Monday that Trump has picked James M. Murray, a career USSS official, to replace Alles. ""United States Secret Service director Randolph 'Tex' Alles has done a great job at the agency over the last two years, and the President is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country. Mr. Alles will be leaving shortly and President Trump has selected James M. Murray, a career member of the USSS, to take over as director beginning in May,"" she said. A source familiar with the director said his ouster was not related to the recent scrutiny the Secret Service got after a Chinese woman illegally entered the President's Mar-a-Lago club carrying Chinese passports and a flash drive containing malware. Just five days ago, Trump said he ""could not be happier with Secret Service"" following the Mar-a-Lago incident. ""Secret Service has done a fantastic job from Day 1. Very happy with them,"" Trump said during a White House event when asked by reporters about the Mar-a-Lago trespasser. The Secret Service director reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned on Sunday amid growing pressure from the President. The director oversees the Secret Service's work on both protection and investigations. ""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" one senior administration official says. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen United States Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick are expected to be gone soon, and the White House is eyeing others to be removed.

Pete Buttigieg's unlikely rise as a symbol of LGBT progress - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/pete-buttigieg-lgbt-progress/index.html,"(CNN) Before South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg captured the nation's attention as a serious contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, he was in Iowa, laying the groundwork for his forthcoming bid.
Addressing a gathering of progressive activists, Buttigieg, who is gay and married to his husband, Chasten, reflected on the impact decisions made in Washington have had on his life. ""Sitting down to Christmas dinner at the side of my husband, whose marriage to me, our family ‚Äî not its well-being but its existence ‚Äî comes by the grace of single vote on the United States Supreme Court,"" he said in December. After the event, a group of women mingled near the elevators and reflected on their first impression of the South Bend mayor. ""I like that Mayor Pete guy,"" one woman standing near the elevator said to the others. ""He's gay and going places."" Read More Pete Buttigieg says his team raised more than $7 million in first quarter In the months since, Buttigieg went from the obscure mayor of a small city to a standout contender within the Democratic field of candidates looking to take on President Donald Trump next year. And being gay, while not the entirety of Buttigieg's story, is a key aspect of his identity, something that voters say sets him apart from the other candidates and something that Buttigieg has highlighted more as he began to rise in prominence. His campaign has worked to seize on his newfound status in recent weeks by tapping into LGBT communities for support and money. His swift rise as the only member of the LGBT community in the race has also prompted a broader conversation about the importance of his identity and the progress made on LGBT rights in the course of just a decade. ""The fact that his sexual orientation is not the headline, that he is being received as a credible qualified candidate for president, just as all the others are, is without question is a profound sign of our progress,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT advocacy group in the United States. 'Not eager to become a poster child' All of it is a bit of an adjustment for the mayor, who once wrote that he came out later in life, in part, because he didn't want to become ""a poster child for LGBT issues."" In ""Shortest Way Home,"" the mayor's pre-campaign memoir, Buttigieg writes that he worried his coming out would turn into something he is not. ""I had strongly supported the causes from the beginning, but did not want to be defined by them,"" he wrote. Speaking at the Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington, DC, on Sunday, an event that is meant to raise money for LGBTQ candidates across the country, Buttigieg took that a step further and told attendees that dealing with his sexual orientation was ""a kind of war."" ""If you could have offered me a pill that could make me straight, I would have swallowed it before you could give me a swig of water,"" Buttigieg said. ""It's a hard thing to think about now. If you had shown me exactly what it was that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife."" He added later: ""Thank God there was no pill. Thank God there was no knife."" Buttigieg goes on to write in his memoir that it was his deployment to Afghanistan in 2014 that forced him to come to terms with his public and private life. Despite the fact that Buttigieg, as a student at Harvard, used the earliest iterations of Facebook to see which men identified as ""seeking men"" on the site, it wasn't until he reflected ""on the possibility that I might get killed in action, thirty-two years old, single for basically all my adult life"" that he realized he ""needed to come out."" He did so in a June 2015 essay in the South Bend Tribune, where he nodded to the fact that the Supreme Court would soon decide on whether gay marriage was legal nationally by writing that he felt his public coming out ""could do some good"" for people struggling with their sexuality. As the only gay candidate in the race, Buttigieg has also been asked questions that other candidates haven't had to address. During an appearance on The Breakfast Club in March, Buttigieg was asked about how he feels about Chick-fil-A , a chicken-centric fast food company that has faced criticism -- and, in some cases, boycotts -- from gay rights advocates for its donations to anti-gay groups and anti-gay comments by Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy. ""I do not approve of their politics, but I kind of approve of their chicken,"" Buttigieg said. He later added at another event that while he supports people's right to boycott companies and spend their money however they please, he worries it leads people to ""sometimes slip into a sort of virtue signaling in some cases where we're not really being consistent."" Buttigieg says he doesn't support boycotts of companies over political donations It was a nuanced view on a controversial subject within the LGBT community and was not universally well received. ""It riled people in the LGBTQ community,"" Annise Parker, the head of Victory Fund and the former mayor of Houston who was one of the first gay mayors of a major US city when she was elected in 2010, said of Buttigieg's comments about Chick-fil-A. ""There are certainly folks on the left of the community who say that is not good enough. But I think that is one of the things that has caused a lot of folks to take another look at Pete is that he is a bridge builder, mainstream, middle of the road politician and he wants to find a balance and a position of fairness."" Even if Buttigieg wasn't looking to draw attention to his sexuality, it has found him during the presidential campaign. And that he is gay, in the eyes of gay rights advocates and political operatives, could be an asset. ""One reason Obama had a lot of success in 2008 was that he represented change in many ways,"" said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign manager and the first gay man who ran a major presidential campaign. ""I think Buttigieg represents change in many ways in a primary where voters want just that."" Mook added: ""All the gay men I know, they all want to give him money. It's not the worst demographic to raise money from."" Polling bears this out -- a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found nearly 70% of American are either enthusiastic or comfortable with a candidate who is gay or lesbian -- but it is still remarkable to those gay lawmakers who paved the way for a Buttigieg campaign. Former Rep. Barney Frank, who came out in 1987 and was, at the time, widely considered the most prominent gay politician in the United States, said during his decades in politics he never viewed his sexuality as an asset. For Buttigieg, however, it could be, he said, because it allows people who have had homophobic views in the past to atone at the ballot box. ""His candidacy is an example of the absolute speed with which we are getting there. I think it is very clear, his being gay is clearly an asset,"" Frank said. ""In a way, he gives people a chance to almost atone for past wrongs."" For those LGBTQ voters who have come to Buttigieg events, some because they support him and others because they are curious about a gay man running for president, the symbolism in Buttigieg's rise is powerful. ""I think it matters because symbolism is important. I think having that reflected in your leaders is important,"" said Adi Dubash, 37, who attended a Buttigieg event in South Carolina last month with his husband, Michael Upshaw, 34, and their 16-month-old son Finnick. ""But I think he has got the right idea because he embraces his identity and he wants people to know his identity but it is not all who he is."" For Upshaw, Buttigieg's presidential bid is about representation, he said, and being able to tell their young son that ""your dads are represented"" and ""you are growing up in a world that accepts people and families like you are growing up in."" ""That means a lot,"" he added. Radical normalcy One area in which gay rights activists are most pleased by Buttigieg's campaign is the way that his marriage to Chasten Buttigieg , a now ever-present figure on the campaign trial, has given increased visibility to the normalcy of same-sex marriage. Chasten, 29, has seen his online following balloon from a few thousand Twitter followers months ago to nearly 200,000 this month. He and his husband regularly tweet about the normalcies of life: Doing laundry on the weekend, reading on the couch and their two dogs. ""Doing a quick bit of laundry. Hear loud scream. Run into kitchen terrified, expecting to see @Chas10Buttigieg in pool of blood. Am thereupon informed that @Lin_Manuel is following my husband, whose life is now complete,"" Pete Buttigieg tweeted last month after the Hamilton star followed his husband on Twitter. Pete Buttigieg's not-so-secret weapon is his husband, Chasten Buttigieg reflected on his marriage at Sunday's brunch. ""Being married to Chasten has made me a better man,"" Buttigieg said, before the turned his focus on Vice President Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana who has a long history of comments of opposing same-sex marriage. ""And yes Mr. Vice President it has made me closer to god,"" Buttigieg said as the crowd gave him a standing ovation. ""If you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."" Pete and Chasten met online and the mayor proposed to his husband-to-be in 2017 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the spot where Chasten, a teacher, was sitting when they first connected on the dating app Hinge. The mere fact that the two are living their lives so openly on the political stage is a moment in the eyes of Parker, the head of Victory Fund and the former mayor of Houston. ""I have been an activist since the 70s and if you had asked me back then if we would have had a gay married man running for president, I would have thought you were crazy,"" Parker said. But it's the rise of Chasten Buttigieg's popularity that has really marveled men and women in the LGBTQ community, a rise that was recently cemented by the fact that the political spouse headlined the Human Rights Campaign annual gala in Houston on Saturday, hours before his husband headlined the Victory Fund event in Washington, DC. And Chasten Buttigieg, who came out at 18 and moved out of his home shortly after, has embraced the spotlight -- from the comical, like tweeting the hosts of Netflix's ""Queer Eye"" asking them to take him shopping, to the serious, like when he tweeted ""your time in the closet and your journey to coming out belong to you. ... You matter first."" For Frank, who married his longtime partner James Ready in 2012, making him the first gay politician to be married in office, the prominence of this LGBTQ couple has been remarkable. ""I got married, seven years ago. It was international news when I announced that I was getting married,"" Frank said in an interview. ""It was, to quote Joe Biden, a BFD. Now, the fact that Pete is married isn't a big deal. A BFD to an NBD in seven years. ... It's a sign of enormous progress."""
Sen. Cory Booker to introduce reparations commission bill in the Senate - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Rebecca Buck,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/cory-booker-reparations-senate-bill/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Cory Booker announced Monday he will take the lead in the Senate on a proposal that would establish a commission to study possible reparations, an idea that has emerged as a key policy question in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and won broad support from the candidates.
Such a commission would seek to remedy generations-worth of discrimination as a result of ""overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed African-Americans economically for generations,"" the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement, in addition to policies ""that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class"" but ""systematically excluded blacks."" ""This bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white supremacy and implicit racial bias in our country,"" Booker added. ""It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed."" 2020 Democrats vow to sign House reparations study bill The bill, originally introduced by former Rep. John Conyers of Michigan and currently sponsored in the House by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, has emerged as a key issue for 2020 Democrats -- and an area of consensus. At the National Action Network Conference in New York last week, Rev. Al Sharpton questioned one presidential hopeful after another on the measure and the candidates vouched their support. Now, Booker seems poised to emerge as the legislative leader on the issue. Read More The New Jersey senator has previously vented frustration that the question of reparations has been ""reduced to a box to check on a presidential list, when this is so much more of a serious conversation,"" as he told CNN's Don Lemon during a recent town hall in Orangeburg, South Carolina.

"Woman accused of illegal entry to Mar-a-Lago had numerous electronic devices, thousands in cash - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/mar-a-lago-yujing-zhang/index.html,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) Yujing Zhang, the woman who allegedly breached security at President Donald Trump's private Florida club while carrying Chinese passports and a flash drive containing malware late last month, had a signal detector, other electronic devices and thousands of dollars in cash in her hotel room, federal prosecutors said Monday, suggesting the possibility she was trying to spy on the US.
Zhang appeared at a detention hearing in a Florida federal court Monday afternoon looking shaken and anxious in her jail uniform and handcuffs, her defense attorney presenting a receipt that she had paid $20,000 dollars to a private businessman to attend a canceled Chinese-American ""friendship"" event at the private club. Prosecutors say they found multiple electronic devices in her hotel room, including a signal detector that can seek out and detect hidden cameras, another cell phone, nine USB drives and five SIM cards. There were also several credit cards in her name in the room--at the upscale Colony Hotel a block from the beach. She also had more than $8,000 in US and Chinese currency, with $7,500 of it in $100 bills. Prosecutors have called Zhang a flight risk because she has next to no ties to the US. The federal magistrate judge who held the hearing Monday will decide next week if Zhang should stay in jail until she is tried, or be released to live in the US as she awaits trial. Zhang, 32, has not yet entered a plea to the criminal charges she faces, and prosecutors said they plan to formally indict her in the coming week. Read More ""She lies to everyone she encounters,"" prosecutor Rolando Garcia said. ""Her ties are all in China,"" he later added. Zhang arrived in Newark on a flight from Shanghai on March 28, Garcia said. She went to Mar-a-Lago on March 30. This wasn't the first time she visited the country in recent years. Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security Zhang arrived at Mar-a-Lago via taxi-to ""acquaint"" herself with club grounds, her defense attorney said, before the planned private but canceled event, which promoters had pledged the President's sister would attend. After giving the Secret Service her last name and showing her passports, making it through two security checkpoints and taking a golf cart ride with a club staffer, the Secret Service found she was carrying a thumb drive with malware, as well as a laptop, an external hard drive and four cell phones. She was charged with two counts -- making false statements to federal authorities and a misdemeanor offense of entering a restricted area without authorization. She has not been charged with any offenses that nod to international spying. However, the FBI has been investigating the Zhang incident as part of a Chinese espionage effort. Secret Service missteps In the first hour of the hearing, Zhang's defense attorney focused on how the Secret Service let her on the property, determined Zhang may have lied, and steps they took in questioning her that afternoon and night. ""The only thing Ms. Zhang did was give a very common Chinese name"" to gain access to Mar-a-Lago, public defender Robert Adler said in court. ""And, it was decided she be let in. I don't understand how this could support a trespassing charge."" The agent who questioned her, Samuel Ivanovich, testified on Monday for about an hour about what happened that day. Adler used Ivanovich's testimony to show flaws in the Secret Service's procedures. For instance, a Secret Service agent who spoke Mandarin was called in to help with translations hours into Zhang's questioning. Adler also had Ivanovich admit that the agency that protects the President largely relied on Mar-a-Lago staff to determine whether to admit Zhang, didn't see red flags in the devices she carried when they showed up at a metal detector checkpoint inside the club, and asked no further questions of Zhang when she first arrived once they believed she was related to another club member with the same last name. Adler pointed out her name was extremely common in China--one of the three most common last names in the country. The Secret Service has no audio security recordings of its interactions with her and what she said on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago, Ivanovich also said. Ivanovich, being questioned about the malware allegedly found on Zhang's thumb drive, said the agent examining the drive found a malicious ""file"" that began to install onto an agent's computer, and the agent looking at it said that had never happened before, and it was ""very out of the ordinary"" when conducting a criminal analysis. The agent looking at the drive had to stop the analysis and shut down his computer. Mar-a-Lago security Trump has described the Zhang case as a ""fluke situation,"" but the case so far has highlighted the possibility of security flaws at Trump's private club. Zhang talked her way into the club, carrying a large number of electronic devices including malware on a thumbdrive. At first, she told a special agent at Mar-a-Lago she wanted to visit the pool at the beach club--even though she wore a long gray dress and had no bathing suit. The Mar-a-Lago beach club manager then noted her last name matched that of a club member, and the club waved her in, believing her to be the club member's daughter, and ""due to a potential language barrier issue,"" authorities wrote in her criminal complaint. A golf cart shuttle driver then took her to the club's main reception area, where Zhang told a Secret Service agent she sought to attend a ""United Nations Friendship Event"" on the premises. Adler showed in court fliers that advertised in Chinese a similar-sounding event for that day. The fliers included a photo of Trump's sister, and may have come from a Florida businesswoman and a Chinese businessman who promoted events and attempted to profit off of political heavyweights he met in America. In essence, Adler said, the businesswoman Cindy Yang ""bundled"" the Mar-a-Lago event, then a man named Charles Lee ""repackaged"" the event, collecting $20,000 from Zhang so she could attend. Adler had a wire transfer receipt from Chinese contacts that showed this, he said to the judge. Trump is removing US Secret Service director Zhang had told authorities who were questioning her that her Chinese friend ""Charles,"" whom she communicated with over a chat app, had sent her from Shanghai to speak with the President's family about Chinese and American foreign economic relations, according to the complaint. The case comes as Democrats in Congress press for more information about security at Mar-a-Lago and, separately, for an FBI investigation into Florida businesswoman Li ""Cindy"" Yang's efforts to interact with Trump, after she appeared to have pitched to Chinese clients the opportunity to interact with the President and spend time at Mar-a-Lago with the President at a Super Bowl party. Previous hearing Zhang's two court appearances have run unusually long, with more details than usual about her and her case being presented to the judge. At the previous hearing, she admitted to owning a BMW and a home in China worth more than 1 million American dollars, and asked extensively about how she may get in contact with an attorney or find phone numbers of contacts in America if she were detained in a Florida jail. She said she worked as an investor and consultant who sought to develop business contacts in the US, but kept some money in a Wells Fargo account here--thousands less than what she actually had in her hotel room, the prosecutors say. She has been in jail since her arrest, with a court-appointed public defender representing her. The federal magistrate judge, William Matthewman, even noted the astuteness of her questions and her intelligence at the previous hearing. There's been some dispute over how well Zhang speaks and understands English, and the court has provided her with a language interpreter at both court hearings."

""The entire membership of the Baltimore City Council believes that it is not in the best interest of the City of Baltimore, for you to continue to serve as Mayor. We urge you to tender your resignation, effective immediately,"" the two-sentence letter read. In a statement, council member Brandon Scott, who tweeted a photo of the letter Monday, noted the ""severity of the action (the council members) have taken,"" but said Baltimore was deserving of a mayor who can focus on other issues affecting the city.

‚Äî Brandon M. Scott (@CouncilmanBMS) April 8, 2019 The letter was signed by 14 members of the 15-member council -- the only member not to sign it was Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young, the council's president who has been serving as the ""ex officio Mayor of Baltimore City"" since Pugh took a leave of absence last week. Despite the calls for her to step down, Pugh does not plan on vacating her post, according to her spokesman, James Bentley. In a statement issued Monday, Bentley said Pugh, whose current term expires in 2020, ""fully intends to resume the duties of her office and continuing her work on behalf of the people and the City of Baltimore."" Read More Pugh's leave of absence -- which Bentley attributed to a bout of pneumonia -- came the same day Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan wrote to the Office of the State Prosecutor and requested an investigation into the sales of thousands of Pugh's book, ""Healthy Holly,"" to the University of Maryland Medical System while she was a member of its board. UMMS spent $500,000 to fund the purchase of some 100,000 books from Pugh's company Healthy Holly LLC, confirmed UMMS spokesman Michael Schwartzberg, who explained that UMMS never had possession of any Healthy Holly books, nor did it distribute books. Book distribution was managed by Healthy Holly LLC. Pugh -- who apologized in March for doing something ""to upset the people"" -- recently returned $100,000 to the medical system and canceled her book deal. She has also resigned from the hospital's board, according to Schwartzberg. Pugh also received about $114,000 from Kaiser Permanente for some 20,000 books from 2015 to 2018, according to the health care provider. Kaiser Permanente said it delivered the books to back-to-school fairs, elementary schools, communities of faith and early childhood education and care centers. Additionally, Associated Black Charities, a public foundation that works to encourage healthier and more prosperous communities, said it spent approximately $80,000 between 2011 and 2016 to buy some 10,000 copies of Pugh's books -- a project the organization learned about while she was still a state senator."
Lobbyist who steered foreign money to Trump inaugural asks for no jail time,edition.cnn.com,Marshall Cohen,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/sam-patten-sentencing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Lobbyist Sam Patten provided ""substantial assistance"" to special counsel Robert Mueller and several other ongoing investigations, federal prosecutors said Monday, paving the way for him to potentially avoid jail time at his sentencing this week.
The case has been full of intrigue from the beginning, given Patten's connections to several prongs of Mueller's investigation. He founded a company with a suspected Russian operative, steered foreign money to President Donald Trump's inauguration, was closely tied to Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, and advised the controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica. Prosecutors from the US attorney's office in Washington didn't recommend a sentence for Patten, who first came under investigation by Mueller's team. He pleaded guilty in August to illegally lobbying on behalf of a Ukrainian political party that favors closer relations with Russia. The prosecutors said Patten's cooperation was ""immediate"" and ""substantial."" They told the judge that Patten deserved leniency and formally requested a reduction in his sentence. ""Patten has met with government investigators, in person or by phone, a total of nine separate times to answer numerous questions and explain various documents,"" prosecutors wrote. ""In all of these sessions, Patten has been honest and straightforward with government investigators."" Read More But almost all of the details surrounding Patten's ""substantial"" assistance will remain secret for now. Both sides said they would submit additional filings under seal with that information. The court filings revealed that Patten provided evidence against Manafort and was prepared to testify against Manafort at trial. Prosecutors said Patten's experience as an overseas political constant made him a ""valuable resource for the government in a number of other criminal investigations, providing helpful information about additional individuals and entities."" For his part, Patten asked for probation instead of prison. His lawyers said he never intended to cover up anything related to Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. When he pleaded guilty, Patten admitted that he illegally funneled money from a Russia-friendly oligarch to Trump's inauguration fund, and that he lied about it to a congressional committee. ""His crimes were not motivated by greed or a desire to conceal relevant information from the American public or to aid or cover up any potential interference with the 2016 Presidential election,"" they wrote. ""To the contrary, Mr. Patten's decisions in this case stemmed primarily from a desire to accommodate his clients' requests and to present himself in the best possible light after unexpectedly finding himself a subject of the Russian interference investigation."" That $50,000 donation was a tiny fraction of the $107 million raised by Trump's inaugural fund. But federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are now investigating that committee for a slew of potential crimes, including fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. It's not clear if Patten helped with that investigation, which appeared to ramp up earlier this year. The contribution was not part of a broad effort to inject foreign funds into Trump's inauguration, his lawyers said. Patten didn't even like Trump and opposed him in 2016, they added. ""Mr. Patten did not support the Trump campaign and while he may have known people who worked for the campaign at various times, he had no personal connection to it,"" his lawyers wrote. ""Indeed, Mr. Patten not only openly opposed the Trump candidacy but even broke with his party when he voted for President Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election."" In his first public comments about his crimes, Patten submitted a letter to the judge expressing remorse and describing how his actions triggered a ""very dark"" period for him and his family. ""In the eight months since I pleaded guilty before you, and more than a year since this journey began for me, I have changed,"" Patten wrote in the two-page letter, which was dated March 28. ""To an even more meaningful degree than the day the FBI came to my door, I have surrendered. But in admission and surrender, I have also come to know a certain peace."" Patten, who said in court last year that he was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression, has given up drinking and attended more than 150 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous since his guilty plea, his lawyers said. They submitted 45 pages of letters asking for leniency from Patten's family, friends, his AA sponsor and even his childhood babysitter growing up in Maine. A sentencing hearing for Patten is scheduled for Friday. Overseeing the case is Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who handled Manafort's case and several other Mueller prosecutions. Patten's sentencing was previously delayed while he cooperated with investigators. This case is unique, as Patten pleaded guilty to a crime that is rarely prosecuted by the Justice Department. Only about 10 people have been charged in the past 50 years with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a federal law that was enacted shortly before World War II. The small number of comparable cases means Berman Jackson will have ""even broader discretion"" than usual when she decides Patten's fate on Friday, prosecutors noted. The maximum potential sentence is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, though a much less severe outcome seems likely in this case. Patten's foreign client was the Opposition Bloc, a Ukrainian political party that favors close ties with Russia. The party was formed by allies of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych after he fled the country amid unrest in 2014. Patten and Manafort worked for some of the same clients, and Manafort was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison for crimes relating to his own lobbying."
Mick Mulvaney is simply wrong about Donald Trump's taxes,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/donald-trump-mick-mulvaney-taxes/index.html,"(CNN) Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" whether congressional Democrats will ever get to see President Donald Trump's tax returns. Here's how he responded:
""Oh no, never, nor should they. Keep in mind that that's an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the President could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn't, and they elected him anyway, which of course is what drive the Democrats crazy."" This is wrong. You can debate whether Trump should be forced to reveal his taxes under a 1924 IRS law, but you simply cannot successfully argue that the 2016 election was a referendum -- even in a small way -- on the President's unwillingness to release his taxes. It's also not the first time someone in Trump's inner circle has made this argument. Way back in January 2017, White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said of Trump's taxes that ""we litigated this all through the election."" Added Conway: ""People didn't care. They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
The fundamental logic flaw in the arguments put forward by Mulvaney and Conway is that any and all of Trump's flaws, transgressions or abnormalities are fully and completely exonerated -- TOTAL EXONERATION -- by the fact that he won. Read More Under that line of thinking, people who voted for Trump fully approve of how he behaves toward women -- more than a dozen of whom said during the 2016 campaign that Trump had behaved inappropriately -- and worse -- around them. And we know that's not true, since 70%(!) of the electorate said that Trump's treatment of women bothered them, according to exit polling . Painting with such an overly broad brush -- a la Mulvaney and Conway -- drastically oversimplifies why voters do what they do. Elections are never about one thing or one person. It's a choice, always, between at least two candidates. And voters are motivated by lots of different things at the same time. A look at the 2016 exit polling suggests that the primary motivation for voters who chose Trump was electing someone who could change Washington in fundamental ways, and they saw Trump much more in that light than Hillary Clinton. Four in 10 voters said that the most important quality they were looking for in a candidate was someone who could bring about change; Trump won that group 82% to 14% over Hillary Clinton. There were a total of zero -- that's 0 -- questions about Trump's taxes and his refusal to release them (making him the first president to do so since Watergate) on the exit poll . Zilch. Not a one. It is possible to make the argument that in voting for change, Trump voters saw his unwillingness to release his returns as somehow indicative of just how radically different Trump was than not only Clinton but also everyone who had held the office before him? I mean, I gue but almost certainly not. The most likely explanation is that while they didn't love that Trump refused to release his taxes, voters made their final choice on other issues -- again with his perceived power as a change agent right at the top of that list. Most polling since the election, in fact, shows a clear majority of Americans believe Trump should release at least some of his tax returns. In a Quinnipiac University poll released in February, a whopping 67% said they wanted Trump to release his taxes while just 24% said he shouldn't. That same poll showed a majority of Americans (52%) said Trump wasn't releasing his returns because he had ""something to hide."" (Nota bene: It's important to distinguish between people who say they want Trump to release his taxes and those who will vote against him for not doing so. The former number is high; the latter number not so much.) The argument over Trump's tax returns will turn into a legal one sometime very soon. The IRS isn't going to turn the returns over, at which point House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal will have to decide whether he wants to subpoena the returns. If he does that, we are likely headed to the Supreme Court. (Make sure to read this great explainer by CNN's Lauren Fox on what's next in the tax return fight .) But from a purely political perspective, the argument being forward by Mulvaney is nonsense. There is NO evidence to suggest that voters approved of Trump's refusal to release his taxes in 2016 -- and there's plenty to suggest that they were not (and are not) happy with that decision."
"Trump's Fed picks still undergoing White House vetting, top adviser says",edition.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/moore-cain-federal-reserve-hassett-kudlow/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump recently named his two picks for the Federal Reserve -- but a top economic adviser cautioned Monday that the nominations aren't final until they're formally sent to the Senate.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett said it was too early in the process to comment on the potential nominations. Hassett stressed that both Herman Cain and Stephen Moore are currently in the ""intent to nominate"" phase of the process, which means they are subject to vetting and paperwork within the administration ahead of a formal nomination. ""That's exactly how it works for every single nominee, is that there's an intent to nominate and then people fill out their forms, and then they decide, you know, whether they want to move forward after they look at what they have to recuse themselves from and so on and then the nomination officially goes to the Senate,"" Hassett said. Since the President announced his intent to nominate Moore and Cain, concerns have arisen about challenges for both of their confirmations. Moore, an economic commentator and former CNN contributor, owes $75,000 in taxes and penalties to the United States government. And Cain, a businessman and former Federal Reserve regional board member, faced sexual harassment allegations that effectively ended his 2012 presidential campaign. Read More Hassett said that potential candidates should be given privacy and time to work potential conflicts out with the Office of Government Ethics and provide as much information as possible to ensure that the Senate can have a ""fact-based debate"" once the formal nominations are submitted. ""I think the President has a lot of confidence in both (Moore and Cain),"" Hassett said when asked by CNN whether he was concerned about the impact allegations against Cain could have on his confirmation process. He continued, ""And that point, I think, is the right time to debate everything about that we've learned about the past. And part of the process identifies those things, as well."" Trump, who has openly expressed his frustration with Fed chair Jerome Powell -- a former investment banker Trump selected in 2017 -- over interest rate hikes, announced last week he intends to nominate Cain for a seat on the board of the world's most powerful central bank. In March, he also said he would nominate Moore, a former 2016 campaign adviser, to a seat. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday offered a stronger defense of the picks. Kudlow called criticism that the possible nominations of the two longtime Trump supporters would politicize the Federal Reserve ""very unfair."" ""Let's take Herman Cain. Besides being a very successful entrepreneurial businessman, he was a board member of the Kansas City Federal Reserve and actually was the chairman of the board of the Kansas City Federal Reserve. His time there spans, I think, about a decade. He's intimately acquainted with Federal Reserve operations and policy issues, so I think these criticisms are very unfair,"" Kudlow told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" But asked about the sexual harassment allegations against Cain, Kudlow also pointed to the vetting process, signaling the nominations are not yet a done deal. ""We are going through a vetting process in the White House. I'm sure the Senate Banking Committee will do likewise. There's big disputes here. Mr. Cain disagrees with this point of view (of one of the accusers). I'm not going to litigate that here,"" he said. Cain suspended his bid for the Republican nomination for president in 2011 after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment when he was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s and one woman claimed she had a 13-year affair with Cain. Pressed again, Kudlow said, ""Whether it's Supreme Court justices or many other things, we've seen a lot of charges here. They don't necessarily pan out."" He then said that Trump ""has every right in the world to nominate people who share his economic philosophy."" Cain said in a Facebook video posted Friday that he's steeling himself for a tough selection process after sexual harassment allegations rocked his 2012 presidential bid. The former business executive said on Facebook Watch's ""The Herman Cain Show"" he was eager to air things out in the open. ""You better believe that the people who hate me, who do not like conservatism, Republicans, are already digging up all of the negative stuff that's in stories from eight years ago,"" Cain said. ""So be it. Let them go back and dig up eight-year-old stuff. I will be able to explain it this time where they wouldn't let me explain it the last time,"" Cain said. ""They were too busy believing the accusers. I'm not mad, y'all. I'm just not going to let the accusers run my life. Or determine my career."""

He then grabbed a microphone, thanked his supporters and sang 28 seconds of one of his songs before the venue closed at 3 a.m., WICS and WRSP reported.

Lobbyist who steered foreign money to Trump inaugural asks for no jail time - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Marshall Cohen,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/sam-patten-sentencing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Lobbyist Sam Patten asked a judge for no jail time ahead of his Friday sentencing on charges he acted as an unregistered foreign agent.
Patten's case, and how it related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, has been full of intrigue but short on details. Many of the filings in the case are still under seal, leading many to speculate that Patten might be a marquee cooperator. Patten's lawyers wrote Monday that he was a valuable asset for the Mueller investigation and other federal prosecutors. But the details of how he helped prosecutors will be submitted in sealed filings that aren't available to the public, they said. ""Mr. Patten earned the trust of the government and became a reliable and valuable resource,"" they wrote, noting that he assisted ""several ongoing investigations."" Prosecutors didn't recommend a sentence for Patten, but they told the judge that he was a very helpful cooperator and formally asked the judge to go easy on him, filing a motion that is formally known as 5K or a ""downward departure."" Read More ""Patten has served as a valuable resource for the government in a number of other criminal investigations, providing helpful information about additional individuals and entities,"" prosecutors wrote. ""In total, Patten has met with government investigators, in person or by phone, a total of nine separate times to answer numerous questions and explain various documents. In all of these sessions, Patten has been honest and straightforward with government investigators."" They said he provided evidence against Paul Manafort, who became Trump's campaign chairman, and was prepared to testify against Manafort if he went to trial in Washington. Patten previously admitted funneling money from a Russia-friendly oligarch to the Trump inauguration, and that he lied about it to Congress. But Patten's lawyers said Monday that his actions were not intended to ""cover up"" foreign interference in the US election. ""[H]is crimes were not motivated by greed or a desire to conceal relevant information from the American public or to aid or cover up any potential interference with the 2016 Presidential election,"" Patten's lawyers wrote in their sentencing memo. Patten's attorneys wrote that his use of an American company to disguise the purchase of inauguration tickets for a Ukrainian national was not part of an effort to funnel foreign money into the Trump campaign but another a ""breakdown in judgement"" to please his client. They went on to say that Patten didn't even like President Donald Trump, even though he facilitated a donation to the Trump inauguration. ""Mr. Patten did not support the Trump campaign and while he may have known people who worked for the campaign at various times, he had no personal connection to it,"" his lawyers wrote. ""Indeed, Mr. Patten not only openly opposed the Trump candidacy but even broke with his party when he voted for President Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election."" He pleaded guilty in August to acting as an unregistered agent for the Opposition Bloc, a Ukrainian political party that favors close ties with Russia. He worked for some of the same oligarchs that hired Manafort. Manafort was sentenced last month to more than seven years in prison on federal fraud and tax charges."

Pete Buttigieg's unlikely rise as a symbol of LGBT progress - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/pete-buttigieg-lgbt-progress/index.html,"(CNN) Before South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg captured the nation's attention as a serious contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, he was in Iowa, laying the groundwork for his forthcoming bid.
Addressing a gathering of progressive activists, Buttigieg, who is gay and married to his husband, Chasten, reflected on the impact decisions made in Washington have had on his life. ""Sitting down to Christmas dinner at the side of my husband, whose marriage to me, our family ‚Äî not its well-being but its existence ‚Äî comes by the grace of single vote on the United States Supreme Court,"" he said in December. After the event, a group of women mingled near the elevators and reflected on their first impression of the South Bend mayor. ""I like that Mayor Pete guy,"" one woman standing near the elevator said to the others. ""He's gay and going places."" Read More Pete Buttigieg says his team raised more than $7 million in first quarter In the months since, Buttigieg went from the obscure mayor of a small city to a standout contender within the Democratic field of candidates looking to take on President Donald Trump next year. And being gay, while not the entirety of Buttigieg's story, is a key aspect of his identity, something that voters say sets him apart from the other candidates and something that Buttigieg has highlighted more as he began to rise in prominence. His campaign has worked to seize on his newfound status in recent weeks by tapping into LGBT communities for support and money. His swift rise as the only member of the LGBT community in the race has also prompted a broader conversation about the importance of his identity and the progress made on LGBT rights in the course of just a decade. ""The fact that his sexual orientation is not the headline, that he is being received as a credible qualified candidate for president, just as all the others are, is without question is a profound sign of our progress,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT advocacy group in the United States. 'Not eager to become a poster child' All of it is a bit of an adjustment for the mayor, who once wrote that he came out later in life, in part, because he didn't want to become ""a poster child for LGBT issues."" In ""Shortest Way Home,"" the mayor's pre-campaign memoir, Buttigieg writes that he worried his coming out would turn into something he is not. ""I had strongly supported the causes from the beginning, but did not want to be defined by them,"" he wrote. Speaking at the Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington, DC, on Sunday, an event that is meant to raise money for LGBTQ candidates across the country, Buttigieg took that a step further and told attendees that dealing with his sexual orientation was ""a kind of war."" ""If you could have offered me a pill that could make me straight, I would have swallowed it before you could give me a swig of water,"" Buttigieg said. ""It's a hard thing to think about now. If you had shown me exactly what it was that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife."" He added later: ""Thank God there was no pill. Thank God there was no knife."" Buttigieg goes on to write in his memoir that it was his deployment to Afghanistan in 2014 that forced him to come to terms with his public and private life. Despite the fact that Buttigieg, as a student at Harvard, used the earliest iterations of Facebook to see which men identified as ""seeking men"" on the site, it wasn't until he reflected ""on the possibility that I might get killed in action, thirty-two years old, single for basically all my adult life"" that he realized he ""needed to come out."" He did so in a June 2015 essay in the South Bend Tribune, where he nodded to the fact that the Supreme Court would soon decide on whether gay marriage was legal nationally by writing that he felt his public coming out ""could do some good"" for people struggling with their sexuality. As the only gay candidate in the race, Buttigieg has also been asked questions that other candidates haven't had to address. During an appearance on The Breakfast Club in March, Buttigieg was asked about how he feels about Chick-fil-A , a chicken-centric fast food company that has faced criticism -- and, in some cases, boycotts -- from gay rights advocates for its donations to anti-gay groups and anti-gay comments by Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy. ""I do not approve of their politics, but I kind of approve of their chicken,"" Buttigieg said. He later added at another event that while he supports people's right to boycott companies and spend their money however they please, he worries it leads people to ""sometimes slip into a sort of virtue signaling in some cases where we're not really being consistent."" Buttigieg says he doesn't support boycotts of companies over political donations It was a nuanced view on a controversial subject within the LGBT community and was not universally well received. ""It riled people in the LGBTQ community,"" Annise Parker, the head of Victory Fund and the former mayor of Houston who was one of the first gay mayors of a major US city when she was elected in 2010, said of Buttigieg's comments about Chick-fil-A. ""There are certainly folks on the left of the community who say that is not good enough. But I think that is one of the things that has caused a lot of folks to take another look at Pete is that he is a bridge builder, mainstream, middle of the road politician and he wants to find a balance and a position of fairness."" Even if Buttigieg wasn't looking to draw attention to his sexuality, it has found him during the presidential campaign. And that he is gay, in the eyes of gay rights advocates and political operatives, could be an asset. ""One reason Obama had a lot of success in 2008 was that he represented change in many ways,"" said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign manager and the first gay man who ran a major presidential campaign. ""I think Buttigieg represents change in many ways in a primary where voters want just that."" Mook added: ""All the gay men I know, they all want to give him money. It's not the worst demographic to raise money from."" Polling bears this out -- a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found nearly 70% of American are either enthusiastic or comfortable with a candidate who is gay or lesbian -- but it is still remarkable to those gay lawmakers who paved the way for a Buttigieg campaign. Former Rep. Barney Frank, who came out in 1987 and was, at the time, widely considered the most prominent gay politician in the United States, said during his decades in politics he never viewed his sexuality as an asset. For Buttigieg, however, it could be, he said, because it allows people who have had homophobic views in the past to atone at the ballot box. ""His candidacy is an example of the absolute speed with which we are getting there. I think it is very clear, his being gay is clearly an asset,"" Frank said. ""In a way, he gives people a chance to almost atone for past wrongs."" For those LGBTQ voters who have come to Buttigieg events, some because they support him and others because they are curious about a gay man running for president, the symbolism in Buttigieg's rise is powerful. ""I think it matters because symbolism is important. I think having that reflected in your leaders is important,"" said Adi Dubash, 37, who attended a Buttigieg event in South Carolina last month with his husband, Michael Upshaw, 34, and their 16-month-old son Finnick. ""But I think he has got the right idea because he embraces his identity and he wants people to know his identity but it is not all who he is."" For Upshaw, Buttigieg's presidential bid is about representation, he said, and being able to tell their young son that ""your dads are represented"" and ""you are growing up in a world that accepts people and families like you are growing up in."" ""That means a lot,"" he added. Radical normalcy One area in which gay rights activists are most pleased by Buttigieg's campaign is the way that his marriage to Chasten Buttigieg , a now ever-present figure on the campaign trial, has given increased visibility to the normalcy of same-sex marriage. Chasten, 29, has seen his online following balloon from a few thousand Twitter followers months ago to nearly 200,000 this month. He and his husband regularly tweet about the normalcies of life: Doing laundry on the weekend, reading on the couch and their two dogs. ""Doing a quick bit of laundry. Hear loud scream. Run into kitchen terrified, expecting to see @Chas10Buttigieg in pool of blood. Am thereupon informed that @Lin_Manuel is following my husband, whose life is now complete,"" Pete Buttigieg tweeted last month after the Hamilton star followed his husband on Twitter. Pete Buttigieg's not-so-secret weapon is his husband, Chasten Buttigieg reflected on his marriage at Sunday's brunch. ""Being married to Chasten has made me a better man,"" Buttigieg said, before the turned his focus on Vice President Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana who has a long history of comments of opposing same-sex marriage. ""And yes Mr. Vice President it has made me closer to god,"" Buttigieg said as the crowd gave him a standing ovation. ""If you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."" Pete and Chasten met online and the mayor proposed to his husband-to-be in 2017 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the spot where Chasten, a teacher, was sitting when they first connected on the dating app Hinge. The mere fact that the two are living their lives so openly on the political stage is a moment in the eyes of Parker, the head of Victory Fund and the former mayor of Houston. ""I have been an activist since the 70s and if you had asked me back then if we would have had a gay married man running for president, I would have thought you were crazy,"" Parker said. But it's the rise of Chasten Buttigieg's popularity that has really marveled men and women in the LGBTQ community, a rise that was recently cemented by the fact that the political spouse headlined the Human Rights Campaign annual gala in Houston on Saturday, hours before his husband headlined the Victory Fund event in Washington, DC. And Chasten Buttigieg, who came out at 18 and moved out of his home shortly after, has embraced the spotlight -- from the comical, like tweeting the hosts of Netflix's ""Queer Eye"" asking them to take him shopping, to the serious, like when he tweeted ""your time in the closet and your journey to coming out belong to you. ... You matter first."" For Frank, who married his longtime partner James Ready in 2012, making him the first gay politician to be married in office, the prominence of this LGBTQ couple has been remarkable. ""I got married, seven years ago. It was international news when I announced that I was getting married,"" Frank said in an interview. ""It was, to Quote: Joe Biden, a BFD. Now, the fact that Pete is married isn't a big deal. A BFD to an NBD in seven years. ... It's a sign of enormous progress."""
Chicago's first warm weekend of 2019 ends with 24 shootings and 5 murders - CNN,us.cnn.com,From Bill Kirkos and Ryan Young,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/chicago-violence-weekend/index.html,"(CNN) It was the first warm weekend in Chicago, and just as feared, violence spiked, with 24 shootings across the city and five murders, police said.
The count began Friday at 6 p.m. and ran though Sunday. In one incident, two children were among several people injured at a baby shower, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. The children were in stable condition midday Monday. ""We know that two men in dark clothing approached the family gathering which we believe was a baby shower and opened fire,"" Guglielmi said. ""The shooters fled the area on foot,"" he added. ""Cooperation has been very limited with detectives, and based on victim profiles we suspect this could have been a possible retaliatory shooting from an earlier incident that stemmed from an ongoing gang conflict in that neighborhood.""

While many candidates in Chicago's mayoral election have called for Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson's badge, Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot promised a more patient approach, predicting warmer weather would again usher more violence into the city. ""We're going to be heading soon into the summer violence season,"" she told CNN. ""After that's over, we'll evaluate at that point, but I'm going to be working closely with the superintendent and with his executive team to make sure that we keep our neighborhoods safe."""
"Trump's Fed picks still undergoing White House vetting, top adviser says - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/moore-cain-federal-reserve-hassett-kudlow/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump recently named his two picks for the Federal Reserve -- but a top economic adviser cautioned Monday that the nominations aren't final until they're formally sent to the Senate.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett said it was too early in the process to comment on the potential nominations. Hassett stressed that both Herman Cain and Stephen Moore are currently in the ""intent to nominate"" phase of the process, which means they are subject to vetting and paperwork within the administration ahead of a formal nomination. ""That's exactly how it works for every single nominee, is that there's an intent to nominate and then people fill out their forms, and then they decide, you know, whether they want to move forward after they look at what they have to recuse themselves from and so on and then the nomination officially goes to the Senate,"" Hassett said. Since the President announced his intent to nominate Moore and Cain, concerns have arisen about challenges for both of their confirmations. Moore, an economic commentator and former CNN contributor, owes $75,000 in taxes and penalties to the United States government. And Cain, a businessman and former Federal Reserve regional board member, faced sexual harassment allegations that effectively ended his 2012 presidential campaign. Read More Hassett said that potential candidates should be given privacy and time to work potential conflicts out with the Office of Government Ethics and provide as much information as possible to ensure that the Senate can have a ""fact-based debate"" once the formal nominations are submitted. ""I think the President has a lot of confidence in both (Moore and Cain),"" Hassett said when asked by CNN whether he was concerned about the impact allegations against Cain could have on his confirmation process. He continued, ""And that point, I think, is the right time to debate everything about that we've learned about the past. And part of the process identifies those things, as well."" Trump, who has openly expressed his frustration with Fed chair Jerome Powell -- a former investment banker Trump selected in 2017 -- over interest rate hikes, announced last week he intends to nominate Cain for a seat on the board of the world's most powerful central bank. In March, he also said he would nominate Moore, a former 2016 campaign adviser, to a seat. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday offered a stronger defense of the picks. Kudlow called criticism that the possible nominations of the two longtime Trump supporters would politicize the Federal Reserve ""very unfair."" ""Let's take Herman Cain. Besides being a very successful entrepreneurial businessman, he was a board member of the Kansas City Federal Reserve and actually was the chairman of the board of the Kansas City Federal Reserve. His time there spans, I think, about a decade. He's intimately acquainted with Federal Reserve operations and policy issues, so I think these criticisms are very unfair,"" Kudlow told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" But asked about the sexual harassment allegations against Cain, Kudlow also pointed to the vetting process, signaling the nominations are not yet a done deal. ""We are going through a vetting process in the White House. I'm sure the Senate Banking Committee will do likewise. There's big disputes here. Mr. Cain disagrees with this point of view (of one of the accusers). I'm not going to litigate that here,"" he said. Cain suspended his bid for the Republican nomination for president in 2011 after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment when he was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s and one woman claimed she had a 13-year affair with Cain. Pressed again, Kudlow said, ""Whether it's Supreme Court justices or many other things, we've seen a lot of charges here. They don't necessarily pan out."" He then said that Trump ""has every right in the world to nominate people who share his economic philosophy."" Cain said in a Facebook video posted Friday that he's steeling himself for a tough selection process after sexual harassment allegations rocked his 2012 presidential bid. The former business executive said on Facebook Watch's ""The Herman Cain Show"" he was eager to air things out in the open. ""You better believe that the people who hate me, who do not like conservatism, Republicans, are already digging up all of the negative stuff that's in stories from eight years ago,"" Cain said. ""So be it. Let them go back and dig up eight-year-old stuff. I will be able to explain it this time where they wouldn't let me explain it the last time,"" Cain said. ""They were too busy believing the accusers. I'm not mad, y'all. I'm just not going to let the accusers run my life. Or determine my career."""
"Nearly 1 in 13 US males reported having sex before age 13, study says - CNN",us.cnn.com,Jacqueline Howard,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/sex-health-statistics-teen-boys-study/index.html,"(CNN) The percentage of boys who start having sex at a young age can vary based on factors such as where they live and their mothers' education level, according to a new study. Yet among those boys, only about half described their first time as something they fully ""wanted.""
The study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics on Monday, found that 3.6% to 7.6% of boys and young men in the United States -- nearly 1 in 13 -- report having had sex for the first time before they turned age 13. The researchers are calling for more education, care and conversations about supporting healthy sexual development in boys. ""Too often, the sexual health needs of young men are overlooked. These findings have major implications for the timing of sex education and sexual and reproductive health care,"" said Laura Lindberg, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank, and first author of the study. In general, about age 17 is when most boys and girls have sex for the first time -- but boys are more likely than girls to have sex for the first time before 13, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Only these 8 states require sex education classes to mention consent Read More The new study included data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System from 2011, 2013 and 2015 and from the National Survey of Family Growth from 2006 to 2015. Data in the first system was collected in questionnaires completed by students in grades nine to 12 and involved 19,916 male students. The family growth survey data was collected through in-person interviews with 15- to 24-year-olds and involved 7,739 males. The researchers analyzed that data with a close eye toward demographic factors, where the boys lived and how much respondents wanted that first experience to happen. To measure ""wantedness,"" the National Survey of Family Growth asked the respondents to describe how much they wanted the encounter to happen, choosing between ""I really didn't want it to happen at the time,"" ""I had mixed feelings -- part of me wanted it to happen at the time and part of me didn't"" and ""I really wanted it to happen at the time."" Fewer teens having sex and using drugs, CDC survey finds The researchers found that sex before 13 was reported by 7.6% of the male high school students in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data and 3.6% of the respondents in the National Survey of Family Growth data. The National Survey of Family Growth data showed that among those who reported having sex before 13, 8.5% described it as ""unwanted,"" 37% had mixed feelings about it, and 54.6% described it was ""wanted."" Most described their first sexual partner as a friend. That was similar to findings among males who had sex later than 13, the study found, which was that 5.4% reported it as ""unwanted,"" 31.3% had mixed feelings, and 63.3% described it as ""wanted."" The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data showed that, across 15 metropolitan areas in the United States, the percentage of male students reporting having sex before 13 varied widely: 5% in San Francisco to 25% in Memphis, Tennessee. The researchers also found that respondents whose mothers had a college degree or higher educational level were less likely, by a statistically significant amount, to report having sex before 13, and reports of having sex before 13 were higher among black males. The study had some limitations, including that the younger the survey respondent the more likely they were to report having sex before age 13, and the data focused only on male-female sexual intercourse, not other types of sexual experiences.

Dr. David Bell, pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center , and Samantha Garbers, an associate professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health , wrote an editorial published alongside the study in JAMA Pediatrics . They called for improvements in sex education and screening for sexual activity in youth. ""Any messaging, whether from clinicians or schools or parents, must recognize pressures that 'manhood is something that boys must make happen, by passing certain social milestones,' such as having sex. It is critical to engage young men in self-reflection about the real pressures US society places on them that affect their overall health and well-being,"" Bell and Garbers wrote. ""Any discussions associated with pressures should include topics of 'what it means to be a man' and soliciting and giving consent,"" they wrote. ""With the support of caring adults, led by existing national guidelines that call for developmentally appropriate interventions early in life, boys can achieve healthier milestones without ambivalence or societal risk."""
"Measles: 78 new cases reported nationwide since last week, CDC says - CNN",us.cnn.com,"Debra Goldschmidt, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/measles-2019-cdc-update-bn/index.html,"(CNN) At least 465 cases of measles have been reported in the United States since January 1, according to the latest numbers shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday.
That's 78 more cases than the number reported last week and includes cases reported to the CDC by state health departments as of April 4; it therefore does not include cases reported since then. Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts and Nevada reported their first cases of measles this year, bringing the total number of states reporting cases to 19. The other states that have reported measles cases this year are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington. The total number of measles cases nationwide this year ""is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000,"" the CDC says. That threshold was reached last week when the national total for the year surpassed last year's total of 372. The largest outbreak was in 2014, when there were 667 cases reported nationwide due to several large outbreaks. Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable respiratory illness characterized by a rash of flat red spots. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes.

Indiana health officials reported the first case of measles there on Friday. Massachusetts health officials also reported that state's only 2019 case last week. Washington state reported 78 cases in an outbreak that began in January. That includes individuals in Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and Georgia who all became infected in Washington. (Hawaii is not included on the CDC list of states reporting cases because the cases there were reported by Washington.) Her son died. And then anti-vaxers attacked her Oregon has also reported seven other cases that are not linked to that outbreak. In February, Colorado , Kentucky , Connecticut and Texas all reported cases of measles. There is also an ongoing outbreak in observant Jewish neighborhoods in New York that began in October when, according to health officials, an unvaccinated child became infected with the illness while visiting Israel.

People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn and Rockland County ,"" the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene website says. According to case counts from local health departments, at least 468 cases of measles have been reported in the state since October as part of this outbreak. On Monday, the New York City health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, ordered all yeshivas, which are Orthodox Jewish schools, in Williamsburg to prohibit unvaccinated students from attending. In December, Barbot issued the same order for yeshivas in affected parts of Brooklyn. Also on Monday, Rockland County Executive Ed Day released a statement to ""vehemently disagree"" with a judge's order issued late Friday that prohibits the county from enforcing a ban put in place last month barring unvaccinated children from public places. The ban was established in an effort to contain the outbreak there. ""I absolutely do not agree with the judge's opinion that this measles crisis does not rise to the level of an emergency, when, in fact, we are facing the longest lasting current outbreak in the nation, and the largest outbreak in New York State in 30 years,"" Day said in a statement. He noted that the judge's ruling does not apply to a separate December order that prohibits those who are not vaccinated or have not had both doses of the preventive measles, mumps and rubella vaccine from attending school.

Measles is endemic in many countries other than the United States. It is brought in when people who are unvaccinated or undervaccinated visit from a place where the virus is circulating or when people living in the United States visit such a place and return with an infection. Health officials have said that the proliferation of anti-vaccine rhetoric has, in part, fueled an increase in the number of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States."
Syria deserves to live,us.cnn.com,Mouaz al-Khatib,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/khatib-syria-deserves-to-live/index.html,"Mouaz al-Khatib is founding and former president of the Syrian National Coalition and a former imam of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria.

(CNN) It's not easy to defuse a crisis complicated by tens of thousands of foreign fighters , many affiliated with ISIS , over 100,000 Iranian-sponsored militiamen , and the armies and intelligence agencies of myriad states . Nor can the horrific humanitarian crises plaguing many Syrian refugee and internally displaced persons camps , where aid gets siphoned off and manipulated by the Assad regime, be easily managed. One trembles to hear every few days of children freezing to death and parents burning themselves or killing their children out of humiliation, poverty, and hunger .
Score-settling between Iran and Israel, Turkey and the Gulf, and the US and Russia stands to come at an inestimable cost for Syrian civilians. As bad as that already is, the clashing is not limited to geopolitics. The first shots of the war over reconstruction spoils have already been fired; over time, their blasts could drown out even the din of Russia's military assault on civilian-packed Idlib , already underway. Mouaz al-Khatib, founding president of the Syrian National Coalition Inside Syria, unbearable misery is omnipresent nationwide amid rising opioid addiction, high crime rates, and a pervasive lack of security. A recent sobering study found that over 40% of Syrian refugee children no do not attend school. But while previous diplomatic and political initiatives have failed to end Syria's suffering, history offers a potential roadmap. The Rwandan , Bosnian , and even Polish experiences could inspire a reasonable solution for Syria: Poland-style roundtable talks bringing together ruling elites and opposition and grassroots leaders, for example, have not been seriously explored but should be considered. Read More ISIS has lost its final stronghold in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces says Syria is one mighty tragedy, but tragedies are bound to eventually end. Mustering the international political will for a solution can nudge the Syrian tragedy closer to a solution. One way to do that is through the adoption of a pre-transitional phase centered on a pre-transitional presidential council to be established by mutual consensus. The six-member PTPC could include President Bashar al-Assad, but would acquire his powers within a year. By the end of the established time-frame, Assad would be completely transitioned out, a condition without which the bloodletting would not stop. Such a negotiated council could lay the groundwork for stabilization by releasing political detainees, issuing a general amnesty, and ensuring a proper environment for political talks. While accommodating Russian fears about total state collapse, it would restructure the military and intelligence agencies. Municipal elections, followed by parliamentary elections under international monitoring, could follow, allowing Syrians to finally choose a new constitution. A new parliament could elect a new president, who would dissolve the pre-transitional council and establish a transitional justice process, to help Syria confront crimes committed during the war, and a truth and reconciliation commission to pave the way for a new dawn for Syria. Why would Assad agree to any of this? He probably would not, but his sponsors, especially Russia, have an interest in pressuring him to get on board with such a face-saving initiative before Syria completely disintegrates and all end up losing. I know from my own outreach that pressure could also come from within the regime. If encouraged, goaded, and offered a credible alternative, the scale of the Syrian catastrophe may yet prompt leaders within the regime to overcome their fear of meeting with opposition leaders for frank discussions in search of a common way out before their whole ship goes down. Equally important, such an initiative has the potential to galvanize grassroots support across the Syrian divide and bring Syrians from across the spectrum together. Journey to safety was more terrifying than Aleppo, activists say The failure of all other avenues means a path like this one could succeed. Previous diplomatic proposals, including the tortured Geneva process, have failed to bridge the gulf between conference rooms and the crushing realities on the ground. Eight years on, a political solution does not seem near; rather than focusing on a governing body to transition Syria away from dictatorship, Syrians are being distracted by a constitution-drafting committee that will do nothing to stanch the bleeding. Some UN envoys to Syria have performed disgracefully , operating as little more than mail carriers without any creativity, and humoring the states that dominate the war-torn country without a credible proposal to see Syrians through their ordeal. Meanwhile, Syria slips away. The Assad regime is fast decaying. Pro-regime social media sites clearly show the extent of frustration among regime loyalists on whose behalf the regime declared a hollow ""victory"" only to lose its own supporters by failing to provide the most basic services . Things do not look better in opposition-controlled areas, either, where civilian-run councils are hobbled by lack of support and burgeoning military factions -- greedy for money and power. These treacherous conditions have recently prompted the head of the Syrian Opposition Interim Government, Dr. Jawad Abu Hatab, to tender his resignation. Gasping for life: Syria's merciless war on its own children While maintaining unfettered levels of military, diplomatic, and political support to Assad, the Russians have placed before the Syrian political opposition the daunting challenge of competing in presidential elections two years away, a suggestion I've heard in conversations with senior Russian officials. The Syrian opposition, in the meantime, preoccupies itself by jostling over tiny crumbs of ""power"" they hope to gain from future unempowered positions, with many opposition groups in the Astana and Sochi conferences operating more as expressions of regional agendas than as a national Syrian project. All competing powers are seeking to turn a catastrophe to their advantage with no regard for the Syrian people. Russia seeks to reassert itself on the world stage as a superpower and to build up its influence in the Middle East; the Iranians are playing a long game to reach the Mediterranean by entrenching themselves politically and socially in Syria ; the Israelis lobby tirelessly for recognition of their annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights; Turkey seeks control over northern Syria fearing Kurdish separatism; the Kurds seek an independent entity; and the United States seeks continued military presence. Syria has become a cauldron for strategic conflicts pitting state and sub-state actors with competing interests against each other. The bill is footed by Syrians. But this does not have to be Syria's kismet. Top US general refutes report that military could keep nearly 1,000 US troops in Syria Such an approach, to move toward a new government following historical models of conflict resolution and post-conflict transition, based on intra-Syrian outreach and communication, buttressed by coercive international diplomacy, especially by the United States and Russia, could bring Syria back to life from its dying gasps. A credible road map is the only guarantee for arresting state collapse, stopping the brain drain and capital flight, and encouraging Syrians to return to help rebuild their country. Neither Bashar al-Assad's recent speech that all is well in Syria, nor the unceremonious visit to Iran that was arranged for him will keep Syria from going down an abyss spawned by fifty years of fascist rule. Many countries have come apart only to return much stronger, their people born anew thanks to the lessons they learned from their bitter experiences. The Syrian people are known for their entrepreneurship and vim and vigor; they certainly deserve to see their country return to life. Getting there will not be easy, but it is not mission impossible."
Sudan protests: Sudanese troops move to protect demonstrators - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliza Mackintosh,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/africa/sudan-protests-military-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Some members of the Sudanese army have moved to protect protesters in the capital, Khartoum, after national security forces attempted to break up the third day of a mass sit-in outside the presidential compound and army headquarters, according to an opposition union of doctors.

Trump's strategy with Jewish community won't work (Opinion),us.cnn.com,Julian Zelizer,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/trump-jewish-community-strategy-zelizer/index.html,"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, and author, with Kevin Kruse, of the new book "" Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.

(CNN) President Donald Trump told the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas Saturday that Democrats ""are advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history.""
In his ongoing effort to win over a bigger percentage of the American Jewish vote in 2020, the president highlighted his support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and criticized Congresswoman Ilhan Omar in asking American Jews to support the GOP. The strategy won't work. Traditionally, solid majorities of American Jews have voted for Democratic presidential candidates. The only Republicans who made some progress against this trend were Ronald Reagan, with 39% of the Jewish vote in 1980, and Mitt Romney, with 30% in 2012. Normally, the numbers look more like they did in 2016 -- when Hillary Clinton won 71% of the Jewish vote and Trump got 23%, despite his efforts to use Israel as a wedge issue. Trump belittles Democrats, says asylum seekers look like they're 'fighting for the UFC' In 2019, the numbers don't look good for Trump. According to Gallup, 71% of Jewish respondents disapprove of the president. In 2018, only 16% of American Jews identified as Republicans. In the 2018 midterms, 79% of American Jewish voters supported Democratic candidates. In other words, what the Conservative Political Action Conference has called ""Jexodus"" isn't likely to happen. Read More Most American Jewish voters remain liberal. They don't support the reactionary agenda that President Trump has championed. For instance, a sizable majority of American Jews hold liberal views about immigration. As a community that has spent much of its history seeking safe harbor and fleeing persecution -- a history that Jews will be talking about in their homes over the upcoming Passover seders -- they are not on board with the President's efforts to build border walls and shut down the asylum seekers. There is good reason why all of the Jews currently serving in the Senate are Democrats and only two of the Jewish Representatives are Republican. The pre parties have more work to do to fight anti-Semitism When it comes to Israel, polls from the American Jewish Committee have shown that most American Jews don't support Prime Minister Netanyahu's positions on the conflict with Palestinians. By large numbers, American Jews continue to support a two-state solution, they want to curtail settlements, and they believe in the peace process. The American Jewish Committee found that only 34% of American Jews support how Trump is handling American-Israeli relations. The notion that being ""pro-Israel"" means endorsing the Netanyahu government is a myth propagated by the right, one which most American Jewish voters don't agree with. To be sure, President Trump's hardline rhetoric about the current government of Israel does play with some minority parts of the American Jewish community. The President has also been exploiting concerns that exist over the rhetoric used by Congresswoman Omar and other progressives in their criticism of AIPAC, such as her tweeting out ""All About the Benjamins"" and making statements that, some believed, implied Jews have a dual loyalty to the United States and Israel. Although Omar apologized for this and other issues, Democrats have not been able to quell the concerns about renewed anti-Semitism on the left. But as the President finds some sympathetic audiences with his cynical deployment of the issue, he has not been able to grow support within the GOP. Then there is President Trump himself. There is now a long and well-documented record of his willingness to use anti-Semitic tropes and images, even as he claims to be the best President for American Jews. He has retweeted out anti-Semitic imagery on several occasions, while he has consistently refused to come down hard on white nationalist forces within the United States who are the champions of the most lethal forms of anti-Jewish sentiment. The infamous neo-Nazis at Charlottesville chanted ""The Jews Will Not Replace Us!"" He has joked about Jews enjoying bargaining and money. Even in the speech to the Jewish Republicans, he employed the dual loyalty rhetoric that Republicans have been deriding with Congresswoman Omar when he spoke about ""your Prime Minister."" Indeed, the entire notion that American Jewish voters can be won over simply through hardline positions about Israel plays directly into the worst stereotypes about the community. The hypocritical way in which he manipulates this issue is an insult to voters. Stay up to date...
Despite his predictions, President Trump is actually one of the worst things to happen to Republicans who have been working to increase their hold on the American Jewish electorate. Putting aside his own bluster, he has done a great deal to isolate, marginalize and even scare American Jewish voters who might have been giving some thought to switching their historic allegiance from the party of Franklin Roosevelt. If they think that large numbers are going to be bolting to the party of Trump, they should take a harder look at the President's actual record."

(CNN) Running the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may be the toughest job in the federal government.
The DHS is a sprawling giant of 22 agencies that merged together in the wake of 9/11. The department's 240,000 employees handle everything from hurricanes to cyber security to border security to terrorism. As secretary of homeland security, a lot of things can happen on your watch: A botched response to a hurricane, or a serious cyber attack, or a major terrorist assault, or rising numbers of migrant families trying to cross the southern border. That's why in the past the top job at DHS has gone to a party elder skilled in politics, such as the former governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano, who served in the role during President Obama's first term or, the former governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, who served under George W. Bush. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen If it wasn't a skilled politician who took the top DHS job, it went to officials who had served at the highest levels of policy-making or the US military such as the Bush-appointed Michael Chertoff, who ran the criminal division at the Department of Justice where he oversaw the investigation of the 9/11 attacks. Read More During his second term Obama appointed Jeh Johnson , who had been the top lawyer at the Pentagon, while Trump appointed Gen. John Kelly, the former four-star general in charge of Southern Command, which is responsible for all US military operations in Latin America. Kirstjen Nielsen was neither a political heavyweight nor had she served in senior policy or military roles when she took over DHS. Nielsen had worked at the George W. Bush White House in a relatively junior role for three years and then had gone into the private sector for more than a decade. When Kelly was tapped by Trump to run DHS, Nielsen was appointed to be his ""sherpa"" during his confirmation process. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster exposes Trump's immigration crisis Kelly was impressed and made Nielsen his chief of staff at DHS. When Kelly moved to the White House to serve as Trump's chief of staff, Kelly brought Nielsen over to be his deputy. Kelly then pushed for Nielsen to take over DHS. Like so many other top Trump officials, Kelly was eventually forced out and in December he left the White House. Kelly had served as a heat shield for Nielsen, who sometimes bore the brunt of Trump's ire. The President blew up at her at a Cabinet meeting last spring because she was hesitant to sign a memo ordering migrant children to be separated from their parents, according to the New York Times. In October, Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton had a curse-laden shouting match at the White House about the rising number of migrant crossings at the southern border. Bolton told Kelly that Nielsen needed to do her job, which led to the heated argument in which Kelly defended his former deputy, according to CNN. With Kelly gone, Nielsen no longer had an advocate at the White House. She became Trump's scapegoat for the rising number of migrant families trying to cross the southern border in recent months. Many of those families are fleeing the violence and economic travail of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and there isn't much that any DHS secretary can do to try to stem the flow of migrants willing to leave everything behind to seek a better future in the United States. Stay up to date...
Almost a century ago one such desperate migrant, Mary Anne MacLeod, left the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Europe, to find work as a servant in New York. Mary later married Fred Trump. They had five children, including a son named Donald. Trying to dissuade migrants such as Mary Anne MacLeod from leaving countries where they see no future to seek their fortune in the United States is likely beyond the ken of any secretary of homeland security."
She lived for 99 years with organs in all the wrong places and never knew it,us.cnn.com,"Sandee LaMotte, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/99-year-old-backward-organs-medical-oddity/index.html,"(CNN) On an early spring day in 2018, the faint smell of formaldehyde floating in the air, 26-year-old medical student Warren Nielsen and four of his classmates prepped a cadaver in the chilly dissection lab at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.
Similar groups of five gathered around bodies on the other 15 tables in the anatomy class, all eager to explore the mysteries of the human body they had seen only in textbooks. The cadaver assigned to Nielsen's team was a 99-year-old woman who had died of natural causes. Her name was Rose Marie Bentley, but the students didn't know that then. To honor and respect the privacy of those who offer their bodies to science, no further details are given medical students about the person who had once inhabited the body lying on the silvery slab before them. Rose Marie Bentley, not long before she died and donated her body to science. But as the students and their professors were soon to find out, Bentley was special, so special she deserved her own unique spot in medical literature and history books. The reason? A condition called situs inversus with levocardia, in which most vital organs are reversed -- almost like a mirror inside the body. That, along with a host of other weird but wonderful abnormalities, made Bentley a sort of medical unicorn. Read More ""I think the odds of finding another person like her may be as remote as one in 50 million,"" said assistant professor Cameron Walker, who teaches the Foundations of Clinical Anatomy class at Oregon Health and Science University. ""I don't think any of us will ever forget it, honestly."" 'This is totally backwards' On this March day, the assignment was to open the body's chest cavity to examine the heart. It wasn't long before Nielsen's group began to question their fledgling medical knowledge. ""Her heart was missing a large vein that's normally on the right side,"" Nielsen said. Bewildered, he and his team called the professors over and asked: ""Where's the inferior vena cava? Are we missing it? Are we crazy?"" ""And they kind of rolled their eyes,"" Nielsen said, ""Like, 'how can these students miss this big vessel?' And they come over and that's when the hubbub starts. They're like 'Oh, my God, this is totally backwards!' "" A typical body has a large vein called the vena cava that follows the right side of the vertebral column, curving under the liver and emptying deoxygenated blood into the heart. Bentley's vein was on the left, and instead of terminating directly into the heart, which is typical, ""her vein continued through her diaphragm, along the thoracic vertebrae, up and around and over the aortic arch and then emptied into the right side of her heart,"" Walker said. ""Normally speaking, none of us have a vessel that does that directly,"" he added. That wasn't the only irregularity Walker and his students found in Bentley's body. Numerous veins that typically drain the liver and other parts of the chest cavity were either missing or sprouting from an unusual spot. Her right lung had only two lobes, instead of the standard three, while the right atrium of her heart was twice normal size. ""And instead of having a stomach on the left, which is normal, her stomach was on the right,"" Walker said. ""Her liver, which normally occurs predominantly on the right, was predominantly on the left. Her spleen was on the right side instead of its normal occurrence on the left. And then the rest of her digestive tract, the ascending colon, was inverted as well."" The mutations in situs inversus with levocardia occur early, Walker explained, possibly between 30 and 45 days into the pregnancy. No one knows why. The condition occurs in only 1 out of 22,000 babies and is invariably associated with severe congenital heart disease. Because of the heart defects, only 5% to 13% live past the age of 5; case reports mention one 13-year-old boy and a 73-year-old who at the time was the second-longest survivor. But Bentley was an anomaly, one of the few born with the condition that didn't have heart defects, Walker said. ""That is almost certainly the factor that contributed most to her long life,"" he said. And that, along with all her other exceedingly rare anatomical abnormalities, is what makes Bentley 1 in 50 million, Walker estimated. 'Mom would have been so tickled' Rose Marie Phelps was born in 1918 in Waldport, a small town on the Oregon coast. The youngest child of four, ""she was babied,"" said daughter Patti Helmig, who at 78 is the oldest of her five children. ""She would admit she was spoiled."" A hairdresser by trade, Bentley was always fascinated by science, Helmig remembered, and she believes her mother would have made a fine nurse if she had been given the opportunity to train. ""She volunteered during World War II for one of the nurse's aid corps,"" Helmig said. ""And she was thrilled when someone reached out to her about doing a study on smallpox survivors, which she had as a child."" Rose Marie Bentley with a big catch. Despite chronic heartburn (which would have been explained by her unusual gastric anatomy), Bentley never showed any negative effects from her flip-flopped innards, said 76-year-old Ginger Robbins, the third of Bentley's children. ""We had no reason to believe there was anything like that wrong,"" Robbins said. ""She was always very healthy. She was always doing something, taking us to Campfire Girls, fishing, swimming. She was an excellent swimmer."" The only clue anything might be unusual came when Bentley's appendix was removed, said 66-year-old Louise Allee, the fourth-born child and youngest of the daughters. ""The surgeon made a note that her appendix wasn't in the right spot when they took it out,"" Allee said, ""but never said anything to us. Nobody said a thing when they took her gallbladder out and did a hysterectomy, either."" Get
The decision to become a body donor began with Jim Bentley, Rose Marie's husband, but she too ""thought it was the greatest thing,"" Allee remembers. ""There was a poem that my dad found, and it was all about donating your parts,"" she said. ""You know, 'give my eyes to a man who has never seen the sunrise' and the like. He kept showing us the poem. It was really important to them."" The poem, written by Robert Test, opens with the line: ""Give my sight to the man who has never seen a sunrise, a baby's face, or love in the eyes of a woman,"" and ends with ""If, by chance, you wish to remember me, do it with a kind deed or word to someone who needs you. If you do all I have asked, I will live forever."" The couple's beliefs about donation made an impact. All three daughters plan to donate their bodies for research. Rose Marie Bentley, a one in 50 million gal. Jim Bentley kept his promise and donated his body when he died of pneumonia more than a dozen years before his wife's death.

"Number of children going to ER with suicidal thoughts, attempts doubles, study finds",us.cnn.com,"Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/child-teen-suicide-er-study/index.html,"(CNN) The number of children and teens who visited emergency rooms for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts doubled between 2007 and 2015, according to a new analysis.
Researchers used publicly available data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , administered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention every year. From the 300 emergency rooms sampled, the researchers tracked the number of children between 5 and 18 who received a diagnosis of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts each year. Diagnoses of either condition increased from 580,000 in 2007 to 1.12 million in 2015, according to the study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics . The average age of a child at the time of evaluation was 13, and 43% of the visits were in children between 5 and 11. Suicides under age 13: One every 5 days ""The numbers are very alarming,"" said Dr. Brett Burstein, the lead study author and a pediatric emergency room physician at Montreal Children's Hospital of McGill University Health Centre. ""It also represents a larger percentage of all pediatric emergency department visits. Where suicidal behavior among the pediatric population was just 2% of all visits, that's now up to 3.5%."" The findings come as no surprise to child psychiatrists. Read More ""We know that suicide and depression have been rising significantly,"" said Dr. Gene Beresin, executive director of The Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. Depression and a prior suicide attempt are the two biggest risk factors for suicide, and with rates of suicide on the rise, it makes sense for risk factors to increase as well, he explained. The reason? It's complicated One reason for the increase in depression and suicidal behaviors may be more stress and pressure on kids, Beresin said. ""Kids are feeling more pressure to achieve, more pressure in school, and are more worried about making a living than in previous years,"" he said. Parents and caregivers are also more stressed, Beresin said, adding that rates of suicides have increased in all age groups over the past 20 years and that the stress is passed down to children and teens. Another reason may be the rise of social media and increasing rates of cyberbullying that have come with it, Beresin said. Suicide rate hit 40-year peak among older teen girls in 2015 Approximately 15% of US high school students report that they've been bullied online in the past year, according to the CDC . A Pew Research Center survey found that the number could be even higher: 59%. ""Cyberbullying can be especially difficult for kids,"" explained Dr. Neha Chaudhary, child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and co-founder of Brainstorm: Stanford Lab for Brain Health Innovation and Entrepreneurship. ""Unlike in settings like schools, it can fly under the radar without anyone knowing it's happening and without the same repercussions for the bullies."" In isolation, none of these factors has been proven to lead to an increase in suicidal behaviors and ultimately suicide, but taken together, a pattern begins to emerge, Beresin said. And the country may not be adequately equipped to deal with the problem. Families left waiting According to data from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the majority of the United States faces a severe shortage of practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists, with fewer than 17 providers available per 100,000 children. This means many families face long wait times, which can lead to worsening of a child's underlying mental health condition and an eventual need for more treatment sessions than if the condition had been addressed in its early stages, explained Jennifer Mautone, a psychologist in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The available qualified providers face another challenge: communicating with other systems caring for children. Nearly 1 in 7 US kids and teens has a mental health condition, and half go untreated, study says Many systems are aimed at caring for children, including the education, health care, juvenile justice and child welfare systems, said Dr. Barbara Robles-Ramamurthy, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Long School of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio who was not involved in the study. ""All of these systems that are supposed to be caring for children oftentimes are not talking to each other,"" she said. ""A lot of times, kids fall through the cracks, and families are not getting the appropriate support they need.""
According to a study published in JAMA Pediatrics in February, half of kids with mental health conditions like depression and anxiety go untreated. Rising rates of mental health conditions in youth coupled with difficulties accessing care and long waiting lists is a bad combination, Beresin said. Burstein, who regularly sees children and teens in the emergency department with suicidal behaviors, worries that the rates will continue to increase. ""We are seeing an acceleration of this issue, and I worry that we have not yet seen the peak,"" he said."
Illinois raises age for buying tobacco,us.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/health/illinois-tobacco-age/index.html,"(CNN) Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed legislation on Sunday that raises the legal age for purchasing cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21.
HB 345 takes effect July 1. It aims to reduce tobacco use among teens and young adults by preventing them from starting, said Pritzker and state lawmakers who attended Sunday's bill signing. Gov. JB Pritzker signs legislation raising the age for buying tobacco products. Statistics show that most smokers start as teenagers, and the younger they are when they start, the more likely they'll become addicted. Illinois joins a growing list of states and municipalities adopting ""Tobacco 21"" policies, as vaping among teens is on the rise . Teen smoking rates have declined over the years, but advocates warn that the popularity of e-cigarettes threatens to reverse the progress. Read More Some tobacco and e-cigarette companies have signaled support for Tobacco 21 policies. The chief executive officer of JUUL Labs commended Pritzker and the bill's sponsors for their ""leadership on the issue."" In a statement, Ken Burns pledged the e-cigarette maker's support for similar legislation in other states, saying the policies reduce sharing by legal-age peers, a major contributor to youth tobacco use. ""We know Tobacco 21 policies work. In areas where they are already enacted, smoking rates are falling,"" the company said previously . ""We urge lawmakers in states without these age protections to follow their example, and when and if they do, we will proudly support their efforts."" Other places where you have to be 21 to purchase tobacco Washington's governor on Friday signed legislation that will take effect in 2020. The New York Senate passed legislation on April 1 that is expected to go to the governor's desk. States where the legal age is already 21 include Hawaii, California, New Jersey, Oregon, Maine and Massachusetts. Laws will take effect later this year in Arkansas and Virginia. Chicago raised the age in 2016 for purchasing tobacco, in what Pritzker called a model for the statewide legislation. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who attended Sunday's signing, said raising the age contributed to reductions in youth smoking in Chicago. Pritzker cited statistics showing that tobacco use is on the rise among youth, driven largely by e-cigarettes . The new law would help reverse the trend, he said. ""We're dealing with an old problem in a new form,"" Pritzker said. ""And while all our residents have the right to make this choice for themselves, we need to be realistic about what that choice means for our young people."" His predecessor, Gov. Bruce Rautner, vetoed a similar measure, saying it would limit consumer choice and drive people to other states or non-licensed vendors for purchases. Pritzker dismissed concerns that the legislation would hurt businesses by depriving them of revenue. He called on neighboring states to pass similar laws to discourage people from crossing state lines. The new law does not include penalties for underage possession, but businesses face fines and sanctions for selling to consumers under 21. What parents should know about the 'huge epidemic' of vaping A March 2015 report by the Institute of Medicine -- now called the National Academy of Medicine -- concluded that raising the age would save lives and lead to better public health outcomes. The report found that increasing the age reduces tobacco initiation among 15- to 17-year-olds, leading to reductions in smoking prevalence. Representative Camille Y. Lilly, who sponsored the Illinois legislation, said it will reduce sharing among underage teens who get tobacco from older friends. ""It takes health care to make America better,"" she said. ""This piece of legislation brings us forward."""
"Senators' scathing letter to Juul demands answers about tactics targeting youth, ties to Big Tobacco",us.cnn.com,"Michael Nedelman, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/juul-senators/index.html,"(CNN) Leading e-cigarette company Juul Labs is under the microscope again, with 11 senators demanding answers from the company at the center of the youth vaping ""epidemic"" whose business practices have been shrouded in ""immense secrecy,"" the senators said in a letter to Juul on Monday.
They are requesting data, plans and other information from Juul related to its popularity among youth and its relationship with tobacco giant Altria, which invested nearly $13 billion in the company late last year. The Altria deal signaled that Juul is ""more interested in padding its profit margins than protecting our nation's children,"" says the letter, signed by Democrats including Dick Durbin of Illinois, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Juul ramped up nicotine levels, and competitors followed, study says ""Altria has a long and sordid history of spending billions to entice children to smoke through targeted campaigns that intentionally lied about the science and health effects from cigarettes,"" the letter says. The move comes as Dr. Scott Gottlieb -- who took a strong stance against underage vaping as commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration -- stepped down Friday, prompting questions about how aggressively the agency will continue to pursue the issue under new leadership. Read More ""Incoming Acting FDA Commissioner [Dr. Ned] Sharpless must, on day one, work to protect our nation's children from a lifetime of nicotine addiction by putting the full force of FDA behind this effort,"" Durbin said in a statement. ""An epidemic must be dealt with immediately, not months or years from now,"" he said. The senators are pressing Juul for detailed information on its sales and ad spending; how the company plans to keep underage people from seeing its ads or buying its products; new business dealings that emerged after the Altria announcement; how the company plans to verify ages and prevent people from ordering in bulk online; and what financial ties the company has to the ""conservative-leaning and anti-regulation organizations "" that wrote to President Trump in February, hoping to hamper the FDA's crackdown. #JUUL: How social media hyped nicotine for a new generation In addition, the lawmakers requested a complete list of ""social media influencers"" paid by Juul to publicize its brand. A CNN investigation in December shed light on Juul's influencer program and identified several of the social media users who participated. At the time, a representative for Juul said that the company had abandoned that program, describing it as small and short-lived. But now the senators want to know whether the company conducted this business in line with Federal Trade Commission regulations. The company's response to the letter -- addressed to its CEO, Kevin Burns -- is requested by April 25. In an emailed statement Monday, Juul said ""we welcome the opportunity to share information regarding JUUL Labs' commitment to curbing underage use of our products while fulfilling our mission to eliminate combustible cigarettes,"" promising to continue to work with various elected officials and authorities. The company added it has taken steps to curb underage use, such as halting most retail sales of flavored products and shutting down some of its social media accounts. Juul also said its deal with Altria ""will help us switch adult smokers off of combustible cigarettes by helping us get our product in their hands"" -- by including Juul inserts in cigarette packs, for example. FDA investigates reports of seizures after vaping Juul has maintained that its products are intended to convert adult former smokers to what it describes as a less-harmful alternative. But in the wake of the Altria deal, the senators say, Juul ""has lost what little remaining credibility the company had when it claimed to care about the public health."" The FDA revealed in November that vaping had increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since the year before. Public health experts say that Juul has largely propelled the rise, holding about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States. Experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs. The FDA has been conducting its own investigation into e-cigarette companies in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy. The agency also conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's San Francisco headquarters in October, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.
Most of the same senators also wrote to Juul last year , pressing the company to take swift action to keep its nicotine-filled products out of kids' hands -- but they have been disappointed by the lack of progress made since then, the lawmakers said. ""While you and your investors may be perfectly content with hooking an entire new generation of children on your tobacco products in order to increase your profit margins,"" the letter says, ""we will not rest until your dangerous products are out of the hands of our nation's children."""
"Particulate pollution in the air we breathe kills hundreds of thousands a year, study finds",us.cnn.com,Jen Christensen,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/particle-pollution-study/index.html,"(CNN) Air pollution is deadly: A new study links exposure to it to more than 107,000 premature deaths in the United States in 2011.
It isn't just killing us; it cost the country $866 billion, more than double the value of all the economic activity in a country like Ireland, according to the study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Particulate matter, or particle pollution, is the mix of solid and liquid droplets floating in the air, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. It can come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Particulate pollution comes from coal- and natural gas-fired plants. Cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires can also create it. Air pollution linked to 3.2 million new diabetes cases in one year This study focused on the harm caused by the tiniest particulate matter, PM2.5 . It's so tiny --1/20th of a width of a human hair -- that you cannot see it, and it can travel past your body's usual defenses . Instead of being breathed out, it can get stuck in your lungs or go into your bloodstream. The particles cause irritation and inflammation and can lead to respiratory problems. Long-term exposure can cause cancer, stroke and heart attack. Read More The most harmful emissions account for the largest share of the total damage, with the top 10% of sources of PM2.5 pollution accounting for 54% of damage, the study found. The highest damage happens in high-population areas such as Los Angeles. Hispanics and blacks create less air pollution than whites, but breathe more of it, study finds Using a model called the Intervention Model for Air Pollution, InMAP , researchers calculated location-specific estimates of the damage from emissions. About a third of the deaths reported in the study were among people who lived within 5 miles of the pollution source, but they weren't the only ones affected. About a quarter of the deaths were among people who lived more than 150 miles from the pollution sources. ""Overall, the number of deaths we are seeing with this, that's more than traffic accidents and homicides combined,"" said study co-author Julian Marshall , a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington. ""Seeing this should be a strong motivator to make improvements."" Which cities face most, least air pollution according to new WHO data Of these deaths, 57% were associated with pollution caused by energy consumption, the study found. About 28% was related to transportation, 14% to electricity generation from coal-fired and gas plants and 15% to pollution caused by farm activities like the application and storage of manure and other fertilizers. Because no one sector is to blame, the authors argue that multiple industries need sizable reductions in pollution. Marshall said the good news is that policy solutions work. The air is cleaner than it has been in past decades. The Clean Air Act made a huge difference, but there's always room for improvement. ""If you look at the cost and benefit of addressing air pollution, the costs are far outweighed by the benefit of having cleaner air,"" Marshall said. Air pollution particles found inside human brains Dr. Brian Christman, a spokesman for the American Lung Association, said the high number of deaths in the study should be a concern for everyone. ""If two planes were going down every day -- that's about the same number of deaths in this study -- this would be on the front page of every newspaper,"" said Christman, who was not involved in the research. ""This should be seen as a call to action."" Research has shown that air pollution is a serious health problem. A study published Wednesday showed that air pollution will shorten children's life expectancy by 20 months, on average. Prolonged exposure also hurts our ability to think clearly, reducing scores on verbal and math tests, studies have shown . It may increase risk of dementia. No amount of air pollution is safe, Christman said. Pollution in the United States, though, probably won't be reduced any time soon. More bad news for coal: Wind and solar are getting cheaper In August, the Trump administration announced plans to let states set their own coal-fired plant emission standards. By the EPA's own risk analysis, the additional pollution will result in up to 1,400 more premature deaths a year by 2030. By the same year, the Obama administration's Clean Air Plan , which the new rule will replace, would have avoided 3,600 premature deaths, according to the analysis. Christman noted that the authors of the new study mention the need to balance health issues with regulatory burdens, but he said that when politicians say this, it always feels like a ""false equivalency."" ""This is America. We can always find new ways to generate energy or create technology that doesn't hurt our people,"" Christman said.
The country would benefit significantly from any reduction in pollution, Marshall said. ""There are such significant health benefits when you reduce this kind of pollution. People live longer healthier lives; there would be fewer heart attacks and strokes and lung cancer. Hopefully we will continue to improve on this issue."""
