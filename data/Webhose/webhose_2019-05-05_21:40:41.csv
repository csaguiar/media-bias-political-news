And obviously, the mavens in the so-called news media could study their geography better.
The likely objective of Haftar and his LNA is to isolate Tripoli, Misrata, and other coastal enclaves, while gaining control of northwestern Libya to the Tunisian border. This area will include the coastal regions where all the ""migrant express"" boat traffic has been launched for Italy for some years now.
With the LNA in control, the Italians can negotiate a new deal, this time with Haftar. And the latter is more amenable to border control and keeping Libya from being used as a highway. So the migrant express will no longer be in business. Those in Libya will be rounded up and sent back across the Sahara.
Any new agreement between Libya and Italy will be between two strong men with a lot of credibility, namely Haftar and Salvini. They can each speak for their side, and make a deal work."

I have some comments elsewhere on this thread on what might happen in the coming weeks. At any rate, here's my take on Saif:
Haftar's LNA is likely to soon gain control of the Libyan coast between Tripoli and the Tunisian border, an area where many of the migrant boats have been launched. And he may then get control of the area between Tripoli and Misrata, the other coastline with launchpoints. The strategy here is to isolate those two centers rather than get tied down in urban warfare. That will give Haftar control of at least 99% of Libyan territory. And he, and no one else, will be the new strongman there.
So what about Saif? We should be concerned for what mischief he could cause, but it may be he will try to leave the country, if some other place is willing to take him. There are still Gaddafi family members and regime supporters in exile, and they seem to have more than enough money to live on. They might be able to make some mischief from exile. But will they? Any efforts seem doomed from the start.
But if Saif stays in Libya, he will likely not do well opposing Haftar. Haftar has Egyptian support, and may now be getting Gulf Arab money, or certainly more than he has been getting. Most Libyans might miss Gaddafi, but they want a restoration of public safety and security, and getting the benefits of the oil industry coming their way again. The question is, would most Libyans be willing to make a break with the past (Gaddafi and his family) to ensure a strong government that would get the economy back in shape? If so, I'd certainly bet on Haftar, and not Saif.
Under the circumstances, what Saif might want to do is make his peace with Haftar and wait, as Haftar is old and he is still quite young by comparison. The future, or a good part of it, could yet be his. And then, perhaps, he could mete out his revenge upon those he would deem responsible for his father's overthrow.
Just my thoughts. I'd be interested in any comments you might have. These are certainly interesting times."

As there is absolutely no legitimate evidence whatsoever that will substantiate that pure utter nonsense.
As Muslim stealth jihadists, i.e., enemy Muslim invaders and conquerors, posing as being so-called migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees migrating to the West to wage stealth demographic jihad never ever assimilate and integrate. As that would constitute apostasy and be an automatic death sentence for them. So instead, they settle into Muslim no-go zones ruled by Sharia that in effect are really tiny independent Islamic Sharia Statelets residing within the larger host non-Muslim unbeliever societies as ticking time bombs.
In fact, the government of France, a few years ago, counted in excess of 700 Muslim no-go zones in France alone and they are almost as prevalent throughout the EU and the UK and are also rapidly forming throughout the USA and Canada today as well.
Hence, saying that Muslim stealth jihadists, i.e., enemy Muslim invaders and conquerors, are migrants is out and out intentional deception, and the people responsible for it should be held to account and locked up behind bars for the remainder of their damn lives."

I am your long time fan. The world mess, dems/RINO's have nothing to do with Trump's person such as it is. Trump talks a good game. Jerry Lewis nailed it with the showman remark. Barry is evil to tge core. When you experience full bore the consequences of barry's ""transformation"", you will understand why this is beyond political palaver. America is occupied and people walk around in denial while Trump avoids CLOSING OUR BORDERS and being CIC. Very sad. We ALL pay on every level for his cowardice."

BTW, I'm American, and have few nice things to say about the former administration. And I worked in Europe and the UK for part of the Blairite Horror Years, and tell my fellow citizens that what they saw in 2009-2017 could be a lot worse, and could indeed be worse if they ever vote in such a regime again.
As for Trump, he was the logical choice in 2016 and will almost certainly be the logical one in 2020 for anyone who cares about our national defense, economic prosperity, and respect for the Constitution and US law.. I have gotten earfulls from others not happy with how he goes about trying to get things done. I often have to remind them that we would all be a lot less happy had his opponent have been elected. Many Americans voted for Trump in spite of his faults. And certainly for a lot of people, their choice was based on the fact that he was not Hillary, or any other sort of Democrat. And considering what Trump has done so far, practically all of those who voted for him in 2016 will vote for him again next year.
Trump is indeed Trump, and will remain so. He was voted in for what he promised he would do, and he surprised many by keeping some promises and is still trying to keep others. And despite that all that was promised has not yet been accomplished, the US is better off for what has been done so far. I appreciate your comment on how you are disappointed on what he has not done, but if he is re-elected, it will be largely on what he has done. And next year's choice might be like that of 2016. Maybe not the best choice, but certainly a clear one."

How many republicans will stay home if Trump continues to crapweasel and betray both his base and America by helping invaders across the border. Make no mistake: so long as catch and release is in force--AND IT IS--dependent, diseased, predator invaders will continue to add to occupiers. If you are unaffected, count your blessings. The spanish heiroglyphics are on the NO WALL fence. I suggest you take your family along with the Trumps and live UNPROTECTED on the border. Or come and live in Wyoming or Kentwood, MI. Or better yet, Dearborn.
Look at the vapid cabinet members and remember Sessions, mcMasters. Bannon saw this coming. Blind ego is a terribly destructive trait.
All the above plus NO JUSTICE SYSTEM will tank America. Hoping everything will be okie dokey won't do it. Israel has already surpassed America as a superpower. Every barry holdover is a bloodletting. Trump could have axed 12,000 by this time.
This will not end well no matter how much you wish. Good grief. You lived in the UK. Look at it.
