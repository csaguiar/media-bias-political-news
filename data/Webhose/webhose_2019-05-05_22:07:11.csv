Trump Claims “Every Right” To See Full Mueller Report,www.joemygod.com,Joe Jervis,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.joemygod.com/2019/04/trump-claims-every-right-to-see-full-mueller-report/,"The Hill reports :
President Trump said Saturday he has not yet read special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report which was delivered to the Justice Department late last month, but said he has “every right to do so” as House Democrats clamor for the document to be released publicly.
Democratic lawmakers have tried five times to pass a House resolution, which says there is “overwhelming public interest” in the government releasing the contents of the high-profile Mueller report.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday blocked a resolution calling for Mueller’s report on the Russia probe to be released, marking the fifth time Republicans have blocked the House-passed measure. I have not read the Mueller Report yet, even though I have every right to do so. Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion. Likewise, recommendations made to our great A.G. who found No Obstruction. 13 Angry Trump hating Dems (later brought to 18) given two…..

Dem Leaders Troubled By Lingering 2016 Primary Anger,www.joemygod.com,Joe Jervis,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.joemygod.com/2019/04/dem-leaders-troubled-by-lingering-2016-primary-anger/,"April 6, 2019 2020 Elections , Democrats
The Associated Press reports :
Some establishment-aligned Democrats worry the party could lose in 2020 if lingering concerns about the last primary aren’t put to bed. “It has the potential to escalate, and it has the potential to help re-elect Donald Trump,” said Mo Elleithee, a former spokesman for Clinton and the DNC.
The acrimony stems from a fiercely fought campaign and a sense among Sanders loyalists that party leaders privately favored Clinton. DNC leaders at the time scheduled fewer debates than Republicans and sometimes slated them for nights with low television viewership. Often opaque delegate allocation rules also contributed to a belief among some Sanders supporters that the primary was essentially rigged.
According to data from the Pew Research Center, the tension took a toll. About 81% of people who consistently supported Sanders during the primary season and were confirmed to have voted in the general election said they ultimately voted for Clinton, while 11% said they supported Stein or Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, and 3% supported Trump.

British Government Monitors Pre-Brexit Hoarding,www.joemygod.com,Joe Jervis,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.joemygod.com/2019/04/british-government-monitors-pre-brexit-hoarding/,"NBC News reports :
In the spare bedroom of Sarah Cuffe’s house are piles of food and toiletries. Natural disasters don’t hit the English county of Hertfordshire very often but it looks like she’s ready for one.
“Just in case the worst comes to the worst, we thought we’ve got a spare bedroom, so why not stockpile stuff like pasta, tinned tomatoes, things aren’t going to go off,” she told NBC News. “We’ve got loo roll [British slang for toilet paper], cleaning products, multivitamins and nuts for protein.”
But the mother of two isn’t getting ready for a hurricane. Instead, she is one of the many Britons stockpiling goods in case of the most chaotic and unpredictable Brexit outcome: The United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a negotiated withdrawal agreement.
Politico Europe reports :
Whitehall officials are monitoring the household food shopping of U.K. citizens in response to no-deal Brexit fears, to look out for signs of stockpiling or other behavior that might require government intervention in the food supply chain.
A consumer analysis firm has been hired by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to deliver “detailed household expenditure data for food and drink” on a weekly basis until early May, according to a contract posted to the government’s online archive.
Data has been collected since March 21 and the first tranche will be handed to civil servants on Defra’s “food chain analysis team” this week. The contract with London-based firm Kantar Worldpanel states that the information is required “as part of the wider evidence base supporting the analysis on no-deal impacts and emergency response.”
Bloomberg reports :
As the U.K. relies on just-in-time deliveries, fresh food and vegetables imported from the continent may be in short supply. The government has urged supermarkets and drugmakers to stockpile.
Melvin, though, is taking no chances. He has an outhouse packed with six months of supplies for his wife and eight-year-old son. He’s prioritised tinned food and batteries over toilet roll, explaining he’s bought a shower-head toilet attachment instead.
In Cardiff, Wales, Helena is mostly worried about her Jack Russell, Charlie, having enough to eat in a no-deal scenario. “I’ve got about three months of human food and a year’s worth of dog food on the basis that if there are supply problems then actually the government isn’t going to prioritize dog food at the ports,” said Helena, 27.
Quartz reports :
On communities like Mumsnet, a forum where parents discuss, debate, and offer advice on raising children, stockpiling is a hot topic. By reviewing more than 3,000 Mumsnet posts about Brexit stockpiling, Quartz was able to compile seven representative shopping lists—one for each of seven most-common Brexit prepper mentalities.
The same intricate, as-needed supply chain that brings food to the island also delivers medications. For those who depend on specialized treatments, there are worries about Brexit interrupting access to life-or-death medicines and supplies.
Some people are stockpiling generic health- and hygiene-related products, while others are acquiring a cache of medicine by asking doctors for vacation prescriptions.
The Independent reports :
On Wednesday night, BBC Newsnight revealed some life-saving drugs have proved impossible to stockpile – including those used to treat epilepsy – and that the doctors who had been given this information had been told to keep quiet.
Back in January the health secretary Matthew Hancock told parliament that the requisite medicine supplies had been stockpiled in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Last night we learned that was not the case. Currently, a no deal would mean potential shortages of three important drugs for epilepsy, bipolar disorder and neuropathic pain. This would be life threatening for patients. Cookie makers. Metal fabricators. Stair lift manufacturers. Fearing a no-deal Brexit, companies in the U.K. are hoarding supplies at record rates. https://t.co/7dDdnrHUmk

The Hudson Journal-News reports :
State legislators are pushing to end non-medical exemptions to vaccinations for school-aged children, as measles cases in Brooklyn, Queens and Rockland County have reached 425.
State Sen. Brad Hoylman and state Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, the main sponsors of the bills, were joined by medical professionals and State Sen. David Carlucci, D-New City, Thursday afternoon on the steps of City Hall to call for support of the legislation.
Similar bills to end religious exemptions in New York failed in the 2015-16 and 2017-18 legislative sessions. New York would become the fourth state that allows only medical exemptions for vaccinations, following California, Mississippi and West Virginia.
CBS News reports :
A judge in upstate New York on Friday lifted the ban on unvaccinated children in public places despite 166 confirmed measles cases, most of which have been in the local ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. According to the judge, the number of measles cases in the county did not meet the legal requirement for an emergency order, CBS New York reports.
Officials in Rockland County, New York issued an emergency order on March 26 that prohibited unvaccinated children under the age of 18 from going out in public spaces for 30 days. Public places affected by the order included shopping centers, businesses, restaurants, schools, and places of worship. Share"

Barack Obama Warns Progressive Purists That Their ‘Circular Firing Squad’ Will Only Help Trump,www.politicususa.com,Sean Colarossi,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/06/barack-obama-circular-firing-squad-hurting-movement.html,"Barack Obama Warns Progressive Purists That Their ‘Circular Firing Squad’ Will Only Help Trump 3.6k Subscribe Print Flipboard
Popular former President Barack Obama openly expressed his concerns on Saturday about progressives hurting liberal causes by shooting at their own Democratic allies.
At a town hall event in Germany, Obama said the overall progressive movement weakens when liberals set up purity tests and tear down Democrats who may not align with them on 100 percent of the issues.
“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States, maybe it’s true here as well, is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Uh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be’ and then we start sometimes creating what’s called a ‘circular firing squad’ where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues,” Obama said, according to The Hill .
“When that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens,” he added.
Obama continued, “So I think whether you are speaking as a citizen or as a political leader or as an organizer … you have to recognize that the way we structure democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you, and that by definition means you’re not going to get 100 percent of what you want.”
The former president pointed to the Affordable Care Act, which has provided health care coverage to millions of Americans, as evidence that his approach to politics has had success, even if he did have to make concessions to get it done.
“You can’t set up a system in which you don’t compromise on anything,” he said. “But you also can’t operate in a system where you compromise on everything.” Progressives should heed Obama’s advice ahead of 2020
Liberals purists and media outlets would be smart to heed Barack Obama’s advice heading into 2020.
Already, we’ve seen far too many progressives take their eye off the ball and attack potential or declared Democratic presidential candidates for positions that may not fully pass their purity test.
This same approach hurt Democrats in 2016 when many disappointed supporters of Bernie Sanders continued to attack Hillary Clinton long after she secured the nomination, claiming there was no difference between her and Donald Trump.
After two years of this president, progressives should have learned their lesson: When you wage war on your Democratic allies for *only* agreeing with you 80 to 90 percent of the time, you do nothing to advance your causes, and you only help people like Donald Trump consolidate their power.
Healthy debate is one thing, but a circular firing squad isn’t helping the progressive movement.

Citizenship Question Blocked From 2020 Census For Third Time,www.newsy.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/citizenship-question-blocked-from-2020-census-for-third-time/,"April 6, 2019 April 6, 2019 A federal judge in Maryland said the question violates both the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
On Friday, a federal judge in Maryland ruled the Trump administration cannot add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. This is the third time the question has been struck down in federal court.
In a 119-page ruling , the judge wrote, ""The unreasonableness of Defendants' addition of a citizenship question to the Census is underscored by the lack of any genuine need for the citizenship question, the woefully deficient process that led to it, the mysterious and potentially improper political considerations that motivated the decision and the clear pretext offered to the public.""
The judge also said the question violates both the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution.
The Administrative Procedure Act requires government officials to disclose the reasoning behind their decisions. While Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the question is meant to enforce the Voting Rights Act, administrative records suggest that wasn't his actual intention.
As for the constitutional violation — the census is required by the Enumeration Clause . It mandates an accurate count of every person living in the United States every 10 years. The judge ruled that by adding a question that could deter people from participating in the census, the count could become inaccurate.
From 1970 to 2000, a citizenship question appeared on some extended questionnaires given to a sample of the population. Then the Census Bureau replaced the longer census survey with a yearly survey of 1 in every 38 households. That annual survey — which is meant to understand the social and economic needs of communities — still includes the citizenship question.
The Trump administration has appealed the past two rulings and will likely appeal this one. Later this month, the Supreme Court is set to make a decision on whether or not to reverse the decisions."

The last few months of WW2 in Europe was a good illustration of the point. The Allies swept across France in August and September 1944, and then basically came to a halt for nearly six months over the winter. Part of the reason was extended lines, and getting supplies to catch up with the rapid advance. But a number of observers noted an increasing reluctance among the troops - particularly veterans* - to take risks. And that definitely slowed further advances. Why get yourself killed doing something heroic in the last phase of the war, when you know you've already won, and you can see your way clear to surviving ? Conversely on the German side, there wasn't much flagging of miitary spirit - it was a death struggle for them.
* obviously this reluctance was statistical not universal. And it seems to have been more noticeable among the Brits - whose veterans had been in action longer - than the Yanks who were relative newcomers."

Parental Rights in the 21st Century,patriotpost.us,Nate Jackson,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://patriotpost.us/articles/62223-parental-rights-in-the-21st-century,"Parental Rights in the 21st Century
Vaccines, fevers, and gender dysphoria. What are parents supposed to do? Nate Jackson · Apr. 6, 2019
Three recent stories highlight the way the rights of parents to determine the physical and emotional health and well-being of their children have changed in the 21st century. Looking at all three at once provides an interesting analytical exercise.
First, we have the ongoing measles outbreaks around the country in areas with a higher number of so-called “anti-vaxxers” — people who reject vaccines of various diseases for their children. Without rehashing the debate here, those who oppose vaccinations, or even merely advocate the freedom of parents to choose, are encountering vigorous challenges from others who believe vaccines are a responsibility of being a good citizen — never mind those (sometimes in authority) who argue that vaccines should be mandatory. Parents are faced with a choice, and sometimes it’s a costly one.
Second, in Chandler, Arizona, a mom took her feverish two-year-old son to an alternative medical practice. The doctor noted that the boy was unvaccinated and recommended the mother take him to the hospital. She said she would, but as he improved that day, she decided against it. The doctor followed up, and she gave the same promise, but again, ultimately declined to take her son to the hospital. Eventually, the cops showed up, burst through the door, arrested the father, and sent the couple’s three children to foster care with their grandparents. Both parents were charged with one count of child abuse. The case is ongoing, but it hinges on whether the mother had the right to do what she deemed best for her child, or whether the doctor had the right to alert the cops to “a possibly life-threatening situation.”
And third is the heart-wrenching story of a mother who was rendered powerless to prevent doctors from shepherding her daughter through a sex “transition.” Here’s how she explained the process: “If you take your child to a clinic to seek help, affirmative care means the therapist must follow the child’s lead. The professionals must accept a child’s professed gender identity. In fact, this is the law in many states. Under ‘conversion therapy’ bans, questioning a child’s professed gender identity is now illegal. So, if a little boy is 5 years old and believes he is the opposite sex, affirmative care means going along with his beliefs.”
She and her daughter found themselves in that situation, and now doctors and authorities are preventing the mother from doing anything to stop what we believe is child abuse . Similar stories have played out in other parts of the U.S. and Canada .
There are indeed parental choices that are patently wrong and do harm to children. But the same is true for certain institutional and medical decisions. And parents have little reason to trust those authorities in the face of so much demonstrably false information and coercive force. Thus, legitimate scientific advancement is sometimes rejected because there is no trust basis. Meanwhile, authorities and medical experts no longer trust parents to see through all the harmful misinformation out there. It’s a vicious cycle.
Often lost in this destructive debate is what’s actually best for kids. Parents are supposed to be the best determiners of that, and they should endeavor to make informed decisions that protect their kids from harm. This includes taking action again preventable communicable diseases and refusing to contribute to a vulnerable child’s gender dysphoria . Yet advocating smart decisions is a far cry from allowing the state to impose its will on parents and their children.

"Liberians, You can immigrate to Canada as Skilled Immigrants FrontPageAfrica",frontpageafricaonline.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/opinion/liberians-you-can-immigrate-to-canada-as-skilled-immigrants/,"0 Share
CANADA – Canada has one of the most superior health care systems in the world, by far better than the US, if you judge by accessibility by all citizens and affordability for all. Canada has a better education – Canada has always ranked much higher than the US on any measure of education around the globe.
By: Christopher Luke, [email protected] , Contributor
Canada has world class universities that attract students from all over the world. Canadian ingenuity has given the world the zipper, insulin, the Canadarm for the space shuttle, and even basketball (Oh yes, Basketball was invented by a Canadian called James Naismith in 1891).
In terms of living, Canada has a longer life expectancy, much stricter gun laws, better social safety nets, and a general “niceness” that is renowned world wide. Canadians are tolerant, respectful, polite, and always willing to please others. (Yes, we have our share of nasty people but I’m speaking in generalities).
As for working, Canadian industries are highly competitive globally. I must admit that there may be more opportunities in the US, due to its size, but Canadians do pretty darn good. Our dollar is strong, but we are smart enough to keep it just under the value of the American dollar because this brings many Americans into Canada to visit our beautiful landscape as visitors and to do business cheaper.
Canada’s Military might not be as large as the that of the US, but Canada has a reputation for highly trained forces, and world-wide success as liberators and peace keepers. We do not use weapons for protection – we don’t need it because we do not allow our criminals to freely arm themselves. We live in a much safer, more peaceful and less stressful environment than you would find in much of the US. Even in our largest cities, violent crime is much lower when compared to similar sized cities in the US.
Canada has an unimaginable beauty of landscape and we preserve it in our national parks. We have four seasons – and our summers are beautiful. Winters are cold but are also amazingly enjoyable, and as a Bassa boy from Lower Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, I must admit that I love the winter months. I really do. Don’t even know if I can ever live in a tropical country. LOL
Our politics are vastly different. Canada invests in its people. We have incredible social safety nets to support those who can’t support themselves. Don’t get me wrong, we do not encourage lazy people, but as a society, we strive to help others to bring the best out of them.
When you read rankings of countries based on any number of factors, Canada always scores high, and much higher than the US.
Canada has the 10 th largest economy in the world, making us one of the wealthiest nations with a consistently high standard of living. Canada’s unemployment rates are lower than other countries in the G7 (Group of Seven) or OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development).
Canada is a major contributor to quantum computing, medical discoveries, space science and technology, and while other nations continue to debate the issue, we’ve been celebrating inclusivity and same-sex marriages for years .
And we’re polite. In fact, our politeness is one of the reasons we play well with other nations and why our general satisfaction levels consistently rate high. That’s according to the results of the 2016 Best Countries survey conducted by U.S. News & World Report , in collaboration with BAV Consulting and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. In January’s World Economic Forum in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau called Canada a ‘great place to invest’ because of our public health care, education, safety and economic stability. Business decision-makers eye Canada as the place they’d like to locate or relocate their businesses and/or head offices speaks volumes about our quality of life and the opportunities Canada offers. Our tax structures aren’t the highest among nations, but they aren’t the lowest either. That makes the Canadian workplace, benefits and lifestyle a selling point to organizations seeking to attract and retain a workforce. Canada’s also a great place to start a business . Interestingly, in a field where Asian countries typically reign, Canada sits at 4th place, and the only non-Asian country to rank in the top five.
We have greater economic freedom because of our sound, reliable and transparent public finances. Canadian banks and banking systems are better and stronger (4 of the top 10 banks in the world are Canadian).
Canada has a relatively lower unemployment rate than the U.S., particularly among young workers. Canadians have better health care, benefits, paid holidays and paid leaves, including maternity and paternal leave. A new mother can take up to a year off work with pay, and a new father can take up to four months off work with pay and other benefits.
Our workplaces are mandated by law to be inclusive and welcoming, with opportunities open to all. According to a BMO study , “in Canada, nearly half of millionaires are immigrants or second-generation residents, compared to just one-third in America.”
And this brings me to the title of this write up: ‘How can Liberians immigrate to Canada as skilled workers through what is known as “Express Entry?” WHAT IS EXPRESS ENTRY (EE)? Related Posts"
Liberia: Bong Community College Struggles To Get Govt Funding FrontPageAfrica,frontpageafricaonline.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/county-news/liberia-bong-community-college-struggles-to-get-govt-funding/,"Apr 11, 2019
Dear Honorable Tweah:
The administration of the BCTC presents compliments. We write concerning the submission of specific information on enrollment and attendants costs through you to the Government of Liberia.
The information as summarized below is the detailed and in the attachment of this letter:
.The cost per credit hour at BCTC is US$5.00 (five United States dollars). The total credits taken by all students is 12,071(twelve thousand seventy one) which costs a total amount of $60, 355 (sixty thousand three hundred fifty five United States dollars) for tuition;
. The total registration and activity fees is US 75, 00 (seventy five United States dollars) per student. The total enrollment for the current semester stands at 856 students. The total cost of fees is US$ 64,200.
Please note that the budgetary allocation initially set at approximately 980, 000, 00 USD for BCTC was reduced by more than twenty percent (20%) to 780, 000, 00. This process poses serious constraints on our ability to recruit the level of suitably qualified faculty required and to provide facilities such as equipped laboratories, internet connectivity, fuel and lubricant and educational supplies. At present, our annual appropriation or subsidy for goods and services is $62, 000, 00 or 5,166.66 USD per month, an amount which is very low. We therefore operate as a crisis management team to ensure that students’ expectations are underpinned and partially met.
We are reminded of the commitment made by President Weah on this and his recent visit at the BCTC but we have been told that something might be done in the next budget year with emphasis on the completion of the building.
Sincerely.
Roland C.Y. Massaquoi, Ph. D
Staffs Rally To buy Fuel
According to Dr. Massaquoi, staffs of the college usually rally to procure fuel for the generator because they haven’t received a dime from government.
“We can’t continue to sit and wait for government. Things are tough on us so we collect money from staffs to buy fuel to run our offices,” he said.
Dr. Massaquoi said if nothing is done by the government to address constraints faced by the college it could pose serious problems to the administration and students when the next academic year commences.
“There are some courses we teach in the night. How do we teach those courses in the absence of electricity?” Post Views: 2,625"

They were then taken to the Monrovia City Court and later forwarded to the Monrovia Central Prison, where they will remain pending court trial.
According to the Writ of Arrest, the above-mentioned defendants were arrested in March 2019 in Manjoe Town, Todee District where they were carrying out illegal mining activities.
The Writ of Arrest further states that the defendants used dredge machines and other equipment to carry on their illegal mining activities, thereby depriving the government of its revenue and at the same time sabotaging the economy of the country.
The writ: “That during the period of March 2019, in the area of Manjoe Town, Todee District, Montserrado County, Republic of Liberia, the within named defendants being there and then without legal right whatsoever, purposely and intentionally engaged themselves in illegal mining using dredge machines and other equipment with the intent to deprive the government of Liberia of its revenue and in the same sabotaging the economics of the country.”
The Writ Continues: “The alleged act of the defendants being unlawful, wicked, criminal and willful is in violation of section 15.51 and 15.80 of the reversed Code of Liberia there and then crime herein defendants did do commit”.
Section 15.51 of the Penal law of Liberia states: “A person is guilty of theft if he knowingly takes, misappropriates, converts or exercises unauthorized control over the property of another with the purpose of depriving the owner thereof. While section 15.80 provides that: “A person is guilty of a first-degree felony, if he knowingly conspires or colludes to defraud the Government of Liberia”. Post Views: 7"

Mike Pompeo Whines To Fox News After Being Disinvited To Foundation Dinner,crooksandliars.com,John Amato,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/mike-pompeo-disinvited-james-foley-fdn,"4 days ago by John Amato Views:
Trump's SOS, Mike Pompeo joined Fox & Friends Friday morning and whined that he had been dis-invited from a dinner held by the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation , where he was set to receive the “Freedom Award.”
Fox and Friends were horrified that the left wing had, because of Trump derangement syndrome, infiltrated the Foley awards decision makers and foiled Pompeo's attempt to be rewarded for bringing back American hostages.
Pompeo really tried to cover up the reason the foundation left him in the dust.
Ainsley Earhardt said that after he won the award, it was pulled back and she asked him a very serious question.
Earhardt asked, ""Is that bullying? How'd you feel about that?""
Bullying is a very serious issue among children and teens, but having an award revoked from the Secretary of State is not bullying.
If you only watched the first few minutes of their interview, you would have no idea why Pompeo and the administration were ditched by the fully Foley Foundation.
Doocy yelled, ""But what happened?""
The Secretary said they announced it and then all of a sudden he wasn't invited anymore. ""It's sad,"" Pompeo said.
Doocy again asked why he was uninvited, and Pompeo just kept talking about bringing hostages home, saying that's not a ""partisan issue.""
He continued, ""It sounds like some in the media, who are underwriting this event, sponsors for the event said, ‘If Pompeo’s there, we won’t be,’ and I think that's why...” he said.
Doocy kept up his outrage. ""They took an award away from you because they wanted to sell more tables?"" he said.
Pompeo never told them why he was disinvited since I imagine no member of the Trump cabinet is permitted to speak the name, Jamal Khashoggi. Finally, after almost two minutes, Brian Kilmeade had to explain that the foundation didn't think their response to Saudi Arabia over the Khashoggi execution was strong enough.
Ureka!
The crotch couch then changed lanes and said if America stops supporting the war in Yemen, Iran wins. ↓ Story continues below ↓
Pompeo agreed, saying that's been the point of their actions. And then he lied, ""Maybe they don't think we've done enough with respect to Mr. Khoshaggi. I actually think we did a great deal and are prepared to do more.""
Mediaite reached out to the James Foley Foundation for comment.
The January 11 decision with respect to the James W. Foley Hostage Advocate award is being mischaracterized by some media outlets. While it is accurate that our foundation intended to present our hostage freedom award to Secretary Pompeo until that date, we ultimately decided we could not present the award as planned due to the dramatic change in circumstances when the Administration did not press for genuine accountability from the Saudi government for the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In addition to advocating for the safe return of American hostages abroad, the protection of free speech and promotion of journalists’ safety is a key pillar of our foundation and this award would have been in conflict with that key principle.
We thank Secretary Pompeo for his extraordinary efforts to bring Americans home and are grateful for all that he and this administration have accomplished to prioritize the return of our citizens. In particular we are thankful for the time he dedicated to meeting with families of American hostages on Tuesday. We look forward to working closely with Secretary Pompeo and this administration on these efforts to bring Americans safely home. Tags:"

Not taking him literally or seriously is a problem.
Gillespie (quoting someone else perhaps) once said something to the effect that ""Trump's critics take him literally but not seriously, where Trump's supporters take him seriously but not literally"", and I think that gets it about right.
There's something even more fundamental going on. Progressives live in a world where the things people say in public are more important than what they actually do in private. An essential part of their thinking has to do with making it seem socially unacceptable, for instance, to be homophobic, misogynistic, racist, or xenophobic. This is why progressives on college campuses everywhere shut down controversial speakers--can't have people thinking these ideas are acceptable! And this is why Truimp's ""public"" statements about ""pussy grabbing"" or there being rapists among the illegal immigrants Mexico sends are so bad--probably foremost among Trump's worst sins against progressivism.
Yeah, Trump's opponent make fools of themselves when they take Trump's statements literally, but they'd also be foolish not to take his statements seriously."

Mass Bleaching Events Hurt The Great Barrier Reef's Ability To Rebuild,www.newsy.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/mass-bleaching-hurts-great-barrier-reef-s-recovery-rate/,"Mass Bleaching Events Hurt The Great Barrier Reef's Ability To Rebuild By Ethan Weston April 6, 2019 April 6, 2019 Great Barrier Reef coral replacements were down 89 percent in 2018 after two back-to-back mass bleaching events. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
Global warming has likely severely harmed the Great Barrier Reef's ability to rebuild itself, a new study suggests.
The study, published in the journal Nature Wednesday, specifically looked at the number of adult corals last year after two back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. Bleaching events happen when the ocean reaches above-average temperatures.
The study found that the events harmed so many coral that new coral numbers were down 89 percent last year.
Normally, when a large part of the reef is damaged, coral from other parts of the reef help rebuild the damaged areas by seeding them with coral larvae. But the 2016 and 2017 mass bleachings affected large portions of the reef, and the areas least affected by the events were too far away from the damage to help make up for the losses.
Scientists who worked on the report said coral recruitment in the Great Barrier Reef could recover in five to 10 years — if there aren't any more mass bleaching events.
But the chances of that are looking increasingly unlikely. A 2017 study found that as sea temperatures begin to rise due to climate change, mass bleaching events will become more and more common worldwide until they happen every year.
The more recent study's lead author said in a statement that there's only one fix for the issue: ""reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero as quickly as possible."""

In the control centre near Tel Aviv, in Yehud, a fleet of engineers monitored the speed of the spacecraft. In order to catapult away from the Earth and efficiently”catch” the moon’s gravitational pull, then Beresheet had to slow down in 8,500 kilometers per hour (5,300 mph) into 7,500 kilometers per hour (4,700 mph).
Spectators observed from behind glass, holding their breath as displays revealed Beresheet’s engines kicking into gear.
After five minutes, Beresheet reach the velocity that was perfect, along with the engineers burst congratulating each other with hugs and handshakes.
A failure could have attracted the assignment to an abrupt end.
“The cost of a mistake here would have been boundless,” said Opher Doron, space division general manager at Israel Aerospace Industries, that functioned with SpaceIL about the undertaking. “We’d have been spinning in distance toward some sunlight orbit that nobody would like to go into.”
Beresheet will follow smaller and smaller loops around the moon before attempting to land.
“It’s very risky, and it’s tough to predict we will succeed.”
However , he added, after completing the struggle of Thursday, the team was optimistic.
Unlike giant, powerful NASA rockets that hurtle straight the recording craft that was humble, on the moon the size of a washing machine, has embarked on a risky and roundabout route.
The 100 million mission could not manage its own rocket Beresheet hitched a ride on the SpaceX Falcon rocket in February.
SpaceIL got its beginning from the Google Lunar X Prize Competition, which guaranteed $20 million to the spacecraft that was privately financed to make it.
The contest ended with no winner. But motivated by the perseverance of SpaceIL, the XPrize Foundation announced last week it would supply the group $1 million when Beresheet sticks its landing.
Beresheet will land on a plain of lava, if all goes according to plan. It send back images and data, and will devote a couple weeks on the moon’s face, measuring the magnetic field in the landing site.
A successful mission would make Israel the fourth nation to pull a moon landing, following Russia, the U.S. and China.
SpaceIL expects the next generation of Israelis wills inspire to study technology and science.
Winetraub explained during the current festival of Purim, he saw many children dressed up as astronauts and since Beresheet. “It’s amazing to see the total amount of excitement we’ve already produced,” he explained. “That’s what’s going to propel our nation forward.” Latest News"
