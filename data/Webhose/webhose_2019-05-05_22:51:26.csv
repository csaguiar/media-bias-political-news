The Sewer is pretty deeply entrenched across continents and it cannot be uprooted within the current legal systems of the UK, Germany, US etc.
Because of that, citizens that cares, by itself, is just not enough to dismantle it and undo the existing damage. If anyone is to make a difference in the house of common today, it must be individuals with uncompromising dedication like Tommy Robinson.
There must be thorough knowledge/skills to know what to do, there smart leadership to replace the torie worms and there must be organization, the kind of organization you have for an army waging an effective campaign, to make it all happen.
This is a war, after all. This is a struggle for the survival of England, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall and the continued existences of its peoples against a world-wide evil. It is the single most vital, important struggle in history.
Not even the full list of things either. Pretty sure that nobody have it just yet, stay inquisitive! -)"

The last 10% on the road to Europe - 'There may be tension with Russia on this issue',ednews.net,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/specialist-view/361413-the-last-10-on-the-road-to-europe,"1 2 3 4 5 The last 10% on the road to Europe - 'There may be tension with Russia on this issue' A- A A+
Yesterday, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov said at the 16th meeting of the Azerbaijan-European Union Cooperation Council that there is such a high level of relations that I consider it is very positive and politically creative. We have recently been able to synchronize the negotiations on all three parts. So now, we have a very good opportunity today, for 90 per cent have already been agreed.
Mammadyarov explains ‘evaluated speech as last 10% for deal’ to MP, political scientist Rasim Musabeyov told Eurasia Diary.
R. Musabeyov informs that ‘Yes, such an agreement is expected with EU’. Probably, It will happen in May. Actually, deal is planned beforehand. Simply, the certain difficulties have been resolved late that prevented sign of agreement.
MP as well adds that mentioned difficulties do not include the Karabakh problem or human rights issue. In general, these difficulties are not related to political and humanitarian issues, but mostly economic factors delay the sign of an agreement. As it is known, Azerbaijan is not a member of the WTO and does not have economic, commercial commitments to member states. This factor prevents the expansion of economic relations with the EU.
Since Ukraine and Georgia are members of the WTO these countries didn’t face to difficulties during signing of Association Agreement with EU. Because, if there was no disparity between these states and the EU in terms of economic obligations. However, Azerbaijan is not a WTO member, and Azerbaijan's foreign trade laws are completely different from the laws of the WTO member countries. Therefore, we can’t sign a common convention with the EU yet.
Obviously, it is possible to sign an agreement on economic cooperation with the EU on the basis of WTO membership or WTO principles. However, there are some difficulties. In this case, new legal problems may arise for banks, insurance companies, AZAL and other companies in Azerbaijan. Because, if Azerbaijan enters this kind of convention, the economic organizations in the country will must operate on the basis of European and WTO standards. I think that if these issues are not solved, as E.Mammadyarov said that the agreement with the EU was not 100%, but 90%.
The remaining 10% are related to the above economic factors. Mentioned 10% difficulties are not issues unsolved. It should be borne in mind that 50% of Azerbaijan's products are exported to Europe and for many years the Azerbaijan-EU cooperation continues to be fruitful. Azerbaijan is one of the main sources of energy for European countries, and the EU gives special importance to Azerbaijan in this regard. Therefore, I think that these troubles will soon be overcome. At present, the Ministry of Economy of Azerbaijan and the Customs Committee are working on these issues.
The agreement with the EU is very important. With all good intentions, it is possible to overcome all difficulties. We will be a member of the WTO. Therefore, the EU should sign an agreement soon. If we are able to resolve this issue now, there will be no problem to joining the WTO. If it is talked the about agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan on the European Union, there is no expectation that any official Moscow will be pressured. Because before Azerbaijan, Armenia and Kazakhstan, which are members of the CSTO, signed similar agreement with EU. Russia did not commit any maneuvers in this process.
The chairman of the Society for Humanitarian Research, Conflict Prof. Avaz Hasanov shared his views with Eurasia Diary.
A. Hasanov noted that ""the Republic of Azerbaijan has been discussing the document that it will sign with the European Union for a long time now. Government supported document a document containing its own interests has proposed a ""strategic partnership"" conventional document after refusing to sign the ""Association Agreement"". On the eve of the discussions around this document, Armenia has signed a similar document. Now, Azerbaijan and Belarus have not signed any document. When joining the Eastern Partnership Program, the Republic of Azerbaijan did not hurry to co-operate in other areas as it signed a separate document with the EU on ""energy security"".
But in this case, cooperation with the European Union has become an important factor for the country itself. Even though Europe criticized Azerbaijan for its human rights and democracy-related processes, it had to sign a cooperation agreement regardless of its name with the EU. This is a prerequisite for the SAP. Azerbaijan has done everything to reduce its criticism of itself in Europe by now promoting reforms. I can’t say now that there is serious pressure on human rights to Azerbaijan. The government used this opportunity and intensified the negotiation process, and, of course, it would be a good tactic to sign and approve this document during the elections in the European Parliament.
There is no serious obstacle in it. However, it is possible that former officials who are afraid of reform hinder staff changes. External barrier is unavoidable. Especially during the signing of the agreement, Armenians are likely to aggravate the situation on the frontline. Of course, the desire of Azerbaijan to be closer to the European family irritates Russia most. But I think that Ilham Aliyev will be able to neutralize Russia and it will cope with it. The document will be signed.
A. Hasanov also said that ""It is the"" Strategic Cooperation ""agreement noted by Mammadyarov. The ""Strategic Partnership"" agreement to be signed with us will be approximately in the same text as the agreement signed by the EU with Armenia. Perhaps, given our commitment to our energy security, more space is needed. Tension can be exacerbated with Russia in this regard. In particular, by flaring up protests in the country, authorities may try to avert the government to sign a contract. However, Azerbaijan is vigilant in this issue. Because Azerbaijan is the main economic partner of Europe. Azerbaijan's energy projects are the best support for Europe in preventing Russia's hegemony. Because Azerbaijan is a valuable partner for Europe.
What will be the course of our course in Azerbaijan, if the agreement is to be signed, is to end the public debate on our choice of Russia and Europe. The agreement will allow the authorities to carry out reforms. It will strengthen the position of power. It will enable the political reforms in society.

From Lambos To Minivans; German Automakers Colluded To Prevent Better Emissions Tech: EU | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/lambos-minivans-german-automakers-busted-colluding-prevent-better-emissions-control,"0 SHARES
The European Union Commission on Friday accused BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen Group of colluding to limit emissions reduction technology in their vehicles, reports Ars Technica . Of note, Volkswagen owns VW, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Bugatti, Ducati and Lamborghini - which hasn't been Italian for over 30 years.
The commission accused the three manufacturers of coordinating to limit the size and refill ranges of AdBlue tanks on their diesel vehicles made between 2006 and 2014 . AdBlue is a urea-based liquid that is injected into exhaust gas to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) that are released during diesel combustion.
The commission also accused the three manufacturers of agreeing to avoid or delay the introduction of ""Otto"" particulate filters on gas-powered vehicles between 2009 and 2014. - Ars Technica
As part of an investigation launched last September , the EU Commission sent the three German automakers formal Statements of Objections which conclude that their behavior was illegal.
""Such market behavior, if confirmed... would violate EU competition rules prohibiting cartel agreements to limit or control production, markets or technical development,"" reads an EU Commission press release.
As Ars Technica notes, this isn't related to the 2015 Volkswagen Group diesel scandal where it lied to governments about how well its diesel vehicles reduced harmful emissions. Moreover, BMW, Daimler and VW Group are not being accused of violating any environmental laws - rather, the EU Commission says they violated laws pertaining to competition among firms.
As we noted in 2017 , the three German automakers have been holding secret “working groups” since the 1990s, where they would discuss, production costs, suppliers, strategy and – importantly – emissions issues , according to Spiegel .
***
It was at these meetings that the companies agreed on the appropriate gas purification standards for their diesel vehicles, thus laying the groundwork for the diesel scandal that has resulted in massive fines for these companies both in Germany and the US. The working groups also selected suppliers, helping to set costs for vehicle components. The ongoing discussions allegedly involved more than 200 employees in 60 working groups in areas including auto development, gasoline and diesel motors, brakes and transmissions. Talks may have also involved the size of tanks for AdBlue fluid for diesel autos , according to Bloomberg.
The allegations are guaranteed to result in more fines for the automakers, which were just beginning to move on from the diesel emission scandal that rocked the industry.
“These allegations look very serious and would mean more than 20 years of potential collusion,” said Juergen Pieper, a Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler told Bloomberg. “There seems to be a never-ending story of bad news about the industry’s bad behavior.”
German authorities first became aware of the problem when they raided Volkswagen’s offices in 2016 searching for evidence that the company sought to rig steel prices. Instead, it found evidence of collusion between German automakers . Two weeks later, VW submitted a voluntary admission to antitrust authorities, as did Daimler in hopes of minimizing penalties.

Central Elections Committee chairman Judge Hanan Melcer rejected Blue and White’s petition against the Likud, claiming that the latter is operating a secret social media propaganda network.The petition was based on a report in Yediot Aharonot and The New York Times last week. Soon after its publication, the people behind most of the Twitter accounts named as created specially to promote the Likud came forward to say they were genuine users of the network not officially connected to any political party. Melcer ruled on Friday that there is not enough proof indicating that the accounts are following instructions from the Likud.“The right to private political expression, including anonymously, is promised to all, even during elections, as long as it is not organized or funded, directly or indirectly, by an election candidate,” Melcer explained. “During an election, the Internet in general and social media specifically are used like the new town square and a platform to exchange ideas, send messages, express opinions and convince people, whether under the individual’s name or anonymously.“Limiting personal political expression on social media must be done sparingly and according to the laws and its purposes,” he added.Still, Melcer warned that any messages coordinated with parties in any way must be labeled, and not doing so could be considered criminal.Also Friday, Melcer ordered the organization Darkenu to register with the State Comptroller under what has been nicknamed the “V15 Law.”Darkenu – which has been campaigning for voters to choose parties that are not extremist and that unite Israelis – was known as V15 in the 2015 election, in which it campaigned against the Likud and for a two-state solution.If Darkenu does not register as an active body in the election by Sunday, it must halt all activities until after the elections, Melcer ruled.Likud had petitioned against Darkenu, saying it violated the V15 Law the party ushered through the Knesset. The party argued that Darkenu hopes to help the Blue and White Party, is worth millions of shekels and manages a database of hundreds of thousands of voters.During the 2015 election, V15 was accused of being a form of foreign intervention, in part because one of the organizations backing V15, One Voice, had received support from the US State Department under then-president Barack Obama and because Obama’s 2012 national field director Jeremy Bird was a consultant for V15. The organization denied any connection to the Obama administration.The V15 Law inspired by the group limits fund-raising by non-party political organizations in an election year. Such groups would have to register as an “active elections body.” Likud MK Yoav Kisch, who proposed the bill, said it is meant to prevent American-style Super-PACs from influencing elections in Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to evacuate the illegal West Bank herding village of Khan al-Ahmar in a series of weekend interview he gave just prior to Tuesday’s election.“This will happen very soon, as soon as possible. I promised and it will happen,” Netanyahu told Channel 12 on Saturday night. In an interview with the Hebrew news organization Makor Rishon, he said that before acting against the village of huts and tents, which is home to 180 members of the Jahalin Bedouin tribe, he had to “dismantle a diplomatic-legal ambush.”Netanyahu said now that he has resolved the legal and diplomatic issues, he plans to coordinate with the security forces to remove the encampment.The parties to the right of the Likud, have hammered over the last few months over this failure to do so. The right-wing NGO Regavim hasn’t waited for electoral politics to force his hand. It turned to the High Court of Justice and asked that he make good on past pledges to evacuate Khan al-Ahmar.The court responded this week, that the state must explain by May 1 why it has not evacuated Khan al-Ahmar.Regavim’s demolition request also included the elementary school adjacent to the village. Built with European funds, it is known as the Tyre school.Regavim told the court that its petition was the sixth against the village, which it called an “outpost,” and the school in the last decade.In May 2018, the High Court of Justice (HCJ) ruled that the village and the school could legally be demolished, but it did not insist that they must be removed. As such, no court mandated date was given for an evacuation.The justices in past remarks have been clear that they do not wish the village to remain at its current location, just off of Route 1, on the outskirts of the Kfar Adumim settlement, in between Jerusalem and Jericho.At the same time, the justices have urged both the Bedouin community and the state to find an agreed upon alternative location.The Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin, who have been at that their present location since the 1970s, have insisted on remaining there but would be willing to relocate a short distance further from Route 1.They also rejected the two alternative sites presented by the state in the same region of Area C outside of Jerusalem where Khan al-Ahmar is located.The first is located next to a garbage dump in a new neighborhood of Abu Dis, called Jahalin West. The second site is next to a wastewater treatment plant not far from the settlement of Mitzpe Yericho.Former defense minister Avigdor Liberman had been close to evacuating the community in October, but his efforts were thwarted by Netanyahu who at the last minute halted the proceedings after Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said that from a legal perspective he needed to make another attempt to come to an agreement with Khan al-Ahmar’s residents.The decision to delay the demolition also came after a warning by Fatou Bensouda, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court at The Hague, that such a move could constitute a war crime.At the time, Netanyahu promised that Khan al-Ahmar would be demolished soon.“Khan al-Ahmar will be evacuated. It is a decision of the court. It is our policy and it will be executed,” Netanyahu told his faction in October.In its petition to the HCJ, Regavim stated that it seemed as if Netanyahu and defense officials believed they had fulfilled their obligations to the court simply by making declarative statements.By failing to enforce the evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar, the state is undermining the principle of law and order and eroding the public’s trust in the government and the courts, Regavim stated in its petition.

New Right Party heads Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked put out a music video on Saturday in which they express their pledge, through song and rap, to reform the High Court of Justice and the IDF.The video opens to Shaked singing while Bennett plays along on the piano. ""Today we're saying goodbye,"" sings the former justice minister, playing the part of the High Court. ""I've done you harm for too many years / We tried together until we were tired / we were weak against Hamas.""""I know you asked 'How much longer?'"" continues Shaked as a member of the court, talking to an IDF soldier and referring to a common term used by troops to denote their frustration with their service. ""A wise army like you would be better off without me / Always remember what we both swore / The most important thing is to protect our soldiers.""Bennett later chimes in through rap, playing the part of an IDF soldier stuck between listening to the orders of his commander and the laws put in place by the High Court.""My commander says, 'You must attack,'"" raps the former education minister. ""My lawyer says, 'You may be sorry,' / It's confusing, it's scary / When I stand in front of a terrorist / I am armed, I am determined / But you do not let go / I separate to win / I have no other choice / It's nice for you to give me advice from the side / At the end of the war you leave me alone.""The party also put out a video on Wednesday in which Bennett holds a dove and offers him a pep talk.""You know what your problem is?"" Bennett asks the white dove. ""Insecurity. You compromise, you yield, you are naive. That is not how peace is made. Because of you we almost lost our hope. Now, lift up your head. Remember that you are right. Fight, win, give them a real battle - and then, and only then, they will beg you to make peace.""Last month, another video by the New Right gained attention when Shaked modeled a perfume called ""Fascism.""While a piano tinkles in the background, Shaked flips her hair, puts on an earring and slowly descends a staircase, while a narrator lists her goals and achievements as justice minister: “Judicial revolution. Reducing [judicial] activism. Appointing judges. Governance. Separation of Powers. Restraining the High Court of Justice.”Shaked then sprays herself with the “fascism” perfume, raised her eyebrows, and says: “It smells like democracy to me.” Lahav Harkov contributed to this report.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began a campaign over the weekend to take seats away from the Likud’s satellite parties on the Right, in an effort to win more seats for Likud than Blue and White in Tuesday’s election, and ensure that President Reuven Rivlin will ask him to form the next government.As part of that effort, in an interview with Channel 12 on Saturday night, Netanyahu vowed to annex territories in settlements and evacuate the illegal West Bank herding village of Khan Al-Ahmar, if he wins another term. “We are dealing [with the Americans] on exercising Israeli sovereignty on Ma’aleh Adumim and other things,” Netanyahu said. “Everyone understands the next term will be fateful for guaranteeing our security and our control over key territory in Judea and Samaria.”In weekend interviews with Channel 13 and the right-wing Makor Rishon and Israel Hayom newspapers, Netanyahu vowed to not permit a single settlement or a single resident of them to be evacuated.“That [evacuation] will not be happening,” he told Channel 13. “If that’s the plan, there will be no plan.”In the Makor Rishon interview, Netanyahu promised more clearly than ever that he would form a government with right-wing parties and not invite Blue and White to join his coalition.“Anyone with a brain understands that a unity government cannot be formed,” he said.Netanyahu had been careful until this weekend not to try to take votes from parties like Yisrael Beytenu, Kulanu and Shas, because they are in danger of not crossing the 3.25% electoral threshold.But on Friday morning, he came out to visit Likud activists outside his Jerusalem residence and warned them that his rule was in danger. Just before Shabbat, he taped a video message saying that Blue and White leaders Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid could form the next coalition.“At the moment, Lapid and Gantz are leading us by four or five mandates,” he said. “If it won’t change, Lapid and Gantz will break the Right bloc and form a left-wing government. It is not imaginary.”Netanyahu noted that Gantz and Lapid have said they have already negotiated with parties in the Likud’s bloc.“There is only one way to guarantee that Lapid and Gantz won’t form a left-wing government, and that is to vote Likud,” Netanyahu said. Only a large Likud will block a left-wing government. If you stay home, if you don’t vote Likud, you voted for Lapid and Gantz.”On Saturday night, the Likud released another video that featured an edited version of a speech by Rivlin in which he spoke about the largest party being a factor in his decision on which party leader to ask to form the government.In the Channel 12 interview, Netanyahu said right-wing party leaders were not committing to recommend him to Rivlin. When interviewer Rina Matzliach responded that all except Zehut leader Moshe Feiglin had promised to recommend him in interviews with her Saturday night, Netanyahu said they could change their minds.The leaders of right-wing parties reacted with anger to the prime minister’s change in strategy. They said he was lying about the Likud not being first in the polls and that he was irresponsibly trying to take away their votes. They said the move was a sign that he intends to form a government with Blue and White instead of them.A right-wing rally that had been set for Jerusalem on Sunday night was canceled. The reason given for the cancellation was security, but political sources said the real reason was that parties to the Right of Likud were unwilling to send their supporters to hear Netanyahu speak.

Here it is in full:
Gynhadledd… Gynhadledd ddiolch i chi bawb am ddod heddiw. Dyma fy nhrydedd gynhadledd fel arweinydd ac mae’r angerdd a’r brwdfrydedd sydd gennym yn ein plaid wedi creu cymaint o argraff arnaf.
Conference thank you for all coming today. This is my third Conference since becoming your leader and I am still so impressed with the passion and enthusiasm we have within our party.
So, what is going on? Let’s take ourselves back to that strange broadcast from Theresa May 2 weeks ago.
In the past few months we’ve seen increasing instability, a lack of political leadership and the national embarrassment that is this government’s handling of Brexit.
And while Brexit dominates every debate, every storyline, just spare a moment’s thought for the issues that have been ignored. Poverty rising, money for our public services cut and climate change forgotten.
Conference, have we ever seen a Westminster Government that’s more of a mess and a shambles than the one we have today?
I say Wales demands better.
This cannot be the kind of world we want our children to grow up in.
Around the world we are seeing the rise of right-wing populism, intolerance and the politics of fear and division. From Trump in the US, to Bolsonaro in Brazil to Orban in Hungary, we live in dangerous times.
Here in UK, we’ve seen the rise and, much more pleasantly, the fall of UKIP.
Every day we’re seeing the effects of the Brexit vote.
A vote that has been tainted even more by the Vote Leave campaign’s decision to withdraw its appeal against fines for breaking electoral laws.
In the near 3 years since the referendum, we’ve seen a Conservative Prime Minister who has put her own party first at every stage – not our country. Her real masters have become the ERG and the DUP.
Only in the last week have we seen her reach out across the political divide for the first time – and only then because there was no choice.
In the Conservative Party, a party that took Britain into the Europe and into the single market, we’re seeing good, honest, pro-European MPs like Dominic Grieve and Nick Boles labelled as traitors and facing votes of no confidence.
All while Jeremy Corbyn continues to ignore most of his members and voters by consistently failing to oppose what is clearly a Brexit that will hurt our economy, our future and frankly the most vulnerable in our society.
In all this I say thank goodness for the Liberal Democrats.
It was Tim Farron that showed great courage after that referendum and first put forward the idea of a People’s Vote.
It was Vince Cable that took this fight forward and put the Liberal Democrats at the heart of a movement of millions to give the people the final say on the deal.
Conference, there is an alternative to right wing populism, to the politics of fear and to Brexit. It is the Liberal Democrats and liberals around the world.
Now is OUR time to demand better and take a stand.
We demand a People’s Vote and we will not waver in our stand.
No-one can be scared in to silence and made to feel they cannot stand up for their beliefs
I stand here before you as a product my upbringing in a Welsh speaking family Wrexham. I learned from my parents the value of public service, the importance of giving back to the community and of course, the value of a good education.
It’s that education that enabled me to become a social worker and I’m proud that I’ve been able to spend the last 27 year helping to protect vulnerable children at home and abroad.
The thing that links my politics and my work life is tackling injustice. And in today’s world, sadly we don’t have to go far to find it.
Around my home in Powys, I visit foodbanks and find people driven there by the injustice and failing of the Westminster government’s universal credit scheme.
I talk to young people that are being driven out of the areas they grew up in because there’s no jobs and no affordable housing.
I meet long standing residents that have lost important community facilities such as Post Offices, shops or banks and seen public transport links to towns arbitrarily removed.
Every week I talk to farmers that are living in fear of a no deal Brexit and what it will do to their livelihoods.
As Liberal Democrats, it’s our job to stand up against injustices like these.
It’s our job to give a real voice to the powerless.
To stand up against authority that’s failing the people in their most basic needs.
Conference we demand better.
Let me talk to you on an issue that’s close to my heart – climate change.
I don’t need to tell you the dangers of climate change, nor should I have to be stood here making the case for tackling it.
Yet sadly there are still many people out there who fail to grasp the severity of the issue.
Climate change is not a can you can kick down the road. We need to act now and act fast before we cause further irreversible damage to our planet.
Green politics needs to be embraced in everything we say and do.
It’s not just about our economy.
It’s about the way we live,
It’s about the way we learn.
It’s about how we travel.
Wales is the only nation in the UK with green in our flag. Let’s make Wales a standard bearer for putting green in the heart of the way we live.
I applaud the way communities in Wales are all taking up the climate change challenge. Carmarthenshire and Gwynedd County Councils, along with numerous Town Councils across Wales, have declared a Climate Emergency.
Because it is a crisis
Because it is an emergency
AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT – IT IS NOT TOO LATE
Wales has already sought to create a green economy with the Swansea Tidal Lagoon at its heart. Conference I will never apologise for continuing to talk about and fight for the Swansea Tidal Lagoon.
But it isn’t Wales that is standing in the way, it is Westminster, where the Conservative Government is blocking the investment needed to make the tidal lagoon happen.
It is the vital first step in making Wales a world leader in green renewable energy and, if successful, could spark a whole wave of new Lagoons right across Wales.
We need to be embracing this and embracing other new technologies to diversify our energy supply, create new well-paid jobs for the future and move away from damaging fossil fuels.
Conference, we must invest in tackling climate change now. Because if we don’t, it will be much more damaging for all of us in the long run.
We have 12 years before the damage we have done is irreversible.
Aiming to be Carbon neutral by 2050 simply doesn’t go far enough.
If we’re serious about putting a stop to climate change, we need to commit to diversifying our energy production, investing in green technologies and eliminating the usage of damaging fossil fuels.
We need to move away from the polluting ways of the past and move towards a new sustainable future.
Now yesterday, I visited the UK’s first “energy positive’ house at Cenin in Bridgend. For every £100 spent on electricity, its aim is to generate £175 in electricity exports.
This is a great example of new innovative ways we can harness new technologies cut down on our carbon footprint.
Wales is leading the way in cutting edge low carbon supply storage and I want us to make more of that fact.
Conference in a few years’ time conference I want the motor engine to look as out of date as the steam train.
I want us to launch a new Welsh Green Tech Fund. A package of investments aimed at supporting these new technologies and funding further green energy projects.
These include requiring solar panels on all new houses we build, promoting the rapid roll-out of affordable electric cars, including wireless charging, replication of the Minesto project in Holyhead – the world’s first low-flow tidal stream project, which I visited in December.
Young people are ready and willing to take up the green challenge. Young people like the pupils from Ysgol y Bannau Primary in Brecon – who made their own placards and went out to protest against climate change.
These children really inspire me. I applaud them, and school children across Wales who are standing up to make their voice heard on the future of our planet. They can teach the grey, complacent Conservatives a thing or two.
Now what really opened my eyes to the real danger plastic pollution poses to our planet was a little documentary you may have heard of… Blue Planet.
This documentary brought this issue into the spotlight and into mainstream thinking. It broke my heart to see the huge damage done to animals, their habitats and our oceans by waste.
It has inspired a whole generation of people, the Blue Planet Generation, to really step up and act.
Across the UK people are demanding action to tackle the menace of plastic pollution. Let us promote a bottle return scheme, so every plastic has a value if returned for recycling. This will hugely cut down on the number simply thrown away.
If we do not act soon, it may be too late and I for one am committed to fighting to protecting our planet.
As we’ve seen with the motions we’ve debated today, solutions are possible.
A tax on Carbon, with the proceeds going to fund further green projects and public health initiatives, is just one of them.
People across Wales are crying out for change, real change which they can feel and experience.
We’ve been so lucky to be able to be make change happen in one sphere at least, thanks to Kirsty Williams. As Education Minister she’s been doing amazing work to overhaul the education system in our country, so it’s fit for the 21 st century.
Let us look at what her record of achievement has been: There has been yet more expansion of the Pupil Premium, a signature Welsh Liberal Democrat policy that is extending opportunity for our most disadvantaged children.
We’ve seen progress in our drive to reduce infant class sizes, backed with a £36million fund to help make this happen.
And she has published a white paper outlining the first ever made in Wales legislative proposals for the school curriculum. These proposals include changes to make Relationship & Sexual Education that will make it inclusive of all genders and all sexualities, something that – as we can see from England – cannot be taken for granted.
Now that is what I call a record of achievement, diolch Kirsty.
Now ponder this, if we can do all that just with one Assembly Member, imagine what a difference we could be making with more.
That is my target, to ensure we return a strong team of Welsh Liberal Democrats to the Senedd to lead the change and drive our progressive agenda forward.
We have already selected two of our regional champions – for South Wales West, Sheila Kingston-Jones will be leading our list and for South Wales Central, Rodney Berman.
Let’s do all we can to support them and the other Welsh Assembly candidates as they are selected, because
we have,
we will continue to make a difference
But Conference, if we want to do that, we need to do things differently. We need to change the way we approach politics, the way we talk, and the way we campaign.
I want us to truly change the way things work. We need to offer a fresh vision for Wales. A positive vision of the kind of society we want our children to grow up in.
A liberal vision of an open, welcoming and forward-looking Wales that we can all be proud of.
A vision of hope to defeat the politics of fear and division.
Let me talk about how we do just that. It starts by offering a People’s Vote with an option to Remain in the European Union.
But that’s the tip of the iceberg.
We need to tackle the root causes that led to the Brexit vote in the first place. That starts with taking real action to lift people out of poverty in our country.
First, we will campaign to abolish the Conservative Government’s universal credit scheme. It started with good intentions, but there’s no doubt it’s failed and it’s hurting those it was supposed to help. We will work to secure a better benefits system that protects the poorest and provides support to those in low income jobs.
Conference let us stop the war on the poor and give people hope again.
Second, we will deliver a green revolution in Wales. We will fight to overturn the Conservative Government’s disgraceful decision to abandon the Swansea tidal lagoon scheme. We will take action to tackle climate change and get the plastic out of our seas and oceans. We will create a Green Tech fund to create green jobs in Wales.
Together we can stop climate change.
Finally, we will build more affordable homes. It is a national shame that children are driven out of their own areas because of the lack of affordable homes. We will work with communities across Wales to build these homes.
Our children demand it and we must deliver.
Conference, we live in troubled and dangerous times. There’s a temptation for us all to turn off the TV, radio and even Facebook to hide away from the daily bad news stories.
The people I meet around Powys are often saddened by the way things are going, but they have not given up hope.
They are positively searching for it.
Conference, the Liberal Democrats offer real hope and real change to the people of Wales.
We offer a fresh vision of a positive, open and vibrant country where the people are free to make their own choices – with Government their servant, not their master.
Free to never be lonely, surrounded by strong communities there to support people when they need it.
Free to live in dignity with enough money to live on, buying food for families and that food banks disappear
Free to live in an environment that is sustainable, healthy, positive and hopeful.
Together, we can change Wales for the better.
Together, we can champion our communities and tackle the injustices we face.
Together, we can and will make a freer, fairer, greener and more liberal Wales.
Conference thank you, Diolch yn fawr iawn."

By the numbers: Illinois ranks 10th highest for state-imposed gas taxes | Illinois | newsbug.info,www.watchdog.org,Watchdog News,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.watchdog.org/illinois/by-the-numbers-illinois-ranks-th-highest-for-state-imposed/article_6d8cfd84-570f-11e9-9c2f-3b4d8a2504ec.html,"Save
Illinois finished 10th in a ranking of the taxes and fees that states place on gasoline, according to the Washington-based Tax Foundation.
Drivers in the state pay 37.32 cents per gallon in state-imposed taxes and fees as of July 2018, the foundation reports. These levies may include excise taxes, fees related to environmental issues, storage tank levies and general sales taxes.
Only seven states apply sales taxes to gasoline, a practice that effectively layers levies onto one another. The seven states are California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and New York.
The gas taxes studied do not include an 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal excise levy on gasoline.
The foundation deems gas taxes a sensible way for states to fund road repairs, maintenance and highway expansion since those who use the public roads the most pay the most via gas taxes. But some states don’t index the taxes for inflation, meaning that revenues generated through the taxes can lag behind state infrastructure needs over time, according to the analysis.

FALL RIVER, Mass. — An 87-year-old man was killed and a firefighter was injured after a fire broke out early Saturday morning inside a residence at 11 Palmer St., according to a fire official.
Fall River firefighters were called to the two-story, wood-frame home at about 4:30 a.m. Saturday, said Jason Burns, president of the city firefighters union.
Firefighters reported seeing smoke and possible flames on arrival, he said.
“The guys made a very quick stop,"" Burns said, ""but it appears that it could have been burning on arrival.""
Burns said an 87-year-old man was unable to escape the fire and was dead when firefighters located him inside the second-floor apartment, according to the results of a preliminary investigation.
The fire apparently broke out in the space between the first-floor ceiling and the second-story floorboards, according to Burns.
“It was burning within those floorboards for a while and popped out pretty quick and took this man by surprise,” he said.
The occupant of the first-floor apartment returned home after 4 a.m. and called 911 to report the fire, he said. The 87-year-old man was home alone when the blaze began.
A Fall River firefighter was hurt when the floor collapsed beneath him and he fell from the second floor to the first floor, Burns said.
The firefighter was taken to Rhode Island Hospital with serious injuries but Burns said the injuries are not life-threatening.
The Fall River Fire Department and the Bristol County district attorney’s office are investigating. Never miss a story

"Even Joe Biden's Wife Said His Constant Groping Made Her Feel ""Strange And Uncomfortable"" | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/even-joe-bidens-wife-said-his-constant-groping-made-her-feel-strange-and,"0 SHARES
Even Joe Biden's wife found her husband's tendency to be overly physical to be strange and off-putting when they first met.
According to an excerpt from the former second lady's upcoming autobiography published in the Daily Mail, when the couple first met, ""He was always holding my hand, putting his arm around me, brushing the hair from my face."" She added that Joe and his ""handsy"" family made her feel ""strange and uncomfortable"" at first. As an admitted introvert, she ""sometimes found all that affection draining,""
But she said she soon came to understand that it was the death of Biden's first wife Neilia and their baby daughter Naomi that made Biden and his family realize ""how precious every second could be,"" which was displayed by ""constantly touching"" and ""being connected to each other.""
But Jill said this ""tactile"" sensibility helped make Biden the politician that he is .
""He connects with people so easily and he never hesitates when a stranger wants to tell him something personal or give him a hug,"" she said.
""When Joe loves, he loves hard; he's all in.""
Case in point: She went on her first date with Biden after he cold called her. ""How did you get this number?"" were the first words she remembers speaking to him back in 1975, when he was a young Senator from the State of Delaware. Joe told her that he got her number from his brother, Frank.
When she told him she had a date already planned the night, Biden asked her to cancel it; she did, and they went out for the next three nights.
Of course, the eight women who have accused Biden of inappropriately groping them probably wouldn't see this as an excuse. Not that Biden cares: He infamously refused to apologize for his behavior, though he did promise to be more mindful of other people's feelings.
Since one of Biden's accusers blasted him over his non-apology, maybe getting the ""you just don't understand"" talk from his wife would be more effective. Login "

Before beginning another major series I wanted to discuss something a little more personal, something that people might relate to. Something more down to earth. Babe Ruth baseball season starts today, Saturday, April 6 (it’s 2019, for posterity’s sake). The game starts at 8 AM–or the ‘scrimmage’ (does not count towards the regular season), and I will provide updates, not play-by-play, but more og the usual sociological perspective in line with the title of this piece.
Anyway, to begin with there is my son. He’s 13 year’s old and he is extremely fast. He has a strong, if rather wild, arm and, he is a particularly good fielder, which is pretty rare in his age group, where everyone’s chief interest is to swing for the fences on every pitch. And that’s another thing, call it the weakest part of his game: the boy can’t hit. Oh, he makes contact, not feebly flailing away a half a second too early or too late. He just usually dribbles the ball through the infield, or pops out to shallow left. Sometimes his speed gets him on base, and he has an excellent eye, walking at least once nearly every game over his four year career (this is his fifth season.)
I have no idea what to make of his team yet. This is his first year in the Babe Ruth league. Last year (our first in this present community) many of the other boys playing alongside him played in the same regional ‘youth baseball’ league (‘Little League’ is apparently yet another term whose time has passed, sinking into some swirl of uncertainty and offense.) Some of those kids are pretty damn good. Some of these newly teenage behemoths are bigger than me.
Last year the team he was on was run by a terrible person–an angry, pushy coach whom no one on the team and none of the parents liked. He would humiliate kids for not playing well–for missing a fly ball or striking out with runners on. He would yell at the kids–yank them from the game in the middle of an at-bat and then tell them that they sucked in the dugout. You might be surprised, or even shocked, to hear this, but you shouldn’t be.
Sports parents take on a few forms, none of them particularly admirable. You can be the stomping, ranting bully, always demanding the unrealistic from their child, living out their own shattered dreams by insisting that their child succeed where they couldn’t. Sometimes the parents are just assholes, understanding nothing about team play and only interesting in their own child, considering them better than everybody else regardless of whether they actually are. In truth, the parents of the most talented kids tend to be far better people, those who might drive their children very hard, but do so with support and genuine interest in what the child is doing.
Other sports parents scream violence from the stands–calling out umpires, on rare occasion even running on the field to argue balls and strikes. These are also the parents who boo kids on the other team, who laugh out loud and mock some poor child who missed a ball and caused a run to score. They criticize their child for striking out and treat them like a loser because they could not drive in the winning run.
Then there are the parents like myself and, frankly, most of the others, realizing that their child is never going pro, and there to support them in any way they can, watching the games endlessly, often not wanting to be there and frequently annoyed at the endlessness of the day after day games and the two month loss of the weekend. We are the ones who laugh in the stands, mostly condemning the coaches and rooting for one another’s children. We stay out of the rough and tumble of the urgent, psychopathic parents in team uniforms, pretending that they are an actual part of the league. Most of us simply sit there and watch when parents are asked to help clean up the field after the game. We contribute the bare minimum–our child having fun, and take it unseriously. —
Here are some of the parents present today in my upper middle class suburban community (still a foreign land for this jaded and impatient city boy): take this guy, walking past me as I sit in the car to avoid the wet cold until game time. It is about 42 degrees (Fahrenheit, for those trapped in the metric system) and it rained all night long. This man looks silly in orange shorts riding up the crack of his ass, his legs goose-pimpled beneath their going slightly gray tangled hair. He’s in an anonymous sweatshirt, perhaps promoting a different sports league out of his child’s past, or maybe even one from his own. He’s wearing a baseball hat, sure, one that he spent twenty-five dollars on to prove that his son plays on a team. He sports a weird strip of gray facial hair–really a stripe on his face like he’s some sort of model in Hustler magazine (only, you know, on his face) He has his hands in his pockets and is shuffling around on his feet, clearly freezing but unwilling to admit this to anyone–most of all himself. He tells everyone that he is all man.
He is talking with the other fathers, things about professional sports, things like “You see how terrible the Red Sox are this year,” or “The Phillies are looking great!” These other men all have some form of neatly trimmed facial hair, goatees and other circular grasps at fur as the scruff atop their heads blows away in the wind. (For myself, also gradually losing my hair, I am simply grubby and unshaven.)
—
The boys are warming up now as I sit upon a wet, freezing metal bleacher, the only one of the parents not standing. The rest seem to be readying themselves to be harsh east coast fans, more than simply demanding. They are angry. They want to be amused, entertained. More than anything they want to win. There is a mixture of shouts, all shouting the others down. One of the coaches–an arrogant know-it-all who does not appear to like children–shouts indifferent orders about “good throws and good catches.” (The head coach, this year, actually seems like a great guy–fun and fun-loving. He is no doubt a man who knows how to have a good time) This secondary coach is watching neither the throwing nor the catching. He stares into his cell phone, perhaps seeing if his afternoon rendezvous with his mistress has been cancelled due to rain.
More parents are gathering as many of the boys show up late (mom or dad’s fault, although none of them admit this.) Two people nervously uttered something about their kid taking forever, which is why they are late without having been asked. This is bad parenting. Some of these men are bad parents.
The mothers are an interesting mixture too. These are not the gymnastics moms (my daughter was once involved with this). Those mothers are every bit as harsh and demanding as the baseball, football and basketball fathers, and frequently much worse. They tend to hate the other parents, while the guys, at the very least, like to sullenly smirk around critics of a like mind. But the mothers at youth baseball tend to be either hyper-enthusiastic or utterly indifferent. The hyper-enthusiastic are insane, talking in a language that few people understand, involved with tactics and techniques, all in the most technical terms–speaking way over our heads, themselves once prime athletes too. Their kids tend to be the most talented players. These women, sometimes far too aggressively, seem to want to help everyone be better. The indifferent are just that. They sit there with younger children, teaching them to be disinterested in their sibling’s accomplishments, or merely staring into their phones throughout the entire game.
—
I just took five minutes to watch the coach with the boy who I guess is going to be their ace pitcher. The kid throws hard, although his range and accuracy are limited. The trouble here, however, has less to do with occasional wildness, and is entirely focused upon the non-stop jabbering of the man standing right behind him on the mound, giving directions even during the wind up. He is clearly annoying the boy, but is so funny and charming that you simply can’t be angry with him.
I walk over to the gathered fathers standing along the third base line and make a bland comment to one of them about the rain. He seems thrilled, all of the sudden, to have someone to talk to. He busily talks about his child, making sure that I know that last year he was an all-star. He tells me what a great pitcher his son is. He says I should keep an eye on his all season.
Another child is tubby, slow. He cannot catch. He cannot throw. I am certain that he cannot hit. The boy looks miserable. Some of the other kids–my son are mocking him. I am the only one to say anything, the boy’s father red faced. I call my son over. I ask him what is going on. My son says that the boy is very shy, and is probably the nicest person he has ever met, but that the other kids don’t want him on their team because he isn’t any good at the game.
My son is presently telling some of the others to stop. A few– the kids of the real fucking assholes, those in their Hummers and weekend Porsches–the bulk of them in expensive SUVs that they really don’t need–they refuse to let it go. Every third word out of their mouths is some form of ‘fuck.’ One of these 13 year old kids, apparently with the nodding approval of his father, talks about how he “finger fucked” his girlfriend “last night in the fucking basement.”
—
So the game has finally started and I go to socialize. I spoke with one of the dads for a while–one of those forgettable discussions about previous seasons and our cursory plans later in the day (my daughter gets a nice birthday dinner at some joint back home in the city.) Decent guy; right attitude. He does not take it too seriously, unlike most of the other parents, anxiously pacing around, calling out balls and strikes.
One guy–a real motherfucker, so harsh in this scrimmage towards his son that the boy walked off the field crying–seems to believe that his child’s team is all about himself. Winning is everything as far as he is concerned (this game is essentially preseason and does not count). This is the lesson he offers his son, a form of bitter aggression that will someday consume him when he has his own children to boss around. He, like so many others, is creating a monster.
One of the boys is superb. A slugger who sent the ball flying all the way over to the soccer field net in deep, deep center field, is also the most team-oriented, least arrogant–wait–my son is batting . . . 0-1, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, ground out–the team star has a wonderful father. Here is a man who sacrifices himself for his children, like any parent is supposed to do, at least more often than not. He is encouraging, demands hard work, and realizes that not everything is about himself.
On the most part this is a pretty good group. There is the same arrogance, the same pettiness and selfishness that is tragically inevitable when kids are desperate to impress their watching parents. This is our competitive nature. I could go on and on and eventually trash every single one of them, pointing out the covered up stupidity of our manifest flaws, but I have presently decided against this. The skies are clearing and the sun has started to broil up the chilling wind. It looks as though it will be a lovely day after all. Besides–and what can I say, I am a long time fan–how bad could things possibly be? It’s the start of baseball season. Advertisements "

"Nipsey Hussle Memorial Service: Rapper's Funeral Will Not be a Ticketed Event, Karen Civil Confirms",www.newsweek.com,Janice Williams,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/nipsey-hussle-memorial-funeral-death-1388181,"On 4/6/19 at 3:58 PM EDT Share Culture
Planning for Nipsey Hussle’s memorial service is underway, but contrary to earlier reports, tickets will not be sold to the event.
Media maven and Hussle’s friend Karen Civil shared details of the rapper’s upcoming funeral on Twitter on Saturday.
“I want to officially let @NipseyHussle fans & supporters know there will be NO selling of tickets to his funeral,” she wrote.
A TMZ report claimed Hussle’s service was planned to be held at Los Angeles’ Staples Center, as the memorial is expected to attract thousands. The arena, home to the Los Angeles Lakers NBA team and the NHL's L.A. Kings, can hold up to 21,000 people.
The report said tickets would be sold online for an undisclosed price through an unidentified website, and only ticketholders would gain access to the service, which was reportedly scheduled for Thursday. However, Civil disputed those claims.
“A lot of incorrect information was released today, please know in the upcoming days and [sic] official statement will be made soon,” she wrote.
Regardless of when or where Hussle’s memorial is held, the funeral service is likely to be flooded with fans and spectators. In cities all across the U.S., hundreds of people have gathered together and held vigils honoring the West Coast rapper’s legacy.
In addition to being a successful rap artist, the Grammy nominee was also a prominent figure in his Los Angeles community and invested much of the fortune earned from his music back into the neighborhood he grew up in.

“He was a brother, a musician, an entrepreneur, a people’s champ,” Samiel Asghedom, Hussle’s older brother, said in his first interview with ABC News following Hussle’s death. “He was somebody that believed in the process of hard work, determination and just the positivity of somebody staying in the area that he grew up in and making something out of nothing…he was a role model to the community, to the kids, and to the mothers and grandmothers and the community that watched him grow up and seen him as a youngster, (and now) a family man, a father, raising his kids.”
The father-of-two was shot outside of his retail store, Marathon Clothing, in the Hyde Park area of Los Angeles on March 31. He was transported to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead. Two other men were also hit by bullets but survived the incident. One of the men did receive medical treatment for injuries.
A man named Eric Holder, who allegedly had an altercation with Hussle before his death, is suspected of shooting him. Holder, also known as S**tty Cuz, was charged with two counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon on Thursday, according to Los Angeles District Attorney’s office. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison."

The results were interesting, to say the least, as finding and maintaining solid 5G signal proved difficult , since its ""millimeter wave technology"" is apparently fairly dependent on line of sight.
Over the course of our initial hands-on, we seriously questioned Verizon's 5G network's reliability.
Take the Verizon Store where the event took place: it was scarcely bigger than 30 feet across and 100 feet back, with a 5G node in the front of the building. Reception was spotty toward the back, and could even peter out near the front . We noticed the Moto Z3 switch from 5G to 4G LTE on multiple occasions as we moved around, and had to keep checking that our speed tests were 5G all the way through. - TechRadar
AT the Verizon store, the 5G modded Moto Z3 hit speeds of more than 650 Mbps . Downloading a 1.81 GB PUBG Mobile game over the 5G network took just under 4 and a half minutes, while taking 6 minutes and 8 seconds on the 4G network. As TechRadar notes, "" while the 5G network is clearly the faster of the two, it's not by an order of magnitude .""
Walking around Chicago - areas with strong reception provided downloads of more than 400 Mbps .
Read TechRadar's ongoing hands-on test here . Their findings as of this writing are below:
4/5, 1:30 pm CT: Checking to make sure Netflix and the Play Store weren't a speed bottleneck, we connected to Wi-Fi and retried the downloads. The movie downloaded at close to 20MB/s and the game downloaded at about 13MB/s, vastly exceeding what we could get on our 5G connection.
4/5, 12:59 pm CT: Took another 5G field trip, and found a consistent signal at the base of a building that seemed like it would have actually blocked signal. A few speed tests that exceeded 400Mbps confirmed we had a real 5G connection , though a test using a single data stream showed only 17.3Mbps downstream. In between multiple tests that showed high speeds, we attempted to download another movie on Netflix and a game on the Play Store, but neither managed to download much faster than 1MB/s, whereas a 400Mbps connection should offer up to 50MB/s download speeds.
4/5, 9:10 am CT: Further into West Loop, found a semi-stable 5G signal and ran a series of speed tests, getting 292Mbps, 113Mbps, 65.5Mbps, and 240Mbps. The speed tests didn't show a correlation between 5G signal strength and speeds.
4/5, 8:58 am CT: Walked into the West Loop on a street that has frequent wide views of The Loop. Once again, experienced 4G and 5G quickly switching back and forth. Ran a speed test while the network was toggling and got 47.4Mbps downstream.
4/4, 5:25 pm CT: Left the West Loop after a day generally spent without 5G. The millimeter wave technology used is fairly dependent on line of sight , and that can be hard to find, but we'll keep trying.
4/4, 12:30 pm CT: Popping back outside into the rain to see how long it'd take to download The Raid Redemption at 446MB on the 5G network, we gave up after 2 minutes and 30 seconds that had only netted 44MB. A quick speed test showed the lowest speeds we'd seen all day at 59.9Mbps. Never mind downloading a whole TV show season before a flight takes off, we couldn't even download Iko Uwais kicking his first ass.
4/4, 12:08 pm CT: Went into the grocery store on that same corner and couldn't get 5G even sitting next to a window near that corner.
4/4, 11:56 am CT: Took the Moto Z3 out for a walk in the West Loop, because the 5G signal couldn't bother to join me indoors on this cold and rainy day. Found a corner closer to The Loop that had 5G signal, though it was still spotty. Ran a speed test that hit 448Mbps downstream with a 19ms ping time . Tags "
Who Will Prosecute the Attorney General? - LA Progressive,www.laprogressive.com,Lance Simmens,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.laprogressive.com/attorney-general-barr/,"Subscribe Who Will Prosecute the Attorney General?
T hroughout the course of human history we have devoted considerable time and effort to identify a savior, a hero or heroine, a larger than life itself manifestation of redemption to which we could pledge unconditional allegiance in exchange for the hope that all would be right with the world. Foolishly we strive to anoint a mere mortal with providential authority, an act of unrelenting futility, despair, and disappointment, so we turn our attention skyward and place a spiritual trust in religion to save us.
Whether or not one is a religious or spiritual individual, at one time or another most of us fall victim to the illusion that great leaders will rise from the heap of human endeavors and provide at the very least a temporary respite from the horrors we inflict upon ourselves. Speaking only for myself I too have fallen victim to what many would label hopeless romanticism. While great men and woman have risen to the task over the centuries, in the end they are merely human and carry many of the same faults, insecurities, and foibles as those of us self-appointed ordinary people.
In most instances those who place the enormous burden of leadership upon our fellow humans end up disappointed. It is only natural that we let our hopes and dreams carry us away and expect the impossible. However, many leaders do emerge in times of great crises, demanding substantial sacrifices that we agree to agree to endure and help us avert, if only temporarily, a greater catastrophe.
Contemporaneously, many concerned with the encroaching authoritarian bent that is being exhibited throughout the world, but most troubling and unexpectedly right here in America, have cast their lot with the foundational notion that our representative democratic would in the end save us from ourselves. I am one of them, believing that appealing to our better angels would help resurrect a society whose guiding principles are so eloquently embodied in the words of our Founding Fathers and would avert what has been labeled a constitutional crisis.
Idealistically, liberals have placed their trust in individuals and institutions whose conservative credentials are relatively foreign to our beliefs and political ideology. So we at first resorted to a cadre of military generals to keep the President from destroying a world order that has withstood seven decades since the end of World War II. That failed. Next we put our faith in a governmental bureaucracy that certainly would protect our national security (Intelligence community) and the rule of law (Department of Justice). That failed.
We have relied upon individuals with strong partisan Republican credentials to rectify or at the very least mitigate the rampant corruption that has overtaken our society.
Finally, we turned to a Special Counsel whose solemn responsibility would be to present the case of whether or not our President and his administration have compromised or conspired to thwart the will of the American people. The verdict is still out on this one. In all of these instances we have relied upon individuals with strong partisan Republican credentials to rectify or at the very least mitigate the rampant corruption that has overtaken our society. It is looking more and more likely that we may have to wait until the 2020 election to render a verdict on this issue.
We still do not know whether or not our system of checks and balances is anything more than a fanciful aberration held hostage to the realities of a gangster government. The Special Counsel’s report has been sequestered by an Attorney General whose predisposition to despotism was on display when he authored a 19 page document essentially proclaiming his belief that the President was above the law, hence cementing his modern-day status as a judicial hack whose allegiance is to an individual not a system of government. His June, 2018 letter essentially arguing that the President could not be subjected to an obstruction of justice charge by the Special Counsel is a disqualifying action that should have demanded his recusal. Instead, it served as an audition tape for the role he currently plays in this modern version of a Greek tragedy.
So as the President, a congenital liar who is most likely suffering from dementia and surrounded by family advisors, mimicking the telltale signs of a banana dictatorship, who worships at the altar of unfeathered self-aggrandizement and suffers from uncontrollable narcissism, revels in the nether regions of dubious exoneration, the American public is left in the dark wondering if the report they paid for will ever see the light of day.
I wonder, who will prosecute Attorney General Barr for the audacious perversion of authority he has assumed that would allow him to purposely misrepresent to the American people the results of a Special Counsel investigation? Mr. Mueller, it is now time to stand up and be counted. The American people placed their trust and faith in your service to the nation to present the truth as you and your investigators see it. If your work is being fashioned and misshaped to reflect anything other than what your original report has found, you need to speak up. Too many have put their unconditional trust in you because of your carefully honed reputation for honesty and integrity at a time when both are in short supply at the highest reaches of our government. Consider this the ultimate act of dedication and devotion to your country.
Republican leadership in the US Senate, a body I devoted 6 years of my life in service to, is absolutely devoid of patriotism at this point and hopefully will be relieved of that responsibility in the next election. I worked in the Senate under the shadow of the post-Watergate years when leaders like Howard Baker, Lowell Weicker, Mark Hatfield, just to name a few, faced their obligation to the nation and regularly placed it above crass partisanship. Such a thing no longer exists in the Republican Party and the damage it inflicts upon our nation is staggering.
I have not read the Mueller report, few have. I do not know what is has to say other than the pathetic whitewash concocted by a crooked and corrupt Attorney General whom history will treat very harshly. But it is common sense that the actions of the AG and the President clearly reflect consciousness of guilt regardless of whether or not actions warrant criminal prosecution. We must allow the report to be released in its pristine form and let the chips fall where they may. Why would any conscientious citizen want anything other than such a conclusion? If the President is indeed innocent he should be screaming for such and if he were it would have already happened.
S o on behalf of those who wish to know the truth, regardless of where or what it points to, it is time for Mueller to step up and be heard. The President is doing everything he can to shape the public narrative, as he is inclined to do regardless of whether or not it resembles the facts, and the longer that is allowed to carry the day, the harder it will be to face up to the truth. The public is weary and delay only exacerbates tensions that worsen as division and polarization tear at the very fabric of our republic. It is time to face the music and move on.

"GPS Goes ""Haywire"" When Putin Is Near, Study Finds | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/gps-goes-haywire-when-putin-near-study-finds,"0 SHARES
A study published by the Center for Advanced Defense has determined that the Russia security services are using a cutting-edge new technique, presumably to protect President Putin - as well as several government buildings in Russia, and military facilities in Syria - from drone attacks.
Using publicly available data sets and reports on social media and in the press, the organization pinpointed incidences of ""GPS spoofing"" when an electronic weapon scrambles the data stream between nearby ships, vehicles and aircraft and the satellites that help power their navigation systems. In many cases, like one incident that occurred near the Kerch Strait, the site of a skirmish late last year between Ukrainian and Russian forces. As Putin and a convoy of construction vehicles crossed a new bridge over the Strait, the GPS of ships docked in a nearby harbor suddenly went ""haywire.""
Here's more on that from CBS News :
The ships' GPS systems suddenly began to indicate they were actually 65 kilometers away, on land, in the middle of an airport.
The incident is one of many highlighted in a new report that found the Kremlin ""spoofed"" global positioning systems, or GPS, to effectively place a bubble around Putin or properties associated with him. The researchers, with a nonprofit called C4ADS and the University of Texas at Austin, used public marine GPS databases, as well as a GPS monitoring device on the International Space Station to track similar instances.
The report, which documented a pattern of spoofing surrounding the movements of the Russian head of state...
....surmised that the GPS scrambling technology was employed to protect him against drone attacks, or airborne robot spies.
The researchers theorize that one reason ""spoofing"" is deployed is to protect Putin and other Russian officials from attacks or surveillance by drones that rely on GPS.
""The purpose of this spoofing activity was likely to prevent unauthorized civilian drone activity as a VIP protection measure,"" they wrote in the study.
The report also identified buildings used by Russian security services or the president that appeared to be hotspots for spoofing activity, and detailed several incidents of suspected mass-spoofing activity.
While the technology was presumably employed to protect Putin, there is an inadvertent drawback that could be used by exploited by malicious actors to stalk the president.
However, there's a drawback to creating a GPS bubble around a world leader, said Todd Humphreys, an engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who was involved with the study. It also makes it easier to keep track of Putin.
""What's ironic is if you look at these patterns, and if you coordinate it with the movements of the leader of Russia, it appears you have a Putin detector,"" Humphreys said. In other words, if you detect spoofing, there's a good chance Putin may be nearby.
It also creates the possibility for collateral damage.
The technique could also prove dangerous. The 24 maritime vessels that reported the Kerch bridge incident were otherwise unaffected. But Humphreys said a similar tactic in Syria could affect airplanes, which require functioning GPS to stay out of harm's way.
The researchers identified Russian equipment in Syria emitting what Humphreys described as ""a whole different signal, one that was much much stronger, but not spoofing."" The signal appeared to be jamming airplane GPS units, effectively rendering their navigation systems inoperable.
When the same tactic was apparently deployed during large-scale Russian military exercises in eastern Europe, civilians saw the effects, according to the report.
""Norway and Finland reported severe GPS outages affecting commercial airliners and cell phone networks for several days,"" according to the report.
Unfortunately, this drawback would probably exclude GPS spoofing from the list of possible anti-drone techniques employed by airports...we imagine the security staff at Heathrow and Gatwick will be very disappointed. Login "

NEW YORK (Reuters) – A 55-year-old New York man has been arrested and charged with threatening to assault and murder Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, a Muslim U.S. Congress member from Minnesota, federal prosecutors said.
Patrick Carlineo Jr. of Addison, New York, faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday in a statement.
According to prosecutors, Carlineo spoke by telephone with one of Omar’s staff members on March 21 and asked the employee: “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s a (expletive) terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.”
The threat was referred to the U.S. Capitol Police, which launched a probe in coordination with the FBI, the Justice Department said.
Carlineo sounded angry during the phone call but also spelled his name for the staff member and provided contact details, according to an affidavit by an FBI special agent.
Interviewed at his home by investigators, Carlineo “stated that he was a patriot, that he loves the President, and that he hates radical Muslims in our government,” the affidavit said.
Carlineo made an initial court appearance on Friday and is being held pending a detention hearing on April 10.
Representatives of Omar, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who was elected in November as one of the two first Muslim women to win seats in Congress, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In February, Omar apologized “unequivocally” after Republicans and Democrats condemned comments she made about the pro-Israel lobby in the United States as using anti-Semitic stereotypes. President Donald Trump said her apology was inadequate and she should be “ashamed of herself.”

Chase CEO Dimon Illuminates Capitalism’s Sickness While Trying to Critique Socialism,www.politicususa.com,Tim Libretti,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/06/chase-ceo-dimon-illuminates-capitalisms-sickness-while-trying-to-critique-socialism.html,"Chase CEO Dimon Illuminates Capitalism’s Sickness While Trying to Critique Socialism 208 Subscribe Print Flipboard
To perhaps an unprecedented degree in the United States, we are witnessing an increasingly serious debate playing out about the relative merits of capitalism and socialism.
This development is healthy, allowing the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the way we organize our economy to meet human need through honest comparison with the ways other nations do, as we search for the best solutions and possibilities for serving people’s needs.
Despite the general consensus that during the Red Scare days Senator Joe McCarthy was in fact conducting an extremist witch hunt, an anti-communism ideology has abided in American culture, disarming our ability to engage in clear-eyed reflection of other possibilities for organizing our economy, healthcare system, and more. Once anyone said, “Well that’s socialism” or “that’s communism,” the conversation ended.
Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign, regardless of its shortcomings, catapulted “socialism” into the nation’s political vocabulary, eroding in some measure its pejorative presumptions, arguably sparking more curiosity than castigation. The juggernaut intellect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has furthered the term’s currency, endowing it with a vibrancy, substance, and maybe even a sustainability, although it still holds the status of being a shiny new object in political conversation, its history notwithstanding.
One sign of socialism’s currency, that it demands reckoning, is the fact that J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon felt compelled even to address socialism in a recent letter to shareholders. One doesn’t take on opponents one doesn’t view as a serious threat to one’s standing and interests; one ignores them. Dimon’s discussion also signals the extent to which “socialism” really is a shiny new object largely misunderstood in U.S. politics and culture.
It’s not even clear Dimon really understands capitalism, as his comments to shareholders, ironically, read more like an indictment of the U.S.’s current capitalist order.
Let’s look at this letter, released with the bank’s 2018 annual report. Dimon writes :
“When governments control companies, economic assets (companies, lenders and so on) over time are used to further political interests – leading to inefficient companies and markets, enormous favoritism and corruption.”
“Socialism inevitably produces stagnation, corruption and often worse – such as authoritarian government officials who often have an increasing ability to interfere with both the economy and individual lives – which they frequently do to maintain power. This would be as much a disaster for our country as it has been in the other places it’s been tried.”
Did you catch the irony? Substitute “capitalism” for “socialism” in this passage, and it would make more sense, particularly in our current context, to which Dimon seems rather oblivious.
If you didn’t catch the irony, let me explain some sad facts of our political economy that should clarify it.
Nevermind our President is being sued for violating the Constitution’s emoluments clause and has been blatant in exploiting the Presidency to enrich himself, vacationing at his own resorts at taxpayer expense, gaining favoritism for his and his family’s businesses with foreign governments, and more. The Saudis and their lobbyists book rooms in Trump hotels by the hundreds.
Last March, Newsweek reported on the strange — and quietly orchestrated — move by the White House, endorsed by Jared Kushner, to support a blockade of Qatar organized by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This support came a month after reports that Qatar had rejected solicitations from Jared Kushner’s father for financing to bail them out of a heavily indebted property. Speculation ran high that this otherwise puzzling foreign relations decision was an exacting of revenge on the part of the Kushner family. And Dimon thinks socialism breeds corruption and favoritism?
Trump and his shenanigans aside, though, let’s look at a few other examples, from the thousands from which we could pick, of the way capitalism breeds corruption, fosters behavior hostile to the public good, and interferes with individual lives in damaging ways.
Here’s a few:
*A recent lawsuit filed by the state of Massachusetts against Purdue Pharma details how the company, in marketing its product OxyContin, self-servingly and knowingly urged over-prescription of the drug and abetted the opioid crisis that has taken and damaged tens of thousands of lives. Among other information contained in company communications, documents reveal the company knew of the problems of addiction and the dangers of their drug and, instead of pursuing a course of action to curtail the problem, developed a PR campaign to blame the addicts rather than threaten their profits.
*Remember that horror of U.S. capitalism called the Great Recession caused largely by banks creating and trading toxic mortgage loans, often fraudulently, leading to the destruction of millions of Americans’ wealth, causing massive employment, triggering a foreclosure crisis, and more? And remember that capitalist history cyclically experiences such crises? Certainly capitalism has its moments far worse than stagnation, and I hope the rampant corruption here is clear.
*And remember Wells Fargo defrauding its customers, opening accounts in their names without their knowledge?
*And, to inject a little variety, let’s shift to how the criminal justice system functions within capitalism. Remember the Pennsylvania judge who enriched himself by sentencing juvenile offenders to serve time in a private prison? Or are carceral state with private prisons that benefit not from reductions in crime and rehabilitating prisoners but expanding crime and warehousing criminals?
*How about for-profit universities (including Trump’s) that have swindled students out of exorbitant tuition payments and left them no with degree?
This kind of greed infecting our system, which does not promote democracy or the public good but rather a kind of authoritarianism and a private interest hostile to others, is a value capitalism cultivates–and set of behaviors applauded and awarded..
The system Dimon describes as socialism, is in fact capitalism, our nation’s capitalism.
Meanwhile, as I’ve written about in these pages , nations like Finland and Denmark rank higher for happiness, health, and education, and people like Nikki Haley and Dimon, swimming in private wealth, continue to denounce them.
Wonder why?
I guess the authoritarianism, corruption, economic crises and instability, and favoritism and cronyism we experience in U.S. capitalism are somehow preferable. Tim Libretti

Despite President Obama’s insistence that “ we can’t drill our way ” to energy independence, America has been enjoying an energy renaissance under the Trump administration. We have become an energy exporter for the first time in 75 years, gas prices are low, and we are on track to achieve energy independence by 2020.
The Trump administration can be proud of these data points. Yet, its energy policy is not perfect.
James (Rick) Richard Perry Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief expects Turkey to drop purchase of Russian missile system | Dems counter Trump's proposed cuts with B spending boost | Lawmakers press Perry on nuke work with Saudis Senators press Perry on nuclear work with Saudi Arabia Rewarding failure: Taxpayers on hook for billion nuclear boondoggle MORE recently visited the Vogtle nuclear power plant in eastern Georgia, where he announced that the administration would provide an additional $3.7 billion in loan guarantees to support construction of two reactors. The move leaves the government guaranteeing a full $12 billion of the project’s financing.
To say that the project’s construction has been troubled would be an understatement. It is billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, and it is not certain that the project will, in fact, ever be completed. Its potential customers are balking at the prospect of paying the high prices it will be forced to charge to recoup its investment. The fact that energy prices overall are sharply lower than they were when the project began — thanks to the 50 percent increase in natural gas production in the past decade — has put its long-term prospects in doubt even if the Vogtle plant does get up and running.
The Trump administration appears unwilling to let the market determine the optimal energy mix in this country. In the past two years, it has attempted to prop up failing nuclear and coal-fired power plants several times, offering up various rationales for doing so. Last year it suggested these fuel sources were more resistant to cyber threats, an unsure claim. The administration also put forth the argument that subsidizing coal and nuclear plants is necessary for reasons of national security, but the majority of our nation’s natural gas supply is sourced from domestic producers.
Earlier, the Trump administration tried to push the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to determine that it was necessary to prevent coal and nuclear power plants from closing in order to ensure grid resilience, but the commission rejected that notion in January 2018.
Most recently, the administration introduced language in the Economic Report of the President outlining a potential vehicle for a federal bailout. The report discussed a “voluntary reserve program” that would serve to “promote the grid’s resilience.” While all sources would be eligible to be part of a reserve, unsurprisingly the report specifically mentions nuclear and coal plants as assets that could be shown preferentially treatment given they provide alleged “greater resilience benefits.” It is little more than a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.
The Trump administration no doubt feels compelled to protect the shift away from coal and nuclear and towards natural gas. It has a deep vein of support in coal country, and nuclear power plants provide well-paying jobs for both blue- and white-collar workers.
However, the unprecedented increase in natural gas production has brought substantial economic benefits. Most importantly, its rise has helped to moderate energy prices across America. Not only has that helped U.S. companies — especially manufacturers and other businesses in energy-intensive activities — but lower energy prices have been good for consumers. For example, a study by the Consumer Energy Alliance estimated that Ohio energy consumers saved a total of $40 billion from the lower prices engendered by the rise in natural gas production, which amounts to a significant boost in the state’s collective standard of living — less money spent on energy allows people to spend more on other things.
There’s no denying that the economy’s transition away from coal and nuclear power towards natural gas has disrupted some communities and careers, especially in areas of the country heavily dependent on coal. However, spending billions of dollars to prevent this evolution from occurring would leave us with energy prices higher than they need to be and diminish the environmental benefits of transitioning to natural gas, which releases 40 percent fewer greenhouse gases than coal.
The best response from this, or any, administration to the changing mix of energy prices would be benign neglect. Protecting coal or nuclear plants with further subsidies will generate no public benefit.

Consider the list of cable news contributors and personalities who have joined the administration or been offered promotions in the last year or so: John Bolton became national security adviser, Matthew Whitaker briefly served as acting attorney general, Heather Nauert almost became U.N. ambassador, Morgan Ortagus was tapped as a State Department spokeswoman, and Bill Shine was Trump’s short-lived communications director. That list doesn’t even include earlier appointments like communications director Mercedes Schlapp, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, former Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Tony Sayegh, and of course, who could forget Anthony Scaramucci, whose stint as communications director lasted just 10 days…
All of this matters. The skills that make for steady, wise governance are almost the opposite of the skills needed to shine on cable TV. Governing is a marathon, the sum of thousands of decisions designed, hopefully, to improve the lives of Americans and keep them safe. TV news stardom is a sprint — if you are able to argue for a stretch of five to 10 minutes, repeating the same talking points over and again, you can become famous. Performance skills can sometimes be useful in senior government positions; on TV, they’re just about the only thing that matters.
Of course, Trump ascended to his job after his own razzle-dazzle performance, both on TV and at his rallies — and he seems fairly confident in his own qualifications. It may be little wonder that he applies similar logic to his administration’s staffing decisions.

"How the Providence Journal Economic Scorecard charts were built - News - providencejournal.com - Providence, RI",www.providencejournal.com,Paul Edward Parker,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190406/how-providence-journal-economic-scorecard-charts-were-built,"Paul Edward Parker projopaul Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 4:07 PM
The Providence Journal Economic Scorecard offers a simple score that reveals the performance of 11 key economic indicators in the current quarter of the year compared with the same quarter a year ago. A score of 11 would mean Rhode Island’s economy is firing on all cylinders, every indicator improving, while a -11 would mean nothing’s going right, at least not economically. Any number above zero means most indicators showed improvement, while a negative number means most indicators declined.
How is the score determined?
The current level for each indicator is compared with its level one year ago. If it shows improvement, it is scored +1. If it shows decline, it is scored -1. If it hasn’t changed, it is scored 0. The scores for all 11 are added up to get the economic scorecard value.
What indicators are used?
The Journal draws the raw indicators from a number of state and federal government and private agencies: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the R.I. secretary of state’s office and the R.I. Association of Realtors.
They include several measures of the employment market, the housing market, personal income, new businesses, people in economic distress and the overall production of the economy.
We chose indicators that are updated at least every quarter of the year, because the scorecard will be updated quarterly. A number of excellent indicators, including those measuring household income and poverty, are not included because they are updated only once a year.
Why don’t all the indicators line up time-wise?
Two factors prevent all the indicators from lining up.
First, some indicators come out quarterly, some monthly, and some daily. These have all been converted to “quarterly” values, either by taking the latest monthly statistic or by adding up all of the daily statistics to come up with a three-month total.
More limiting, though, is that some of the indicators are delayed up to three quarters of the year behind real time. To include all of them on a same-time-frame basis would mean having to wait almost nine months for the slowest one. That may work for economists studying history, but not for a newspaper. So we use the latest available figures.
This creates a scorecard that reflects the perception of the time. So, on the facing page, the quarterly scorecard for January 2019 shows what the economy looks like, based on the best information available this month.
Why compare the current quarter with a year ago?
To calculate the score on the scale from -11 to +11, a quarter is compared with the same quarter a year earlier, rather than to the previous quarter.
This is to counter a phenomenon prevalent in economic data called seasonality. More people buy houses in warmer months than in colder months, so an increase in sales from winter to spring doesn’t mean much.
A change from one spring to the next is more meaningful. Several of the indicators have strong seasonality, as can be seen by the jagged ups and downs on their graphs.
Others show smoother lines, largely because the federal government applies seasonal adjustments to its statistics to eliminate jagged spikes.
When down is up ...
For two of the indicators — bankruptcy filings and unemployment rate — things are better when the numbers go down, so the score is +1 if the current quarter’s score is lower than the same quarter a year ago.
Do the numbers change?
The federal government periodically revises some of the indicators that it provides. The scorecard picks up those revisions and retroactively adjusts past scores."
Man Who Threatened to Murder Rep. Ilhan Omar Over Muslim Brotherhood Conspiracy Theory Had Weapons: FBI,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/man-charged-threatening-kill-rep-ilhan-omar-over-muslim-brotherhood-1388149,"On 4/6/19 at 1:51 PM EDT Share U.S.
A New York state man is in custody for threatening to murder Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The man, identified by authorities as Patrick Carlineo Jr., allegedly called the freshman congresswoman’s office and threatened to “put a bullet” in her skull.
Carlineo, Jr. made the statements during a brief March 21 phone call, according to a criminal complaint released Saturday by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York. When a staffer answered, the man allegedly berated the worker and referenced a false conspiracy theory linking Omar to the Muslim Brotherhood.
“Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood?” Carlineo, Jr. said, according to the complaint. “Why are you working for her, she's a f*cking terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her f*cking skull.”
The call was then forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Carlineo, Jr., 55, apparently provided his name and phone number to Omar's staff member, allowing authorities to trace the phone number back to his Addison, New York address.
Authorities found two firearms at Carlineo, Jr.’s residence during a subsequent investigation. In an interview with officials, he allegedly doubled-down on his threats, telling an FBI investigator: “if our forefathers were still alive, they’d put a bullet in her head.”
If convicted, Carlineo, Jr., 55, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Omar, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, has been targeted by conspiracy theorists throughout her short tenure in office. The controversy surrounding her critiques of U.S. support for Israel lifted her visibility in online forums, and made her image a fixture in right-wing blogs and news shows.
Earlier this year, the lawmaker was one of several Democratic politicians listed on an alleged ""hit list"" compiled by Christopher Paul Hasson, a U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant who prosecutors accuse of planning acts of domestic terrorism. And fringe websites and alt-right forums have repeatedly been flooded with racist commentary and memes about the 37-year-old representative.
When one such meme was posted in the rotunda of the West Virginia legislature , Omar decried Republican colleagues across the aisle for not doing enough to combat spurious and incendiary claims.
""No wonder why I am on the 'Hitlist' of a domestic terrorist and 'Assassinate Ilhan Omar' is written on my local gas stations,"" Omar wrote on Twitter, linking to an article about the flyers. ""Look no further, the GOP's anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist rocks in state capitols and no one is condemning them!""
In the weeks following the flyers and her statements about Israel, Democrats in the House passed a symbolic anti-hate resolution that denounced racism and hatred in “all forms.”

Watergate's John Dean Mocks Donald Trump over Mueller Report: 'When Was the Last Time You Read 400 Pages Plus of Anything',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/john-dean-mocks-trump-reading-mueller-report-1388158,"On 4/6/19 at 1:30 PM EDT Share U.S.
Richard Nixon's White House counsel John Dean mocked President Donald Trump for claiming that he has not yet read Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on the Russia investigation, asking Trump when he last read anything that long.
The president revealed that he has not seen the highly debated document in a Twitter post on Saturday morning.
“I have not read the Mueller Report yet, even though I have every right to do so,"" he wrote. ""Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion. Likewise, recommendations made to our great A.G. who found No Obstruction.""
Dean, who was himself heavily involved in the Watergate coverup before agreeing to be a witness against Nixon, immediately replied to Trump’s comment with a tweet of his own: “And when was the last time you read 400 pages plus of anything? You don’t read, remember! Maybe Barron will read it to you…”
And when was the last time you read 400 pages plus of anything? You don’t read, remember! Maybe Barron will read it to you... https://t.co/9DB9qmrorw &mdash; John Dean (@JohnWDean) April 6, 2019
There have been several reports in which Trump is described as the president who doesn’t read. Occasionally, Trump has even admitted that he is often “too busy” to read detailed reports or even daily intelligence briefings.
During the 2016 election, then-candidate Trump told the Washington Post that not only does he have no time for reading but he also has no need for it because he can reach the right decision “with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I [already] had, plus the words ‘common sense,’ because I have a lot of common sense and I have a lot of business ability.”
Then in 2018, it was reported that President Trump does not read his daily briefing, which is a document laying out the most important information collected by intelligence agencies. Instead, he opted for an oral briefing of select intelligence issues in the Oval Office.
Even still, the Mueller report has been one of the most highly anticipated events in national politics for the past two years.
The special counsel handed over his final report to Attorney General William Barr on March 22 and Barr released a brief four-page summary of the investigation’s key findings just 48 hours later.
In the summary, Barr said that Mueller and his team did not establish conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign during the election. Barr also announced that while the special counsel did not reach a conclusion “one way or the other” as to whether Trump obstructed justice throughout the probe, he and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein concluded there was not sufficient evidence to prove the president committed a crime.
But Democrats are still waiting for Mueller’s report to be released in its entirety. This week, the House Judiciary Committee authorized a subpoena for the full report just in case Barr does not make the entire document available.
“Show us the Mueller report, show us the tax returns, and we are not walking away just because you say no the first time around,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned the president on Thursday.
Trump continued his Twitter tirade on Saturday, adding that ""13 Angry Trump hating Dems (later brought to 18) given two years and $30 million, and they found No Collusion, No Obstruction. But the Democrats, no matter what we give them, will NEVER be satisfied. A total waste of time.""

Alec Baldwin on How Fatherhood Helped Him Tap Into His Character in 'The Public',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/alec-baldwin-fatherhood-helped-him-public-character-1385685,"Emilio Estevez's new film The Public begins when a homeless man dies in front of a public library. The shelters in Cinncinati are filled to capacity as bitter cold freezes the city, sparking a debate about whether the public library should house those without homes when temperatures become unbearable. The film is packed with A-list celebrities, including Alec Baldwin, who was attracted to the film’s message: Is it the public's duty to take care of the underprivileged?
The Public , out Friday, stars Estevez and Baldwin, who plays Detective Bill Ramstead, alongside Hollywood elites Taylor Schilling, Gabrielle Union, Michael Kenneth Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Jena Malone and Christian Slater. The movie follows librarian Stuart Goodson (Estevez) after a group of homeless men hold a peaceful demonstration in the public library in which he works. A standoff between the homeless and the police follows.
The law is simple: No one is allowed to stay in the library overnight, no matter how cold it might be, but things are murkier when it comes to Detective Bill Ramstead. His son, played by Nik Pajic, is a homeless drug addict. Baldwin was able to tap into the dichotomy his character faces—being someone who is supposed to uphold the law but also understands the struggle of the outlaws—based on his own experience as a father of five.
“I think probably the most painful thing I could think of...is you give your child nearly everything and they still turn out very troubled and self-destructive. That must hurt like hell,” Baldwin, 61, told Newsweek . “I’ve got three little sons. I’m 61 years old on Wednesday, and I’ve got a 5-year-old, a 3-year-old, a 2-year-old and a 10-month-old. I got remarried, I have a lot of kids and I have my older daughter as well, my daughter Ireland. I think about what a great mom my wife is, and I think about how my kids are being raised with a lot of opportunities and a lot of comforts.
“They’re very well taken cared for and provided for, but that doesn’t guarantee anything. So my character, a cop who probably has a certain code that would raise his kids a certain way, [has a] son [who] turns out the opposite...I know that from my character’s little tributary of a storyline there, it’s very painful for him, but it creates the empathy that allows him to drive through the rest of the story,” Baldwin continued.
The Public also addresses the global warming epidemic and mental illness. Estevez’s exploration of both is still timely, as those issues are only worsening.
Baldwin said that people “can’t expect our society to function any longer” if action to improve its faults aren’t taken—and that is the message being pushed in The Public .
“There’s a lot of things we need to do which, ultimately, I believe, are very reasonable financially,” he said. “It’s not like we’re gonna bring the country to its knees and the economy’s gonna come grinding to a halt. The great Ameican economic machine is not gonna cease up.”
The Public hits theaters Friday.

'Game of Thrones' Season 8: How Are Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen Related?,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/game-thrones-season-8-1385454,"On 4/6/19 at 3:00 PM EDT Share Culture
The last time fans saw Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen together on the Game of Thrones Season 7 finale, the pair were gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes as they made good on the attraction that seemingly began brewing from the first moment they met each other earlier in the season.
In the midst of their bedroom love fest, somewhere further North Jon’s brother Bran Stark and loyal friend Samwell Tarly pieced together the true story of Jon’s origin and realized that he actually was not the bastard son of Lord Eddard ""Ned"" Stark and some anonymous woman he'd met during the war, but rather the son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Eddard's sister Lyanna Stark, giving Jon a strong claim to being the true heir to the Iron Throne.
Of course, Jon doesn’t have a clue. He’d been raised as Eddard’s bastard boy (hence the Snow last name), but the linkage to Rhaegar makes it all the more understandable why Ned wouldn’t tell Jon the truth about his parents before the young man went off to join the Night’s Watch all those years ago on Season 1.
At the time of Jon's conception, Ned was a member of Robert Baratheon’s rebellion against the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, the father of Rhaegar, who had secretly married and fathered a child with Lyanna.
Surly baby Jon—or Aegon Targaryen as his loving and married parents named him—would have been killed in the war if anyone knew about his true parentage, especially since it was believed Lyanna, who Robert was desperately in love with, had been kidnapped by Rhaegar instead of eloping with her silver-haired beau.
After all, the only Targaryens known to survive the war were Rhaegar’s younger brother Viserys Targaryen and their baby sister, Daenerys, and elderly Maester Aemon, Rhaegar's great-great uncle who had once given up his opportunity to sit the Iron Throne in order to fulfill his obligation to serve with the Night’s Watch at Castle Black.
The family dynamic is a particularly interesting (and, sorry, super gross) one for Jon, who was last seen on GoT consumating his relationship with Daenerys. Thus, not only do Jon and Daenerys each have solid argument for being the rightful heir to the kingdom, they are also very closely related. To put it bluntly, Jon and his Aunt Daenerys are sleeping together.
There’s no guarantee when or if Jon and Daenerys will discover their relation on the eighth and final season of GoT . If they do, though, it won’t necessarily mean the end of their incestuous relationship.
GOT is known for its love ties among family members. The Targaryen’s claim to fame was mating among siblings and relatives—you know, to keep the white-haired bloodline pure. Not to mention, known lovers and twins Cersei and Jaime Lannister’s boot-knocking resulted in three children (maybe four) between the siblings.
Where it could, perhaps, bring problems for Jon and Daenerys is in determining which of them will actually sit on the Iron Throne—that is if either of them even survives the Great War that’s headed their way.
Under some traditional rules of succession, Jon would have the more solid claim, being the male son of King Aerys II's eldest child; much like England's Prince William would inherit the throne before any of his aunts or uncles. However, there are those who eschew such claims and believe that Daenerys, being a child of King Aerys II, is the rightful one to sit the Iron Throne.
Even if Jon does have the better claim, he may not take it. The brought-back-from-the-dead brooder has already bent the knee to Daenerys, First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regent of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. The odds of her being willing to give up her newfound power (not to mention massive following) seems unlikely, but the bloodlines don’t lie.
Of course, the ""Jon or Daenerys"" debate overlooks the existence of Gendry, the blacksmith bastard son of the late King Robert Baratheon. Though a bastard, Gendry is a direct descendant of the man who successfully seized the throne, as opposed to being a child or grandchild of a king who had to be killed by his own guard in order to prevent him from further mass destruction.
Guess we’ll all have to wait to see exactly what becomes of the relatives when Game of Thrones returns to HBO with the final season on April 14 at 9 p.m. ET."

by Jake Johnson, staff writer 0 Comments Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks during her weekly news conference at the U.S. Capitol April 4, 2019 in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came under fire from single-payer proponents Thursday after she deployed what one healthcare policy expert described as ""probably the most dishonest argument in the entire Medicare for All debate.""
""People who love their employer-based insurance do not get to hold on to it in our current system. Instead, they lose that insurance constantly, all the time. It is a complete nightmare.""
—Matt Bruenig, People's Policy Project
In an interview with the Washington Post , the Democratic leader said she is ""agnostic"" on Medicare for All and claimed, ""A lot of people love having their employer-based insurance and the Affordable Care Act gave them better benefits.""
Matt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing think tank People's Policy Project, argued in a blog post that Pelosi's statement ""implies that, under our current health insurance system, people who like their employer-based insurance can hold on to it.""
""This then is contrasted with a Medicare for All transition where people will lose their employer-based insurance as part of being shifted over to an excellent government plan,"" Bruenig wrote. ""But the truth is that people who love their employer-based insurance do not get to hold on to it in our current system. Instead, they lose that insurance constantly, all the time, over and over again. It is a complete nightmare.""
To illustrate his point, Bruenig highlighted a University of Michigan study showing that among Michiganders ""who had employer-sponsored insurance in 2014, only 72 percent were continuously enrolled in that insurance for the next 12 months.
""This means that 28 percent of people on an employer plan were not on that same plan one year later,"" Bruenig noted.
People Lose Their Employer-Sponsored Insurance Constantly
https://t.co/PI4EwRuIDk pic.twitter.com/2JiBhhuHeV
— Matt Bruenig (@MattBruenig) April 5, 2019
""Critics of Medicare for All are right to point out that losing your insurance sucks,"" Bruenig concluded. ""But the only way to stop that from happening to people is to create a seamless system where people do not constantly churn on and off of insurance. Medicare for All offers that. Our current system offers the exact opposite. If you like losing your insurance all the time, then our current healthcare system is the right one for you.""
All On Medicare—a pro-Medicare for All Twitter account—slammed Pelosi's remarks, accusing the Democratic leader of parroting insurance industry talking points:
Jesus Christ, @SpeakerPelosi -- why not just let a lobbyist from @AHIPCoverage be Speaker? You literally say the same things! https://t.co/lbGe3xPX6E pic.twitter.com/DIxPRQXWR2
— All On Medicare (@AllOnMedicare) April 5, 2019
The Speaker's alternative to the Medicare for All legislation co-sponsored by over 100 members of her caucus is a bill to strengthen the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which she introduced last week .
""We all share the value of healthcare for all Americans—quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans,"" Pelosi told the Post . ""What is the path to that? I think it's the Affordable Care Act, and if that leads to Medicare for All, that may be the path.""
The nation's largest nurses union was among those who expressed disagreement with the Speaker's incrementalist approach.
In a statement last week, National Nurses United president Zenei Cortez, RN, said Pelosi's plan would ""only put a Band-Aid on a broken healthcare system.""
""National Nurses United, along with our allies, will continue to build the grassroots movement for genuine healthcare justice and push to pass Medicare for All,"" Cortez concluded.

Former President Barack Obama At Berlin Town Hall: 'Circular Firing Squad' Weakens Progressive Progress,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/former-president-barack-obama-berlin-town-hall-circular-firing-squad-weakens-1388128,"On 4/6/19 at 12:15 PM EDT Share U.S.
While speaking at a town hall in Berlin, Germany, on Saturday, former President Barack Obama addressed divisions within the Democratic party and outlined his concerns about the fiercely partisan political climate.
“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States—maybe it’s true here as well—is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be,” Obama said at the town hall, organized by The Obama Foundation. “And then we start sometimes creating what’s called a 'circular firing squad' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.
He continued: ""When that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens, so I think...you have to recognize that the way we’ve structured democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you.”
Navigating compromise, he said, was “necessary for everyone.” He cited as evidence his efforts to ratify the Paris Climate Agreement and push through the Affordable Care Act.
Organized by The Obama Foundation, the town hall brought together more than 300 young leaders from private, public and nonprofit institutions and organizations, according to a statement. The speech, designed to foster civic engagement, was following by a question-and-answer segment during which the former president touched on a range of topics, from inequality to climate change.
At one point, he warned against rising nationalism and the “bloodshed” that follows such positions.
“Nationalism, particularly from the far-right, has re-emerged,” he said. “A politics that divides us into us and them,” he said. “And we know where that leads. Europe knows better than anyone where that leads.”
He also praised Europe for its rising standard of living, calling it the “pinnacle of human well being” and credited the spike in education rates and economic wealth to Democratic policies.
“We have to recognize that this moment is full of contradictions,” he said. “Europe in 2019, in some ways, has achieved the pinnacle of human well being. Collectively in Europe right now, on average, you probably see the highest standards of living of any group of people in the history of the planet.
But, he continued, “powerful forces are threatening to reverse many of these trends. The Democratic institutions that helped to bring these about, often times, have been taken for granted. The planet that we live on is in danger.”
Fostering civic engagement and working across political divisions is key to addressing those issues, he said.

Alec Baldwin on Trump Supporters and How 'SNL' Has Helped Shape American Politics,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/alec-baldwin-trump-supporters-snl-shaping-american-politics-1387765,"On 4/6/19 at 12:00 PM EDT Share Culture
Alec Baldwin, who has famously played President Donald Trump on numerous Saturday Night Live appearances, said the president's supports must be ""clinically insane"" if they believe Trump has what it takes to do one of the most important jobs on the planet.
Baldwin, 61, has been playing a parody version of Trump on SNL since 2016, often delighting the president's detractors while occasionally raising the hackles of Trump himself. Additionally, the politically liberal actor has—unlike his conservative-leaning brother, Stephen Baldwin—often expressed his disdain for Trump and his policies. The Oscar-nominated actor also had some harsh words for those who support the Republican leader simpy because he's not a Democrat.
""There are people who no matter what you say, no matter what you do, they don’t necessarily like Trump,"" Baldwin told Newsweek at a New York press event for his new film, The Public, which hit theaters Friday. ""I'm firmly of the belief that there is an abundant people who are motivated to raise their hand [and say] that they're in the Trump camp not of any appreciation for Trump's leadership skills. Trump is someone who you'd have to be clinically insane to think that he was a qualified leader in this country. What they do is they hate Trump's opposition. They hate liberal Hollywood.
""I'll apply all of their labels: they hate liberal Hollywood, they hate East Coast elites, they hate the over-educated, whatever, however, you want to identify people that believe [they] are controlling the faith of the country,"" continued Baldwin. ""It's more what they stand against than what they stand for. You can never change their minds and satisfy them.""

When asked if he'd given any thought to putting an end to playing Trump on SNL — a role that landed him a Primetime Emmy — Baldwin responded with a resounding ""yes,"" though he nonetheless recognized the role the late-night sketch series has played in shaping American politics.
""To me, I just keep saying pretty much 90 percent of what we do [is] just repeat things that Trump has said,"" he said. ""I mean, that's why they hate us most of all.""
Trump is a subject that Baldwin has brought up with his younger children. In February, he told daytime talk show host Ellen DeGeneres that his kids are ""sick"" of his Trump impression and have since associated the president with examples of things they should abstain from doing.
""Whatever you teach them is something they shouldn't do, they immediately assign that horrible thing to Trump,"" he told Ellen.
""My son will look at me and go, 'Does Trump pick his nose, Dad?'"" Baldwin continued. ""And I go, 'Yes, he does. That is a horrible thing to do.'""
Last month, Trump spent part of one Sunday morning railing against SNL on Twitter, referring to the show as an ""advertisement without consequences"" for Democrats, and suggesting that the Federal Elections Commission and the Federal Communications Commission should look into the matter.

Newt Gingrich: Changing the Bureaucracy—Vice President Pence’s 5 Rules for Effective Government | Opinion,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/changing-bureaucracy-vice-president-pences-5-rules-effective-government-1387977,"On 4/6/19 at 12:00 PM EDT Share Opinion

Again and again, we have seen presidents and congresses start out boldly, using big words to dramatically describe big ideas, only to have the ideas disappear in the impenetrable resistance of career bureaucrats. The dense thickets of regulations they have cultivated over the last 80 years make management and change virtually impossible.
The resistance of the bureaucracy is reinforced by the tenacious and pervasive lobbying and media campaigns executed by the defenders of the old order. I wrote in my book Breakout about “pioneers of the future and prison guards of the past.” Huge corporations and wealthy special interests who have been dominant and want to avoid change behave precisely like prison guards of the past. In virtually every sector of federal activity, there are companies and institutions that have lobbyists and apologists who oppose real change.
President Trump has run enough big businesses that he understands that real effort must be put into challenging the failed systems of the past. Translating the bold vision of President Trump into practical reality takes enormous effort and focus. In areas such as going to the Moon and defeating Huawei and the Chinese strategy to implement 5G globally, the old order will want to avoid change.
Vice President Pence has been a governor who had to implement practical changes despite the bureaucracy and the interest groups. In a recent speech to the National Space Council in Huntsville, Alabama, he outlined a series of powerful principles for reforming the government.
Pence’s first principle is to establish a big goal and then stick to it. As he put it in his remarkably bold and direct challenge to NASA, “failure to achieve our goal to return an American astronaut to the Moon in the next five years is not an option.”
Pence’s second principle is to be prepared to reach outside the traditional bureaucracy to new entrepreneurial private companies, if necessary, to get the job done. The Vice President told the NASA-Boeing bureaucracy, “we’re not committed to any one contractor. If our current contractors can’t meet this objective, then we’ll find ones that will. If American industry can provide critical commercial services without government development, then we’ll buy them. And if commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the Moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be.”
This principle could be immediately applied to change and streamline the rules bureaucrats are using to dole out work. One of the reasons the same stable of big companies always get government contracts is because they are the only ones with the knowledge and resources to navigate the web of red tape.
Imagine if we looked for new suppliers and new companies across the federal government to get faster, better, more efficient, and less costly solutions in health, learning, infrastructure – and every aspect of the federal government. Imagine if the Department of Defense was this aggressive in reaching beyond the old supplier base to new entrepreneurs. The achievements and savings would be stunning.
Vice President Pence’s third principle is a willingness to change the bureaucracy rather than abandon the goal. As I have written in a previous column , Pence recognizes that a new mindset must compensate for a lack of funding. In fact, I would argue that a new mindset is necessary, because more money poured into failing systems simply leads to more expensive failures (inner-city schools are a tragic example that cheat children of a proper education while avoiding accountability). Pence said in Huntsville that “we will call on NASA not just to adopt new policies but to embrace a new mindset. That begins with setting bold goals and staying on schedule.”
The Vice President’s fourth principle is a determination to change the bureaucracy in fundamental ways. As he asserted at the National Space Council, “NASA must transform itself into a leaner, more accountable, and more agile organization. If NASA is not currently capable of landing American astronauts on the Moon in five years, we need to change the organization, not the mission.” This principle of transformation can be applied to essentially every aspect of the federal bureaucracy.
Given the work I have been doing on the challenge of 5G and the Chinese dominance through Huawei, I really appreciate Pence’s fifth principle, which is a sense of urgency to push through needed changes. As he warned: “What we need now is urgency... it’s not just competition against our adversaries; we’re also racing against our worst enemy: complacency.”

If we could defeat the telecom complacency and the bureaucratic inertia, we could regain the lead in the implementation of 5G. If we allow the arrogance of the big, old established systems and the stubbornness of the bureaucracy to prevail, we will presently have a Chinese internet and terrible consequences for our freedom.
Pence’s five principles should be applied throughout the federal government. They would be excellent principles for Congress to apply in doing oversight. And many governors and mayors could apply them to their levels of government.
At every level, American would be greatly improved.

"Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang: 'We need to build a trickle-up economy' as Automation, Artificial Intelligence Change American Workplace",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/presidential-candidate-andrew-yang-we-need-build-trickle-economy-automation-1388152,"On 4/6/19 at 12:52 PM EDT Share U.S.
Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang said Saturday that the tech innovation driving the American economy is simultaneously putting large numbers of Americans out of work and argued that the U.S. needs to rethink how it measures economic success.
""We need to build a trickle-up economy,"" said Yang during an appearance on MSNBC's AM Joy, where the 2020 hopeful made the point that President Donald Trump was elected, in no small part, by Americans who had seen their manufacturing jobs taken by machines and computers – a fate that Yang said now faces the country's large retail workforce.
""Being a retail worker is the most common job in the United States and 30 percent of malls are going to close in the next four years because of Amazon sucking up another 20 billion in commerce every year,"" he told host Joy Reid. ""So we have to think much bigger if we're going to build an economy that works for people.""
Yang took issue with using Gross Dometic Product (GDP) — the total monetary value of all goods and services produced in a country — as a metric for success of failure.
""GDP is at record high, even as American's lives are falling apart, so we need to move our economic measurements to things that are actually meaningful to us and our communities,"" he explained, using the example of his wife, who is raising their two sons. ""Her work counts as zero in GDP, and we know that's the opposite of the way it should be.""
Rather than using a strict dollars-and-cents based measurement like GDP, Yang suggested other metrics that should be used when considering a nation's overall economic well-being: ""childhood success rates, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, life expectancy, how clean our air and water are.""
If elected, Yang said he would simply go to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics and tell them, ""Hey guys, GDP is almost 100 years old. It's out of date and we need to move on to the next form of our economic measurements.""
Yang, the son of immigrants from Taiwan, said that ""scapegoating immigrants"" for American job loss ""is the height of ignorance.""
He clarified: ""We need to wake America up to the fact that it is not immigrants that we need to be concerned about. It's the fact that our economy is evolving with advanced technology to the point where more and more Americans are going to struggle to find meaningful opportunities.""
Yang recently made headlines with his proposal for Universal Basic Income (UBI), or what the Yang campaign refers to as “The Freedom Dividend.” It would give $1,000 per month, or $12,000 each year, to every American adult over the age of 18.
""If I put money into Americans' hands, that going to make us stronger, healthier, better educated, mentally healthier,"" he said. ""It's going to create over two million jobs in our economy. The money just doesn't disappear; we spend it.""
Reid questioned Yang about the high price tag for such a program.
""The headline cost is something like $1.8 trillion a year,"" Yang explained on Saturday. ""For context, our economy's up to $20 trillion, up $5 trillion in the last 12 years.""
He explained the money would come from a new tax that would fall mostly on large tech companies like ""Amazon, Facebook, and Uber because the big winners with [artificial intelligence] and new technologies are gonna be the mega-tech companies — We all know that Amazon paid zero in federal taxes last year, and that's what has to change.""
In the polls, Yang remains far behind leading Democratic hopefuls like Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, though the 44-year-old did recently surpass the signature threshold needed to take part in the first rounds of candidate debates taking place later this year."
"Donald Trump Says He Could Change Immigration Laws in '15 Minutes,' Blames Other Countries For 'Not Giving Us Their Finest'",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-change-immigration-laws-fifteen-minutes-blames-countries-not-giving-1388136,"On 4/6/19 at 1:36 PM EDT Share U.S.
President Donald Trump, who has not passed any significant immigration reform bills since taking office, claimed in a new interview that he could change America's immigration laws in just “15 minutes” and blamed other countries for not “giving us their finest” in a Fox News interview during his visit to the southern border.
The president was in Calexico, California, on Friday to press his argument that there is a full-blown crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigration officials claim the nation’s immigration system is at a “breaking point” as thousands of migrants cross the border.
“We’re really making progress at letting people know this is an emergency,” Trump said. “It’s a colossal surge and it’s overwhelming our immigration system and we can’t let that happen.”
The president also made time to sit down with Fox News’ Griff Jenkins during his visit. In the interview, which aired on Saturday during Fox & Friends Weekend , Trump continued to tear into Democrats and foreign countries over the situation at the border.
“Oh Griff, we can change these laws in 15 minutes I could change them,” Trump claimed. “Catch and release. You know that is. Democrats, you catch the person you take their name and you release them. And we're not doing that anymore. And it's just a horrible thing.”
Trump went on to say that the Democrats are “getting hurt badly, politically” when it comes to immigration issues and predicted they may start working with Republican lawmakers.
But on Friday, House Democrats sued the Trump administration to block spending on the president's long-promised border wall. Earlier this year, Trump declared a national emergency at the border in order to gain the necessary funds to begin construction for the barrier. In their complaint, Democrats compared Trump and his national emergency to monarchy.
“Even the monarchs of England long ago lost the power to raise and spend money without the approval of Parliament,” the complaint read.
When asked whether it was time to set up a summit with the leaders of Central American countries like Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to discuss immigration, Trump quickly brushed off the idea: “No I don’t need a summit. I think we’ve done very well without a summit.”

Due to the surging amount of migrants coming to the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan recently said that for the first time in over a decade his agency is performing direct releases of certain migrants. This means that they are not turned over to ICE or detained, but rather given a notice to appear in court and released.
On Saturday, Trump lamented that Central American countries were not “giving us their finest.”
“I’m not going to say they give us their worst but you know why wouldn’t they,” he added. “So we have to get rid of these things and we can have it so easy. What has happened though, and you’ve seen it, is Mexico.”
Earlier this week, the president threatened to close the southern border entirely if the number of migrants and asylum-seekers crossing the border did not decrease. Though he backed off the threat, during his interview Saturday he said that if Mexico does not continue to apprehend migrants he is going to have to no choice but to “close up the border."""
'RHOBH' Star Erika Jayne Says 'The Tone Changes' When Lisa Vanderpump Isn't on Bravo Show: 'We Get to Have a Lot of Fun,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/real-housewives-beverly-hills-1388146,"On 4/6/19 at 1:16 PM EDT Share Culture
The drama will simmer down in the aftermath of Lisa Vanderpump and Kyle Richards’ explosive fight on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills , and now the cast will apparently start having some fun.
The PuppyGate controversy has been the topic of discussion for most of Season 9 so far, but Erika Jayne revealed the focus of the show will become less toxic now that Vanderpump has excused herself from the season. In the wake of her blowout with Richards, Vanderpump discontinued filming with the group and it's unclear how much of her presence will be on the show going forward.
“I think that we get to have a lot of fun,” Jayne told Us Weekly during an interview on Friday. “And remember… we have a lot of episodes to go. These first eight or whatever just happen to be very heavy, and then we start to have a lot of fun, which I think viewers will enjoy.”
She added: “Lisa is not there and the tone changes.”
The beginning of the season started with drama surrounding Vanderpump and Dorit Kemsley, who adopted a dog from Vanderpump’s animal rescue charity. When the dog ended up at a shelter, gossip emerged among the group that Kemsley purposefully dropped the dog at a kill shelter, although those rumors were unfounded.
When the truth about the dog was revealed—Kemsley had given it to a friend who ended up having to hand the animal over to a different shelter—the cast began to think Vanderpump was behind the gossip. Stories of the situation later leaked to the press, which only fueled speculation Vanderpump was out to get Kemsley.
While some of the ‘wives have said how tired they are of the doggie scandal, coined PuppyGate, Jayne said she was not. “I’m not tired of hearing about PuppyGate. It’s a story that we knew was going to take a lot of explaining and getting that out to the audience and showing all sides to the story,” she said.
However, the “XXPEN$IVE” singer did note how sad it was to see the controversy bring the end of Vanderpump and Richards’ friendship.
“I feel bad for both of them,” she said. “I feel bad for Lisa and for Kyle because it was a very tough place for them in their relationship and to confront each other with their true feelings. And to be screamed at and to be basically shown the door and have someone’s husband scream in your face, that doesn’t feel great.""
Richards confronted Vanderpump over the articles on the most recent episode of RHOBH , which aired on Tuesday, and told her longtime friend the general consensus was that she leaked the story about Kemsley and the dog to the press to make Kemsley look bad. Vanderpump staunchly denied the accusations, and following a screaming match between the women, she kicked Richards’ out of her home.
“I know Kyle did the right thing,” Jayne continued. “She felt terrible. She felt very hurt. This is someone that she has had a long work relationship and a personal friendship with. She loves Lisa and Ken very much, but this had to be done.”
Vanderpump hasn’t spoken to Richards and several other cast members since the pair’s showdown. It is also still unclear whether the reality star will appear at the Season 9 reunion, which is usually where the cast clears the air and settles their differences. However, Jayne didn’t believe Vanderpump had a desire to make things right with the cast.
“I don’t know that she cares to come back or that she cares to be friends with any of us, some of us, none of us,” she said."

Sport has historically played an important role in all societies, be it in the form of competitive sport, physical activity or play. But one may wonder: what does sport have to do with the United Nations? In fact, sport presents a natural partnership for the United Nations (UN) system. Sport as a Fundamental Right
The right of access to, and participation in, sport and play has long been recognised in a number of international conventions. In 1978, UNESCO described sport and physical education as a ""fundamental right for all."" But until today, the right to play and sport has too often been ignored or disrespected. Sport as a Powerful Tool
Sport is a powerful tool to strengthen social ties and networks, and to promote ideals of peace, fraternity, solidarity, non-violence, tolerance and justice. Sport and Peace
Sport as a universal language can be a powerful tool to promote peace, tolerance and understanding by bringing people together across boundaries, cultures and religions. Its intrinsic values such as teamwork, fairness, discipline, respect for the opponent and the rules of the game are understood all over the world and can be harnessed in the advancement of solidarity, social cohesion and peaceful coexistence.
Sport programmes permit encounters on neutral territory and in an environment where aggression can be controlled, regulated and transformed and hence facilitates rapprochement and reconciliation between opposing parties.
Although sport alone cannot stop or solve an acute conflict, it represents a flexible and cost-effective medium for post-conflict relief work and peace building as well as conflict prevention. Sport and Sustainable Development
Sport has proven to be a cost-effective and flexible tool in promoting peace and development objectives. Since the inception of the MDGs in 2000, sport has played a vital role in enhancing each of the eight goals, a fact which has been recognized in numerous Resolutions of the General Assembly. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sport’s role for social progress is further acknowledged: "" Sport is also an important enabler of sustainable development. We recognize the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace in its promotion of tolerance and respect and the contributions it makes to the empowerment of women and of young people, individuals and communities as well as to health, education and social inclusion objectives. "" Sport encourages: Health promotion and disease prevention The promotion of gender equality Social integration and the development of social capital Peace building and conflict prevention/resolution Post-disaster/trauma relief and normalisation of life Economic development"

PROVIDENCE — If anyone was going to lead Providence College out of the woods after they lost their way early in their NCAA East Regional game against Minnesota State last weekend, it was Kasper Bjorkqvist.
“I’m not surprised that he’s the one that got them back on track,’’ said Urho Vaakanainen of the Providence Bruins, Boston’s first-round draft pick in 2017.
“He’s always been a leader. He’s very vocal in the locker room. Outside the rink, he’s very energetic. Smiles a lot. He’s a natural-born leader,’’ said Vaakanainen, a friend and teammate of Bjorkvist back home in Finland.
After PC roared back from three goals down to beat Minnesota State, 6-3, Friar coach Nate Leaman credited Bjorkqvist for doing what good captains do -- taking control of the locker room at the end of a rocky first period in the biggest game of the season.
“Kasper ran the room,’’ said Leaman.
The epic comeback that followed always will be remembered in the annals of PC hockey, all the more so if the Friars go on to win the national championship in Buffalo this week.
Teams don’t reach the Frozen Four without great leadership. PC’s 2015 national championship team had extraordinary leaders to lean on in players like Ross Mauermann, Noel Acciari and Tom Parisi. The current team has an excellent group in Bjorkqvist and Jacob Bryson as captains and Vinny Desharnais as assistant captain.
Bjorkqvist was happy to be recognized by his coach, but was quick to point out that he had help.
“It wasn’t an individual thing. It was kind of a collective, older guys speech,’’ Bjorkqvist said.
“With the story of our year this year, we’d been in that spot (trailing by multiple goals) earlier. We talked about the unique situation it is to play in this tournament and the fact that’s we’ve been there before,’’ he said.
According to Josh Wilkins, who scored a big power play goal to bring the Friars to within 3-1 before the end of that opening period, Bryson reminded the players to stick with the game plan.
“Obviously, we went down against Boston College twice. Jacob (Bryson) was just, like, we’ve been here before. Don’t panic. Keep chipping at it. Keep playing our game,’ “ said Wilkins, Bjorkqvist’s linemate along with Jack Dugan.
They did exactly that when the puck dropped in the second period, cutting the deficit to one on a goal by Vimal Sukumaran and then tying it on Bjorkqvist’s power play goal before pulling away with three more goals in the third period.
The next day they extended their consecutive goal streak to 10 in a 4-0 win over Cornell. Now they’re on to Buffalo. Bjorkqvist sat out the third period with an upper-body injury but is expected to be good to go against Minnesota Duluth on Thursday.
Bjorkqvist recalled a lesson learned from last season’s captain, Brian Pinho, now playing for Hershey of the AHL.
“He talked about earning your luck. The thing was, we didn’t play good in the first period, but we knew we’d earn our luck, we’d earn the power play by working hard,’’ Bjorkqvist said.
“We weren’t trying to win the game in the second period, even though we got it tied. We had 40 minutes to get back. Play good hockey and the result will come.
“We made a pact and agreed that it had to come from inside that locker room, those 25 guys. That was the main thing. Let’s just make sure we do it for each other.’’
Bjorkqvist is the first Finn to play for the Friars. Scott Borek, now the head coach at Merrimack, flew to Finland to recruit him.
“Instantly, he made an impact, not only on me but on my parents. That started the whole thing. Then I came over and visited. I came here, Denver, UMass Lowell and UConn. I toured (PC) with Coach (Kris) Mayotte. I fell in love with the place and with the people here,’’ he said.
“It was a group effort, different from many other places where you talk to one guy recruiting you and then maybe the head coach talks to you briefly. Here it was spending a lot of time with all the coaches.’’
Bjorkqvist, 21, was drafted in the second round by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016. In its Future Watch edition this week, The Hockey News list him as the Pens’ No. 1 prospect. After the season, he is likely to give up his senior year to sign an NHL contract.
First, however, the Friars have business in Buffalo. And if they find themselves in a situation where something needs to be said, Bjorkqvist will say it.
“He’s always fired up,’’ said Wilkins."

“Killing Eve,” returns Sunday at 8 p.m., simulcast on AMC and BBC America
What’s a little gut-stab between girlfriends? This is me being facetious, of course, because international assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) and MI5 agent Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh) aren’t in a relationship. Technically. Advertisement:
In a real way they are fascinated, obsessed, and somewhat unnaturally drawn on one another, moths to each other's fire. But as season 2 of “Killing Eve” kicks off, the strange love and bloodlust these women have for one another appears to be taking a new shape, as a person would expect when what initially looked like a carnal consummation of their bizarre obsession transforms, suddenly and bloodily, into violence.
Between the first and second seasons of this series the popularity of “Killing Eve” has blasted off, thanks to Oh’s multiple award nominations and Golden Globe win for Best Actress in a TV drama. And her performance is just as taut, frantic and comedically solid in the opening pair of episodes sent to critics for review as it was last season.
Having said that, if there’s any justice in the world these new episodes should also bring much deserved attention to Comer’s performance as Villanelle. Her fashion-obsessed killer played the role of the childlike gamine in season 1 but in these new episodes radiates the internalized effects of the wounds to her midriff and her heart in shocking ways.
Comer makes her even more chilly and tosses in an additional dose of psychotic snarl in these new episodes while maintaining Villanelle’s off-putting yet entrancing sweetness. This lends a new urgency to the next act in this spy-hunts-assassin game, which I won’t spoil beyond stating the obvious: if you’re going to knife a psychopath, it’s probably wise to finish the job.
“Killing Eve” is not a story about good choices, but a tale of compulsion – one that its very busy creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, has passed into the hands of new showrunner Emerald Fennell in order to helm other projects, including a second season of “Fleabag” for Amazon.
Ordinarily that might give enamored viewers reason worry about a decline in quality, but Fennell and Waller-Bridge are apparently close friends in real life. And the fact that the humor and tension flows seamlessly from the first season finale into the second season premiere, which picks up mere moments after Eve’s failed coup de grace, is a good sign that Fennell is up to the job of keeping the deadly mission on task. Advertisement:
And it is still very much a thriller with a feminist bent, on display in the most unexpected moments. While she’s in the hospital, a boy asks Villanelle what happened to her, and when she tells him she was stabbed, he expresses shock – but even more when she reveals her assailant was a woman.
""Women don't stab,"" the youngster says with all the confidence of a kid who has been taught early where the boundaries of gender exist. Villanelle, too, is aware of how early those lessons are hardwired into people, and uses those expectations to her advantage. Instead of correcting the boy, she simply agrees. ""I know,"" she replies, and with a somewhat dreamy, slightly crazed look in her eye, adds, ""It surprised me, too.""
When it comes to affairs of the heart, you never can tell what will happen. From what I’ve seen, however, there’s no reason for the audience to break things off now. * * *
“A Discovery of Witches,” premieres Sunday at 9 p.m., AMC and BBC America
Proving we have yet to hit our saturation point when it comes to sorcerer tales, this U.K. series was so successful in its AMC streaming services premiere that the network is launching it in broadcast on the heels of the “Killing Eve” season premiere. Advertisement:
This is another literary adaptation about supernatural adventures in the real world, this time from author Deborah Harkness, and starring a veritable all-star line-up of British and Aussie Actors We Like Watching on TV, including Matthew Goode, Teresa Palmer, Alex Kingston and Owen Teale. And it’s not just witch adventures to be featured in this weird love story, either. This world also has demons and vampires, along with a whole lot of lovely architecture. It’s one of two witch-related debuts as of late; new episodes of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” dropped on Netflix Friday. * * *
“Native Son,” premieres Saturday at 10 p.m, HBO
Richard Wright’s classic novel has been adapted as a motion picture twice — once in 1951, and again in 1986, and with Oprah Winfrey in the cast. Neither captures the singular power of the 1940 literary tragedy showing the fall of Bigger Thomas, a young man growing up in grinding poverty who Wright posits is destined to be consumed by violence and criminality. Wright’s novel was seen as controversial for its time, and would eventually be reappraised by James Baldwin, who took issue with Bigger’s stereotypical crimes that spur the plot through its three parts: Fear, Flight and Fate. Advertisement:
Visual artist Rashid Johnson takes Baldwin’s critiques into account in this new adaptation, using a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks and starring Ashton Sanders (“Moonlight”) as a modern version of Bigger, a young man who dresses in the armor of punk rock — hair dyed green, spiked collar around his neck, leather jacket covered in slogans — in part as a cover for his aimlessness.
Bigger works as a bike messenger and courts Bessie (Kiki Layne), but can’t help hide his wandering attention. But when the man dating Bigger’s widowed mother (Sanaa Lathan) gets him hired as the driver for rich businessman Will Dalton (Bill Camp), he takes his opportunity seriously.
His ignited ambitious fails to take into account the recklessness of Dalton’s daughter Mary (Margaret Qualley), a party girl who is also trying on rebellion as a fashion statement. Mary is fascinated by Bigger, an African-American man close to her age — not as a peer but as an accessory and guide into places she would not dare venture alone. Advertisement:
If you know what happens in the novel, you know this friendship goes badly. Johnson and Parks adopt a different tactic than Wright, excising elements of the story that affirm some of the worst tropes about black rage and violence and changing the ending to one more fitting of 2019.
Driving this new “Native Son” is Johnson’s stunning collage of images and references, subtle but noticeable to the greats of African-American literature. The opening image frames a shot of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” on Bigger’s bed, right next to a gun. Much later a voiceover quotes W.E.B. DuBois’ observations about double consciousness — a term that originated in an essay titled “The Strivings of the Negro People.”
Sanders cloaks his performance in this idea above all, presenting Bigger not as an out-of-control anti-hero but a young man desperately attempting to figure out where he fits in the world. And if Johnson loads “Native Son” with symbolic imagery that has multiple meanings, Sanders filters that meaning into every expression and every line of dialogue.
For example, the young rebel wears a t-shirt from the Detroit hardcore band Death, and is seen yearning for a rare pressing of a 7-inch vinyl single of the band hanging on the wall of his favorite music store. There’s the obvious portent in that word, of course. Advertisement:
There’s also the inference of what the band itself stands for: Death never received the mainstream exposure of Motor City brethren like The Stooges, because in 1974, the band refused Clive Davis’ request to change its name into something with more commercial appeal. Death aspired to greatness but smashed against the reality of the world’s fears — just like Bigger.
Such small ribbons of history make this adaptation of “Native Son” more than a success — it’s transcendent. * * *
“The Chi,” returns Sunday at 10 p.m., Showtime
Lena Waithe’s series built a vision of Chicago in its first season that was poignant, funny, bright and tragic, often in a single hour. This new season picks up where the first departed, with new showrunner Ayanna Floyd Davis, who lived in the city, replacing Elwood Reid. Advertisement:
And through her we live these characters struggling and striving, and watch ambitions realized and painfully thwarted in ways that boldly expand on the stories established in the first season. In part this seems to be an effort to compensate for a few departures, primarily (and noticeably) Sonja Sohn.
But this gives room for other performances to stretch and grow, mainly Jason Mitchell’s entrepreneurial chef Brandon and Tiffany Boone as his supportive girlfriend Jerrika, along with Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine’s Ronnie, an addict who confesses to the murder of Brandon’s younger brother and finds solace in the structure of prison.
Once again Alex Hibbert’s Kevin and his fellow middle schoolers provide the bulk of the comic relief, which is necessary, given season 2’s quiet but ever-creeping adversary, gentrification. “The Chi” draws its power from methodically examining the separate and intertwined relationships in the community it features, and this produces a few hours that move more slowly than others. But the first hour of the new season had enough meat to it to prove this series retains its worth. Melanie McFarland MORE FROM Melanie McFarland • FOLLOW McTelevision Related Topics"
"Amy Adams probably will win her Oscar for ""Hillbilly Elegy"" and that's a damn shame",www.salon.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/06/amy-adams-probably-will-win-her-oscar-for-hillbilly-elegy-and-thats-a-damn-shame/,"Amy Adams (Getty/Frazer Harrison) Amy Adams probably will win her Oscar for ""Hillbilly Elegy"" and that's a damn shame Knowing the Academy, Ron Howard's Netflix adaptation of J.D. Vance's facile ""culture in crisis"" book is a sure bet -- Your message has been sent successfully Send email to: Check out this article! https://www.salon.com/2019/04/06/amy-adams-probably-will-win-her-oscar-for-hillbilly-elegy-and-thats-a-damn-shame/ Send Erin Keane April 6, 2019 5:00PM (UTC)
Variety reported Thursday that perennial Academy Award nominee Amy Adams has been tapped to star in the film adaptation of J.D. Vance's memoir "" Hillbilly Elegy ."" Netflix secured the Ron Howard project in a $45 million deal , a sum that would fund an actual Appalachian film and media institute for a couple of decades at least. The film, as described by Variety, promises to be ""a modern exploration of the American dream"" that ""follows three generations of an Appalachian family as told by its youngest member, a Yale law student forced to return to his hometown."" (The word ""forced"" is doing a lot of work in that logline.)
For the incredibly talented Adams, the role (which at press time was still unconfirmed by her reps) is being hailed as a possible clincher for her most elusive triumph to date. Vanity Fair is just asking, ""will this be the role that nabs her that Oscar?"" Meanwhile, Vulture goes all-in on the project's Oscar-bait potential: ""Appalachia! Ron Howard! Three generations!"" Advertisement:
Awards prognosticators are not wrong about the chances for a ""Hillbilly Elegy"" directed by Ron Howard and starring Amy Adams. (Vance is an executive producer). Given what we know about how Hollywood power players feel about myopic, self-congratulatory narratives that affirm their own delusions of progressiveness , Adams might as well start practicing her acceptance speech now: I'd like to thank the Academy, my agent and Roseanne Barr for getting fired and creating a Trump Voter Whisperer vacuum in the entertainment landscape.
Vance's book, you might remember, became a runaway bestseller in 2016 when the intelligentsia, liberal and conservative alike, went looking for narratives to help them understand the vexing ""white working-class Trump voter"" of their nightmares — what they imagined to be impoverished, uneducated, drug-addled hicks mesmerized by a grotesque huckster, ignoramuses who can't help but vote against their own best interests — in an effort to avoid thinking about the vexing Trump voters in their own families, country clubs, alumni associations, and board rooms. Vance's memoir, packaged as it was as a magical two-fer — ""a memoir of a family and culture in crisis""— promised authentic answers from a sympathetic source, a venture capitalist with a degree from Yale.
That Vance's book only really delivers on half of its claim did not seem to be a problem for its intended audience, let alone the national media, suckered as they were by Vance's personal story into allowing him to present shallow research and bog-standard conservative personal-responsibility talking points about poverty, addiction, and education as rarified truth.
The family part of the memoir, while lacking in depth at times, is at least sincerely wrought, with Vance trying to square his own current life as a member of the so-called elite with his humble origins, growing up in a small Ohio town of limited opportunity from a family with Eastern Kentucky roots whose three generations included in the film are marked by addiction, domestic violence, and their attendant dysfunctions. His depiction of life as the child of an addict is heartbreaking, and heartbreakingly familiar for so many. And when he arrives at Yale Law, his eye-opening induction into the world of privilege is full of insight germane to the current conversation about elite school admissions, even if Vance ultimately returns no meaningful criticism of the Ivy League system, choosing to buy in rather than question the status quo.
Which leads to the second promise. To read ""Hillbilly Elegy"" front to back and still believe Vance has much of anything helpful, let alone insightful or scholarly, to say about a so-called ""culture in crisis"" — whether that's supposed to mean post-industrial Ohio, or Appalachian Eastern Kentucky, or some magical hand-waving that lumps together all of those ""flyover"" spaces full of poor white people with their pill addictions and economic decline — requires a level of disbelief-suspension bordering on the fantastical. Then again, Vanessa Taylor, who co-wrote the Best Picture winner ""The Shape of Water"" with Guillermo del Toro, is writing the screenplay. It's probably not crazy to assume that in the minds of Netflix execs and Academy voters, a story about a fish man or a three-dimensional Appalachian character require similar stretches of imagination.
Vance's framing of his story tells people who don't know much about Eastern Kentucky or Appalachia what they think they already know: that the addiction and abuse and poverty that shaped his family are part of a stubbornly ingrained cultural lineage passed down through generations, and that's what keeps the people of Appalachia (a very large geographical area, mind you) poor and under-educated, even lawless and violent. And what's more, largely content to stay that way despite their anger, though exceptional individuals can overcome these innate cultural deficits. His overarching themes point to an attitude adjustment as the solution: poor people wouldn't have to stay poor, with all the social problems that can accompany poverty, if they could decide they didn't want to act like poor people anymore. Advertisement:
This only sounds like a narrative that would turn off Liberal Hollywood if you haven't been paying attention. As historian Elizabeth Catte, who wrote "" What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia "" partly in response to the eagerness with which an educated and affluent liberal audience embraced Vance's story, told me last year , "" They don’t understand, or perhaps they do and they dismiss it, but blaming poverty on poor people is a political opinion. These are people that would be mortified if they had to teach something out of Charles Murray’s bibliography , but they really love 'Hillbilly Elegy' and what it says about the poor.""
Catte is far from alone in her reaction to Vance and his book. West Virginia University Press published an entire anthology of responses, most of them pushing back against the long shadow Vance has cast across the region, in "" Appalachian Reckoning "" earlier this year. And existing wholly outside of the ""Hillbilly Elegy"" conversation is an entire cohort of dazzling Appalachian talent — poets, fiction writers, memoirists, journalists, essayists, and graphic novelists — writing beautiful, complicated, conflicted, memorable stories from and about the region that add to our understanding of what it means to be Appalachian and what it means to be human in new and meaningful ways.
Framing complex systems of oppression as nothing more than a collection of individual weaknesses to explore for character development is one way to produce Oscar bait. See "" Green Book "" and ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" for recent examples of how Hollywood rewards films that reduce racism to basically a vulgar flaw that some individuals will overcome or compensate for, and some won't, depending on how high they're billed. Narratives like this sell not only because a 140-minute redemption arc can be written around them but also because they absolve their creators and viewers of any complicity in systemic issues.
Ultimately, the stories Hollywood loves rarely challenge the stories it tells itself. If the cultural, even moral, failings of poor people are what perpetuates poverty, then the inverse must also be true, and the systems that open doors easily to some and not others can go right on working in the industry's favor. The lessons ""Hillbilly Elegy"" attempts to impart — that an entire region's deeply entrenched economic justice issues are rooted in nothing more complicated than laziness and bad tempers, abetted by willful ignorance, all of which can be overcome with enough grit and exposure to the Ivy League — should play just as well with the Academy as other reductive narratives do. That's good news for Amy Adams, if she does take this role. Bad news, though, for an entire region of Americans who deserve to see their deeper stories told. Advertisement:"

In the next war between Hamas and Israel, the Israelis will have to evacuate not only their “settlements” near the border with the Gaza Strip, but also Ashdod, Ashkelon, the Negev and Tel Aviv, Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, threatened on Saturday.
He said that despite the recent ceasefire understandings with Israel, the Palestinians will continue to protest near the border with Israel.
Sinwar, who was speaking to representatives of Palestinian factions and civil society organizations in the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave, said that his movement will continue to be ready for war with Israel to “defend the Palestinian people.” Hamas, he said, will be a “shield and sword” for the Palestinians.
Sinwar said that if a war is “imposed” on the Gaza Strip, Israel will “suffer.” He added: “I pledge that the occupation will evacuate its settlements not only in the ‘Gaza Envelope,’ but also in Ashdod, the Negev, Ashkelon and even Tel Aviv. Remember this pledge. The fingers of the resistance in the Gaza Strip are on the trigger. We are today ten times stronger than we were in 2014 (a reference to the war in the Gaza Strip –Operation Protective Shield).”
Regarding the ceasefire understandings with Israel, Sinwar said that Hamas did not pay any “political price.” The understandings, he said, “have no prices or political dimensions.”
He further said that the understandings were not connected to any prisoner swap between Hamas and Israel or the issue of the weapons of Palestinian terror groups in the Gaza Strip.
“The understandings are not an alternative to Palestinian unity and partnership,” the Hamas leader explained. “There is no talk about the Palestinian right to resistance in all its forms, especially in the West Bank. Also, there is not talk about halting the March of Return.”
The March of Return is the name Palestinians use to describe the weekly protests near the border with Israel. The protests began in March 2018.
Sinwar praised Egypt for its role in “easing restrictions” imposed on the Gaza Strip.
“We have strengthened our relations with Egypt,” he said. “The Egyptians have thankfully played a big role in the easing of the restrictions.”
Hamas claims that the Egyptian-sponsored ceasefire understandings include the expansion of the fishing zone, reopening border crossings between the Gaza Strip and Israel, the delivery of additional Qatari funds, launching various humanitarian and economic projects in the coastal enclave and solving the power shortage.
The Hamas leader boasted that his movement has been successful in thwarting attempts to instigate unrest in the Gaza Strip. He was referring to recent anti-Hamas protests that erupted in various parts of the Gaza Strip to protest economic hardship. Hamas security forces used brutal force to squash the protests, arresting, beating and shooting scores of Palestinians.
“During the last year, Hamas, together with our people, has scored a number of achievements,” Sinwar said. “The most prominent achievement has been the foiling of all attempts to destabilize civil peace in the Gaza Strip.”
Hamas leaders have accused their rivals in Fatah and the Palestinian Authority of being behind the protests. They claim that the protests were part of a “conspiracy” to end the Hamas-rule in the Gaza Strip. Fatah and PA officials have dismissed the charges.
Sinwar also praised the ongoing protests near the border with Israel and said they have placed the issue of the Gaza Strip blockade on the world’s agenda. Share this:"

Right-wing, ultra-Orthodox bloc forecast to win majority in all final surveys, leaving Netanyahu well-placed to retain power, though several show Gantz’s party ahead of Likud By ALEXANDER FULBRIGHT 5 April 2019, 9:52 pm Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, and Benny Gantz, right. (Hadas Parush/Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and challenger Benny Gantz’s Blue and White were neck-and-neck in a poll released Friday evening, setting up a frantic end to election campaigns as parties worked to shore up their support before Israelis vote on April 9.
Overall, right-wing and religious parties received 66 seats in the poll, versus 54 for the center-left and Arab parties, mirroring the results of all major surveys released in recent days and again suggesting that Netanyahu will have an easier route to building a governing majority.
The survey, aired by Channel 13 news, was the last of the campaign for the 21st Knesset, with Israeli election law barring the publication of further polls after Friday.
Likud and Blue and White were dead even with 28 seats in the poll, after a survey released earlier in the week by the network gave the former a one-seat lead.
Following the two parties in the poll was the opposition Labor Party with 11 seats, similar to the total it received in other surveys this week. Labor Party leader Avi Gabbay tours the Carmel Market in Tel Aviv, on April 3, 2019, ahead of general elections for the Knesset. (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)
After Labor was the Union of Right-Wing Parties, an alliance of the national-religious Jewish Home and National Union factions with the extremist Otzma Yehudit, with seven seats.
Hadash-Ta’al, a merger of two parties from the outgoing Knesset’s Joint (Arab) List, had six seats in the poll, as did maverick former Likud lawmaker Moshe Feiglin’s Zehut, the nationalist New Right and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism.
The ultra-Orthodox Shas party and left-wing Meretz each received five seats, while Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon’s center-right Kulanu, hawkish former defense minister Avigdor Liberman’s Yisrael Beytenu and the Ra’am-Balad alliance of Arab factions each received four seats.
Asked their preference for prime minister, 46 percent of poll respondents said Netanyahu, 37% said Gantz and 17% said they did not know.
The poll was conducted for the network by pollster Camil Fuchs and included 858 respondents. The margin of error was 3.4%.
While Channel 13 had Likud and Blue and White polling even, and a pair of other polls had one or the other leading by a single seat, three separate surveys gave Gantz’s party a 4-5 seat advantage .

(Screen capture: Twitter)
In light of those results, Netanyahu issued an appeal Friday to right-wing voters to back Likud, warning it “ is in danger ” of losing its hold on power.
Encouraging voters from fellow right-wing parties to throw their support behind Likud could prove to be a risky strategy for Netanyahu, as a subsequent failure by one or more of them to clear the minimum electoral threshold could deprive the premier of a majority needed to form a ruling coalition.
Blue and White no. 2 Yair Lapid said in an interview with The Times of Israel on Thursday that if the party receives at least four seats more than Likud, it will get the first shot at putting together a government after Tuesday’s vote, a sentiment that has been echoed by Netanyahu ."
Time really is money with increasingly popular cooperative time banks,www.salon.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/06/time-really-is-money-with-increasingly-popular-cooperative-time-banks_partner/,"(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (AP) Time really is money with increasingly popular cooperative time banks Cooperative software is making time banking easier and more widespread -- Your message has been sent successfully Send email to: Check out this article! https://www.salon.com/2019/04/06/time-really-is-money-with-increasingly-popular-cooperative-time-banks_partner/ Send April 6, 2019 6:00PM (UTC) This article was produced by Local Peace Economy , a project of the Independent Media Institute.
Jennie Weakley is a time bank enthusiast with Unity in Our Community TimeBank in Southwest Detroit. For nearly 10 years, she’s used time banking to get the windows of her home washed and her house deep cleaned, in addition to babysitting, pet sitting, and house sitting. She gives a lot of transportation to the time bank (including rides to the airport), organizes multicultural cooking classes, and does local event support, such as ticket taking.
In a time bank, all these things add up. You see, time banking is a system whereby everyone’s time is the same. For example, you can give an hour of childcare, and you now have an hour in your time bank. You can then spend that hour on a mechanic to rotate the tires on your car. The exchange value is in time, but it’s not in the same moment, or even with the same person. In this example, the mechanic just earned an hour of time to spend—perhaps on someone to mow their lawn. Advertisement:
This time is traded throughout a local time banking community, or even throughout the country: For example, you find yourself in another city and need a ride to the airport. You could spend your time banked in your hometown on a ride in the city you’re visiting.
These transactions are handled digitally, through a cooperative software called hOurworld . Created by three visionaries in Portland, Maine, in 2010, they capitalize the O because the software is for “Our World” and open to the ideas of everyone in the hOurworld time banking system.
Think of it as online banking, without the hassles of money or direct deposit: You replenish and spend based on the time you give and receive.
The software counts over 44,000 “members” around the world, participating in 547 different time banks. Some of these time banks are new, and some have been around for more than 20 years. In aggregate, their members have provided 2.3 million hours of service through the hOurworld platform. The number of time banks using the software has more than doubled in the last five years.
Stephen Beckett, the coder of the hOurworld software, says time banking is simply providing those in your time banking community a friendly, neighborly favor. “I come over and shovel the snow in your driveway. I mark down in my account that I did an hour of service. In your account it shows you owe an hour. But you’re not bound to it. Nothing is given in consideration for anything else. We’re simply accounting for the time that we spend essentially volunteering the time that we have to help our neighbors.”
The problem, says hOurworld co-founder Terry Daniels, is that people get so into the groove of helping their neighbors that they neglect to record their hours. Often, as people in the time bank get to know each other, the “transactions” don’t get recorded—it just becomes people helping other people in their community. Advertisement:
The top services people are spending their time giving and receiving vary from time bank to time bank, but most include the hours of volunteer time to make the time bank run smoothly, including managing meetings, orientations, printing promotional and informational materials and website updates. Youth and elder care, arts and crafts, transportation, construction, home repair and yard care are all common. Each time bank is unique, and some, like the Portland, Maine, time bank, even offer sailing and kayaking.
Each time bank has a service list members can post to—what they are offering or what they need.
The two largest time banks in the hOurworld system are ArchCare in New York City with over 2,200 members and Partners in Care . Both support aging populations, giving the elderly ways to contribute to their communities, and providing them with the support they need to live more independent lives. Other large time banks thrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Los Angeles, Detroit, Clearwater, Louisville, and Milwaukee.
The software is available for use by time banks for free, because the cooperative didn’t think it was right to charge people who were trying to avoid money transactions. Some time banks that are able to collect money do pay the cooperative in order to help cover the cost of the servers and updates. It is otherwise free to implement and use, in recognition that most time banks are about trading in time, not money. Advertisement:
Unity in Our Community is a part of the Michigan Alliance of TimeBanks, and together the different groups made the decision to implement hOurworld software in 2011. Today, most time banks in the country use hOurworld, enabling nationwide trade among thousands of people.
“It’s beautiful we have the ability to create our own currency,” says Daniels. “Everyone’s time is equal. It’s recognizing someone’s life energy as equal to your own. Historically, we come from groups of 150 people that had an economy of reciprocity. This is an ode to that vibration of equality and community.”
While the hOurworld software facilitates time banking nationwide, Daniels says time banking is more about relationships, and asking yourself, “What do you want to get and what do you want to give?” Advertisement:
In addition, exchanging hours in this way can also be a part of a larger divestment strategy, and can lead to a shift in consciousness about time. “There’s magic,” in it, he says. “That’s why we do this.” Valerie Vande Panne

"A blow but not fatal: 9 months after Janus, AFSCME reports 94% retention",www.salon.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/06/a-blow-but-not-fatal-9-months-after-janus-afscme-reports-94-retention_partner/,"This article originally appeared in In These Times . ""
The labor union in the crosshairs of the right wing-led effort to gut public sector unions through a landmark Supreme Court case released new membership data Wednesday showing a decline that experts say could mark the beginning of larger losses, but is far shy of a fatal blow.
The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) reported a 6 percent loss last year, down from 1,411,877 members, agency fee payers and retirees in 2017 to 1,329,594 in 2018. Advertisement:
The numbers offer the first concrete picture of the preliminary fallout from last year’s Janus v. AFSCME decision that eliminated public sector unions’ ability to collect agency fees—also known as “fair share” dues—from workers who do not sign up for full membership in the union but still benefit from its representation.
Many predicted the case, bankrolled by a network of conservative billionaires and think tanks , could put the nail in the coffin of public sector unions by encouraging workers to opt out of paying dues in favor of becoming “free riders.”
AFSCME’s numbers, part of its annual Department of Labor filing, show one of the largest public sector unions has managed to dodge a worst case scenario in the immediate wake of Janus , due in no small part to its preparation for the decision, which focused on retaining rank-and-file members.
Since unions braced for revenues from agency fee-payers to evaporate when the Janus decision came down, a 6 percent decline in membership—less than the total number of “fair share” workers AFSCME represented last year—was an anticipated loss.
However, AFSCME's member sign-ups since the Janus decision outpace member opt-outs at a rate of 8 to 1. The union reported an increase of 18,638 dues-paying retirees and 9,097 dues-paying members, though it is not clear whether those members are new hires or former fee-payers who got on board as full members.
AFSCME previously told ""In These Times"" that nearly 200,000 fee-payers joined as full union members ahead of the Janus decision as part of a one-on-one union-building strategy it says marked a “major culture shift.” In 2017, 112,233 of the 1,411,877 workers it represented were “fair share” fee-payers. Advertisement:
“In overwhelming numbers, AFSCME members have blunted the attacks of the wealthy special interests and chose to stick with their union,” AFSCME president, Lee Saunders, said in a statement Wednesday.
But experts Robert Bruno and Frank Manzo, who released a report forecasting the impacts of Janus ahead of the Supreme Court decision last year , warned that AFSCME’s preliminary 6 percent membership decline could still put the union on track to suffer the losses their research projected.
“A loss of 82,000 is nothing to brush aside,” Manzo, policy director of the Illinois Economic Policy Institute, told ""In These Times.""
“These data show that public sector union membership has dropped, and they suggest that it may be on track to decline dramatically over time,” he said. “But, they also show that the labor movement can take concrete steps to avoid that fate.” Advertisement:
In their report, Manzo and Bruno predicted a loss over three to five years of 726,000 members in unions representing state and local government employees—and a 3.6 percent drop in wages. They see AFSCME’s membership contraction, representing 11 percent of their total forecast for the sector, as consistent with their long-term outlook.
Manzo said that while the labor movement should be “encouraged” by AFSCME’s 94 percent retention rate, it should also be “concerned” about the losses, noting that reduced organizing budgets could have a “cascading effect” in years to come. “The union needs to take steps, and frankly policymakers should consider taking steps, to correct that loss,” he said. For now, AFSCME plans to expand its organizing resources.
The membership data comes on the heels of an onslaught of well-funded right-wing efforts targeting public sector union members with opt-out campaigns in attempts to chip away at membership in the wake of Janus. Advertisement:
“This has to be measured against the resources that have been marshaled by anti-worker, anti-union organizations,” Robert Bruno, professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Labor and Employment Relations, told ""In These Times"" of AFSCME’s membership levels. Despite the net loss, unions’ ability to attract members—whether by converting former fee-payers or recruiting new hires—while facing aggressive anti-union campaigns is notable, Bruno said.
An AFSCME representative told ""In These Times"" the reduction represents the loss of former agency fee-payers. However, the national data doesn’t offer a detailed picture of who is opting out, including a break down of which of the 23 states where agency fees were previously allowed are bearing the brunt of the losses, or if any workers who previously paid full membership dues have deserted.
Many variables could still shape the way Janus plays out in the long-term, including legislation to mitigate the impacts, as well as any further court decisions that could imperil the future of public-sector unions. Advertisement:
Since Janus , conservatives in a number of states have launched efforts to force unions to pay back agency fees collected prior to the decision, which could defund these unions. So far, such efforts have fallen flat in Alaska, California, Illinois, Ohio, Oregon and Washington.
But Moshe Marvit, a fellow at the Century Foundation, warned the threat of these lawsuits “could be seriously damaging” despite their “dubious” arguments. “The theory in Janus never won before any judges, before it won at the Supreme Court,” he told ""In These Times.""
Meanwhile, the Buckeye Institute—part of the State Policy Network of anti-union groups that funded Janus— has filed three cases taking aim at exclusive union representation. Janus allows union members to opt out of membership and paying dues, but the union still has a duty to represent all workers in the bargaining unit. The lawsuits, filed in Maine, Minnesota and Ohio, argue that automatic representation violates workers’ First Amendment rights.
Last month, an appeals court rejected a similar challenge to exclusive representation brought by the Freedom Foundation and National Right to Work Foundation in Washington, finding union representation did not infringe on free speech rights. Advertisement:
Marvit dubbed these lawsuits a kind of “bait and switch” after Janus as anti-union interests seek new ways to “use the First Amendment to limit membership and limit funding of unions.” The Janus decision scrapped agency fees while keeping exclusive representation intact, finding the two “are not inextricably linked.” But Marvit doubted the Supreme Court would offer “any principled consistency other than a sort of anti-union animus” if it came to ruling on exclusive representation.
Increasing union movement-building and education will likely continue to be important responses amid anti-union hostility. This is especially true considering the unfavorable Supreme Court landscape facing union supporters hoping to undo Janus through litigation.
Marvit said that the free speech in logic in the Janus ruling—claiming that agency fees compel speech and violate the First Amendment—could create space for litigation aimed at carving out pro-union rights, though he admitted this would be an “uphill battle.”
“Unions for a long time in litigation have been on the defensive,” he said.” This has opened up and triggered a new desire to go on the offensive with lawsuits and see in what ways it can lead to an expansion of actual free speech, not just money as speech in the way that Janus did.” Advertisement:
But even as the right-wing groups behind Janus seek to smear public sector unions as unfairly dipping into workers’ pockets, approval ratings of labor unions are the highest they have been in 15 years, according to Gallup.
Ken Jacobs, chair of the Labor Center at the University of California Berkeley, told In These Times that Janus has coincided with a “huge shift” in public opinion toward the labor movement, boosted in part by the recent wave of historic teacher strikes. The recent government shutdown also offered “a reminder of what public workers do and how important they are,” he said.
Jacobs added that while it is still early to assess the impacts of Janus , how unions prioritize resources as they tighten their belts to adapt to the financial fallout from Janus will play a key role in defining their long-term capacity to withstand such an existential threat.
“One of the important things we have seen is a real increase in union activity in the public sector, especially among teachers,” Jacobs said. “That deep worker engagement will be essential for public sector unions going forward.” Advertisement:"
What Is Behind the Opposition to Peace with Israel?,warsclerotic.com,Peter Hofman,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://warsclerotic.com/2019/04/06/what-is-behind-the-opposition-to-peace-with-israel/,"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14020/opposition-peace-israel The anti-Israel campaign in the Arab and Islamic world sees peace with Israel — and not failed leadership, bad economic policies and corruption — as the biggest threat to Arabs and Muslims. Recognizing Israel’s right to exit is also seen by many Arabs and Muslims as a humiliation to their values, their culture, their political power and their economic traditions. They seem concerned that Arabs and Muslims might wake up one morning and start demanding freedom of expression and free and democratic elections like the ones held every few years in Israel. The anti-peace camp seems to want its people to continue living in misery and under dictatorships, so that it is easier to recruit people to jihad against Israel and the West. Also, if people are lifted from poverty and misery and begin to enjoy the fruits of modern civilization, there is a chance that Arabs and Muslims will move away from Islam and even start endorsing the inadmissible values of the West. The Trump administration will soon discover what every child in the Arab and Islamic world already knows: that the Israeli-Arab conflict is not about a settlement or a checkpoint or a security fence, but about Israel’s very right to exist in the Middle East. The Trump administration will also learn that peace with Israel is seen by many Arabs and Muslims as nothing but an unacceptable threat that must at all costs be stopped. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is often described by Western media and officials as “moderate” and “pragmatic,” last year quoted Egyptian intellectual Abdel-Wahab El-Messiri, saying Israel “constitutes a colonialist enterprise that has nothing to do with Judaism,” and adding that Europeans wanted “to transfer the Jews” to the Middle East because “they wanted this region to become an advanced post to protect the interests and the convoys coming from Europe to the East.” (Image source: MEMRI video screenshot)
Peace with Israel is purportedly a form of surrender and submission that will harm the dignity of Arabs and Muslims.
This is the theme of a massive campaign being waged by Palestinians and other Arabs in preparation for the announcement of the US administration’s plan for peace in the Middle East, also known as the “deal of the century.” The plan, according to US officials, is expected to be announced sometime after the general elections in Israel, slated for April 9.
The latest campaign is designed to thwart the “deal of the century” and terrorize Arabs and Muslims who may wish to accept the US administration’s peace plan.
As part of an effort to raise awareness to the dangers of the “deal of the century,” an increasing number of Palestinians and Arabs are now trying to explain to their people why peace and normalization of ties with Israel is totally unacceptable.
The latest effort came in the form of an online campaign called “The International Anti-Normalization Campaign.”
The organizers of the campaign say they are worried that some Arab states and leaders may cooperate with the “deal of the century.” They are concerned because they see that some Arab states and leaders are already engaged in various forms of normalization with Israel.
The campaign clearly aims to send a warning not only to ordinary Arabs and Muslims, but also to their leaders, about the “dangerous repercussions” of making peace with Israel.
According to the organizers of the anti-peace campaign, “normalization [with Israel] is the miserable outcome of a culture of surrender and submission”— and concessions and peace are only shameful and degrading.
For them, the words peace and compromise (with Israel) seem associated with extremely negative connotations such as retreat, defeat and surrender.
Recognizing Israel’s right to exit is also seen by many Arabs and Muslims as a humiliation to their values, their culture, their political power and their economic traditions. They have been educated to see Israel as an alien body and a “colonial project” planted in the Middle East by Western powers. They therefore cannot accept the presence of Jews — in what they regard as their own sovereign state — on lands they believe belong solely to Muslims .
Even Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is often described by Western media outlets and officials as a “moderate” and “pragmatic” Arab leader, shares the view that Israel is nothing but a “colonial project.” In a speech before PLO delegates in Ramallah last year, Abbas quoted Egyptian intellectual Abdel-Wahab El-Messiri, saying:
“The functional nature of Israel means that it was evoked by colonialism in order to fulfill a specific function, and thus it constitutes a colonialist enterprise that has nothing to do with Judaism.”
Abbas added :
“[Oliver Cromwell] came up with the idea of transferring the Jews from Europe to the Middle East… because they wanted this region to become an advanced post to protect the interests and the convoys coming from Europe to the East… He asked Holland, which owned the largest fleet in the world, to transfer the Jews, but the project was unsuccessful. This was in 1653.”
In the past year, Abbas has also repeatedly announced his rejection of the unseen “deal of the century.” He has referred to the plan as a “conspiracy” and the “slap of the century.” How then can he turn to his people and suddenly accept it — or any deal that might recognize Israel’s right to exist?
“Normalization [with Israel] is tantamount to defeat,” explained Mohammed al-Adloni, secretary-general of an anti-Israel group, “The International Coalition for Supporting Jerusalem and Palestine.”
He went on to warn that making peace or normalizing ties with Israel would constitute a threat to the “consciousness” of Arabs and Muslims. Making peace with Israel, al-Adloni said , would be like “a complete occupation of the consciousness [of Arabs and Muslims].”
Al-Adloni and other anti-Israel activists in the Arab and Islamic countries appear worried that, should they make peace with the “Zionist entity,” their people might be exposed to democratic values and freedom of expression. They seem concerned that Arabs and Muslims wake up one morning and start demanding free and democratic elections like the ones held every few years in Israel.
The anti-peace camp in the Arab and Islamic world appears not to want its people exposed to advanced Israeli technology, including medical care. This camp seems to want its people to continue living in misery and under dictatorships, so that it is easier to recruit people to jihad against Israel and the West. Also, if people are lifted from poverty and misery, and their living conditions are improved so they begin to enjoy the fruits of modern civilization, there is a chance that Arabs and Muslims will move away from Islam and even start endorsing the inadmissible values of the West.
This camp, extremists, seem not to care about lowering the high rate of unemployment among Arabs and Muslims, improving the living conditions of its people or offering young Arabs and Muslims hope for a better future. They seem instead to want their people to continue living in misery so that their anger, again, can be directed more easily towards Israel and the West.
The anti-Israel campaign in the Arab and Islamic world sees peace with Israel — and not failed leadership, bad economic policies and corruption — as the biggest threat to Arabs and Muslims. The message that the anti-peace activists are sending to their people says: “Peace with Israel is the worst thing that could happen to us Arabs and Muslims because these Jews will invade our minds and our culture.”
Yasser Qadoura, who represents a Lebanon-based group called “The Popular Committee for Palestinians in the Diaspora,” says that his organization is now making a big effort to educate Arabs and Muslims about the “dangers” of peace and normalization with Israel. He said that his followers and he are planning to publish a “list of shame” containing the names of Arabs and Muslims who are caught promoting peace and normalization or trying to make peace with Israel.
Anyone whose name appears on the list will immediately be denounced by Arabs and Muslims as a “traitor.” Treason, in many of the Arab and Islamic countries, is a charge punishable by death. The “list of shame” would therefore be seen by Arabs and Muslims as a license to kill anyone who dared even to talk about peace with Israel.
Last month, a large group of Arab and Islamic activists who met in the Lebanese capital of Beirut ruled that “all forms of normalization with the Zionist entity are an act of treachery.” According to the group, an Arab or Muslim who even engages in sports, cultural and artistic activities with the “Zionist entity” would be considered a “traitor.” In the eyes of the Arab and Islamic activists, including Islamic religious leaders, anyone who plays soccer or attends a cultural event with a Jew would be condemned as a “traitor.”
If and when US President Donald J. Trump’s administration finally publishes its plan, it will discover that many Arabs and Muslims have already launched a campaign of intimidation to stop their leaders from making peace with Israel. If an Arab or Muslim child is prohibited from playing soccer with a Jew, how can the Trump administration expect the Arabs and Muslims to recognize Israel’s right to exist?
The Trump administration will soon discover what every child in the Arab and Islamic world already knows: that the Israeli-Arab conflict is not about a settlement or a checkpoint or a security fence, but about Israel’s very right to exist in the Middle East. The Trump administration will also learn that peace with Israel is seen by many Arabs and Muslims as nothing but an unacceptable threat that must at all costs be stopped.

Previously DEPORTED MS-13 Gang Member Sentenced To PRISON! - The Political Insider,thepoliticalinsider.com,Daily Caller,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thepoliticalinsider.com/previously-deported-ms-13-gang-member-sentenced-to-prison/,"Previously DEPORTED MS-13 Gang Member Sentenced To PRISON! DCwire By Daily Caller
Jason Hopkins on April 6, 2019
A judge sentenced a previously deported MS-13 gang member from El Salvador to one year in prison for illegally re-entering the U.S.
U.S. District Judge Liam O’Grady handed Fily Giovany Amaya-Martinez the sentence Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
Amaya-Martinez, a 36-year-old known member of MS-13, was deported from the U.S. in 2003 after authorities convicted him of an aggravated felony near Washington, D.C. However, he returned to the U.S. in 2009 after being charged with several murders in his home country of El Salvador.
Amaya-Martinez was able to live illegally in the U.S., undetected, for nearly a decade until an anti-gang task force discovered him in 2018.
“Amaya-Martinez fled justice in his home country and defied the laws of this country when he illegally reentered,” said Lyle Boelens, the acting field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s enforcement and removal operations in Washington, D.C. “Today’s sentencing answers his defiance. We stand with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in resolute commitment to continue to ensure that our communities are safe from dangerous criminals.”
The chief federal law enforcement officer for the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) hailed the case as an example for the need of strong immigration enforcement.
“After allegedly committing multiple murders in El Salvador, this violent MS-13 gang member fled El Salvador and illegally crossed our southern border to get back into the United States,” stated EDVA U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger.
“This case is a prime example of our need for strong borders and why this office continues to prioritize criminal immigration cases. My thanks to the dedicated anti-gang task force agents for their outstanding work on this important case, and for removing this dangerous felon from our community,” Terwilliger continued.
Amaya-Martinez’s sentencing comes as the Trump administration continues to clash with congressional Democrats over immigration and border enforcement.
The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, a five-member board that controls the House of Representatives’ general counsel, voted 3-2 along party lines Thursday to initiate a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration on the southern border. Democrats, with the help of some GOP support, had previously passed a resolution that condemned his border emergency. However, Trump vetoed the resolution and lawmakers were not able to override it.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has also asked Congress to pass a series of measures to alleviate the immigration situation, but with Democrats controlling the House, these requests are not expected to be met.

Those deaths include three bodies abandoned in a burning vehicle. The killings began just after midnight on Wednesday when firefighters received a call about an abandoned vehicle burning on a dirt road in colonia Cañón del Padre. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they discovered the badly burned corpse of an unknown victim in the back seat. Upon opening the trunk, they then discovered two more badly burned bodies, according to local media reports.
At 4:25 p.m. on Wednesday, officials called crime scene investigators from the State Attorney General’s office to colonia Francisco Zarco where the badly decomposed body of an unknown male victim was located. The body displayed signs of being exposed to fire. A few hours later, police were called to colonia El Rubí where gunmen shot a male identified as Gerardo Daniel Pérez to death inside an auto shop. At approximately 11:41 p.m., a male identified as Javier Tapia Medina was murdered by gunfire outside his home in colonia Buena Vista.
Just after midnight on Thursday morning, residents in colonia Camino Verde reported the discovery of an abandoned black plastic drum containing a package in a plastic bag. The bag was later determined to contain the corpse of a female murder victim accompanied by a threatening narco-message on a piece of cardboard.
At 1:47 a.m., officials located the body of an unknown male murder victim at the intersection of the Rosarito-Tijuana Transpeninsular highway, in colonia La Gloria. According to investigators, the victim, who had sustained multiple gunshot wounds, was wrapped in a blanket bound with tape. About two hours later, an unidentified male of approximately 25, was killed by multiple gunshot wounds in colonia ejido Francisco Villa.
At 06:05 a.m., investigators of the State Attorney General’s Office (PGJE) were summoned to the rural area of Lázaro Cárdenas ejido, where police discovered three unidentified murder victims displaying signs of trauma. Several hours later at approximately 10:30 a.m., officials found another unknown male murder victim at the edge of the Camino al Vergel bridge. The decomposed body displayed signs of violence.
At 2:30 p.m., police reported a triple homicide where they discovered two unidentified males and an unidentified female in colonia Mariano Matamoros. The three victims sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Thirty minutes later, citizens reported the discovery of a human jaw and arm which had been abandoned on a public roadway in colonia Lomas de San Antonio. Investigators could not locate the rest of the body.
In the next few hours before midnight, officials discovered four additional homicide victims in multiple locations throughout the city. This brought the total number of those murdered to 21.
A study released in March by the Citizen Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice (El Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad Pública y la Justicia Penal) listed Tijuana as the deadliest city in the world per capita, based on its 2018 registered homicide count. The bloodshed is generally related to turf wars involving Cártel Tijuana Nueva Generación (CTNG), aligned with El Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación, against the Sinaloa Cartel.
