National Review Nails Leftist Activists: 'The War on Chick-fil-A Is Chicken McCarthyism' - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/national-review-nails-leftist-activists-the-war-on-chick-fil-a-is-chicken-mccarthyism,"National Review Nails Leftist Activists: 'The War on Chick-fil-A Is Chicken McCarthyism' 04-10-2019 Steve Warren
Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review , has called out Chick-fil-A's opponents writing the recent bans from San Antonio and Buffalo's airports are not about social justice, but ""about punishing the Georgia-based company for the faith of its leadership.""
""The official bans are anti-Christian, unconstitutional and a harbinger of a larger effort to hunt down and punish any organization that has uncongenial views on sexual morality,"" Lowry writes in the April 9 op-ed .
He points to San Antonio City Councilman Roberto Treviño's explanation of why Chick-fil-A was banned. ""Everyone has a place here, and everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport,"" Treviño said. Lowry highlights how ironic this statement really is.
""The irony of discriminating against Chick-fil-A in order to demonstrate the city's famous open-ness was, of course, lost on him,"" he wrote.
Chick-fil-A's growth as the largest, fastest-growing restaurant chain in America is well-documented due to its good food and fast, friendly service.
The hostility toward the company began in 2012 after CEO Dan Cathy's statements about his personal opposition to gay marriage and revelations that his foundation contributed to conservative groups. Responding to the backlash at the time, Cathy said the company would back off the gay marriage debate and instead, focus on chicken.
Despite the company's neutrality, according to Lowry, critics still detect the ""lingering stench of Christianity"" with their chicken.
The left-wing Think Progress issued a report widely circulated in the media accusing the company of ""anti-equality"" giving. As Lowry explains this means the company donated to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (and a small Christian home for troubled young men in Vidalia, Georgia).
The editor also points out that since the Salvation Army raises about $2 billion a year, a lot of other people are guilty of the same offense.
He goes even further, writing, ""To consider all that the Salvation Army does — its thrift shops, aid for the homeless, disaster relief, anti-trafficking programs, Christmas gifts to needy children and much, much more — and reduce the organization to an allegedly anti-LGBTQ group is simply perverse."" Lowry says public officials participating in the current campaign against Chick-fil-A need to go back and read the Constitution.
""Any public official joining the punitive campaign against Chick-fil-A needs a remedial lesson in the Constitution, which forbids discrimination against private companies on the basis of political or religious viewpoint. It is the enemies of Chick-fil-A who are intolerant and out of the mainstream. They desperately need to abandon their tawdry McCarthyite crusade — and Eat Mor Chikin,"" he wrote."
Four Democratic Opponents Favor Sanders' 'Medicare for All': Others Not So Sure,www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/four-democratic-opponents-favor-sanders-medicare-for-all-others-not-so-sure,"Four Democratic Opponents Favor Sanders''Medicare for All': Others Not So Sure
On the 2020 presidential election front, Democrats are firing opening shots in a new battle over health care.
Vermont senator and White House hopeful Bernie Sander is re-launching a new bid for his plan to eliminate private health insurance in favor of a single government plan.
Even some of Sanders' Democratic opponents stepped out in support of his plan Wednesday.
The new version of the Vermont senator's ""Medicare for All"" bill quickly drew support from four other Democrats running for president.
""Health care is a human right, not a privilege,"" Sanders said.
Wednesday's unveiling presents the opening volley in a new fight.
Sen. Bernie Sander's vision -- more affordable coverage that lowers the number of uninsured Americans.
""Medicare for All is a dream, but the dream comes at a price,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn).
The safety net could prove dangerously expensive. Independent studies estimate that over 10 years the plan will cost anywhere from $25 to $35 trillion.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warns it's just the latest in a socialist bonanza.
That price is so steep that even left-leaning analysts are quietly admitting that the tax burden is virtually certain to land on the shoulders of the middle class,"" the Kentucky Republican said.
At the Sanders's liftoff party, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a rival for the presidential nomination, came out in support of the proposed health care idea.
""This has to become the next social safety net,"" she said. ""It has to become something that is there for you no matter what.""
Gillibrand is one of four Senate Democrats running for president who backs Sander's idea. ""You are creating a not-for-profit public option that is good, high-quality healthcare now,"" the New York senator said.
While some 180 million Americans would lose private health insurance under Medicare for All – all would be covered under a public plan.
""I can't imagine how we would pull them off of health care coverage that in most cases, that like other Democrats, have backed away from ""Medicare for All,"" said former Colorado Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper.
Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. ""It could be a possibility in the future.""
With even Democrats differing on how to fix health care, it's sure to be the main campaign issue from now until election day.
The White House says Republicans are working on ""realistic solutions."" President Trump says a ""really great health care plan"" will be ready right after the 2020 election."

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's Deep Faith Revealed in New Book,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalias-deep-faith-revealed-in-new-book,"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's Deep Faith Revealed in New Book
On Faith: Lessons From an American Believer is an inspiring collection of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's reflections on his own faith, on the challenges that religious believers face in modern America, and on the religious freedoms protected by the Constitution. Featuring a personal introduction by Justice Scalia's son Father Paul Scalia, this volume will enrich every reader's understanding of the legendary justice. Pat Robertson speaks with Rev. Paul Scalia and Christopher Scalia, Justice Scalia's sons, about On Faith on Thursday's 700 Club.
Antonin Scalia reflected deeply on matters of religion and shared his insights with many audiences over the course of his remarkable career. As a Supreme Court justice for three decades, he vigorously defended the American constitutional tradition of allowing religion a prominent place in the public square. As a man of faith, he recognized the special challenges of living a distinctively religious life in modern America, and he inspired other believers to meet those challenges.
This volume contains Justice Scalia's incisive thoughts on these matters, laced with his characteristic wit. It includes outstanding speeches featured in Scalia Speaks and also draws from his Supreme Court opinions and his articles.
In addition to the introduction by Fr. Scalia, other highlights include Fr. Scalia's beautiful homily at his father's funeral Mass and reminiscences from various friends and law clerks whose lives were influenced by Antonin Scalia's faith."
"GA Dem Called Heartbeat Bill 'Abominable and Evil,' 'Bad for Morality,' Implying Abortion Is Morally Superior",www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/ga-dem-actually-called-heartbeat-bill-abominable-and-evil-and-bad-for-morality-implying-abortion-is-morally-superior-to-life,"GA Dem Called Heartbeat Bill 'Abominable and Evil,''Bad for Morality,' Implying Abortion Is Morally Superior 04-10-2019 Benjamin Gill Stacey Abrams Via Twitter
Planned Parenthood leaders are calling Georgia's heartbeat bill ""blatantly unconstitutional."" That's to be expected. But what's somewhat surprising was the way the Democratic Party's former candidate for governor described it.
Stacey Abrams, the former speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives who nearly won the governor's race in 2018, called the pro-life bill ""abominable and evil."" Those two words are usually used by pro-lifers in describing the horrors of abortion, not the other way around.
In her MSNBC interview, Abrams went on to say the heartbeat bill is ""bad for morality and our humanity.""
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) pointed to Abrams' remarks fly in the face of morality. ""Human beings have heartbeats. Blobs of protoplasm do not,"" he argued on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday morning.
""I hope that somewhere among Democrats who even, perhaps believe in abortion, they recognize that the science on this, and they love to talk about science all the time. Then let's talk about the science of biology and stop the madness of killing babies with a heartbeat. Surely we're civilized enough to think that that's just flat-out evil,"" Huckabee said.
The Georgia measure would restrict abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat. The individual and distinct heartbeat of an unborn person can usually be detected by the sixth week of pregnancy.
The bill passed the state legislature in late March and should be signed soon by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. His office says they don't have a timeframe for the signing.
Kemp applauds the bill which is considered one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the nation, saying, ""We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.""
""Our efforts to protect life do not end here. We must work to ease the adoption process, find loving homes for those in our foster care system, and protect the aging and vulnerable,"" he said.
Along with the expected attack from Planned Parenthood and the not-so-expected label from Stacey Abrams, Georgia's heartbeat bill has also led to a boycott threat against this Bible-belt state.
Kemp is moving forward with plans to sign the bill despite the criticism and a Hollywood campaign to boycott filmmaking in Georgia if he does.
The boycott threat from the Writers Guild of America actually holds more clout than many people realize because Georgia is the third biggest state for film and TV production. Some have even called the state ""the Hollywood of the South."""

Brain Scans May Reveal Concussion Damage in Living Athletes,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/brain-scans-may-reveal-concussion-damage-in-living-athletes,"Researchers may be closing in on a way to check athletes while they’re alive for signs of a degenerative brain disease that’s been linked to frequent head blows. Experimental scans found higher levels of an abnormal protein tied to the disease in a study of former National Football League players who were having mood and thinking problems.
It’s the first time a major study has tested these scans for detecting chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, which is only diagnosed now after death, with brain autopsies.
Doctors are searching for a way to tell when players, veterans or others with concussions or other head injuries are at risk for permanent damage. It’s too soon to know if the scans will enable that — so far they only show that these athletes are different as a group; they can’t be used to say a particular player does or does not have CTE.
“We’re not there yet,” said Boston University neuroscientist Robert Stern. “It is not ready to be used for individual diagnosis in the clinic.”
He led the study, published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.
“It’s an encouraging advance. It looks like they have detected CTE in living players,” said Dr. Gil Rabinovici, a neurologist and imaging expert at the University of California, San Francisco, who is doing other research using the scans.
“It’s hugely important to be able to detect the disease in living people” to know how common it is and to research treatments, he said.
The study was done in Massachusetts and Arizona and involved 26 former NFL players with thinking, mood or behavior problems, and 31 similarly aged men without these symptoms or head injuries.
They were given positron emission tomography, or PET scans, in which a radioactive tracer is injected that binds to various substances and makes them visible on the scans. Several of these tracers are used now to look for a protein called beta-amyloid in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. An experimental tracer that doctors are testing binds to another protein, tau, which is the key one that’s been implicated in CTE.
Men in the study had both types of tracers. Tau levels were higher in the players compared to the others, but their amyloid levels were similar, confirming that CTE is a different disease than Alzheimer’s.
Researchers also saw a relationship to years of play.
“The more years of play in tackle football across all levels, the greater the amount of tau detected,” Stern said.
However, there was no relationship between tau levels and the severity of mood and thinking symptoms. Researchers think the study may have been too small to detect a difference or that tau may not be the only factor involved.
“There’s a lot more work to be done to develop a diagnostic” tool using these scans, said Dr. Michael Weiner an imaging expert at UCSF who is involved in other CTE research.
Government grants and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, which makes the tracers, funded the study. Some authors work or consult for the company.
A larger study of former NFL and college football players is underway; first results are expected early next year.
Mike Adamle, a former running back for the Chicago Bears and sports announcer, has been told he has symptoms consistent with CTE, and has been evaluated by Stern at the Boston research center though he was not part of the current study.
“I had more than a few” concussions, Adamle said. “If you were running, everybody kind of led with their head. Back then, it was a test of your macho man stuff.”
The illness has been devastating, said his wife, Kim. “He couldn’t remember his lunch or he couldn’t remember his lines on the air,” and lost multiple jobs, she said.
If a test could have shown he was at risk and given him a chance to consider quitting play, “I would have definitely taken note,” Mike Adamle said.

'Salvator Mundi': $450M Da Vinci Painting of Jesus Christ Goes Missing,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/salvator-mundi-450m-da-vinci-painting-of-jesus-christ-goes-missing,"The most expensive painting ever sold at an art auction is missing. And it seems no one can account for it.
A painting of Jesus Christ which art historians believe was done by Leonardo da Vinci was purchased by an anonymous buyer for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 2017 for $450 million. The painting called ""Salvator Mundi"" was to be exhibited at the Louvre Abu Dhabi.
One month after the auction, The New York Times reports the museum's culture department announced the painting would be displayed as a part of its collection. Last September, the painting was scheduled to be unveiled, but the event was canceled with no explanation.
The Louvre Abu Dhabi's culture department and staff have refused to answer any questions about the painting. Also, an official at the Louvre in Paris, which licenses its name to the Abu Dhabi museum, told the Times their staff has been unable to locate the ""Salvator Mundi.""
In addition, both museums refused to provide a comment to the Times .
Believed to have been painted around 1500, the painting's provenance even includes it being listed in the inventory of King Charles I of England's collection after he was executed in 1649, the newspaper reported. The painting then disappears from the historical record sometime in the late 1700s.
However, the heavily painted-over artwork later turned up in the collection of a 19th-century British industrialist. Art historians at the time surmised it was the work of one of da Vinci's students.
Then in 2005, two dealers saw it at an auction in New Orleans and brought it to Dianne Modestini, a professor at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and a conservator, the Times reported.
Modestini restored the details, stripping away the overpainting, and repaired damage to the wood panel.
In 2013, the painting was bought by Russian billionaire, Dmitry E. Rybolovlev for $127.5 million who auctioned it off at Christy's in New York four years later. At the time of the Saudi prince's purchase, some art historians were skeptical the painting was one of da Vinci's works.
Rumors abound in the art world as to the exact whereabouts of the painting. One story currently circulating is it was taken to Europe after payment was made.
Modestini said that she had heard from a restoration expert that he had been asked by an insurance company to examine the painting in Zurich last fall before further shipping.
But the examination was canceled the Times reported and the expert declined to comment.
""After that, the trail goes completely cold,"" Modestini said"

However, there was no relationship between tau levels and the severity of mood and thinking symptoms. Researchers think the study may have been too small to detect a difference or that tau may not be the only factor involved.
“There’s a lot more work to be done to develop a diagnostic” tool using these scans, said Dr. Michael Weiner an imaging expert at UCSF who is involved in other CTE research.
Government grants and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, which makes the tracers, funded the study. Some authors work or consult for the company.
A larger study of former NFL and college football players is underway; first results are expected early next year.
Mike Adamle, a former running back for the Chicago Bears and sports announcer, has been told he has symptoms consistent with CTE, and has been evaluated by Stern at the Boston research center though he was not part of the current study.
“I had more than a few” concussions, Adamle said. “If you were running, everybody kind of led with their head. Back then, it was a test of your macho man stuff.”
The illness has been devastating, said his wife, Kim. “He couldn’t remember his lunch or he couldn’t remember his lines on the air,” and lost multiple jobs, she said.
If a test could have shown he was at risk and given him a chance to consider quitting play, “I would have definitely taken note,” Mike Adamle said.

Chip and Joanna Gaines New Series and New Network to Launch Next Year,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/chip-and-joanna-gaines-new-series-and-new-network-to-launch-next-year,"Chip and Joanna Gaines will return to television, but not with just one series – they will have their own cable network.
Slated to launch in the summer of 2020, the Gaines' new network is being developed by Discovery.
As CBN News reported in November, the Gaines, both devout Christians, inadvertently announced their return to television during an appearance on NBC 's The Tonight Show.
Citing their non-disclosure agreement, Chip said, ""And it said Quote: : -unQuote: : you can tell your mother, but that's it. So Mom, I just wanted to make a quick announcement. We are coming back to television. You're going to see the kids grow up. You'll get to see us with obviously a six-month delay like the rest of the world. We're excited to be back.""
In an exclusive interview with USA Today published Wednesday, the ""Fixer Upper"" stars spoke about their new series which will be the anchor for their new network.
""The difference moving forward is Jo and I are going to be able to tell more of our life stories,"" Chip told the newspaper. ""And so, as opposed to it being a very narrow vein in our universe, which is obviously construction and design and the things we do for a living, for us we feel like there's a more holistic story to be told here, and that's what we're going to focus on.""
Inspired by their quarterly Magnolia Journal , the couple decided they wanted to do other things on television to reach more people.
""We loved this idea of connecting with people in a different way,"" Joanna says, ""telling other people's stories, curating content. It felt to us a lot like what we do love with the magazine, but on a different playing field.""
Discovery CEO David Zaslav said the couple has a unique authenticity.
""They have real views and opinions on bringing up children, on cooking, on diet, on faith, on education, on design,"" he told the newspaper . ""They have a lot to say.""
While some may criticize the Gaines' decision to go back into the entertainment industry, others are cheering them on.
In an article for the website Lightworkers , Bianca Tavera writes: ""I think for so long the church has looked down on the entertainment industry because of its liberal views. But we need more people with strong Christian convictions, pioneering shows for networks. Creating fun clean content is hard to come across these days on our television sets.""
""On top of that, showing an example of a strong Christian marriage is important for families across America,"" she continued. ""We need to see what it looks like to have a healthy Christian marriage of fifteen plus years. It can give hope to those that come from broken homes, or divorced families. Chip and Jo have laid down an example that many can follow, and for that we are grateful.""
The Gaines' have always been open about their faith. Their ""Silobration"" festival near Waco, Texas last year featured food, fun for the entire family and a concert by Christian artists Johnnyswim.
Last fall, the Gaines' found out about how the Church Under The Bridge was losing their meeting place and invited Pastor Jimmy Dorrell and his congregation to meeting at their Magnolia Market Silos, while renovations were being done to the bridge by the highway department.
""About a month ago, I read about how the I-35 project would impact his church. I was sitting in my office one day, day-dreaming, thinking about making a commitment, and we reached out to Jimmy,"" Chip told the newspaper at the time. ""He came over to the Silos, and we agreed it would make a great fit geographically. We said, 'Let's do it,' and shook hands on it.""
Dorrell said his church has a one-year agreement with the Magnolia company to use the silos at no charge.

'It Hasn't Worked to Date': Pompeo Will Not Affirm Two-State Solution,www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/it-hasnt-worked-to-date-pompeo-will-not-affirm-two-state-solution,"'It Hasn't Worked to Date': Pompeo Will Not Affirm Two-State Solution 04-11-2019 Emily Jones Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Photo: Mario Gonzalez/CBN News)
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to publicly endorse the two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Wednesday.
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine asked Pompeo if he thought a peace agreement including two separate states for Israel and the Palestinians was outdated.
""It's certainly an idea that's been around a long time, Senator,"" Pompeo replied.
""I would argue that millions of man-hours have been spent to try and build out a two-state solution. It hasn't worked to date. It may work this afternoon, but it hasn't,"" he continued. ""Ultimately the individuals in the region will sort this out. We want good things for the Palestinians.""
The hearing comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party beat the rival Blue and White party in the national election. The win has set Netanyahu on a clear path to his fifth term as prime minister, making him Israel's longest-serving prime minister in the nation's history.
Before the election, Netanyahu said he would annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank if his party won. Annexation is a controversial move because historically, Palestinians want a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with eastern Jerusalem as its capital.
Kaine asked Pompeo if the United States would support, oppose, or be indifferent to Israel's potential annexation.
""We are now working with many parties to share what our vision [is] as to how to resolve this problem,"" Pompeo responded. ""For decades, there had been all these wonderful experts that have tried to resolve this crisis in the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people, and they have each failed. So the old set of ideas aren't worth retreading. They have simply not succeeded. We are hopeful that our vision, our ideas about what this might look like, how we might proceed to do that, will create the conditions where the Israelis and the Palestinians can resolve this.""
He added the Trump Administration ""has been working on a set of ideas"" for peace that he hopes to present."
‘He Knows Better’: Mike Pence Responds to Pete Buttigieg’s Criticism of His Faith,www.cbn.com,"Will Maule, Faithwire",04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/lsquo-he-knows-better-rsquo-mike-pence-responds-to-pete-buttigieg-rsquo-s-criticism-of-his-faith,"Vice President Mike Pence has responded to criticism leveled against him by Democratic Presidential hopeful and South Bend, Indiana Mayor, Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg, in a recent address to an LGBT campaign group, swiped at Pence for his religious belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman.
“I wish the Mike Pence’s of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,” Buttigieg, who is openly gay and married, declared Sunday. “Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
Buttigieg also referred to Pence when insisting that his gay marriage brought him “closer to God.”
Presidential Candidate Pete Buttigieg Claims God Is on His Side of the Gay Marriage Debate
Bizarrely, Pence had not issued any comments to provoke such pointed remarks. Speaking in response to the mayor’s comments, the Vice President told CNBC that Buttigieg “knows better” than to say “things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally.”
“He knows me,” Pence added, “but I get it. You know, it’s look, again, 19 people running for president on that side in a party that’s sliding off to the left. And they’re all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are.”
Pence, who has been a staunch believer in traditional marriage for his entire political career, noted that this “doesn’t mean that we’re we’re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view,”
Pence noted that as governor of Indiana, he “worked very closely with Mayor Pete” and that they “had a great working relationship.”
Karen Pence Issues Blunt Response to Buttigieg’s Unprovoked Attacks on Vice President’s Christian Beliefs
Pence’s wife, Karen, also responded to Buttigieg’s comments, declaring that “in our country, we need to understand you shouldn’t be attacked for what your religious beliefs are.”
“I think kids need to learn that, at a young age, that this is OK, what faith people have,” she said. “We don’t attack them for their faith.”"
WikiLeaks' Assange Arrested at Ecuador Embassy in London,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/wikileaks-assange-arrested-at-ecuador-embassy-in-london,"LONDON (AP) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was forcibly bundled out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and into a waiting British police van on Thursday, setting up a potential court battle over attempts to extradite him to the U.S. to face charges related to the publication of tens of thousands of secret government documents.
British police arrested Assange after the South American nation decided to revoke the political asylum that had given Assange sanctuary for almost seven years. Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno said he took the action due to ""repeated violations to international conventions and daily life.""

— Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) April 11, 2019
In Washington, the U.S. Justice Department accused Assange with conspiring with Chelsea Manning to break into a classified government computer at the Pentagon. The charge was announced after Assange was taken into custody.
His lawyer has previously said that Assange planned to fight any U.S. charges against him.
Assange took refuge in the embassy in 2012 after he was released on bail in Britain while facing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations that have since been dropped.
British police said Thursday that Assange had been arrested for breaching his bail conditions in Britain and in relation to the U.S. arrest request.
Moreno, speaking in a video released on Twitter, said the country was no longer willing to give Assange protection. Other Ecuadorian officials in Quito accused supporters of WikiLeaks and two Russian hackers of attempting to destabilize their country.
""The discourteous and aggressive behavior of Mr. Julian Assange, the hostile and threatening declarations of its allied organization, against Ecuador, and especially the transgression of international treaties, have led the situation to a point where the asylum of Mr. Assange is unsustainable and no longer viable,"" Moreno said.
Assange for years has been under U.S. Justice Department scrutiny for years for WikiLeaks' role in publishing thousands of government secrets. He was an important figure in the special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe as investigators examined how WikiLeaks obtained emails that were stolen from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and Democratic groups.
Assange had not come out of the embassy in London for almost seven years because he feared arrest and extradition to the United States for publishing classified military and diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks. Although Sweden has dropped the sexual assault case that first led to Assange's arrest in Britain, U.K. authorities said he would be rearrested if he ever left the embassy because he skipped bail in the original case.
Video posted online by Ruptly, a news service of Russia Today, showed several men in suits around Assange, pulling him out of the embassy building and loading him into a police van Thursday while uniformed British police officers formed a passageway. Assange sported a full beard and slicked-back grey hair.
WikiLeaks quickly drew attention to U.S. interest in Assange and said that Ecuador had illegally terminated Assange's political asylum ""in violation of international law.""
""Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to de-humanise, de-legitimize and imprison him,"" the group said in a tweet over a photo of Assange's smiling face.
But Moreno appeared to suggest that a swift extradition to America was not likely.
""In line with our strong commitment to human rights and international law, I requested Great Britain to guarantee that Mr. Assange would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty,"" Moreno said. ""The British government has confirmed it in writing, in accordance with its own rules.""
Assange's arrest came a day after WikiLeaks accused the Ecuador's government of an ""extensive spying operation"" against him. WikiLeaks claims that meetings with lawyers and a doctor inside the embassy over the past year were secretly filmed.
In Quito on Thursday, Ecuador's government denounced what they called attempts by supporters of WikiLeaks and two Russian hackers to destabilize their country as its standoff with Assange intensified in recent weeks.
Ecuador Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said a close collaborator of WikiLeaks had traveled with former Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino this year to several countries - including Peru, Spain and Venezuela - in an attempt to undermine the Ecuadorian government. She did not identify the person but said their name and those of the two Russian hackers working in Ecuador would be turned over to judicial authorities.
She also said Ecuador's embassy in Spain and other diplomatic missions abroad have received threats related.
The reaction to Thursday's news was mixed around the world.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked Moreno for breaking the impasse over the WikiLeaks founder, saying on Twitter that Assange ""is no hero and no one is above the law.""
But Edward Snowden, the former security contractor who leaked classified information about U.S. surveillance programs, called Assange's arrest a blow to media freedom.
""Images of Ecuador's ambassador inviting the U.K.'s secret police into the embassy to drag a publisher of -like it or not - award-winning journalism out of the building are going to end up in the history books,"" Snowden said in a tweet.
""Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom,"" Snowden said from Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said Russia wants Assange's rights to be protected following his arrest. Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he could not comment on the overall case but ""we of course hope that all of his rights will be observed.""
And an independent U.N. human rights expert said he won't relent in his efforts to determine whether Assange's privacy rights were violated at the embassy in London. Joe Cannataci, the special rapporteur on privacy, had planned to travel to London on April 25 to meet with Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy, and said he still planned to do so - wherever Assange is at the time.
""I will visit him and speak to him in a police station or elsewhere in the U.K. where he may be held,"" said Cannataci.

Sudanese Officials Say Army Forced President to Step Down,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/sudanese-army-to-deliver-important-statement-amid-protests,"CAIRO (AP) - Tens of thousands of Sudanese were making their way to the center of the country's capital on Thursday, cheering and clapping in celebration as two senior officials said the military had forced longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir to step down after 30 years in power.
The circumstances of al-Bashir's apparent ouster and his current whereabouts remained unclear, however. The armed forces were to deliver an ""important statement"" and asked the nation to wait for it, state TV reported earlier.
The two officials, in high positions in the government and the military, told The Associated Press the army forced al-Bashir to step down and was now in talks about forming a transitional government. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.
The swirling reports of a coup following nearly four months of street protests against al-Bashir's rule raised expectations it was a sign the autocrat was relinquishing power or was being removed by the military.
Pan-Arab TV networks said top ruling party officials were being arrested. They aired footage of masses they said were heading toward the presidential palace in Khartoum, waving the national flag, chanting, and clapping.
Al-Bashir, who is a pariah in many countries, is also wanted by the international war crimes tribunal for atrocities in Darfur.
Eyewitnesses in Khartoum said the military had deployed at key sites in the city to secure several installations since the morning hours.
Armored vehicles and tanks are parked in the streets and near bridges over the Nile River, they said, as well as in the vicinity of the military headquarters, where thousands were anxiously awaiting the army statement. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals.
Organizers of the protests urged crowds to converge and join an ongoing sit-in underway in Khartoum since the weekend. They issued a statement vowing to remain in the streets until the ""regime steps down completely and power is handed to a civilian transitional government.""
Thousands of protesters, including women carrying their children, were making their way toward the military headquarters, many ululating and flashing ""V'' for victory. There were also unconfirmed reports that the airport in the Sudanese capital had been closed.
Ahead of the expected army statement, Sudanese radio played military marches and patriotic music. State TV ceased regular broadcasts, with only the brief announcement saying that there will be an ""important statement from the armed forces after a while, wait for it.""
The development followed deadly clashes between Sudanese security forces and protesters holding a large anti-government sit-in outside the military's headquarters in Khartoum, which also include a presidential residence. There were several attempts to break up the sit-in, leaving 22 dead since Saturday.
On Tuesday, Sudanese security forces tried again to disperse the sit-in, which began over the weekend, killing at least 14 people, activists behind the demonstration said. The government said 11 died. The fatalities so far have included five soldiers who protest organizers said were defending the sit-in.
The months of protests have plunged Sudan into its worst crisis in years. The demonstrations initially erupted last December with rallies against a spiraling economy, but quickly escalated into calls for an end to embattled al-Bashir's rule.
Security forces have responded to the protest movement with a fierce crackdown, killing dozens. Al-Bashir banned unauthorized public gatherings and granted sweeping powers to the police since imposing a state of emergency last month. Security forces have used tear gas, rubber bullets, live ammunition and batons against demonstrators
The protests gained momentum last week after Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in power for 20 years, resigned in response to weeks of similar protests.
On Saturday, marches in Khartoum marked the 34th anniversary of the overthrow of former President al-Nimeiri in a bloodless coup. It was one of the largest turnouts in the current wave of unrest.
The military removed Nimeiri after a popular uprising in 1985. It quickly handed over power to an elected government. The dysfunctional administration lasted only a few years until al-Bashir - a career army officer - allied with Islamist hard-liners and toppled it in a coup in 1989.
Since the current protests began Dec. 19, the military has stated its support for the country's ""leadership"" and pledged to protect the people's ""achievements"" - without mentioning al-Bashir by name.
Army troops have deployed to protect vital state installations but have not tried to stop protests and, in some cases, appeared to offer a measure of protection for the demonstrators.
All that raised the possibility that what was playing out in Khartoum on Thursday was a military takeover and removal of al-Bashir.

Israel Hours Away from Historic Moon Landing - Here's Where You Can Watch It,www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/israel-hours-away-from-historic-moon-landing-heres-where-you-can-watch-it-too,"Homepage Israel News CBNNews.com 'If At First You Don't Succeed, Try Again': Israel Unable to Safely Land on Moon But Hope Remains 04-11-2019 Animation of Beresheet in lunar orbit/Courtesy SpaceIL and IAI
JERUSALEM, Israel - Israel was unsuccessful in making a historic landing on the moon Thursday evening.
""If at first you don't succeed, you try again,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
The spacecraft reportedly experienced an engine failure just meters away from the moon's surface and crashed. Scientists lost communication with the craft.
Israel's Beresheet spacecraft was developed by a team of scientists from SpaceIL and Israel Space Industries (IAI) and was supposed to land on the moon approximately 10:25 p.m. (3:25 p.m. ET).
On Wednesday, the SpaceIL and IAI team successfully completed the last maneuver before landing.
The maneuver lowered the spacecraft’s altitude in preparation for its landing. Beresheet orbited the moon for several hours before scientists attempted to land it.
Beresheet's mission on the moon was supposed to last two to three days. The craft was sent to take pictures of the lunar surface and conduct experiments.
The spacecraft was also carrying with it God's written word to the moon. It had a time capsule containing a database of hundreds of files. The files included a copy of the Bible, information about SpaceIL, Israeli national symbols, and other materials.
The capsule was going to be left on the moon's surface after Israel completed its mission there.
Israeli leaders hoped the mission would have an ""Apollo Effect"" on Israeli youth.
""We want the Israeli kids and the Israeli youth to, we want to encourage them to learn STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and informatics - and we hope that they will have this mission [and] we will create the effect and encourage them,"" said SpaceIL CEO Dr. Ido Antebi.
President Reuven Rivlin said he used to dream of going to the moon
""When I was a child, we used to write fortunes on bubblegum wrappers – 'by the time you're 21, you'll go to the moon'. Then, it seemed fantastical, impossible. Until now, only great powers have landed on the moon – the United States, the Soviet Union and China. But if everything goes to plan, the State of Israel – our young and small country – will be the fourth country in history to land a spacecraft on the moon."""
'Every American's Right': Christian Farmers Fight Back After Being Banned for Biblical Marriage Beliefs,www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/every-americans-right-christian-farmers-fight-back-after-being-banned-for-biblical-marriage-beliefs,"A pair of Christian farmers who were banned from their local farmers market in 2016 for choosing not to host a gay wedding on their personal farm are taking their battle to court this week.
Steve and Bridget Tennes, owners of Country Mill Farms, are asking for a permanent court order forcing the city of East Lansing, Michigan to let them sell their products at the city's farmer's market.
The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) will represent the Tennes family in court this Friday. According to ADF, the City of Lansing blocked the Christian family from selling their products after reading on the Country Mill Farms' Facebook page that they support biblical marriage and will not allow LGBTQ weddings in their orchards.
""Our family farm here is very personal to us,"" Steve Tennes said in a statement on the ADF website. ""One of the things we really enjoy about our family farm here is (that) we are able to raise our five children here at the farm in accordance with our faith.""
In 2017, a federal judge issued a preliminary order forcing the city to allow the Tennes family to participate in the farmers market and said the city most likely violated their religious and free speech rights.
According to NBC News , East Lansing Mayor Mark Meadows said that temporary ruling only covered the 2017 market season. Meadows also said the city opposes the Tennes' ""corporate decision-making,"" not their religious beliefs.
""This doesn't have anything to do with Mr. Tennes,"" Meadows said. ""This has to do with the business.""
ADF Legal Counsel Kate Anderson strongly disagrees.
""All Americans should be free to live and speak according to their deeply held religious beliefs without fear of government punishment,"" said Anderson. ""Yet East Lansing officials changed their market policy to shut out Steve Tennes because they don't like his Catholic beliefs regarding marriage. Courts have repeatedly rejected these types of practices as unconstitutional discrimination.""
Steve and Bridget Tennes are military veterans and hope their case will help preserve the freedoms of other Americans.
""This isn't just about our ability to sell at the farmer's market. It's really about every American's right to make a living and not have to worry about being punished by the government,"" Steve said.

Assange had not come out of the embassy in London for almost seven years because he feared arrest and extradition to the United States for publishing classified military and diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks. Although Sweden has dropped the sexual assault case that first led to Assange's arrest in Britain, U.K. authorities said he would be rearrested if he ever left the embassy because he skipped bail in the original case.
Video posted online by Ruptly, a news service of Russia Today, showed several men in suits around Assange, pulling him out of the embassy building and loading him into a police van Thursday while uniformed British police officers formed a passageway. Assange sported a full beard and slicked-back grey hair.
WikiLeaks quickly drew attention to U.S. interest in Assange and said that Ecuador had illegally terminated Assange's political asylum ""in violation of international law.""
""Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to de-humanise, de-legitimize and imprison him,"" the group said in a tweet over a photo of Assange's smiling face.
But Moreno appeared to suggest that a swift extradition to America was not likely.
""In line with our strong commitment to human rights and international law, I requested Great Britain to guarantee that Mr. Assange would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty,"" Moreno said. ""The British government has confirmed it in writing, in accordance with its own rules.""
Assange's arrest came a day after WikiLeaks accused the Ecuador's government of an ""extensive spying operation"" against him. WikiLeaks claims that meetings with lawyers and a doctor inside the embassy over the past year were secretly filmed.
In Quito on Thursday, Ecuador's government denounced what they called attempts by supporters of WikiLeaks and two Russian hackers to destabilize their country as its standoff with Assange intensified in recent weeks.
Ecuador Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said a close collaborator of WikiLeaks had traveled with former Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino this year to several countries - including Peru, Spain and Venezuela - in an attempt to undermine the Ecuadorian government. She did not identify the person but said their name and those of the two Russian hackers working in Ecuador would be turned over to judicial authorities.
She also said Ecuador's embassy in Spain and other diplomatic missions abroad have received threats related.
The reaction to Thursday's news was mixed around the world.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked Moreno for breaking the impasse over the WikiLeaks founder, saying on Twitter that Assange ""is no hero and no one is above the law.""
But Edward Snowden, the former security contractor who leaked classified information about U.S. surveillance programs, called Assange's arrest a blow to media freedom.
""Images of Ecuador's ambassador inviting the U.K.'s secret police into the embassy to drag a publisher of -like it or not - award-winning journalism out of the building are going to end up in the history books,"" Snowden said in a tweet.
""Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom,"" Snowden said from Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said Russia wants Assange's rights to be protected following his arrest. Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he could not comment on the overall case but ""we of course hope that all of his rights will be observed.""
And an independent U.N. human rights expert said he won't relent in his efforts to determine whether Assange's privacy rights were violated at the embassy in London. Joe Cannataci, the special rapporteur on privacy, had planned to travel to London on April 25 to meet with Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy, and said he still planned to do so - wherever Assange is at the time.
""I will visit him and speak to him in a police station or elsewhere in the U.K. where he may be held,"" said Cannataci.

‘He Knows Better’: Mike Pence Responds to Pete Buttigieg’s Criticism of His Faith,www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/lsquo-he-knows-better-rsquo-mike-pence-responds-to-pete-buttigieg-rsquo-s-criticism-of-his-faith,"‘He Knows Better’: Mike Pence Responds to Pete Buttigieg’s Criticism of His Faith 04-11-2019 Will Maule, Faithwire
Vice President Mike Pence has responded to criticism leveled against him by Democratic Presidential hopeful and South Bend, Indiana Mayor, Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg, in a recent address to an LGBT campaign group, swiped at Pence for his religious belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman.
“I wish the Mike Pence’s of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,” Buttigieg, who is openly gay and married, declared Sunday. “Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
Buttigieg also referred to Pence when insisting that his gay marriage brought him “closer to God.”
Presidential Candidate Pete Buttigieg Claims God Is on His Side of the Gay Marriage Debate
Bizarrely, Pence had not issued any comments to provoke such pointed remarks. Speaking in response to the mayor’s comments, the Vice President told CNBC that Buttigieg “knows better” than to say “things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally.”
“He knows me,” Pence added, “but I get it. You know, it’s look, again, 19 people running for president on that side in a party that’s sliding off to the left. And they’re all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are.”
Pence, who has been a staunch believer in traditional marriage for his entire political career, noted that this “doesn’t mean that we’re we’re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view,”
Pence noted that as governor of Indiana, he “worked very closely with Mayor Pete” and that they “had a great working relationship.”
Karen Pence Issues Blunt Response to Buttigieg’s Unprovoked Attacks on Vice President’s Christian Beliefs
Pence’s wife, Karen, also responded to Buttigieg’s comments, declaring that “in our country, we need to understand you shouldn’t be attacked for what your religious beliefs are.”
“I think kids need to learn that, at a young age, that this is OK, what faith people have,” she said. “We don’t attack them for their faith.”"

WASHINGTON – A powerful spring storm has triggered blizzard warnings in at least six states while others are experiencing high winds and severe flooding.
From the Rockies to the central plains and Great Lakes, millions of Americans are in the storm's path. This is the second potential ""bomb cyclone"" to bear down on the US in less than a month.
In Colorado, freezing temperatures and heavy snow prompted the state's governor to call in the National Guard. Troops rescued 75 people and two dogs from stranded vehicles southeast of Denver Wednesday night.
South Dakota has been one of the hardest hit states with more than 18 inches of snow recorded in some places.
Near whiteout conditions in Minnesota are shutting down highways.
And in other parts of the country, they're seeing severe flooding and wind.
A ""dustnado"" was spotted near Pueblo, Colorado and a ""blowing dust warning"" was issued near Lubbock, Texas where winds reached up to 70 miles per hour.
In the Northwest, the storm is causing serious flooding. Near Eugene, Oregon, boats could glide over one flooded highway.
The storm is also causing headaches at airports. At Denver International Airport, about half of all fights were cancelled Wednesday."

A new report shows the US Government is still spending much more money than it brings in. That means the US is continuing to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars just to keep paying its bills.
The Treasury Department reports a $146.9 billion deficit in March, bringing the total deficit for the first half of the budget year to $691 billion. That's up 15 percent over the same time period last year.
Treasury officials say the deficit is on track to pass $1 trillion when the fiscal year ends in September.
It's not due to a decrease in tax revenue though. In fact, because the economy is booming and more Americans have jobs, there's now more tax revenue coming in. The Associated Press reports, ""Tax receipts are running slightly higher than a year ago.""
Meanwhile, new budget battles are underway as Republicans control the Senate, Democrats control the House, and each side wants to keep funding for the government programs and departments that are important to their supporters.
Progressives are pushing for spending hikes for domestic programs, and conservatives in the Trump camp want a bigger Pentagon budget.
Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell wants bipartisan talks on a new budget pact to fund federal agencies over the next two years.
President Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is a budget hawk. He's signaling that the White House is taking a harder line on budget negotiations this time around.
But others in the Trump administration say they're facing an uphill battle to trim spending.
""Democrats aren't even writing a budget and are pushing for a reckless 'caps deal' that would cost taxpayers over $2 trillion and explode deficits,"" said a senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions have been private. ""We've made clear to Congress that type of a wasteful spending is unacceptable."""
Sudanese Officials Say Army Forced President to Step Down,www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/sudanese-army-to-deliver-important-statement-amid-protests,"Sudanese Officials Say Army Forced President to Step Down 04-11-2019 Associated Press Credit: AP Video Screenshot
CAIRO (AP) - Tens of thousands of Sudanese were making their way to the center of the country's capital on Thursday, cheering and clapping in celebration as two senior officials said the military had forced longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir to step down after 30 years in power. The circumstances of al-Bashir's apparent ouster and his current whereabouts remained unclear, however. The armed forces were to deliver an ""important statement"" and asked the nation to wait for it, state TV reported earlier. The two officials, in high positions in the government and the military, told The Associated Press the army forced al-Bashir to step down and was now in talks about forming a transitional government. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The swirling reports of a coup following nearly four months of street protests against al-Bashir's rule raised expectations it was a sign the autocrat was relinquishing power or was being removed by the military. Pan-Arab TV networks said top ruling party officials were being arrested. They aired footage of masses they said were heading toward the presidential palace in Khartoum, waving the national flag, chanting, and clapping. Al-Bashir, who is a pariah in many countries, is also wanted by the international war crimes tribunal for atrocities in Darfur. Eyewitnesses in Khartoum said the military had deployed at key sites in the city to secure several installations since the morning hours. Armored vehicles and tanks are parked in the streets and near bridges over the Nile River, they said, as well as in the vicinity of the military headquarters, where thousands were anxiously awaiting the army statement. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals. Organizers of the protests urged crowds to converge and join an ongoing sit-in underway in Khartoum since the weekend. They issued a statement vowing to remain in the streets until the ""regime steps down completely and power is handed to a civilian transitional government."" Thousands of protesters, including women carrying their children, were making their way toward the military headquarters, many ululating and flashing ""V'' for victory. There were also unconfirmed reports that the airport in the Sudanese capital had been closed. Ahead of the expected army statement, Sudanese radio played military marches and patriotic music. State TV ceased regular broadcasts, with only the brief announcement saying that there will be an ""important statement from the armed forces after a while, wait for it."" The development followed deadly clashes between Sudanese security forces and protesters holding a large anti-government sit-in outside the military's headquarters in Khartoum, which also include a presidential residence. There were several attempts to break up the sit-in, leaving 22 dead since Saturday. On Tuesday, Sudanese security forces tried again to disperse the sit-in, which began over the weekend, killing at least 14 people, activists behind the demonstration said. The government said 11 died. The fatalities so far have included five soldiers who protest organizers said were defending the sit-in. The months of protests have plunged Sudan into its worst crisis in years. The demonstrations initially erupted last December with rallies against a spiraling economy, but quickly escalated into calls for an end to embattled al-Bashir's rule. Security forces have responded to the protest movement with a fierce crackdown, killing dozens. Al-Bashir banned unauthorized public gatherings and granted sweeping powers to the police since imposing a state of emergency last month. Security forces have used tear gas, rubber bullets, live ammunition and batons against demonstrators The protests gained momentum last week after Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in power for 20 years, resigned in response to weeks of similar protests. On Saturday, marches in Khartoum marked the 34th anniversary of the overthrow of former President al-Nimeiri in a bloodless coup. It was one of the largest turnouts in the current wave of unrest. The military removed Nimeiri after a popular uprising in 1985. It quickly handed over power to an elected government. The dysfunctional administration lasted only a few years until al-Bashir - a career army officer - allied with Islamist hard-liners and toppled it in a coup in 1989. Since the current protests began Dec. 19, the military has stated its support for the country's ""leadership"" and pledged to protect the people's ""achievements"" - without mentioning al-Bashir by name. Army troops have deployed to protect vital state installations but have not tried to stop protests and, in some cases, appeared to offer a measure of protection for the demonstrators. All that raised the possibility that what was playing out in Khartoum on Thursday was a military takeover and removal of al-Bashir.

"Censorship: Instagram, Facebook Block Pro-Life Posts by Alveda King, Nick Loeb and Babylon Bee Founder",www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/censorship-instagram-facebook-block-pro-life-posts-by-alveda-king-nick-loeb-and-babylon-bee-founder,"Censorship: Instagram, Facebook Block Pro-Life Posts by Alveda King, Nick Loeb and Babylon Bee Founder 04-11-2019 Christian Ellis Instagram & Facebook Logos
Multiple pro-life supporters have seen their anti-abortion posts removed in another round of censorship from popular social media sites Instagram and Facebook.
Recently, Christian satire site founder Adam Ford and pro-life filmmakers Nick Loeb and Dr. Alveda King report they've all seen their posts blocked.
Ford, who created the Christian satire Babylon Bee, had created a post comparing abortion to slavery. It was quickly removed by Instagram over an assertion it was ""hate speech.""
""We want to keep Instagram a safe place for everyone, and we ask that you treat other members of the community with respect,"" stated Instagram in a note to Ford. ""Even if you didn't mean to offend, remember that we created these guidelines to support and protect our community on Instagram.""
""When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it,"" they continued.
Ford's comic strip featured a conversation between two women living 200 years ago, debating the morality of slavery. The conversation involves similar arguments used in the abortion debate, with the initial question being, ""Does slavery ever bother you?""
The last picture in the comic, captioned ""200 years later,"" shows the two women starting the conversation on abortion, with one asking ""Does abortion every bother you?""
In a post on the Christian Daily Reporter , Ford exposed Instagram's actions and defended himself.
""I am hardly the first person to espouse the belief (and hope) that one day society will look back on abortion with the same mortified disbelief we now have when we consider our country's history of institutionalized chattel slavery,"" stated Ford. ""Millions and millions of pro-life Americans - of all races - see the heartbreaking similarities between abortion-on-demand and the forced enslavement of human beings.""
""There is no way any human being could believe my comic is promoting slavery, since the two women talking are clearly identified as living 200 years ago, and the woman on the right is clearly the 'bad guy',"" he added.
This isn't the first time Ford has had to deal with censorship. Last year, Facebook reduced Babylon Bee's distribution and demonetized it in response to a liberal Snopes piece that claimed to ""fact-check"" one of their satirical stories, according to the Christian Post.
Meanwhile, filmmakers Nick Loeb and Alveda King have also been blocked on Facebook from sharing about their new pro-life ""Roe v. Wade"" film which stars Jon Voight.
In an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, Loeb shared the movie had already experienced problems since people in Hollywood did not want to financially support the film.
""We created a crowdfund site called roevwademovie.com and we launched on Facebook to try to raise money, and even Facebook tried to shut us down,"" stated Loeb.
""They said that we were spamming,"" he continued. ""So we had to set up a separate crowdfunding site. Facebook is one of the only platforms out there to be able to promote a crowdfunding site and they stopped us from sharing.""
""I couldn't send out the crowdfunding site to my friends or family and people who liked the site couldn't share it,"" he added. ""We even bought and paid for advertising and they blocked us from sharing paid advertising, so it's been a struggle to get people to go to roevwademovie.com to support the film.""
The ""Roe v. Wade"" film is being made to share ""what happened from 1966 through 1973"" that ultimately led to the Supreme Court's decision that made existing laws on abortion unconstitutional. The film shares the story of the abortion-legalization movement being founded on deception and it is backed with historical evidence.
Dr. Alveda King, executive producer of the film, was not able to share about the film's fundraising either.
Loeb has stated Facebook has removed the block but has established a ""shadow ban"" which means what they post will not appear in the feeds of their followers."

Could 2020 Race be a Trump Re-Run?
WASHINGTON — A number of political observers are still dissecting the 2016 campaign for answers to how Donald Trump beat 16 Republican rivals and Hillary Clinton to take the presidency.
While historian and author Victor Davis Hanson was no Trump fan initially, his research led to the new book The Case for Trump. He believes the same characteristics and circumstances could lead to victory again in 2020.
Billionaire Brawler: A Breath of Fresh Air to the ‘Deplorables’
Trump may have been a New York real estate tycoon, but he aimed his campaign right at ""Flyover Country"" — those vast red state regions of America that the ""Deep State"" and coastal elites seem to sometimes deplore.
Hanson suggests in The Case for Trump that the so-called Deplorables saw this billionaire brawler as a breath of fresh air, and sort of like chemotherapy to a cancer that could kill the things about America they love.
“He was not going to take anything from the media or the politicos,” Hanson said of Trump. “So what the mainstream media saw as uncouth or crass or crude, they thought ‘maybe so, but it’s going to shock you and kill you before it kills us.’”
When it came down to choosing, Hanson told CBN News, voters saw clear differences between the old ways of Washington or a Trumpian future.
Trumponomics or Socialism?
“I think most people who voted for Trump thought that it wasn’t just Trump in a vacuum. It was a Manichean choice between 16 years of Obama and Hillary Clinton. And it may be that way in 2020,” Hanson suggested, saying of those voters, “They may feel that all there is between them and socialism is Donald Trump.”
Hanson added that opposing candidates thus far are moving toward extreme positions.
“Reparations. Basically infanticide as abortion. The New Green Deal. A 90 percent or 70 percent upper income tax bracket. A wealth tax. Demolishing the wall. Abolishing ICE. A foreign policy that looks favorably on Venezuela,” Hanson listed.
The author realizes Trump’s combative style can be a turnoff for some. But what some call Trump Derangement Syndrome is causing his opponents to also look bad.
Biden/Depp/Griffin/DeNiro Trash Talk
Hanson had a few examples Americans have observed recently, pointing out, “Joe Biden wants to take Trump out behind the gym and beat him up. Johnny Depp is talking about ‘where’s John Wilkes Booth again?’ And they see Kathy Griffin holding up Trump’s head or Robert DeNiro says that he wants to punch him.”
Hanson predicts voters will look past all the incivility and pick Trump again based on two factors: prosperity and peace.
“What will be the economy? If we’re growing at three percent and unemployment is at four percent or below, he’s in pretty good shape,” Hanson said of Trump. “And if he avoids a war overseas. Any of those three things will, I think, ensure his election.”"
"Suspect in Custody, Linked to 3 Fires at Historically Black Churches in Louisiana",www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/suspect-in-custody-linked-to-3-fires-at-historically-black-churches-in-louisiana,"Suspect in Custody, Linked to 3 Fires at Historically Black Churches in Louisiana 04-11-2019 Christian Ellis Church Fire (Photo: AP Images)
A suspect was taken into custody Wednesday in connection with recent fires at three historically black churches in Louisiana. He's been identified as a local sheriff's deputy's son named Holden Matthews, 21.
As CBN News has reported, arson was suspected after fires broke out at St. Mary Baptist Church on March 26, the Greater Union Baptist Church on April 2, and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on April 4.
""It steals something from you. It robs you... I know their head is down. I know they're spiritually weakened,"" Pastor Toussaint of Mt. Pleasant Baptist said. ""It caused us to pray harder, and pray more frequently. This is the time for us to pull together.""
Officials have stated no injuries have been reported, saying the churches were empty when the fires started.
Gov. John Bel Edwards, the state fire marshal, and other federal and state law enforcement officials held a news conference Thursday to provide an update on the fires at the three historically African-American churches in St. Landry Parish. St. Landry Sheriff Bobby Guidroz confirmed that Matthews is the son of a deputy.
The Justice Department got involved in the investigation as officials tried to determine if the incidents were racially motivated.
""The US Attorney's Office, ATF, and FBI are working with state and local law enforcement and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the victims and those St. Landry Parish residents affected by these despicable acts,"" stated US Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana David C. Joseph.
The president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Derrick Johnson, released a statement calling the incidents ""domestic terrorism.""
""We must not turn a blind eye to any incident where people are targeted because of the color of their skin or their faith,"" he wrote. ""The spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country. But this is nothing new.""
And one church leader expressed concerns that the threat may not be over yet. ""I would like to know whether he was working alone or not. We can't let our guard down,"" said Rev. Freddie Jack of the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association.
A GoFundMe has been started to help the churches rebuild.
""St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, Greater Union Baptist Church, and Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas will benefit from your kind donations. Funds will be used for the rebuilding of all three churches. Your support in this effort is greatly appreciated,"" the page reads."
Israel Hours Away from Historic Moon Landing - Here's Where You Can Watch It - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/israel-hours-away-from-historic-moon-landing-heres-where-you-can-watch-it-too,"Homepage Israel News CBNNews.com 'If At First You Don't Succeed, Try Again': Israel Unable to Safely Land on Moon But Hope Remains 04-11-2019 Animation of Beresheet in lunar orbit/Courtesy SpaceIL and IAI
JERUSALEM, Israel - Israel was unsuccessful in making a historic landing on the moon Thursday evening.
""If at first you don't succeed, you try again,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
The spacecraft reportedly experienced an engine failure just meters away from the moon's surface and crashed. Scientists lost communication with the craft.
Israel's Beresheet spacecraft was developed by a team of scientists from SpaceIL and Israel Space Industries (IAI) and was supposed to land on the moon approximately 10:25 p.m. (3:25 p.m. ET).
On Wednesday, the SpaceIL and IAI team successfully completed the last maneuver before landing.
The maneuver lowered the spacecraft’s altitude in preparation for its landing. Beresheet orbited the moon for several hours before scientists attempted to land it.
Beresheet's mission on the moon was supposed to last two to three days. The craft was sent to take pictures of the lunar surface and conduct experiments.
The spacecraft was also carrying with it God's written word to the moon. It had a time capsule containing a database of hundreds of files. The files included a copy of the Bible, information about SpaceIL, Israeli national symbols, and other materials.
The capsule was going to be left on the moon's surface after Israel completed its mission there.
Israeli leaders hoped the mission would have an ""Apollo Effect"" on Israeli youth.
""We want the Israeli kids and the Israeli youth to, we want to encourage them to learn STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and informatics - and we hope that they will have this mission [and] we will create the effect and encourage them,"" said SpaceIL CEO Dr. Ido Antebi.
President Reuven Rivlin said he used to dream of going to the moon
""When I was a child, we used to write fortunes on bubblegum wrappers – 'by the time you're 21, you'll go to the moon'. Then, it seemed fantastical, impossible. Until now, only great powers have landed on the moon – the United States, the Soviet Union and China. But if everything goes to plan, the State of Israel – our young and small country – will be the fourth country in history to land a spacecraft on the moon."""

Sudan's military has overthrown and arrested the country's long-time anti-Christian dictator, President Omar al-Bashir, and it has taken charge of the country for at least the next two years.
The move came after tens of thousands of protestors rallied for nearly four months against al-Bashir's rule. Security forces had recently tried to break up the demonstrations, killing at least 22 people in the violence that ensued.
""Since 1989, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir has ruled his nation with an iron fist,"" said CBN News Senior International Correspondent George Thomas.
""Under his reign, Christians and Muslims have endured the daily scourge of strict Islamic Sharia law leading to the arrest of numerous pastors, the closure of multiple churches and frequent targeting of those who decide to leave Islam and embrace Christianity,"" he said.
Al-Bashir had long been a pariah in many countries and he's even wanted by the international war crimes tribunal for atrocities in Darfur.
Sudan's defense minister announced al-Bashir had been overthrown on television, claiming that ""free and fair elections"" will be held after two years of transition.
He also says a state of emergency has been imposed for the next three months and that the military has suspended the constitution and closed the borders and air space.
""What comes next is equally of concern,"" Thomas cautioned.
""Sudan's military leaders have in essence replaced an aging military dictator with another military leader thus maintaining the status quo. That's why demonstrators are calling for a complete overhaul of the government and a peaceful transfer of power to civilian authorities,"" he said."

"US Deficit Spikes Again, on Track for $1 Trillion: 'Wasteful Spending Is Unacceptable'",www.cbn.com,Benjamin Gill,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/us-deficit-spikes-again-on-track-for-1-trillion-wasteful-spending-is-unacceptable,"A new report shows the US Government is still spending much more money than it brings in. That means the US is continuing to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars just to keep paying its bills.
The Treasury Department reports a $146.9 billion deficit in March, bringing the total deficit for the first half of the budget year to $691 billion. That's up 15 percent over the same time period last year.
Treasury officials say the deficit is on track to pass $1 trillion when the fiscal year ends in September.
It's not due to a decrease in tax revenue though. In fact, because the economy is booming and more Americans have jobs, there's now more tax revenue coming in. The Associated Press reports, ""Tax receipts are running slightly higher than a year ago.""
Meanwhile, new budget battles are underway as Republicans control the Senate, Democrats control the House, and each side wants to keep funding for the government programs and departments that are important to their supporters.
Progressives are pushing for spending hikes for domestic programs, and conservatives in the Trump camp want a bigger Pentagon budget.
Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell wants bipartisan talks on a new budget pact to fund federal agencies over the next two years.
President Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is a budget hawk. He's signaling that the White House is taking a harder line on budget negotiations this time around.
But others in the Trump administration say they're facing an uphill battle to trim spending.
""Democrats aren't even writing a budget and are pushing for a reckless 'caps deal' that would cost taxpayers over $2 trillion and explode deficits,"" said a senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions have been private. ""We've made clear to Congress that type of a wasteful spending is unacceptable."""
"Censorship: Instagram, Facebook Block Pro-Life Posts by Alveda King, Nick Loeb and Babylon Bee Founder",www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/censorship-instagram-facebook-block-pro-life-posts-by-alveda-king-nick-loeb-and-babylon-bee-founder,"Multiple pro-life supporters have seen their anti-abortion posts removed in another round of censorship from popular social media sites Instagram and Facebook.
Recently, Christian satire site founder Adam Ford and pro-life filmmakers Nick Loeb and Dr. Alveda King report they've all seen their posts blocked.
Ford, who created the Christian satire Babylon Bee, had created a post comparing abortion to slavery. It was quickly removed by Instagram over an assertion it was ""hate speech.""
""We want to keep Instagram a safe place for everyone, and we ask that you treat other members of the community with respect,"" stated Instagram in a note to Ford. ""Even if you didn't mean to offend, remember that we created these guidelines to support and protect our community on Instagram.""
""When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it,"" they continued.
Ford's comic strip featured a conversation between two women living 200 years ago, debating the morality of slavery. The conversation involves similar arguments used in the abortion debate, with the initial question being, ""Does slavery ever bother you?""
The last picture in the comic, captioned ""200 years later,"" shows the two women starting the conversation on abortion, with one asking ""Does abortion every bother you?""
In a post on the Christian Daily Reporter , Ford exposed Instagram's actions and defended himself.
""I am hardly the first person to espouse the belief (and hope) that one day society will look back on abortion with the same mortified disbelief we now have when we consider our country's history of institutionalized chattel slavery,"" stated Ford. ""Millions and millions of pro-life Americans - of all races - see the heartbreaking similarities between abortion-on-demand and the forced enslavement of human beings.""
""There is no way any human being could believe my comic is promoting slavery, since the two women talking are clearly identified as living 200 years ago, and the woman on the right is clearly the 'bad guy',"" he added.
This isn't the first time Ford has had to deal with censorship. Last year, Facebook reduced Babylon Bee's distribution and demonetized it in response to a liberal Snopes piece that claimed to ""fact-check"" one of their satirical stories, according to the Christian Post.
Meanwhile, filmmakers Nick Loeb and Alveda King have also been blocked on Facebook from sharing about their new pro-life ""Roe v. Wade"" film which stars Jon Voight.
In an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, Loeb shared the movie had already experienced problems since people in Hollywood did not want to financially support the film.
""We created a crowdfund site called roevwademovie.com and we launched on Facebook to try to raise money, and even Facebook tried to shut us down,"" stated Loeb.
""They said that we were spamming,"" he continued. ""So we had to set up a separate crowdfunding site. Facebook is one of the only platforms out there to be able to promote a crowdfunding site and they stopped us from sharing.""
""I couldn't send out the crowdfunding site to my friends or family and people who liked the site couldn't share it,"" he added. ""We even bought and paid for advertising and they blocked us from sharing paid advertising, so it's been a struggle to get people to go to roevwademovie.com to support the film.""
The ""Roe v. Wade"" film is being made to share ""what happened from 1966 through 1973"" that ultimately led to the Supreme Court's decision that made existing laws on abortion unconstitutional. The film shares the story of the abortion-legalization movement being founded on deception and it is backed with historical evidence.
Dr. Alveda King, executive producer of the film, was not able to share about the film's fundraising either.
Loeb has stated Facebook has removed the block but has established a ""shadow ban"" which means what they post will not appear in the feeds of their followers."
'Every American's Right': Christian Farmers Fight Back After Being Banned for Biblical Marriage Beliefs,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/every-americans-right-christian-farmers-fight-back-after-being-banned-for-biblical-marriage-beliefs,"A pair of Christian farmers who were banned from their local farmers market in 2016 for choosing not to host a gay wedding on their personal farm are taking their battle to court this week.
Steve and Bridget Tennes, owners of Country Mill Farms, are asking for a permanent court order forcing the city of East Lansing, Michigan to let them sell their products at the city's farmer's market.
The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) will represent the Tennes family in court this Friday. According to ADF, the City of Lansing blocked the Christian family from selling their products after reading on the Country Mill Farms' Facebook page that they support biblical marriage and will not allow LGBTQ weddings in their orchards.
""Our family farm here is very personal to us,"" Steve Tennes said in a statement on the ADF website. ""One of the things we really enjoy about our family farm here is (that) we are able to raise our five children here at the farm in accordance with our faith.""
In 2017, a federal judge issued a preliminary order forcing the city to allow the Tennes family to participate in the farmers market and said the city most likely violated their religious and free speech rights.
According to NBC News , East Lansing Mayor Mark Meadows said that temporary ruling only covered the 2017 market season. Meadows also said the city opposes the Tennes' ""corporate decision-making,"" not their religious beliefs.
""This doesn't have anything to do with Mr. Tennes,"" Meadows said. ""This has to do with the business.""
ADF Legal Counsel Kate Anderson strongly disagrees.
""All Americans should be free to live and speak according to their deeply held religious beliefs without fear of government punishment,"" said Anderson. ""Yet East Lansing officials changed their market policy to shut out Steve Tennes because they don't like his Catholic beliefs regarding marriage. Courts have repeatedly rejected these types of practices as unconstitutional discrimination.""
Steve and Bridget Tennes are military veterans and hope their case will help preserve the freedoms of other Americans.
""This isn't just about our ability to sell at the farmer's market. It's really about every American's right to make a living and not have to worry about being punished by the government,"" Steve said."

From the Rockies to the central plains and Great Lakes, millions of Americans are in the storm's path. This is the second potential ""bomb cyclone"" to bear down on the US in less than a month.
In Colorado, freezing temperatures and heavy snow prompted the state's governor to call in the National Guard. Troops rescued 75 people and two dogs from stranded vehicles southeast of Denver Wednesday night.
South Dakota has been one of the hardest hit states with more than 18 inches of snow recorded in some places.
Near whiteout conditions in Minnesota are shutting down highways.
And in other parts of the country, they're seeing severe flooding and wind.
A ""dustnado"" was spotted near Pueblo, Colorado and a ""blowing dust warning"" was issued near Lubbock, Texas where winds reached up to 70 miles per hour.
In the Northwest, the storm is causing serious flooding. Near Eugene, Oregon, boats could glide over one flooded highway.
The storm is also causing headaches at airports. At Denver International Airport, about half of all fights were cancelled Wednesday."

He's been identified as a local sheriff's deputy's son named Holden Matthews, 21.
As CBN News has reported, arson was suspected after fires broke out at St. Mary Baptist Church on March 26, the Greater Union Baptist Church on April 2, and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on April 4.
""It steals something from you. It robs you... I know their head is down. I know they're spiritually weakened,"" Pastor Toussaint of Mt. Pleasant Baptist said. ""It caused us to pray harder, and pray more frequently. This is the time for us to pull together.""
Officials have stated no injuries have been reported, saying the churches were empty when the fires started.
Gov. John Bel Edwards, the state fire marshal, and other federal and state law enforcement officials held a news conference Thursday to provide an update on the fires at the three historically African-American churches in St. Landry Parish. St. Landry Sheriff Bobby Guidroz confirmed that Matthews is the son of a deputy.
The Justice Department got involved in the investigation as officials tried to determine if the incidents were racially motivated.
""The US Attorney's Office, ATF, and FBI are working with state and local law enforcement and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the victims and those St. Landry Parish residents affected by these despicable acts,"" stated US Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana David C. Joseph.
The president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Derrick Johnson, released a statement calling the incidents ""domestic terrorism.""
""We must not turn a blind eye to any incident where people are targeted because of the color of their skin or their faith,"" he wrote. ""The spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country. But this is nothing new.""
And one church leader expressed concerns that the threat may not be over yet. ""I would like to know whether he was working alone or not. We can't let our guard down,"" said Rev. Freddie Jack of the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association.
A GoFundMe has been started to help the churches rebuild.
""St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, Greater Union Baptist Church, and Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas will benefit from your kind donations. Funds will be used for the rebuilding of all three churches. Your support in this effort is greatly appreciated,"" the page reads."

The move came after tens of thousands of protestors rallied for nearly four months against al-Bashir's rule. Security forces had recently tried to break up the demonstrations, killing at least 22 people in the violence that ensued.
""Since 1989, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir has ruled his nation with an iron fist,"" said CBN News Senior International Correspondent George Thomas.
""Under his reign, Christians and Muslims have endured the daily scourge of strict Islamic Sharia law leading to the arrest of numerous pastors, the closure of multiple churches and frequent targeting of those who decide to leave Islam and embrace Christianity,"" he said.
Al-Bashir had long been a pariah in many countries and he's even wanted by the international war crimes tribunal for atrocities in Darfur.
Sudan's defense minister announced al-Bashir had been overthrown on television, claiming that ""free and fair elections"" will be held after two years of transition.
He also says a state of emergency has been imposed for the next three months and that the military has suspended the constitution and closed the borders and air space.
""What comes next is equally of concern,"" Thomas cautioned.
""Sudan's military leaders have in essence replaced an aging military dictator with another military leader thus maintaining the status quo. That's why demonstrators are calling for a complete overhaul of the government and a peaceful transfer of power to civilian authorities,"" he said."
"'If At First You Don't Succeed, Try Again': Israel Unable to Safely Land on Moon But Hope Remains",www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/israel-hours-away-from-historic-moon-landing-heres-where-you-can-watch-it-too,"JERUSALEM, Israel - Israel was unsuccessful in making a historic landing on the moon Thursday evening.
""If at first you don't succeed, you try again,"" Israeli said.
The spacecraft reportedly experienced an engine failure just meters away from the moon's surface and crashed. Scientists lost communication with the craft.
Israel's Beresheet spacecraft was developed by a team of scientists from SpaceIL and Israel Space Industries (IAI) and was supposed to land on the moon approximately 10:25 p.m. (3:25 p.m. ET).
On Wednesday, the SpaceIL and IAI team successfully completed the last maneuver before landing.
The maneuver lowered the spacecraft’s altitude in preparation for its landing. Beresheet orbited the moon for several hours before scientists attempted to land it.
Beresheet's mission on the moon was supposed to last two to three days. The craft was sent to take pictures of the lunar surface and conduct experiments.
The spacecraft was also carrying with it God's written word to the moon. It had a time capsule containing a database of hundreds of files. The files included a copy of the Bible, information about SpaceIL, Israeli national symbols, and other materials.
The capsule was going to be left on the moon's surface after Israel completed its mission there.
Israeli leaders hoped the mission would have an ""Apollo Effect"" on Israeli youth.
""We want the Israeli kids and the Israeli youth to, we want to encourage them to learn STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and informatics - and we hope that they will have this mission [and] we will create the effect and encourage them,"" said SpaceIL CEO Dr. Ido Antebi.
President Reuven Rivlin said he used to dream of going to the moon
""When I was a child, we used to write fortunes on bubblegum wrappers – 'by the time you're 21, you'll go to the moon'. Then, it seemed fantastical, impossible. Until now, only great powers have landed on the moon – the United States, the Soviet Union and China. But if everything goes to plan, the State of Israel – our young and small country – will be the fourth country in history to land a spacecraft on the moon."""
"PAULA WHITE: How 'Unplanned' Became a Smash Hit, Despite Roadblocks by the Liberal Entertainment Mafia",www1.cbn.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/paula-white-how-unplanned-became-a-smash-hit-despite-roadblocks-by-the-liberal-entertainment-mafia,"PAULA WHITE: How 'Unplanned' Became a Smash Hit, Despite Roadblocks by the Liberal Entertainment Mafia 04-11-2019 Pastor Paula White
EXCLUSIVE COMMENTARY
""Unplanned,"" the beautifully produced true story of Planned Parenthood director-turned-pro-life activist Abby Johnson, is blowing away even the most optimistic estimates at the box office. The film's $6 million opening weekend doubled expectations, which is all the more shocking when you consider that the movie only opened on about 1,000 screens nationwide. That means it actually outperformed the mega-budget woke-feminist superhero romp ""Captain Marvel"" on a per-screen basis. That the film — which was produced independently of the Hollywood studio system, and was supported financially by Christian conservative icon Mike Lindell, the inventor and CEO of MyPillow — even made it to the big screen is a small miracle in itself. The entire liberal entertainment industry mafia banded together with their friends in the business world to thwart this little movie that could. Why? Because if there's anything Hollywood hates, it's people who dare to question the liberal orthodoxy that now undergirds even the most apolitical-seeming studio films today. Those who question that orthodoxy are risking their careers. As the producers of ""Unplanned"" learned, there is no article of faith so central to Hollywood as abortion. The notion that someone was making a pro-life film was enough to send Hollywood's power brokers into such a rage that they did whatever they could to stifle this production that had nothing to do with them. When the film was in production, record companies refused to license music — normally a routine transaction — at any price. They were explicit that it was because they would not allow their music to appear in a Christian movie that doesn't treat abortion the way they'd like. Disney even had the gall to tell ""Unplanned's"" producers that ""Disney does not take sides in such social issues."" Really? Because Disney seems to take plenty of sides on other social issues, both on screen and off. One wonders what that famous studio's devoutly Christian and politically conservative founder would think of his company denying a simple song license to a Christian movie producer because it doesn't want to be perceived as pro-life. Maybe he would just be glad we don't yet have ""a Disney princess who's had an abortion."" Song licensing was hardly the end of ""Unplanned's"" troubles with the entertainment establishment. The Motion Picture Association of America slapped the finished film with an adults-only ""R"" rating, dramatically cutting into its potential audience and actually forcing a Christian radio station to drop ""Unplanned"" ads because of a policy against supporting R-rated movies. Despite a total lack of sex, violence, or profanity, the blood shown in an abortion scene was all it took for the rating board that handed ""Taken"" — a movie about a man torturing criminals to death to save his daughter from forced prostitution — a ""PG-13"" rating. Even after ""Unplanned"" was ""in the can,"" its woes weren't over. Every TV network except Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network refused to run ads for its release. Promotion is absolutely essential in the movie business. Without it, you're dead. But it's 2019, so the producers of ""Unplanned"" thought they could just turn to social media to get the word out. Wrong. At the critical juncture, the day after the film's release, Twitter ""accidentally"" banned ""Unplanned's"" account. Given Big Tech's record of treating the speech of Christians and pro-lifers as inherently toxic, color me skeptical. At least this time, the plan backfired. Following a public uproar, the reinstated ""Unplanned"" account quickly gained more followers than Abby Johnson's old employer, Planned Parenthood. Hollywood liberals still aren't letting up, though. Even with opening weekend over and done with, they're still lining up to pan the film that — somehow — I doubt many of them have actually even seen. ""Unplanned"" is already a smash hit, and there's nothing Hollywood can do to stop that now. Ironically, the film's runaway success will probably lead to even more movies just like it. Powerful messages that defend life and celebrate true heroines can't be contained, not even by the best efforts of some of the most powerful liberals on the planet. Paula White is the senior pastor of New Destiny Christian Center.

About 900 million people are eligible to vote in the election, which has been dubbed as something of a referendum on current Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Burning a Thousand Bibles According to Open Doors USA, India is the tenth most-persecuted nation on Earth in which to live as a Christian. The predominant religion, Hinduism, has within it a radical sect that is fiercely anti-Christian. Many instances of beatings, public humiliation and even murder have been reported over the last few years.
“Driven by a desire to cleanse their country from Islam and Christianity, nationalists do not shy away from using extensive violence to achieve their goals,” Open Doors USA noted in its factsheet.
More recently, however, an incident of desecration was caught on camera — the public burning of a thousand Bibles.

Israel Still a Small Country With Big Dreams After Unsuccessful Moon Landing,www1.cbn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/israel-still-a-small-country-with-big-dreams-after-unsuccessful-moon-landing,"Israel Still a Small Country With Big Dreams After Unsuccessful Moon Landing 04-12-2019
Leaders in Israel’s space industry hope to try again to land a spacecraft on the moon. Their first lunar craft crashed, just miles away from its goal of putting down on the moon’s surface.
Before the spacecraft’s final descent, Israeli pioneers hoped for success.
“Eight and a half years in the making, so many engineers both in SpaceIL, Israel Aerospace Industries, donors, supporters, volunteers and it’s all coming down to this. This baby here is going to get to the surface of the moon. The only question is in how many pieces,” Space IL Co-Founder Jonathan Winetraub told CBN News before the landing attempt.
SpaceIL’s major donor, Morris Kahn, explained the name of the spacecraft.
“‘Beeresheet’ is the first word in our Bible, it is ‘in the beginning. And I think for us this is the beginning. And for Space IL and for Israel Aircraft Industry, this is the beginning,” he said.
But on the verge of history, Israel’s spacecraft “Beresheet” fell just short.
""It seems that the failure in our inertial measurements’ unit caused a chain of events in the spacecraft's avionics which cut off the engines and caused us to lose the mission,” Israel Aerospace Industries’ Opher Doron told the live audience who gathered to watch the landing.
The attempted moon landing began as a dream by three Israeli engineers eight and a half years ago. Despite the failure, it still represents the epitome of Israel as the startup nation.
“It’s a story that shows a lot about Israel. How three young engineers sitting in a bar can just pull Israel after them and make this a reality,” said SpaceIL Co-Founder Yariv Bash.
They want to inspire the next generation.
“We’ve met more than a million kids in Israel and around the world and gave them the message that science and technology can be fun. It can be cool,” said SpaceIL Kfir Damari.
SpaceIL became only the seventh nation to put a spacecraft in lunar orbit and the first privately-funded mission to the moon.
“For a small country like Israel, even smaller company or association like SpaceIL it’s a huge achievement,” said SpaceIL program director Yigal Harel.
“My message is for the kids,” Winetraub added. “This is hard. It is rocket science. Science and engineering is difficult. It doesn’t always work the first time. But you have to pick yourself up and try again.”
Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged the space team to go on.
“If you don’t succeed at first, try again,” he said.
The spacecraft carried a nano copy of the Bible on board.
Before its final descent, the spacecraft took a selfie with a banner that read, “Small country, big dreams.”"

(Image courtesy: Joni and Friends)
Joni Eareckson Tada, founder of the Joni and Friends global ministry serving those with disabilities, has announced she is no longer in the hospital after a recent health scare. Tada was hospitalized on March 29 after getting sick while recovering from treatment for breast cancer. She had completed a series of radiation treatments but started to face severe health challenges. She spent 14 days in the hospital being treated for pneumonia before being released on Tuesday, April 9th. But while she was there, doctors realized she had deeper underlying lung condition beyond the pneumonia. ""It's been quite a journey since March 27th when Ken rushed me to ER,"" shared Tada. ""Basically, over the many years, my chronic quadriplegia has put a strain on my heart and lungs."" ""The good news is, doctors believe that with medication and with a more efficient way of breathing, my condition can be reversed,"" she continued.
""My assignment over the last 14 days of hospitalization was straight out of Acts 20:24, ""But life is worth nothing unless I use it for doing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus – the work of telling others the Good News about God's almighty kindness and love"" (TLB),"" she added. ""When nurses and aides, respiratory therapists, and doctors asked how I was doing, I could say, 'Jesus gives me His peace.

JERUSALEM, Israel - Israeli archaeologists have given new life to the ancient stone room traditionally believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper on Mt. Zion in Jerusalem.
The Cenacle's ancient walls, worn-down surfaces, and poor illumination have made it hard for researchers to study its history. Thousands of Christian tourists go there every year to visit the possible location of the Last Supper. Jewish tradition says it was built above the burial site of King David.
Reuters reports that archeologists from Israel's Antiquities Authority and European research institutions used laser technology and advanced photography to create incredibly detailed three-dimensional models of the hall.

""We managed to reach every corner of the building. We managed to create 3D models of this wonderful and sanctified place,"" archaeologist Amit Re'em told Reuters of the project, which began in 2016. ""We managed in one of the ... holiest places in Jerusalem, to use this technology and this is a breakthrough.""
The technology helped uncover old artwork on the walls and decipher religious symbols. Re'em said they found symbols of the ""Lion of Judah"" and ""Angus Dei"", a lamb that represents Jesus.
""It tells the story of this room,"" Re'em said.
""It delivers the message of the Last (Supper) Room, Christ as a Messiah, as victorious, as a victim - and the lion, the lion is a symbol of the Davidic dynasty. They combine together in this room.""
In Christian tradition, it is more than the site of the Last Supper. It was also the room where early believers encountered the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
The early history of the site is uncertain but scholars believe the arch-filled hall was built by crusaders 800 years ago upon the remnants of an ancient Byzantine Church. They also believe early Jewish Christians worshipped there.
The building was renovated to its current form in 1335 by Franciscan monks.
Ilya Berkovich, a historian at the INZ research institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences who worked on the project, said the project opens ""incredibly new horizons"" with potential for future study."

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has signed into law a bill that bans abortions after the baby's heart starts beating, which can be as early as five or six weeks into pregnancy.
Senate Bill 23, also dubbed the ""heartbeat bill"" makes it a fifth-degree felony for a medical professional to perform an abortion after the child's heart has already begun beating. The bill has an exception to save the life of a mother, but there are no exceptions for rape and incest.
The Republican governor's decision makes Ohio the sixth state in the nation to pass a heartbeat law. Ohio's previous governor, Republican John Kasich vetoed the measure twice while he was in office. He believed the law would spark an expensive court battle and likely be found unconstitutional.
The American Civil Liberties Union immediately threatened to take legal action against Ohio for the newly passed heartbeat bill.

"Bomb Cyclone' Unleashes New Hardship on Flood-Ravaged Nebraska, Midwest",www1.cbn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/bomb-cyclone-unleashes-new-hardship-on-flood-ravaged-nebraska-midwest,"Bomb Cyclone' Unleashes New Hardship on Flood-Ravaged Nebraska, Midwest
After being hit by devastating floods from a late winter storm one month ago, Americans in parts of the Midwest are experiencing hardship once again.
It seemed more like late January than mid-April when this second ""bomb cyclone"" struck millions of Americans. A bomb cyclone is when cold air meets warm air and brings freezing temperatures, high winds and heavy snow.
This one brought up to 30-inches of snow to parts of the Midwest, 70-mile per hour winds, and travel chaos from Colorado to Texas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas.
That's the same region of the country that was hit by a bomb cyclone that caused historic flooding in mid-March.
And driving conditions? ""The roads are terrible,"" said one South Dakota sheriff's department spokesman.
In many parts of the Midwest, road conditions remain life-threatening and hazardous.
At one point on Thursday, at least 500 crashes were reported on roads and highways in Minnesota. Truckers transporting consumer goods and agricultural products to market were stranded in South Dakota.
""With snow and ice and the wind blowing, its quite an experience. It's been kind of rough with the rolling black out because the truck stop has been shut down basically,"" explained Jeff Mitchell, a truck driver from Tucson, Arizona. ""We can't get in to get any food or anything but we have plenty with us. We were well prepared.""
Thousands of flights were cancelled throughout the region and at least 25,000 homes were without power in parts of Minnesota and South Dakota.
In Nebraska where people are still recovering from last month's floods, farmer Brad Wilkins said, ""Instead of Nebraska Strong it should be Nebraska tired.""
But the heavy snowfall hasn't prevented Wilkins from operating his feed and grain business. ""Our producers that are out there are putting in 18-20 hours a day because in weather like this you have to be out there checking mama cows,"" he explained.
Just one month ago, Nebraskans suffered their worst flood in recorded history. Wilkins said it is like deja vu. ""This feels like Groundhog's Day. Couple weeks ago we had about the same situation and the ground was not thawed and that caused flooding situations. Although the water is down now, the infrastructure is still really compromised.""
Wilkins is concerned for his fellow farmers who are stressed and overburdened financially, mentally and physically from devastating loss and hardship.
He urges them to seek help from a pastor or trusted friends. ""Whether it's our faith communities or whatever, we just need to. We're ALL in this together and we'll get through it together."""
WATCH: Hindu Radicals Burn a Thousand Bibles as Historic Indian Election Gets Underway | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,"Will Maule, Faithwire",04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/watch-hindu-radicals-burn-a-thousand-bibles-as-historic-indian-election-gets-underway,"As India plays host to the biggest democratic election in history, the country’s rampant anti-Christian sentiment has beeing coming to the fore. Some 900 million people are eligible to vote in the election, which has been dubbed as something of a referendum on current Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Burning a Thousand Bibles According to Open Doors USA, is the tenth most-persecuted nation on Earth in which to live as a Christian. The predominant religion, Hinduism, has within it a radical sect that is fiercely anti-Christian. Many instances of beatings, public humiliation and even murder have been reported over the last few years.
“Driven by a desire to cleanse their country from Islam and Christianity, nationalists do not shy away from using extensive violence to achieve their goals,” Open Doors USA noted in its factsheet.
More recently, however, an incident of desecration was caught on camera — the public burning of a thousand Bibles.
“Radical Hindus seized and burned these Bibles and threatened the Christians who were legally distributing them,” International Christian Concern wrote in its report of the incident. “Satan, is committed to silencing God’s Word, and he will use people to fit his agenda. Please join with us in praying for those who destroy Bibles even as we replace Scripture!”

1000 BIBLES BURNED: In India, 'nearly 1,000 Bibles were burned in a single incident' says @persecutionnews . Yet, Christians endure: “Persecution is like a blessing for me. Everybody does not get this privilege, to suffer for His name sake.""- Indian pastor. #IndiaElections2019 pic.twitter.com/xRwQzY10Ap
— George Thomas (@GTReporting) April 11, 2019
Despite this blatant show of intolerance and anti-Christian bias, the faithful community of Jesus-followers in this region continue to stay strong.
“Persecution is like a blessing for me,” said one pastor close to the Bible burning incident. “Everybody does not get this privilege, to suffer for His name sake.”
Despite the archaic “caste system” and systemic religious persecution, India actually has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Since Prime Minister Modi was last elected in 2014, almost $200 billion has been invested by foreign companies such as Amazon, Apple and Walmart.
Do continue to pray for all those around the world who suffer for their faith in Jesus.

Their first lunar craft crashed, just miles away from its goal of putting down on the moon’s surface.
Before the spacecraft’s final descent, Israeli pioneers hoped for success.
“Eight and a half years in the making, so many engineers both in SpaceIL, Israel Aerospace Industries, donors, supporters, volunteers and it’s all coming down to this. This baby here is going to get to the surface of the moon. The only question is in how many pieces,” Space IL Co-Founder Jonathan Winetraub told CBN News before the landing attempt.
SpaceIL’s major donor, Morris Kahn, explained the name of the spacecraft.
“‘Beeresheet’ is the first word in our Bible, it is ‘in the beginning. And I think for us this is the beginning. And for Space IL and for Israel Aircraft Industry, this is the beginning,” he said.
But on the verge of history, Israel’s spacecraft “Beresheet” fell just short.
""It seems that the failure in our inertial measurements’ unit caused a chain of events in the spacecraft's avionics which cut off the engines and caused us to lose the mission,” Israel Aerospace Industries’ Opher Doron told the live audience who gathered to watch the landing.
The attempted moon landing began as a dream by three Israeli engineers eight and a half years ago. Despite the failure, it still represents the epitome of Israel as the startup nation.
“It’s a story that shows a lot about Israel. How three young engineers sitting in a bar can just pull Israel after them and make this a reality,” said SpaceIL Co-Founder Yariv Bash.
They want to inspire the next generation.
“We’ve met more than a million kids in Israel and around the world and gave them the message that science and technology can be fun. It can be cool,” said SpaceIL Kfir Damari.
SpaceIL became only the seventh nation to put a spacecraft in lunar orbit and the first privately-funded mission to the moon.
“For a small country like Israel, even smaller company or association like SpaceIL it’s a huge achievement,” said SpaceIL program director Yigal Harel.
“My message is for the kids,” Winetraub added. “This is hard. It is rocket science. Science and engineering is difficult. It doesn’t always work the first time. But you have to pick yourself up and try again.”
Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged the space team to go on.
“If you don’t succeed at first, try again,” he said.
The spacecraft carried a nano copy of the Bible on board.
Before its final descent, the spacecraft took a selfie with a banner that read, “Small country, big dreams.”"

Abortion provider Planned Parenthood's phone number could soon be on basically every California school student's ID from ages 12 to 24 – even at private Christian schools.
California lawmakers just pushed bill AB 624 through a committee this week – it requires ""a sexual or reproductive health hotline"" to be on the ID's.
SaveCalifornia.com's Randy Thomasson points out that the Supreme Court actually ruled in 2018 against forcing anyone to support pro-abortion messages against their beliefs.
""But neither the US Constitution nor the decisions of the US Supreme Court matter to Planned Parenthood abortionists or their bought-and-owned politicians. They want free advertising for new abortion customers as young as 12 years old,"" Thomasson said.
He says the sponsor of the bill, Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel , received a Planned Parenthood endorsement and a $4,400 campaign contribution.
The California Family Council says the measure would turn students into a ""Walking Billboard for Abortions"".
""The audacity of some legislators to use state power to indoctrinate California's students seems to have no limits,"" said California Family Council President Jonathan Keller.

Conservatives say the idea is unconstitutional.
""Legislators failed at forcing pro-life pregnancy clinics in California to advertise Planned Parenthood's pro-abortion message, so now they are trying to compel every school in the state to promote Planned Parenthood's culture-destroying values,"" Keller said. ""Last year, the US Supreme Court made it clear they would not tolerate California's authoritarian attempts to coerce speech. Hopefully, it will not take another judicial defeat for Sacramento to learn its lesson.""
The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) says, ""AB 624 compels students at all public and private high schools and colleges to be walking advertisements for abortion providers. It forces private religious schools who oppose abortion, or simply do not want to speak on reproductive health, to design, produce, and distribute student IDs with contact information for a 'sexual or reproductive health hotline'.""
ADF believes the bill would not survive if it's passed and ends up in the courts.
""It requires private, religious schools to create speech that supports activities that directly conflict with the values the schools seek to teach their students. Such compelled speech, especially on controversial issues like abortion and sexuality, violate the First Amendment rights of students and educational institutions alike,"" ADF states.

'This is a Breakthrough': Israeli Archaeologists Uncover Jesus' Last Supper Room in a Way You've Never Seen Before - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/this-is-a-breakthrough-israeli-archaeologists-use-laser-technology-to-uncover-the-last-supper-room-in-a-way-youve-never-seen-before,"Homepage Israel News CBNNews.com 'This is a Breakthrough': Israeli Archaeologists Uncover Jesus' Last Supper Room in a Way You've Never Seen Before 04-12-2019 Emily Jones 'The Last Supper' by Leonardo da Vinci / Courtesy: Wikicommons
JERUSALEM, Israel - Israeli archaeologists have given new life to the ancient stone room traditionally believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper on Mt. Zion in Jerusalem.
The Cenacle's ancient walls, worn-down surfaces, and poor illumination have made it hard for researchers to study its history. Thousands of Christian tourists go there every year to visit the possible location of the Last Supper. Jewish tradition says it was built above the burial site of King David.
Reuters reports that archeologists from Israel's Antiquities Authority and European research institutions used laser technology and advanced photography to create incredibly detailed three-dimensional models of the hall.
Click below to see laser images:
""We managed to reach every corner of the building. We managed to create 3D models of this wonderful and sanctified place,"" archaeologist Amit Re'em told Reuters of the project, which began in 2016. ""We managed in one of the ... holiest places in Jerusalem, to use this technology and this is a breakthrough.""
The technology helped uncover old artwork on the walls and decipher religious symbols. Re'em said they found symbols of the ""Lion of Judah"" and ""Angus Dei"", a lamb that represents Jesus.
""It tells the story of this room,"" Re'em said.
""It delivers the message of the Last (Supper) Room, Christ as a Messiah, as victorious, as a victim - and the lion, the lion is a symbol of the Davidic dynasty. They combine together in this room.""
In Christian tradition, it is more than the site of the Last Supper. It was also the room where early believers encountered the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
The early history of the site is uncertain but scholars believe the arch-filled hall was built by crusaders 800 years ago upon the remnants of an ancient Byzantine Church. They also believe early Jewish Christians worshipped there.
The building was renovated to its current form in 1335 by Franciscan monks.
Ilya Berkovich, a historian at the INZ research institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences who worked on the project, said the project opens ""incredibly new horizons"" with potential for future study."
New Pilgrim’s Progress Movie a Time-Tested Classic with a Missions Mindset,feeds.cbn.com,Chris.Carpenter,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/movies/new-pilgrims-progress-movie-time-tested-classic-missions-mindset,"New Pilgrim’s Progress Movie a Time-Tested Classic with a Missions Mindset Related Chris Carpenter - Director of Internet Programming
I guess you could say The Pilgrim’s Progress is a movie that was 340 years in the making. However, this is not the classic Hollywood story of a book being optioned by a movie studio and then sitting in filmmaking purgatory for decades … or in this case, centuries.
The Pilgrim’s Progress took a very long time to make its journey from page to screen because, well, John Bunyan wrote it in 1678. Since then, it has been translated into more than 200 languages and has never been out of print. While seven other movies have been based on the book previously, this is the first animated version to be produced.
Find a theater near you to see The Pilgrim's Progress live movie event.
I recently sat down with The Pilgrim’s Progress executive producer Steve Cleary to determine why this time-tested allegory still resonates with audiences today, why his team chose to make an animated feature rather than a live action movie, and his global vision for showing it around the world for free.
The Pilgrim’s Progress is a classic book that was written and first published 340 years ago yet still resonates today. Why are you so passionate about the story of The Pilgrim’s Progress?
John Bunyan is a Christian hero of mine. He was in prison for 12 years. He's away from his wife, he's away from his kids, but he chooses to serve God in this capacity. And then God gives him this amazing allegory called The Pilgrim's Progress . And now you think that's 340 years ago. This is a very old story. How's that relevant to today? The Bible is still as relevant today as it was when it was written. The same is true about The Pilgrim's Progress because it is the story of every believer. I am on a journey. You are on a journey. Everybody who is reading this is on a journey. Even if you say you are not, you are. You're on a path and that path will lead to a destination.
And the question is what destination does that lead to? The allegory points to a eternal city where the king is obviously Jesus Christ. We know from Scripture that this world is not the destination. This world will face destruction. This world will face judgment and God will restore his perfect creation. We are on that same journey and we have a destination which is heaven and to be with Christ, to be with God the Father. Along that journey what do we face? We face trials, tribulations, and temptations. That's what The Pilgrim's Progress reveals.
The main character Christian has demons. That's a spiritual battle. It's spiritual warfare. So we're all on a spiritual journey and it's the story of every one of us. That's why it's really stood the test of time.
In your retelling of the story, what is the same about The Pilgrim’s Progress and what might be different? How do you modernize it so to speak to create interest from contemporary audiences?
We really kept the movie tightly aligned with the book. My goal was that if John Bunyan were alive today and watched the movie he would be honored by our presentation of his book. We kept all the major characters. We kept their names. We kept their traits. We kept all the major locations. People that are extremely familiar with the book have said that it mimes very well. We obviously could not tell the whole story.
There are more than 100 characters in the book. So we have a lot of characters in the movie, but we could not maintain every character. If we did it would be a six-hour film. So we had it narrowed down to under two hours. We added supervisors that are the demons that kind of piece the story together. There was obviously an evil force at work that does not want Christian arriving in the Celestial City. They tried to stop him along the way. So in the book they did not have characters as supervisors. We added that to the movie and it worked very smoothly to help move the story along and understand the powers of darkness.
Why did you choose the animation route over a live action retelling of the story?
There were a couple of major reasons. One, to do a live action film would just be astronomically expensive. For example, Giant Despair in our film is 30 feet tall. It would take a lot of special effects to do this movie the right way.
CGI (computer generated imagery) is expensive in itself. It's the most expensive form of animation because the detail that goes in with the textures and the 3D approach to the film. But the other reason why is when I share this on the mission field, even in dangerous countries, animation is received differently than live action. I've experienced this personally. I've been in Colombia to guerrilla camps, and if I was to give them a Bible, or if I was to show up with a preacher, we would be dead. But when I show up with a children's illustrated Bible and an animated movie, they welcome me in. We actually have seen this happen because animation lives in its own world. They view a pastor and print as propaganda and politics. However, they view illustrations and animations as storytelling.
A lot of people that are persecuted Christians, they're not necessarily atheist. They believe in something but they're against the doctrine that they're teaching. So, we still go back to the basics and we can show Hindus, Muslims, and even terrorist groups an animated film and they will watch it. Our prayer is that the Holy Spirit will begin to plant seeds and convict them of the ways they've chosen their violence and turn them toward Jesus Christ. Animation translates amazingly well.
We think The Pilgrim’s Progress will be a little bit safer to show because it's animation and it lives in its own world. So there was no human person on the screen telling you how you should think or telling you what they believe.
It's pure imagination. It allows you to consider what the character is saying because it's not real. Oftentimes it can be a true story, but it can also be a made up story that proves a point. The Pilgrim's Progress is like a big parable. It's this make believe story that reveals Biblical truth. And it does open doors.
As you have mentioned, one very unique part of this production is the heart for missions behind the film. What is the global vision for The Pilgrim’s Progress ? How do you plan to give away the film around the world?
Our film is free to the missionary and free to any non-commercial mission activity in any language, and in any country. And we are busy. We are already in production in four languages. Our goal is to be translated into 100 languages. We have determined that with 100 languages you can reach over 90% of the world. I would love to have the faith to translate The Pilgrim’s Progress into a thousand. The Jesus film has been translated into more than1,700 languages. We want to follow in their footsteps.
I think that story of Pilgrim’s Progress is an incredible door opener. So now I imagine what about overseas? What if they bring in families and show this film on some night and it's this animated entertaining film that shows about the journey and reveals the king, the king who wants us to be with him in eternity. Then they watch the Jesus film and they see the working out of the King. That's it. Jesus is the King. I think this is a tremendous opportunity. We are committed to be free. We're not free to the theaters, we’re not free to retail stores, but we're free to missions.
That might be a Sunday school teacher who has no budget. That might be a prison chaplain or a Salvation Army center. That might be a homeless shelter. It doesn't always have to be overseas. It can be right here in our own communities. I don't own The Pilgrim's Progress . John Bunyan wrote it and it's in the public domain. I had rights to it but it’s not my story. It's John Bunyan’s story but he would tell you it's not his story either. It's a story inspired by God and the Holy Spirit. This is a tool that belongs to the church and we want to handle it carefully. We want to handle it with honor and respect. We want it to continue going out freely to missions. This makes it hard to attract investors when you say you're going to give you a movie away for free. But we've done it.
After people have seen The Pilgrim’s Progress , from your perspective, what would you like audiences to take away from the film? What is your greatest hope for the movie?
Our big dream for the movie is for it to be the most watched animated film on the mission field and to be the second most watched film period after the Jesus film. We really have a desire to let it be seen by the world and that is already happening. Completing the film was a five-year milestone. So now I want to spend the next five years distributing it for the mission field. For people who watch it, my personal goal is that number one, you wake up every day saying, what path am I on? One line from the movie is ‘help in some form or another is never far off.’ That’s what I want our audience to realize. That there is a straight path and there is a King who is going to help us on that straight path. And then I want you to say, how can I use this film to help lead others to the straight path? How can I use it to help evangelize? Could I invite my neighbors over?
This is an easy tool to start sharing the Gospel and not simply saying, would you pray with me right now? But actually talking to somebody about their faith, their journey, and their destination. Have an ongoing conversation with people about their life. You have a King who's going to help you every step of the way. I want people to embrace it, share it, and then talk about it."

From the moment the first trailer hit, Little looked big. Sure, 14-year-old TV star Marsai Martin 's movie looks like Tom Hanks' classic Big in reverse. But, the trailer just makes it look so fun.
The pint-sized actress, now film producer, shakes things up in this more-often-than-not funny PG-13 flick. It's from one of the producers of Girls Trip , so there's a clue right there that it might have suggestive humor. Well, it has that and some offensive language too (more on that later).
Martin stars as the middle school version of tyranical boss Jordan Sanders ( Regina Hall ). When Jordan's assistant, April ( Issa Rae ) discovers that her mean girl boss has turned back into a child, things get a little crazy. With no way of fixing the 'curse', Jordan is forced to relive her childhood. She goes from bully to being bullied all over again. And, her strong will isn't easily broken. This lesson in humility takes its time and its toll.
Little 's fun cast and moments of creative comedy are brought down by the film's mishaps. It's a missed opportunity mainly due to its PG-13 rated humor. The story presents as family-friendly movie gold, but doesn't deliver on kid-friendliness because of the film's foul language and suggestive dialogue. Parts of the storyline also could use some tweaking. A few fun characters never reappear and one of the third act scenes leaves you questioning: where are the teachers/adults?
All in all, Little might make you laugh, but it'll probably make you cringe a couple of times too. What's certain though is that this isn't the last we will see of the talented Ms. Marsai Martin . Show Guest Bio:"
Corbin Bernsen: 'Pursue with Faith toward Heaven',feeds.cbn.com,Hannah.Goodwyn,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/movies/corbin-bernsen-pursue-faith-sunrise-in-heaven,"Hannah Goodwyn - Senior Producer
For 8 seasons, actor Corbin Bernsen played the role of Shawn's cop dad on USA Network's Psych . This month, he's back in Canada filming with the original cast for Psych: The Movie 2 (set to air later this year).
Recently, I spoke with Bernsen on the phone for a few moments about the highly anticipated TV movie that reunites the popular Psych cast. But, more than that we talked about his new Christian film, Sunrise in Heaven , which led to a deeper discussion about his personal faith and how prayer plays a big role in his life.
Originally approached as a potential director for the film, Sunrise in Heaven turned into an acting gig for Bernsen. Time constraints dictated he stick with portraying the film's protective dad, Jim. The fatherly role is one he's, of course, played before - especially on Psych . However, this time, Bernsen's character is a strict military father to a beautiful daughter named Jan.
Watch a clip of Corbin Bernsen in Sunrise in Heaven :
Based on true events, Sunrise in Heaven tells the love and life story of Jan and Steve Hurst, how they met, fell in love, and how tragedy tears their world apart. Faith and prayer become important parts of their story and the film, something Bernsen appreciates, being a Christian himself.
""We're born into this unbelievable gift that God's given us,"" Bernsen says.
On this incredible journey we call life, most of us hit roadblocks, tragedies that attempt to and sometimes derail us. Bernsen has encountered his share of obstacles. But, his faith 'carries him through'.
""What doesn't kill you ... only makes you stronger in your faith and your relationship with God,"" he says. ""If you have that faith, you have something that drives you through that, knock that obstacle, knock that evil, knock that problem out of the way. Pursue with faith toward Heaven.""
""One of the ways to deal with that gauntlet is to pray,"" Bernsen says. ""I pray to God, but very privately. It's a very private thing to me when I want to connect with God.""
""I don't think it has to have a lot of holy words in it,"" he says. ""Real prayer is you just communicate with your Creator. [Even if] you're yelling at God, you're still communicating with God. That's what God wants. God just wants the conversation. You can be angry. He's OK with that.""
So, how does his faith fit in with his work in film and television?
""I think God put me in this position to be making films that appeal to people just like me, who are constantly exploring our faith, widening faith, getting closer to God, running the gauntlet."""
Do You Want Your Health Plan Replaced with Medicare? Bernie Sanders and These 2020 Candidates Do,www1.cbn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/do-you-want-your-health-plan-replaced-with-medicare-bernie-sanders-and-these-2020-candidates-do,"Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (Photo: screen capture) 6025756385001 Do You Want Your Health Plan Replaced with Medicare? Bernie Sanders and These 2020 Candidates Do
Health care is emerging as the first major campaign issue of the 2020 election. This week Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) unveiled his plan to eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government run program.
""Together we are going to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great country, being the only major nation on earth not to guarantee health care to all as a right,"" Sanders told a cheering crowd on Capitol Hill.
Polls show Sanders as the early leader among Democratic presidential candidates. Now that his big ""Medicare for All"" plan is out, his primary opponents are either fighting it, or trying to get a piece of the action. ""I don't agree with Senator Sanders' single payer approach,"" said Democrat presidential candidate John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) took the middle ground saying, ""It could be a possibility in the future.""
Other candidates are lining up to co-sponsor the bill: Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ""Health care must be a right, not a privilege,"" said Gillibrand. ""This has to become the next social safety net, it has to become something that is there for you no matter what."" But that safety net could prove dangerously expensive. Independent estimates put the plan costing anywhere from $25- to $35-trillion over just 10 years. ""That price is so steep that even left-leaning analysts are quietly admitting that the tax burden is virtually certain to land on the shoulders of the middle class,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) claimed on the Senate floor this week. McConnell could possibly bring the bill up for a vote to make a point as he did with the Democrats' ""Green New Deal"". Some Republicans are hopeful he'll do this to get Democrats on the record on the issue.
""I think it deserves a full debate and a vote and see how many Democrats who are co-sponsors actually support it,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). ""It might be interesting to put a Medicare for all plan on the floor for a vote to see where Democrats really stand,"" echoed Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND). Cramer believes a vote would showcase divisions among Democrats. ""They will quickly gravitate toward the middle where reality exists,"" he continued. Under the plan, some 180 million Americans would see their private health insurance replaced with a public plan. ""What you end up with is you don't have Medicare for all, you have a bunch of people that have inferior or no coverage,"" added Cramer. The White House says Republicans are working on ""realistic solutions,"" and President Trump says a ""really great health care plan"" will be ready right after the 2020 election. ""I personally think there's some risk in that approach,"" Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told CBN News. ""We've got to make sure we're articulating something to counterpunch it and be really good at explaining what a disaster that would be.""
Braun says he agrees with McConnell that the GOP plan is not ready for primetime, but adds his party has to come up with a fix for a ""basketcase"" health care system. ""We've got to be unveiling it and building it into 2020 and maybe the formal presentation can be after 2020,"" added Braun.
Braun believes a Republican plan must differ from Obamacare, but cover pre-existing conditions and allow kids to stay on their parents plans until 26.
""No one should ever go broke because they get sick or have a bad accident,"" added Braun. ""We just have to figure out how to get the industry galvanized to start fixing themselves. I put a lot of the blame on big pharma, big hospitals - just speaking with some ophthalmologists just a moment ago, doctors and providers you know are maybe 25-30% of the health care tab – they're worried you know what life's going to look like a few years down the road.""
""So many of these industries have evolved to where big industries dominate the dynamic, and I put the responsibility mostly on them,"" said Braun."

The pro-life movement is working in a bold venue to deliver its message – with two major events in Times Square, right in the heart of New York City.
Next month, Focus on the Family will take over Times Square with a Live ultrasound of a baby in the womb. And this week, Students for Life of America have been protesting in several big ways.
Students from across America came to Times Square with a message that their generation is the pro-life generation.
Their unusual method: Rallying with 900 crosses representing the 900 babies that are killed daily at Planned Parenthood clinics across the country.
Another big visual for the group: A digital billboard that's rotating for three days with pro-life messages, including one that says only seven percent of millennials support abortion extremism.
It's all part of a pushback from numerous pro-life groups in response to legislation that New York passed earlier this year. The broad new law has been labeled extreme because it allows abortion up to birth, and it may already be changing attitudes. In February, a Marist Poll found that Democrats who identify as pro-life jumped from 20 to 34 percent.
The head of Democrats for Life says they're seeing their numbers go up, crediting New York and other states that have recently considered legalizing abortion through the third trimester. Kristen Day from Democrats for Life says, ""I think what has helped is the recent move by New York and Virginia and other states to redefine what it means to be pro-choice to someone who supports abortion up to 9 months and even after.""
Pro-lifers will head to New York again in three weeks on May 4 for a Focus on the Family LIVE ultrasound in Times Square. Focus on the Family President Jim Daly says it has the potential to change hearts and minds.
""We'll have great speakers. We're going to have music, but we're also going to do a Live ultrasound of a third-trimester baby,"" he tells CBN News. ""There is no way a person is going to be able to say, 'That is not a child.' It is a child and we want everyone to see it.""
Daly recently announced the upcoming Live 4-D ultrasound on CBN News' ""Faith Nation.""

Most of us are used to seeing 2-D ultrasounds which provide a static image, or even a 3-D ultrasound which merges 2-D images from different angles.
But 4-D adds the dimension of time so people in Times Square will be able to see a Live video of a baby moving around in the womb, kicking, stretching, or doing whatever he or she decides to do for the world to see. "

Peggy Rowe recently told “The Pure Flix Podcast” that she’s simply hoping to have a positive impact on culture .
“I can’t control what happens in the world. I can only control my little piece of the world and that is my writing,” she said. “And in my book about my mother I have written stories that will honestly make you feel good and give you hope and make you laugh also.”
Rowe continued, ""That's my contribution to the world.""
Listen to Mike and Peggy Rowe talk about this and much more at the 28:30-mark:
Peggy also revealed some fascinating — and surprising — details about her son, Mike Rowe.
""Mike was very shy,"" she said of her son's childhood demeanor. ""He hated meeting strangers.""
Mike Rowe — a man known for his ability to talk — chimed in on the irony, proclaiming, “I can neither confirm nor deny anything my mother is saying.”
Peggy has gained attention in recent years after her son started sharing her comical text messages to him with the world. And now Mike believes that his mom’s book could really help make an impact on the culture.

“What my mom has done with these stories, in my view, is tap the country on the shoulder and remind us that there’s more to life than the stuff that’s in the headlines,” he said.
Mike Rowe said that “we’re living in a terribly fractured time when most of the country can’t seem to agree on anything.” In his own career, he said he has aimed to look for “universally relevant” themes, and to explore those issues for the public.
It seems his mother is following the same playbook. Find out more about “ About My Mother: True Stories of a Horse-Crazy Daughter and Her Baseball-Obsessed Mother .”
As Pure Flix Insider previously reported , Rowe also addressed the divides that plague the nation and the “kinder, gentler way of communicating that used to be the norm and now isn’t.”
“The country is listening to some sort of warning sign … and every day, every minute, every headline is just a reminder that something, somewhere is rotten or dangerous or hazardous,” he said, noting that he believes people need to be able to laugh more.

Masked Leftist Attacks Conservative Speaker with Chemical for Saying 'Men Are Not Women',www1.cbn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/masked-leftist-attacks-conservative-speaker-with-chemical-for-saying-men-are-not-women,"Masked Leftist Attacks Conservative Speaker with Chemical for Saying 'Men Are Not Women' 04-12-2019
Protests and physical attacks have been proliferating against conservatives on college campuses. The latest victim is conservative political commentator Michael Knowles who was the featured speaker at an event on the campus of University of Missouri-Kansas City Thursday night.
A UMKC student group, Young Americans for Freedom, sponsored the event, ""A Night with Michael Knowles.""
But angry protestors shouted in an effort to drown out Knowles' speech.
While delivering his speech titled, ""Men Are Not Women,"" Knowles was attacked by a masked protester who squirted a bleach-like substance onto him.
Knowles, a Fox News contributor and host of ""The Michael Knowles Show"" on the Daily Wire, tweeted about the incident.
""A student tried to squirt bleach on me during my speech tonight,"" he said. ""Lucky for me he was a left-winger and couldn't even shoot a squirt gun.""

The person who attacked Knowles was eventually tackled and shocked with a taser by UMKC police.
University officials issued a statement that said, ""While we have a responsibility to allow free speech on our campus, we cannot condone physical disruptions of peaceful campus activities. We believe that free speech can be exercised in a constructive way that doesn't put people at risk.""
In an update, Knowles tweeted, ""...Just spoke with police. Despite initial reports from multiple witnesses in room that substance was bleach, it now appears to be an odorous substance merely designed to smell like bleach, not the chemical!""

"At 100-Day Mark, Congress Hasn't Lifted a Finger to Fix Immigration - Will This Plan Put the Squeeze on Mexico?",www1.cbn.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/at-100-day-mark-congress-hasnt-lifted-a-finger-to-fix-immigration-will-this-plan-put-the-squeeze-on-mexico,"This Congress hit the 100-day mark this week, and although the session began with a government shutdown over immigration and then reopened, lawmakers haven't done anything to address the larger issue.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is calling for a new push on a bipartisan agreement that resolves immigration and border security problems.
""I think it's way past time, on both sides, that we sit down together and see what we could agree to to improve the situation, not only border security, but also the asylum laws are very challenging,"" McConnell told reporters.
This came the same day Vice President Mike Pence made a similar call from the border.
""So President Trump and I are calling on the Congress to come together and close the loopholes in our asylum laws to bring about the changes that allow us to return individuals who are apprehended in this country to their countries in Central America the way that we can today in Mexico,"" said Pence.
Border state Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ) tells CBN News he supports changes to asylum laws.
""The problem is most of those would require legislation to get done and I think that's carrying a big rock up a steep hill,"" says Biggs.
He also wants to see fencing and walls in appropriate places and the amnesty issue addressed.
""We have got to have help from Mexico because it used to be mostly Mexican nationals coming across. That's not the case anymore. Now it's mostly Central American people and other nationalities coming across,"" he added.
Biggs suggests President Trump leverage his authority by freezing remittance payments to Mexico.
""Those transfer payments are about $30 billion a year, if he freezes those for a short period of time he can get the leverage I think he needs for Mexico to say we'll sign an international protocol like Canada has done where Mexico can actually help us with the amnesty issue,"" Biggs explained.
He plans to take a congressional delegation to the border next week. ""We'll see how it works and we'll see how it doesn't work,"" said Biggs.
And he's not the only Republican doubting whether or not Congress can reach an agreement.
""I don't think we're going to get immigration reform done because I think Democrats now forgot about what they were for just a few years ago and they calculated politically they're better off having the status quo or worse,"" Sen. Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told CBN News.
Like criminal justice reform, Braun believes Congress will only act when the issue is so broken they can't ignore it anymore.
""It is as complicated as I think most other things the federal government is involved with, it gets too far down the trail to where it's close to calamity or disaster,"" continued Braun.
For decades Congress has failed to approve sweeping immigration reform, and passing a deal will only get more challenging the closer we get to the 2020 election.

Do You Want Your Health Plan Replaced with Medicare? Bernie Sanders and These 2020 Candidates Do,www.cbn.com,Abigail Robertson,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/do-you-want-your-health-plan-replaced-with-medicare-bernie-sanders-and-these-2020-candidates-do,"Health care is emerging as the first major campaign issue of the 2020 election. This week Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) unveiled his plan to eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government run program.
""Together we are going to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great country, being the only major nation on earth not to guarantee health care to all as a right,"" Sanders told a cheering crowd on Capitol Hill.
Polls show Sanders as the early leader among Democratic presidential candidates. Now that his big ""Medicare for All"" plan is out, his primary opponents are either fighting it, or trying to get a piece of the action.
""I don't agree with Senator Sanders' single payer approach,"" said Democrat presidential candidate John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) took the middle ground saying, ""It could be a possibility in the future.""
Other candidates are lining up to co-sponsor the bill: Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
""Health care must be a right, not a privilege,"" said Gillibrand. ""This has to become the next social safety net, it has to become something that is there for you no matter what.""
But that safety net could prove dangerously expensive. Independent estimates put the plan costing anywhere from $25- to $35-trillion over just 10 years.
""That price is so steep that even left-leaning analysts are quietly admitting that the tax burden is virtually certain to land on the shoulders of the middle class,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) claimed on the Senate floor this week.
McConnell could possibly bring the bill up for a vote to make a point as he did with the Democrats' ""Green New Deal"". Some Republicans are hopeful he'll do this to get Democrats on the record on the issue.
""I think it deserves a full debate and a vote and see how many Democrats who are co-sponsors actually support it,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY).
""It might be interesting to put a Medicare for all plan on the floor for a vote to see where Democrats really stand,"" echoed Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND).
Cramer believes a vote would showcase divisions among Democrats. ""They will quickly gravitate toward the middle where reality exists,"" he continued.
Under the plan, some 180 million Americans would see their private health insurance replaced with a public plan.
""What you end up with is you don't have Medicare for all, you have a bunch of people that have inferior or no coverage,"" added Cramer.
The White House says Republicans are working on ""realistic solutions,"" and President Trump says a ""really great health care plan"" will be ready right after the 2020 election.
""I personally think there's some risk in that approach,"" Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told CBN News. ""We've got to make sure we're articulating something to counterpunch it and be really good at explaining what a disaster that would be.""
Braun says he agrees with McConnell that the GOP plan is not ready for primetime, but adds his party has to come up with a fix for a ""basketcase"" health care system.
""We've got to be unveiling it and building it into 2020 and maybe the formal presentation can be after 2020,"" added Braun.
Braun believes a Republican plan must differ from Obamacare, but cover pre-existing conditions and allow kids to stay on their parents plans until 26.
""No one should ever go broke because they get sick or have a bad accident,"" added Braun. ""We just have to figure out how to get the industry galvanized to start fixing themselves. I put a lot of the blame on big pharma, big hospitals - just speaking with some ophthalmologists just a moment ago, doctors and providers you know are maybe 25-30% of the health care tab – they're worried you know what life's going to look like a few years down the road.""
""So many of these industries have evolved to where big industries dominate the dynamic, and I put the responsibility mostly on them,"" said Braun."

"Pro-Lifers Go Big in Big Apple, Taking 900 Crosses and Live 4D Ultrasound to Times Square",www.cbn.com,Heather Sells,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/pro-lifers-go-big-in-big-apple-taking-900-crosses-and-live-4d-ultrasound-to-times-square,"The pro-life movement is working in a bold venue to deliver its message – with two major events in Times Square, right in the heart of New York City.
Next month, Focus on the Family will take over Times Square with a Live ultrasound of a baby in the womb. And this week, Students for Life of America have been protesting in several big ways.
Students from across America came to Times Square with a message that their generation is the pro-life generation.
Their unusual method: Rallying with 900 crosses representing the 900 babies that are killed daily at Planned Parenthood clinics across the country.
Another big visual for the group: A digital billboard that's rotating for three days with pro-life messages, including one that says only seven percent of millennials support abortion extremism.
It's all part of a pushback from numerous pro-life groups in response to legislation that New York passed earlier this year. The broad new law has been labeled extreme because it allows abortion up to birth, and it may already be changing attitudes. In February, a Marist Poll found that Democrats who identify as pro-life jumped from 20 to 34 percent.
The head of Democrats for Life says they're seeing their numbers go up, crediting New York and other states that have recently considered legalizing abortion through the third trimester.
Kristen Day from Democrats for Life says, ""I think what has helped is the recent move by New York and Virginia and other states to redefine what it means to be pro-choice to someone who supports abortion up to 9 months and even after.""
Pro-lifers will head to New York again in three weeks on May 4 for a Focus on the Family LIVE ultrasound in Times Square. Focus on the Family President Jim Daly says it has the potential to change hearts and minds.
""We'll have great speakers. We're going to have music, but we're also going to do a Live ultrasound of a third-trimester baby,"" he tells CBN News. ""There is no way a person is going to be able to say, 'That is not a child.' It is a child and we want everyone to see it.""
Daly recently announced the upcoming Live 4-D ultrasound on CBN News' ""Faith Nation.""

Most of us are used to seeing 2-D ultrasounds which provide a static image, or even a 3-D ultrasound which merges 2-D images from different angles.
But 4-D adds the dimension of time so people in Times Square will be able to see a Live video of a baby moving around in the womb, kicking, stretching, or doing whatever he or she decides to do for the world to see."
CA Moves Toward Forcing Students to Become 'Walking Billboard for Abortions',www.cbn.com,Benjamin Gill,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/ca-moves-toward-forcing-students-to-become-walking-billboard-for-abortions,"Phone numbers for abortionists like Planned Parenthood could soon be displayed on most California student ID's from middle school through college – even at private religious colleges, universities and seminaries.
Democrat lawmakers in California just pushed bill AB 624 through a committee this week – it requires ""a sexual or reproductive health hotline"" to be on the ID's.
SaveCalifornia.com 's Randy Thomasson points out that the Supreme Court actually ruled in 2018 against forcing anyone to support pro-abortion messages against their beliefs.
""But neither the US Constitution nor the decisions of the US Supreme Court matter to Planned Parenthood abortionists or their bought-and-owned politicians. They want free advertising for new abortion customers as young as 12 years old,"" Thomasson said.
He says the sponsor of the bill, Democrat Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel , received a Planned Parenthood endorsement and a $4,400 campaign contribution.
The California Family Council says the measure would turn students into a ""Walking Billboard for Abortions"".
""The audacity of some legislators to use state power to indoctrinate California's students seems to have no limits,"" said California Family Council President Jonathan Keller.
FAITHWIRE: Almost 100 Abortion Clinic Workers Seek to Leave Industry After Seeing Pro-Life Movie ‘Unplanned’
Conservatives say the idea is unconstitutional.
""Legislators failed at forcing pro-life pregnancy clinics in California to advertise Planned Parenthood's pro-abortion message, so now they are trying to compel every school in the state to promote Planned Parenthood's culture-destroying values,"" Keller said. ""Last year, the US Supreme Court made it clear they would not tolerate California's authoritarian attempts to coerce speech. Hopefully, it will not take another judicial defeat for Sacramento to learn its lesson.""
The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) believes the bill would not survive if it's passed and ends up in the courts.
""It requires private, religious schools to create speech that supports activities that directly conflict with the values the schools seek to teach their students. Such compelled speech, especially on controversial issues like abortion and sexuality, violate the First Amendment rights of students and educational institutions alike,"" ADF states."
The Messiah Tree,feeds.cbn.com,Beth.Patch,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/spiritual-life/the-messiah-tree,"The Messiah Tree Related Products Matthew Sleeth, M.D.
If the Old Testament had a tree nursery in it, it would be found in the book of Isaiah. It is the Grand Central Station of trees. Isaiah’s prophecies overflow with trees and metaphors involving the land as they return again and again to describing the coming of the Messiah. That’s because the two are connected.
“Look for the Messiah,” Isaiah said. “He resembles a tree.” Bad News with Defiled Groves
From chapter 1 onward Isaiah used trees to tell the Hebrew nation good news and bad, starting with the bad. Once again the Hebrew people have gone whoring after idols. Isaiah said they should be ashamed of the oaks and the gardens where they conduct their pagan orgies. Because they perform ceremonies to other gods in these sacred groves (“the oaks that you desired,” verse 29), the Hebrew people will wither and be good for nothing but firewood.
In chapter 3 Isaiah prophesied that a nation that forsakes God will no longer have leaders with character or the ability to lead. “I will make boys their princes, and infants shall rule over them. And the people will oppress one another, every one his fellow and every one his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the despised to the honorable” (verses 4–5). While the men of the land will be busy acting like children, Isaiah stated, the women will become haughty and arrogant and adopt lewd fashions, makeup, and hairstyles.
Leaders who act like babies and sport outlandish fashions are not the only consequences that will happen when God’s people turn from him. Language will lose its meaning. People will begin to call “evil good and good evil” (5:20), even going so far as calling light dark and darkness light. They will call bitter sweet and vice versa. At times it is hard to tell whether Isaiah is writing about ancient history or the dawn of our current millennium. Good News Through a Branch
Isaiah also used trees to deliver good news, and the good news was a foolproof method of recognizing the Messiah. “There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit” (11:1). By couching his predictions in tree terms, Isaiah pointed out that trees would play a pertinent role in identifying the Messiah. The Messiah would come from the family tree of King David, as David’s father was Jesse. Isaiah provided unique details about the Messiah. Hundreds of years later when Jesus arrived, anyone looking for the Messiah could have used these clues to identify him.
Hundreds of years before it happened, Isaiah narrowed down the possibilities of the man who would fit the description of the Messiah to a field of one. A virgin would conceive the Messiah (7:14). He would be “despised and rejected by men” (53:3). He would be killed for our transgressions (verse 5). He would be led to the slaughter and would make no effort to escape (verse 7). The Messiah would heal the blind and the deaf (35:5). A man from the wilderness would announce the Messiah (40:3–5). And the list goes on… God Nailed to a Dead Tree
A trip to an art museum might help you understand just how specific and unique Isaiah’s predictions about the Messiah were. If you visit a large museum and look at the statues and paintings that depict gods from various times and cultures, you are likely to find artwork that shows animals combined with the bodies of humans.
You will see feathered serpent gods, eagle-headed gods, and fanged gods; some have crowns of gold. If the deities have human forms, they will be magnificent in appearance. Some statues portray gods that have transcended the world with eyes closed in peaceful meditation.
Contrast these images with the most common depiction of the Messiah: Jesus on the cross. Here we see Christ in agony or in death. He has not transcended the sufferings of this world. Quite the opposite: he took on all the world’s sin and sorrow. Instead of a crown of gold, he wears a crown of thorns. His clothing is nonexistent, or he is in rags. He is not powerful and looming over humanity; instead, he is nailed to a dead tree.
To quote Isaiah,
He [the Messiah] grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. (53:2–3)
To stare at a painting of Christ on the cross today is to gaze on a portrait of the Messiah described by Isaiah 2,700 years ago. His likeness is no abstract expressionist rendering. There can be no case of mistaken identity. Isaiah’s description resembles only one person in history. Perhaps even more telling, Isaiah’s picture of the Messiah resembles no other god in history.
Isaiah was the only prophet to give a physical description of Jesus. Jesus looks as ordinary as a small plant or tree. Unlike the majestic depictions of other gods, nothing is imposing about the appearance of Jesus.
And here Isaiah hinted at the reason trees have gone missing from our theology. Like trees, Jesus gives life. Fallen humanity, however, has a habit of choosing the things that take life away. We reject Jesus, we disobey God, and we walk away from the tree of life.

Recently, while ministering in a women’s prison, I shared with them my struggles, but I also told them about God’s deliverance. I confessed my distresses, but I also testified of my victories in Christ. Afterward, a tough, young inmate came to my prayer line. She confessed that she had come that night only to stir up trouble. But then she said, “But ma’am, you make me want to know God.”
The world is full of hurting people. You know that (I know that). In fact, you may be one of them right now. I have certainly at times wondered how people manage in this life without a knowledge of God and His goodness.
So it’s almost comical, and yet sobering at the same time, when I read about the army that banded together around David when he was running from King Saul. It sounds eerily like our world today.
“And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him. So he became captain over them. And there were about four hundred men with him.” 1 Samuel 22:2 (NKJV)
Can you imagine the conversations in that camp? It’s very difficult for people who are struggling in any way to keep quiet when around those who are suffering the same. And sadly, it becomes a breeding ground for more distress and discontent.
Our nation has seen this on the rise the last several years, mostly due to the voice given to people through social media and the rise of “fake news” (through these same outlets). Rallies and marches have become popular among those who are angry and frustrated with policies and laws. But what is most interesting is the number of people who it attracts — many who really never tried to have a voice before but, in their discontent and searching, migrated towards those who were bold enough to speak up (right or wrong).
But what I love about David’s men is the fact that they became known as David’s mighty men. When they aligned themselves to righteousness, they were healed, filled, and fruitful. The Bible says David was a man after God’s own heart (Acts 13:22), not because he was perfect — but because he was quick to repent.
This is a noble quality in a leader. And obviously, one that creates noble followers.
I remember one time my sister telling me it might be best to keep my “junk” to myself and not tell everyone. “No one would know,” she said. But I couldn’t do that. God had done too much in my life to keep quiet about it. And the only way people would know is to find my voice and tell the difficult parts first.
I believe the men were attracted to David because they saw that although he wasn’t perfect, he kept following God. People are by nature followers and leaders. We’re all following something/someone. And we’re all leading those behind us.
The important thing is the direction we’re going — whether following or leading.
One of my favorite psalms (written by David) is Psalm 23. He said,
“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul; he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.” Psalm 23:1-3 (NKJV)
I particularly pray that last part often: “Lead me in paths of righteousness.” There are a lot of people discontent, distressed, and in debt. But if we will find the path of righteousness and follow it, others will follow us there too — and find (real) life.
The young woman I met in prison was in a camp with many who are distressed and discontent. But I pray she becomes a mighty woman of God and leads many to the truth.

COMMENTARY
You know what's ironic? America has become more pro-life than ever at the very moment that America's abortion advocates have become more extreme and more aggressive than ever.
More than eighty percent of Americans disapprove of late-term abortion. Unlimited abortion and late-term abortion are growing increasingly unpopular among young adults , giving me tremendous hope that the right to life movement is not only alive and well, it's expanding and gaining momentum.
In fact, this issue is no longer a partisan issue at all. Pro-Life Democrats make up a large swath of the electorate and recent developments have led a number of them to speak up and warn of the consequences if their views are ignored.
The truth is that the vast majority of Americans have found legislation in New York that extends abortion into the third trimester with hardly any restrictions, and the failure of the Born Alive Infant Survivors Protection Act in the US Senate, to be far out of touch with their point of view. Instead of ""safe, legal and rare,"" ending the life of the unborn has become too easy, too quick, and all the way to the point of birth in the United States.
Thankfully, a new generation of Americans are looking back on history and discovering the truth about the pain and suffering caused by abortion. We've learned that a baby in the womb feels pain as early as even 8 weeks since conception. We've learned that a child has a beating heart at just 6 weeks.
That's why waves of state legislation and a number of ""heartbeat bills"" in Georgia, Ohio, Mississippi and several other states are emerging. It isn't just because of the moral sensitivities of a narrow group of religious Americans, it's because of basic science. It is reasonable, and responsible, to be pro-life.
At the nexus of legislation from New York to Georgia, we are finding ourselves in an existential moment for the abortion debate and the church needs to respond in unity.
And it isn't about politics. It is a moral and human rights imperative that requires a moral response from our nation's pastors and leaders whether or not they are engaged in partisan politics.
This is why I called a ""family meeting"" of Christian leaders to draw a line in the sand.
This coming Saturday at Free Chapel I'm hosting this meeting for Christians nationwide to speak truth to power and unite around a crystal-clear message that we believe life is beautiful—every life, at every stage. We'll also be activating a generation who are ready to move beyond a rally and a protest and help be a part of a solution.
This activation leans into a new direction in the movement to protect life. We as the church need to focus our efforts on being the best support network for women anywhere and everywhere in the nation. It's not enough to simply advocate for unborn children. We have to acknowledge the fears and concerns of every mother. We have to recognize the complexity of this decision for many women and enter into their journey with a spirit of grace and service, not moral superiority absent of empathy.
We're gathering Christians from across the country to find ways to be more supportive than we ever have been to women carrying the precious gift of life in the womb. And we're doing this with Christians of diverse political persuasions and parties, pastors who refrain from partisan politics, women grieving from past abortions, and concerned citizens alike, all of whom will gather to learn how they can make a difference on this crucially important issue at this consequential moment.
I want to be clear: our meeting is about celebrating the life of both the mother and the child. Our hearts are filled with compassion for every mother who is carrying a child. We're here to tell them they are not alone. If a child in the womb isn't what they expected or planned, we need to tell them there's hope and remind them of the truth that abortion isn't the only option. We have to prove we're serious about ensuring abortion alternatives are abundantly available in their communities.
People of faith must be unified and resilient on this issue. Now is the time.

PRAYER REQUEST: 3-Year-Old Abducted from Legal American Guardians in Kenya,www1.cbn.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/prayer-request-3-year-old-abducted-from-legal-american-guardians-in-kenya,"PRAYER REQUEST: 3-Year-Old Abducted from Legal American Guardians in Kenya 04-13-2019 Charlotte Pence Matt and Daisy Mazzoncini holding their three-year-old who was taken from them last week. (Screenshot: Lightworkers/YouTube)
Every parent’s worst nightmare happened to an American couple a week ago in Kenya. Matt and Daisy Mazzoncini became the legal guardians to a three-year-old boy in April 2017 after he and his twin were abandoned in a plastic bag outside of a prayer center in Kiambu, run by a friend of Daisy Mazzoncini. After caring for him and paying for medical treatment, the couple was awarded joint legal guardianship.
On the night of Friday, April 5, eleven alleged DCI officers raided their home in Westlands and took the boy with no explanation or documentation. The couple still does not know where their son has been taken, and Americans are rallying behind them as they work to use habeas corpus to get the child back.
RELATED CONTENT: 4 Ways to Pray for Persecuted Christians
According to The Star , the real trouble began when the Mazzoncinis applied for adoption after they were told it may be possible to “get an exemption from the moratorium on adoption.” They had to do many interviews with the Child Welfare Society, where they were ultimately accused of child trafficking and creating false records to make it look like the child was sick. However, the boy had continuous epileptic seizures in September 2018 and was advised to go abroad for specialized treatment.
Right before they were due in children’s court to apply for permission to take him to the United States, a group of people dressed as government officials came and demanded to take the boy. After the abduction, the DCI sent out a tweet claiming responsibility for the kidnapping and credit for the boy’s “rescue.” The tweet has since been removed.
The couple still does not know where their son has been taken, and Americans are rallying behind them as they work to use habeas corpus to get the child back.
The American embassy has since gotten involved and one of the alleged DCI officials collected medicine from the embassy for the boy on Sunday.

Matt Mazzoncini is a former senior executive of Starbucks and Daisy has been a missionary volunteer in Kenya for the past three years. The couple has reportedly spent Sh1.5 million for the boy’s medical procedures and care . When Matt demanded to see a court order from the kidnappers, he was allegedly told, “’This isn’t America; this is Kenya.'”
Americans have rallied around the couple, sounding the alarm and spreading awareness to reunite the boy with his legal guardians so he can receive life-saving medical treatment and perhaps be adopted into their family.

Almost 100 Abortion Clinic Workers Seek to Leave Industry After Seeing Pro-Life Movie ‘Unplanned’,www1.cbn.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/almost-100-abortion-clinic-workers-seek-to-leave-industry-after-seeing-pro-life-movie-lsquo-unplanned-rsquo,"Chuck Konzelman, director of the Pure Flix movie “Unplanned,” revealed to Congress this week that nearly 100 abortion clinic workers have sought to leave their jobs after seeing the pro-life film.
During his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Konzelman said 94 clinic workers have approached former Planned Parenthood executive Abby Johnson’s nonprofit, And Then There Were None, according to Pure Flix Insider .
‘Unplanned’ Movie Director Says Film Was Made ‘For Such a Time as This’
“One percent of the abortion workers in the United States, after getting one look at them being portrayed on film,” he said, “have decided to change their lives … and what they do for a living.”

The Pure Flix filmmaker was on Capitol Hill to speak on a panel regarding Twitter’s alleged censorship of “Unplanned.” On its opening weekend in late March, the social media platform temporarily suspended the film’s promotional account.
“Unplanned” chronicles Johnson’s eight-year career at Planned Parenthood and her conversion to the pro-life movement after she watched a doctor perform an abortion via ultrasound.
Ashley Bratcher, the actor who portrays Johnson in the faith-based movie, tweeted Thursday she receives messages “every single day” from people whose lives — and minds — were changed after seeing “Unplanned.”
Every single day I’m receiving messages just like this one. This role was worth it all. @UnplannedMovie pic.twitter.com/awwAqKBfIV
— Ashley Bratcher (@_AshleyBratcher) April 11, 2019
The movie beat box-office expectations for its opening weekend, bringing in $6.1 million — more than doubling forecasted earnings.
Pro-Life Movie ‘Unplanned’ Makes Stunning Debut at Box Office
In an interview earlier this year with Faithwire, Konzelman said “Unplanned” was made “for such a time as this,” noting the series of pro-abortion bills that have passed state houses across the U.S. in recent months.
“We couldn’t have foreseen the rapid developments that are suddenly coming to a head,” he said, “but we serve a God who could, and did.”

Stairs Believed to Have Been Climbed by Jesus Prior to His Crucifixion Unveiled in Rome,www1.cbn.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/stairs-believed-to-have-been-climbed-by-jesus-prior-to-his-crucifixion-unveiled-in-rome,"Stairs Believed to Have Been Climbed by Jesus Prior to His Crucifixion Unveiled in Rome 04-13-2019 Steve Warren Believers kneel on the newly restored marble steps of the Holy Stairs after they are unveiled in Rome. (Image credit: Andrew Medichini/AP)
Stairs that are believed to be a part of Pontius Pilate's palace in Jerusalem and the very same steps that Jesus Christ ascended before he was tried and sentenced to crucifixion by the Roman governor have been restored.
ABC News reports after more than a year of restoration, the 28 steps of the "" Scala Sancta ,"" or Holy Stairs, of the Pontifical Shrine in Rome, was unveiled by the Vatican Thursday.
The stairs have not been seen without their wooden protection for almost 300 years . Their opening comes just in time as thousands of people will visit Rome and the Vatican for Easter.
Housed in a building across from the Basilica of St. John the Lateran in Rome, the stairs were brought from Jerusalem to Rome in the fourth century by the Emperor Constantine's mother, St. Helena after Christianity became the religion of the Roman Empire.
Since the Middle Ages, millions of believers have climbed the stairs on their knees to pray and meditate on Christ's passion.
""The newly restored frescoes help the faithful connect with the holy history,"" Father Francesco Guerra told ABC .
For the next two months until Pentecost, pilgrims will be able to ascend the bare marble Holy Stairs on their knees. They had been encased in walnut wood for their protection since 1723, according to ABC .
Before the stairs were opened Thursday, restorers working for the Vatican Museum described what it was like to uncover the original stairs, which contain three small bronze crosses embedded in the marble and spots believed to be stained by Jesus' blood.
The restorers also described finding large furrows running along each step, which they explained were caused by the toes of pilgrims' shoes as they knelt and rose to move up to the next step over the course of centuries. "

San Jose Decides to Display Rainbow Flags Near Its New Airport Chick-fil-A,www1.cbn.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/san-jose-decides-to-display-rainbow-flags-near-its-new-airport-chick-fil-a,"San Jose Decides to Display Rainbow Flags Near Its New Airport Chick-fil-A 04-13-2019 Steve Warren Chick-fil-A
After approving the addition of a Chick-fil-A at its local airport, the San Jose, California, city council has decided it now wants to send a message to LGBTQ people as the fast food restaurant prepares to open.
The council voted 11-0 this week to hang rainbow flags in support of LGBTQ people along with pink, blue and white flags for transgender rights near a Chick-fil-A location due to open next month at the San Jose International Airport, according to NBC News .
The vote came after the council heard from Paul Escobar, president of a nonpartisan LGBTQ political action group in the Bay Area. He also organized a small protest outside of San Jose City Hall before meeting with council members over his concerns about having a Chick-fil-A at the local airport.
Ken Yeager, the first openly gay elected official in Santa Clara County, told NBC he came up with the idea of displaying the flags and submitted it for a vote.
San Jose Vice Mayor Charles Jones said the plan is to have a flag or flags near the restaurant and outside of the airport
Recently, San Antonio, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, blocked the restaurant chain from opening locations at their airports, stemming from concerns the company has a record of supporting anti-gay organizations. San Antonio is expected to reconsider its decision this week.
As CBN News reported , last month the left-wing ThinkProgress published issued a report widely circulated in the media accusing the company of ""anti-equality"" giving. This week, Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review , called out the left for its attacks on the company's donations to the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and a small Christian home for troubled young men in Vidalia, Georgia. He accused the left of waging a war on Chick-fil-A, which he called ""Chicken McCarthyism"" in a scathing op-ed published online Tuesday .
""To consider all that the Salvation Army does — its thrift shops, aid for the homeless, disaster relief, anti-trafficking programs, Christmas gifts to needy children and much, much more — and reduce the organization to an allegedly anti-LGBTQ group is simply perverse,"" Lowry wrote.
The National Review editor says public officials taking part in the current campaign against Chick-fil-A need to go back and read the Constitution.
""Any public official joining the punitive campaign against Chick-fil-A needs a remedial lesson in the Constitution, which forbids discrimination against private companies on the basis of political or religious viewpoint. It is the enemies of Chick-fil-A who are intolerant and out of the mainstream. They desperately need to abandon their tawdry McCarthyite crusade — and Eat Mor Chikin,"" Lowry wrote.
Chick-fil-A has not responded to a request for comment from NBC , but said in a statement last week that ""recent coverage about Chick-fil-A continues to drive an inaccurate narrative about our brand.""
The company said it does not ""have a political or social agenda"" and that ""it embraces all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.""
""We want to make it clear that our sole focus is on providing delicious food and welcoming everyone — not being a part of a national political conversation,"" it said."
Sheriff: Several Injured After Powerful Storms Hit Texas,www1.cbn.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/sheriff-several-injured-after-powerful-storms-hit-texas,"Storms Sweep Across the South, Killing 8 and Injuring Dozens 04-14-2019 Associated Press In this image made with a wide angle lens, debris is littered on the ground where a home once stood in Hamilton, Miss., after a deadly storm moved through the area Sunday, April 14, 2019. (AP Photo/Jim Lytle)
Powerful storms swept across the South on Sunday after unleashing suspected tornadoes and flooding that killed at least eight people, injured dozens and flattened much of a Texas town. Three children were among the dead.
Nearly 90,000 customers were without electricity in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Georgia as of midday Sunday, according to www.poweroutage.us as the severe weather left a trail of destruction.
Two children were killed on a back road in East Texas when a pine tree fell onto the car in which they were riding in a severe thunderstorm Saturday near Pollok, about 150 miles (241 kilometers) southeast of Dallas.
The tree “flattened the car like a pancake,” said Capt. Alton Lenderman of the Angelina County Sheriff’s Office. The children, ages 8 and 3, were dead at the scene, while both parents, who were in the front seat, escaped injury, he said.
At least one person was killed and about two dozen others were injured after a suspected tornado struck the Caddo Mounds State Historic Site in East Texas during a Native American cultural event in Alto, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) southeast of Dallas. Cherokee County Judge Chris Davis said the fatality that was reported was of a woman who died of her critical injuries.
In neighboring Houston County, the sheriff’s office said one person was killed in Weches, 6 miles southwest of Caddo Mound.
There was widespread damage in Alto, a town of about 1,200, and the school district canceled classes until its buildings can be deemed safe.
A tornado flattened much of the south side of Franklin, Texas, overturning mobile homes and damaging other residences, said Robertson County Sheriff Gerald Yezak. Franklin is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of Dallas.
The weather service said preliminary information showed an EF-3 tornado touched down with winds of 140 mph (225.3 kph).
It destroyed 55 homes, a church, four businesses, a duplex, and part of the local housing authority building, authorities said. Two people were hospitalized for injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening, while others were treated at the scene, Yezak said. Some people had to be extricated from damaged dwellings.
Heavy rains and storms raked Mississippi into the night Saturday as the storms moved east.
Roy Ratliff, 95, died after a tree crashed onto his trailer in northeastern Mississippi, Monroe County Road Manager Sonny Clay said at a news conference, adding that a tornado had struck. Nineteen residents were taken to hospitals, including two in critical condition. A tornado was reported in the area 140 miles (225 kilometers) southeast of Memphis, Tennessee, at the time.
In Hamilton, Mississippi, 72-year-old Robert Scott said he had been sleeping in his recliner late Saturday when he was awakened and found himself in his yard after a tornado ripped most of his home off its foundation.
His 71-year-old wife, Linda, was in a different part of the house and also survived, he said. They found each other while crawling through the remnants of the house they have lived in since 1972.
“We’re living, and God has blessed us,” Scott, a retired manager for a grocery store meat department, said Sunday as neighbors helped him salvage his belongings.
National Weather Service meteorologist John Moore said a possible twister touched down in the Vicksburg, Mississippi, area. No injuries were reported, but officials reported damage to several businesses and vehicles.
The storm damaged a roof of a hotel in New Albany, Mississippi, and Mississippi State University’s 21,000 students huddled in basements and hallways as a tornado neared the campus in Starkville.
University spokesman Sid Salter said some debris, possibly carried by the tornado, was found on campus, but no injuries were reported and no buildings were damaged. Trees were toppled and minor damage was reported in residential areas east of the campus.
The large storm system also caused flash floods in Louisiana, where two deaths were reported.
Authorities said 13-year-old Sebastian Omar Martinez drowned in a drainage canal after flash flooding struck Bawcomville, near Monroe, said Deputy Glenn Springfield of the Ouachita Parish Sheriff’s Department. Separately, one person died when a car was submerged in floodwaters in Calhoun, also near Monroe.
As the storm moved into Alabama, a possible tornado knocked out power and damaged mobile homes in Troy, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Montgomery.
Near the Birmingham suburb of Hueytown, a county employee died after being struck by a vehicle while he was helping clear away trees about 2:15 a.m. Sunday, said Capt. David Agee of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office. The man, whose name was not immediately released, died after being taken to a hospital.
The forecast of severe weather forced officials at the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, to start the final round of the tournament early on Sunday in order to finish in midafternoon before it began raining.

The Masters Drawing That Helped Free a Man From Prison,www1.cbn.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/the-masters-drawing-that-helped-free-a-man-from-prison,"The Masters Drawing That Helped Free a Man From Prison 04-14-2019 Associated Press Valentino Dixon’s drawing of the No. 12 at Augusta National. (Image credit: Valentino Dixon/AP)
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Valentino Dixon’s introduction to golf came when the warden dropped by his 6-by-10 cell at Attica Correctional Facility in New York with a photo of the iconic 12th hole at Augusta National and a simple request.
Could Dixon draw the hole with his colored pencils?
The warden knew Dixon had the talent. He certainly had the time.
“I hadn’t heard of the 12th hole, let alone Augusta National,” Dixon said. “Nothing about golf. Never paid a second of time to golf, it was always football or basketball where I come from.”
Dixon didn’t want to disappoint the warden while serving 39 years-to-life after being convicted of killing a man at a street party in his hometown of Buffalo in 1991. The warden, after all, held great sway over his living conditions in one of the nation’s most notorious — and dangerous — prisons.
But the last thing he wanted to do was irritate his fellow inmates.
“They might take my credibility card away, they may say he’s drawing golf courses, what’s going on here,” Dixon said. “You don’t want people to think, hey, he’s too close with the administration and this prison.”
So Dixon set about drawing. Some times that went on for 15 hours, with Dixon finding solace drawing the colors of the grass against the brilliantly white sand and blue sky .
The warden loved the image, though that’s hardly where this story ends. Dixon made more golf course drawings, hundreds of them from pictures he saw in Golf Digest and other magazines.
It wasn’t long before they found other eyes.
In their reflection, he found support and more believers in his innocence . His conviction was vacated last September, but not before he had spent 27 years in prison.
This week, Dixon found himself in a place far removed from his former home . He was at Augusta National for the Masters; it was both eerily familiar and strikingly foreign to him.
He walked down to Amen Corner and saw the 12th hole he knew only from pictures. He met Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus, whom he’d only seen in magazines.
It felt like home. The drawings had taken him here day after endless day, when there seemed no end in sight and no reason for hope.
“I just wanted to cry,” Dixon said. “I mean inside I was crying but I held back the tears, you know, because it’s just so much more remarkable and awesome in person. And I’ve drawn that 12th hole about eight or nine times and it’s nothing like seeing it in person — nothing. It’s just like the most wonderful thing that I can see in the world right now.”
After spending more than half his life in prison, Dixon might still be there if not for his art. He might be protesting his innocence, too, if not for a Golf Digest writer who answered his letter in 2011 as a submission to a monthly narrative called “How Golf Saved My Life.”
“Golf is saving my life right now because I had almost 20 years then and I was on borrowed time myself,” Dixon said. “I didn’t know if I was going to live one day to see it to the next.”
Some of his friends in Attica didn’t. They took their own lives.
“I made sure that I kept my sanity,” he said. “You know people lose their way.”
Golf Digest’s Max Adler set the wheels of justice in motion when he replied to Dixon’s letter. Seven more years passed before he was finally free.
“I was actually an art major in college, so it’s like this is golf and art and the human condition all coming together,” Adler said. “I’m of course skeptical that this guy is wrongfully convicted, but the fact that art was sort of a redemptive force for him. I thought I’d like to know more about that.”
Adler visited Dixon inside Attica, and saw his colored pencils ground down to the nub. His daughter Valentina’s efforts gathered more momentum as, first, two attorneys got involved and then even more when students from Georgetown University’s Prison Reform Project took up the cause. The final piece of the puzzle fell into place when a new prosecutor took over in Erie County and reviewed the case.
Another man already incarcerated pleaded guilty to the murder.
“Twenty-seven years, it’s just a miracle,” Adler said. “And it’s a miracle that we ever even heard from him.”
Dixon walked out of prison on a day filled with bright sunshine, eager to rejoin the free world. He had to learn how to use a cellphone and adjust to modern life after a generation behind bars. Now he gives inspirational speeches and shows his work in a gallery, most recently in New York.
Dixon says he’s not bitter. His mother, though, still bristles when the subject of his incarceration comes up. He was imprisoned on her birthday, and she refused to celebrate any of them for the next 27 years.
Dixon and Adler came to the Masters to complete their journey in the place it really began. His art brought him here, just as it freed him from prison.
“The artwork, it’s like God was speaking to my soul,” Dixon said. “He was just saying you know it’s gonna be all right, you hang in there.”

"2 Children Dead, Several People Hurt in Strong Texas Storms",www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/sheriff-several-injured-after-powerful-storms-hit-texas,"Powerful storms swept across the South on Sunday after unleashing suspected tornadoes and flooding that killed at least eight people, injured dozens and flattened much of a Texas town. Three children were among the dead.
Nearly 90,000 customers were without electricity in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Georgia as of midday Sunday, according to www.poweroutage.us as the severe weather left a trail of destruction.
Two children were killed on a back road in East Texas when a pine tree fell onto the car in which they were riding in a severe thunderstorm Saturday near Pollok, about 150 miles (241 kilometers) southeast of Dallas.
The tree “flattened the car like a pancake,” said Capt. Alton Lenderman of the Angelina County Sheriff’s Office. The children, ages 8 and 3, were dead at the scene, while both parents, who were in the front seat, escaped injury, he said.
At least one person was killed and about two dozen others were injured after a suspected tornado struck the Caddo Mounds State Historic Site in East Texas during a Native American cultural event in Alto, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) southeast of Dallas. Cherokee County Judge Chris Davis said the fatality that was reported was of a woman who died of her critical injuries.
In neighboring Houston County, the sheriff’s office said one person was killed in Weches, 6 miles southwest of Caddo Mound.
There was widespread damage in Alto, a town of about 1,200, and the school district canceled classes until its buildings can be deemed safe.
A tornado flattened much of the south side of Franklin, Texas, overturning mobile homes and damaging other residences, said Robertson County Sheriff Gerald Yezak. Franklin is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of Dallas.
The weather service said preliminary information showed an EF-3 tornado touched down with winds of 140 mph (225.3 kph).
It destroyed 55 homes, a church, four businesses, a duplex, and part of the local housing authority building, authorities said. Two people were hospitalized for injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening, while others were treated at the scene, Yezak said. Some people had to be extricated from damaged dwellings.
Heavy rains and storms raked Mississippi into the night Saturday as the storms moved east.
Roy Ratliff, 95, died after a tree crashed onto his trailer in northeastern Mississippi, Monroe County Road Manager Sonny Clay said at a news conference, adding that a tornado had struck. Nineteen residents were taken to hospitals, including two in critical condition. A tornado was reported in the area 140 miles (225 kilometers) southeast of Memphis, Tennessee, at the time.
In Hamilton, Mississippi, 72-year-old Robert Scott said he had been sleeping in his recliner late Saturday when he was awakened and found himself in his yard after a tornado ripped most of his home off its foundation.
His 71-year-old wife, Linda, was in a different part of the house and also survived, he said. They found each other while crawling through the remnants of the house they have lived in since 1972.
“We’re living, and God has blessed us,” Scott, a retired manager for a grocery store meat department, said Sunday as neighbors helped him salvage his belongings.
National Weather Service meteorologist John Moore said a possible twister touched down in the Vicksburg, Mississippi, area. No injuries were reported, but officials reported damage to several businesses and vehicles.
The storm damaged a roof of a hotel in New Albany, Mississippi, and Mississippi State University’s 21,000 students huddled in basements and hallways as a tornado neared the campus in Starkville.
University spokesman Sid Salter said some debris, possibly carried by the tornado, was found on campus, but no injuries were reported and no buildings were damaged. Trees were toppled and minor damage was reported in residential areas east of the campus.
The large storm system also caused flash floods in Louisiana, where two deaths were reported.
Authorities said 13-year-old Sebastian Omar Martinez drowned in a drainage canal after flash flooding struck Bawcomville, near Monroe, said Deputy Glenn Springfield of the Ouachita Parish Sheriff’s Department. Separately, one person died when a car was submerged in floodwaters in Calhoun, also near Monroe.
As the storm moved into Alabama, a possible tornado knocked out power and damaged mobile homes in Troy, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Montgomery.
Near the Birmingham suburb of Hueytown, a county employee died after being struck by a vehicle while he was helping clear away trees about 2:15 a.m. Sunday, said Capt. David Agee of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office. The man, whose name was not immediately released, died after being taken to a hospital.
The forecast of severe weather forced officials at the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, to start the final round of the tournament early on Sunday in order to finish in midafternoon before it began raining.

San Jose Decides to Display Rainbow Flags Near Its New Airport Chick-fil-A,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/san-jose-decides-to-display-rainbow-flags-near-its-new-airport-chick-fil-a,"After approving the addition of a Chick-fil-A at its local airport, the San Jose, California, city council has decided it now wants to send a message to LGBTQ people as the fast food restaurant prepares to open.
The council voted 11-0 this week to hang rainbow flags in support of LGBTQ people along with pink, blue and white flags for transgender rights near a Chick-fil-A location due to open next month at the San Jose International Airport, according to NBC News .
The vote came after the council heard from Paul Escobar, president of a nonpartisan LGBTQ political action group in the Bay Area. He also organized a small protest outside of San Jose City Hall before meeting with council members over his concerns about having a Chick-fil-A at the local airport.
Ken Yeager, the first openly gay elected official in Santa Clara County, told NBC he came up with the idea of displaying the flags and submitted it for a vote.
San Jose Vice Mayor Charles Jones said the plan is to have a flag or flags near the restaurant and outside of the airport
Recently, San Antonio, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, blocked the restaurant chain from opening locations at their airports, stemming from concerns the company has a record of supporting anti-gay organizations. San Antonio is expected to reconsider its decision this week.
As CBN News reported , last month the left-wing ThinkProgress published issued a report widely circulated in the media accusing the company of ""anti-equality"" giving. This week, Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review , called out the left for its attacks on the company's donations to the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and a small Christian home for troubled young men in Vidalia, Georgia. He accused the left of waging a war on Chick-fil-A, which he called ""Chicken McCarthyism"" in a scathing op-ed published online Tuesday .
""To consider all that the Salvation Army does — its thrift shops, aid for the homeless, disaster relief, anti-trafficking programs, Christmas gifts to needy children and much, much more — and reduce the organization to an allegedly anti-LGBTQ group is simply perverse,"" Lowry wrote.
The National Review editor says public officials taking part in the current campaign against Chick-fil-A need to go back and read the Constitution.
""Any public official joining the punitive campaign against Chick-fil-A needs a remedial lesson in the Constitution, which forbids discrimination against private companies on the basis of political or religious viewpoint. It is the enemies of Chick-fil-A who are intolerant and out of the mainstream. They desperately need to abandon their tawdry McCarthyite crusade — and Eat Mor Chikin,"" Lowry wrote.
Chick-fil-A has not responded to a request for comment from NBC , but said in a statement last week that ""recent coverage about Chick-fil-A continues to drive an inaccurate narrative about our brand.""
The company said it does not ""have a political or social agenda"" and that ""it embraces all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.""
""We want to make it clear that our sole focus is on providing delicious food and welcoming everyone — not being a part of a national political conversation,"" it said."
"Madagascar Measles Epidemic Kills More Than 1,200 People",www1.cbn.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/madagascar-measles-epidemic-kills-more-than-1-200-people,"Madagascar Measles Epidemic Kills More Than 1,200 People 04-14-2019 Associated Press In this photo taken Thursday, March 21, 2019, mothers wait to have their babies vaccinated against measles, at a healthcare center in Larintsena, Madagascar. (AP Photo/Laetitia Bezain)
AMBALAVAO, Madagascar (AP) — Babies wail as a nurse tries to reassure mothers who have come to vaccinate their children. They fear a measles epidemic that has killed more than 1,200 people in this island nation where many are desperately poor.
As Madagascar faces its largest measles outbreak in history and cases soar well beyond 115,000, resistance to vaccinating children is not the driving force.
Measles cases are rising in the United States and other parts of the world, in part the result of misinformation that makes some parents balk at a crucial vaccine. New York City is now trying to halt a measles outbreak by ordering mandatory vaccinations in one Brooklyn neighborhood.
In Madagascar, many parents would like to protect their children but face immense challenges including the lack of resources.
Just 58% percent of people on Madagascar’s main island have been vaccinated against measles, a major factor in the outbreak’s spread. With measles one of the most infectious diseases, immunization rates need to be 90 to 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.
On a recent day, the Iarintsena health center’s waiting room was full, with mothers sitting on the floor and others waiting outside in the overwhelming heat. Two volunteer nurses and a midwife tried to respond to the demand.
Nifaliana Razaijafisoa had walked 15 kilometers (9 miles) with her 6-month-old baby in her arms.
“He has a fever,” she said. “I think it’s measles because there are these little pimples that have appeared on his face.” The nurse quickly confirmed it. “I’m so scared for him because in the village everyone says it kills babies,” Razaijafisoa said.
The measles outbreak has killed mostly children under age 15 since it began in September, according to the World Health Organization.
“The epidemic, unfortunately, continues to expand in size” though at a slower pace than a month ago, said Dr. Dossou Vincent Sodjinou, a WHO epidemiologist in Madagascar. By mid-March, 117,075 cases had been reported by the health ministry, affecting all regions of the country.
Some cases of resistance to vaccinations exist because of the influence of religion or of traditional health practitioners but they are isolated ones, he said.
This epidemic is complicated by the fact that nearly 50 percent of children in Madagascar are malnourished.
“Malnutrition is the bed of measles, ” Sodjinou said.
Razaijafisoa’s baby weighs just 5 kilograms (11 pounds).
“This is the case for almost all children with measles who have come here,” said Lantonirina Rasolofoniaina, a volunteer at the health center.
Simply reaching a clinic for help can be a challenge. Many people in Madagascar cannot afford to see a doctor or buy medicine, and health centers often are understaffed or have poorly qualified workers.
As a result, information about health issues can be unreliable. Some parents are not aware that vaccines are free, at least in public health centers.
Four of Erika Hantriniaina’s five children have had measles. She had wrongly believed that people could not be vaccinated after nine months of age.
“It’s my 6-year-old daughter who had measles first. She had a lot of fever,” she said. “I called the doctor but it was Friday. He had already gone to town. I went to see another doctor who told me that my daughter had an allergy. ... This misdiagnosis was almost fatal.”
The girl had diarrhea and vomiting and couldn’t eat, Hantriniaina said, adding that she narrowly survived.
Measles, a highly infectious disease spread by coughing, sneezing, close contact or infected surfaces, has no specific treatment. The symptoms are treated instead.
“Vitamin A is given to children to increase their immunity. We try to reduce the fever. If there is a cough, we give antibiotics,” said Dr. Boniface Maronko, sent by WHO to Madagascar to supervise efforts to contain the outbreak. If the disease is not treated early enough, complications appear including diarrhea, bronchitis, pneumonia and convulsions.
Madagascar’s health ministry has sent free medications to regions most affected by the epidemic. Maronko reminded heads of health centers in the Ambalavao region not to make parents pay, saying he had seen some doctors asking for money. He told the AP he feared the medicines wouldn’t be enough.
The country’s capital, Antananarivo, a city of some 1.3 million, has not been spared by the epidemic.
Lalatiana Ravonjisoa, a vegetable vendor in a poor district, grieves for her 5-month-old baby.
“I had 5 children. They all had measles. For the last, I did not go to see the doctor because I did not have money,” she said. “I gave my baby the leftover medications from his big brother to bring down the fever.”
For a few days she did not worry: “I felt like he was healed.” But one morning she noticed he had trouble breathing. Later she found his feet were cold.
“Look at my baby,” she told her mother.
“She hugged him for a long time and she did not say anything. Then she asked me to be strong. He was gone.”
Ravonjisoa said she blames herself, “but I did not imagine for one moment that he was going to die.” At the hospital, a doctor confirmed that her baby died of measles-related respiratory complications.
Late last month WHO started a third mass measles vaccination campaign in Madagascar with the overall goal of reaching 7.2 million children aged 6 months to 9 years.
“But immunization is not the only strategy for the response to this epidemic. We still need resources for care, monitoring and social mobilization,” said Sodjinou, the WHO epidemiologist.

Almost 100 Abortion Clinic Workers Seek to Leave Industry After Seeing Pro-Life Movie ‘Unplanned’ | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,"Tré Goins-Phillips, Faithwire",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/almost-100-abortion-clinic-workers-seek-to-leave-industry-after-seeing-pro-life-movie-lsquo-unplanned-rsquo,"Chuck Konzelman, director of the Pure Flix movie “Unplanned,” revealed to Congress this week that nearly 100 abortion clinic workers have sought to leave their jobs after seeing the pro-life film.
During his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Konzelman said 94 clinic workers have approached former Planned Parenthood executive Abby Johnson’s nonprofit, And Then There Were None, according to Pure Flix Insider .
‘Unplanned’ Movie Director Says Film Was Made ‘For Such a Time as This’
“One percent of the abortion workers in the United States, after getting one look at them being portrayed on film,” he said, “have decided to change their lives … and what they do for a living.”

The Pure Flix filmmaker was on Capitol Hill to speak on a panel regarding Twitter’s alleged censorship of “Unplanned.” On its opening weekend in late March, the social media platform temporarily suspended the film’s promotional account.
“Unplanned” chronicles Johnson’s eight-year career at Planned Parenthood and her conversion to the pro-life movement after she watched a doctor perform an abortion via ultrasound.
Ashley Bratcher, the actor who portrays Johnson in the faith-based movie, tweeted Thursday she receives messages “every single day” from people whose lives — and minds — were changed after seeing “Unplanned.”
Every single day I’m receiving messages just like this one. This role was worth it all. @UnplannedMovie pic.twitter.com/awwAqKBfIV

The movie beat box-office expectations for its opening weekend, bringing in $6.1 million — more than doubling forecasted earnings.
Pro-Life Movie ‘Unplanned’ Makes Stunning Debut at Box Office
In an interview earlier this year with Faithwire, Konzelman said “Unplanned” was made “for such a time as this,” noting the series of pro-abortion bills that have passed state houses across the U.S. in recent months.
“We couldn’t have foreseen the rapid developments that are suddenly coming to a head,” he said, “but we serve a God who could, and did.”

Late last month WHO started a third mass measles vaccination campaign in Madagascar with the overall goal of reaching 7.2 million children aged 6 months to 9 years.
“But immunization is not the only strategy for the response to this epidemic. We still need resources for care, monitoring and social mobilization,” said Sodjinou, the WHO epidemiologist.

Trump Campaign Eyes Chances to Vie for States Lost in 2016,www1.cbn.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/trump-campaign-eyes-chances-to-vie-for-states-lost-in-2016,"Trump Campaign Eyes Chances to Vie for States Lost in 2016 04-14-2019 Associated Press In this Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses the crowd during a campaign stop at the Minneapolis International Airport.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump loves to recount how his 2016 campaign defied expectations to pierce the vaunted Democratic “blue wall.” For 2020, he’s looking to do one better.
As his re-election campaign kicks into high gear, it’s exploring opportunities to contest states he lost in 2016, aiming to keep divided Democrats on the defensive.
Trump on Monday visits one of those states, Minnesota, where he lost to Hillary Clinton by fewer than 45,000 votes in 2016. The campaign also is targeting New Mexico, Nevada, and New Hampshire, all states where Trump fell short by under 100,000 votes.
The tax day visit to Minnesota is meant to highlight the effect of Trump’s signature legislative accomplishment, the 2017 tax overhaul, in a historically Democratic-leaning state that appears to offer Republicans hope.
“We see trends in the state that we like,” said senior campaign adviser Bill Stepien. “We like what we see on the ground. We like the energy we’re seeing.”
In 1984, Minnesota was the only state carried by Democratic nominee Walter Mondale, a former Minnesota senator, against President Ronald Reagan. Over the past several presidential elections Minnesota has grown increasingly competitive, particularly as Trump’s rise coincided with a realignment of many white-working class voters to the GOP. And in an otherwise bleak 2018 for the GOP, Trump helped flip two congressional seats to Republicans.
With record fundraising for this stage in a presidential cycle, both the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely unrestrained financially, allowing them to make riskier investments in states won by Clinton. All the target states, except for Nevada, also have Senate races in 2020, a factor that the party believes will provide extra return.
Any early spending could pay dividends for the GOP in 2020, even if those efforts aren’t successful, forcing Democrats opponents to expend precious resources later in the campaign cycle to defend what should be safer Democratic states.
The Minnesota visit marks Trump’s third to the state since taking office. His first two were political trips to help put two Republican congressional candidates, Jim Hagedorn, and Pete Stauber, over the top in 2018.
The focus on Minnesota and Trump’s other near-misses come as there is mounting concern within the Democratic Party that its heavily contested primary is providing Trump with an opportunity to reinforce his political position with little in the way of organized opposition.
“Trump and the RNC are hell-bent on expanding on the list of states Trump won in 2016 by targeting states like Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Nevada, and they’re counting on early money to build a formidable ground game to make it happen,” said a recent Democratic National Committee fundraising email.
Stephen Stepanek, chairman of the New Hampshire GOP, silenced the room at the party’s recent spring fundraiser, keynoted by the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump when he said the Democrats have “out-organized us. Outraised us. And quite frankly, we have to do a better job.”
“We are in a war right now,” he said. Trump lost the state by fewer than 3,000 votes and the GOP recently placed five staffers in the state ahead of 2020.
To date, early Democratic investments have been focused on shoring up the “blue wall” of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Until 2016, they had been solidly Democratic for two decades. All three states saw Democratic gains in 2018 that the party believes indicate they are ripe for returning to the fold in 2020.
The Trump campaign is also eyeing the fallout of a political scandal among Democratic leaders in Virginia to determine whether there’s an opening in the state. But it acknowledges that the heavy concentration of federal workers in the northern part of the state makes it a more challenging opportunity.
The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA has announced a $100 million campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida, all states that Trump carried. Its publicly announced “phase two” plans include a focus on Trump’s narrow-loss states of Nevada and New Hampshire.
Trump’s team still believes his likeliest path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency means re-running the 2016 map. But it is exploring other permutations.
“We’re casting a wide net and looking for opportunities to grow the map,” said Stepien.

'FIX THE IMMIGRATION LAWS!' Trump Considers Sending Migrants to Sanctuary Cities,www1.cbn.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/fix-the-immigration-laws-trump-considers-sending-migrants-to-sanctuary-cities,"'FIX THE IMMIGRATION LAWS!' Trump Considers Sending Migrants to Sanctuary Cities 04-15-2019 Migrants await processing by the US Border Patrol. (AP Photo)
President Trump's top aides say a controversial plan to send migrants to sanctuary cities remains an option.
The idea first came up several months ago in discussions among the president's aides. It was initially rejected after lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security said it was illegal.
But with Central American migrants flooding across the US southern border, the ongoing border crisis is showing no signs of letting up, and there's been no progress on immigration reform from Congress.
""We are looking at all options as long as Democrats continue to ignore the crisis at the border, as long as Democrats refuse to sit down with the president,"" said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.
""They want more people in their sanctuary cities, well, we'll give them more people,"" Trump said.
And he tweeted Saturday that the US has the absolute legal right to take illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities. Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2019
Top aides say it's not the best option, but they're willing to consider anything.
""The president likes the idea and Democrats have said they want these individuals into their communities so let's see if it works and everybody gets a win out of it,"" Sanders said. ""Again, this is not the ideal situation.""
Sanders said it's time for Congress to work with the president on a comprehensive plan to overhaul the US immigration system. And Trump tweeted again Monday morning, ""Congress should come back to D.C. now and FIX THE IMMIGRATION LAWS!"" Congress should come back to D.C. now and FIX THE IMMIGRATION LAWS!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019
The White House says the goal is to keep border towns from being overwhelmed by the strain of caring for so many sudden arrivals. Democrats say it's just a political stunt, accusing the White House of trying to use migrants as pawns.
Meanwhile, some mayors of sanctuary cities say they'd welcome the migrants. Sanctuary cities, including New York and San Francisco, refuse to cooperate with federal authorities in detaining and deporting people living there illegally."
San Diego Border Tests New Wall in the Midst of Crisis That's Creating 'Huge Vulnerabilities',www1.cbn.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/san-diego-border-tests-new-wall-in-the-midst-of-crisis-thats-creating-huge-vulnerabilities,"San Diego Border Tests New Wall in the Midst of Crisis That's Creating 'Huge Vulnerabilities' 04-15-2019
SAN DIEGO – US Border Patrol has apprehended close to a quarter million unaccompanied children and families already in fiscal year 2019 – and there's no indication that the numbers are slowing . The historic spike comes as Washington continues to debate the merits of a border wall. CBN News recently visited with Border Patrol agents in the San Diego sector to better understand the border dynamics that are shaping much of the debate in Washington. The San Diego sector is unique on several counts: it shares a 60-mile border with Mexico making it the smallest Border Patrol sector on the southwest border. It's also home to the some of the newest border wall technology – a 14-mile stretch of double fencing that's already making a difference.
Fence Makes a Difference But it shares, along with the other sectors, a deepening burden: how to best protect the border even as agents are daily diverted to care for record numbers of immigrant families and children who need processing, transportation, shelter, and food and often, medical care.
In March, Border Patrol agents apprehended 100,000 immigrants along the southwest border. San Diego Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott told CBN News that agents feel the stress on several levels – witnessing the pain and suffering of these children and parents and working to process them and care for their needs while keeping the border secure. Agents Feel the Strain as Border is Overrun
When we talked with him in early April the strain was obvious. ""In the last 24 hours I had 148 agents taken out of patrol duties and they're basically babysitting kids. They're at hospitals with sick aliens. They're processing. They're transporting,"" he said, ""and they're doing things other than patrolling the border. That's created huge vulnerabilities to now where our effectiveness is dropping."" There's no doubt that violence and poverty in Central America are pushing many of these immigrants to head to the U.S. border. But what Scott wants to talk about is a problem he sees that Congress could fix: a legal loophole forcing Border Patrol to quickly release the families it has processed. ""We have to release families within 20 days and it doesn't take long in today's social media environment for that message to get out,"" he said, ""once that message got out, we got overrun."" Scott admits that San Diego's numbers don't compare to the numbers in south Texas, but says in fiscal year 2019 his sector has already processed double the immigrants it did in 2018. Catch and Release
With his facilities at maximum capacity, Scott has been forced to adopt a policy informally known as catch and release. ""We're basically having to process people and then immediately release them into the U.S."" Those immigrants receive an immigration court date, but it's months or even years out and many will never show up. Amidst the struggle to care for the current wave of immigrants, San Diego border patrol agents are enjoying one of the first sections of a new wall that could serve as a prototype for other sectors. It's actually double fencing with a primary wall closest to the Mexico border along with a secondary wall and a law enforcement zone in between that's large enough for a Border Patrol vehicle to comfortably drive. The 14-mile section stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the base of the Otay mountains. It's a vast improvement over the previous 6-foot high wall made out of Vietnam War era landing mats. The new walls rise up 30 feet and have a bollard structure hollow steel beams filled with concrete and steel rods. They allow agents to see through the barrier which enhances security. Agent Fabian Carbajal says the old barrier prevented agents from being able to see illegal crossers getting ready to jump. ""They would stage 20 people at a time, wait for vehicles to go through,"" he said, ""Someone would jump over with a power saw, run to our secondary wall and just breach it – make a hole through it – stage back in Mexico and just wait and see if the Border Patrol would respond. Then the group would go through and make it up north."" Goal: Make it More Difficult for Illegal Immigrants to Cross
Scott doesn't pretend the new wall can't be beaten. That's not the point. He's happy that it simply makes it more difficult for illegal immigrants to sneak across. By slowing them down, Scott can spread out his agents, creating a human barrier that saves time and money. ""Where we've put that in place we've been able to increase our effectiveness from about 10 percent to over 95 percent,"" he said, ""and more importantly, we are able to pull 180 agents out of that area and then redeploy them to other parts of the border."" Scott still faces big challenges. The stretch of new wall abruptly ends in a mountainous area with absolutely no border barrier. In total, his sector includes 17 miles of open border. It's a challenge the other sectors face as well. More than half of the U.S.-Mexico border has no fencing or wall. Agents in the San Diego sector secure these areas on horseback and ATV's. They utilize technology like underground sensors. But they're also up against open spaces with no electricity and no cell coverage. Scott says even locals often don't understand what's at stake. ""They don't realize that less than 14 miles off the coast we have no border fence whatsoever. And anything can cross through here. And if anyone thinks that the criminal organizations and the terrorist organizations and even nation-state countries aren't trying to exploit this crisis – they're fooling themselves."""

A wave of wicked weather has swept through several states killing at least eight people, injuring dozens more, and leaving devastated communities in its wake.
Approximately 21 tornadoes touched down across five states including Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ohio.
""The fence around his pool was pretty much blown down. He had three giant pine trees that had blown over in the field,"" Ohio resident Erv Howard told reporters as he cleaned debris from his brother's yard.
In Franklin, Texas residents were caught by surprise when an EF-3 tornado ripped through the town of fewer than 2000 people.
""My house was just lifted, scattered over the backyard,"" one resident described. ""We've lost about half of the south side of Franklin, it's totally destroyed,"" Robertson County Judge Charles Ellison told reporters.
The destruction included 55 homes, a church, and several businesses, but no fatalities.
That wasn't the case for other parts of the country.
The storm's smallest victims, ages 3 and 8, were killed when a tree crashed into their car in Angelina County, Texas. ""I noticed the tree had fallen on their vehicle and I knew it wasn't a good outcome,"" said a witness.
In Louisiana, power outages and flash flooding struck after torrential downpours and heavy winds.
Two people died as a result of the flash flooding, including 13-year-old Sebastian Omar Martinez whose body was found in a drainage canal.
The aftermath from the severe weather is also affecting travel.
At the nation's largest airports there were thousands of flight cancellations and long lines of stranded passengers.
""This is very, very, very difficult and the help is negligible, it's negligible,"" said Liat Rudberg, who was stranded at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
The first line of weather pushed through parts of Washington, DC, and Virginia overnight and off to the east. However, another line of strong storms winds are expected to hit the southern parts of the US by mid-week."

Pro-life organization 40 Days for Life has announced 446 confirmed reports of babies saved from abortion through their campaign efforts which coincide with the season of Lent.
40 Days of Life's mission is ""to bring together the body of Christ in a spirit of unity during a focused 40-day campaign of prayer, fasting, and peaceful activism, with the purpose of repentance, to seek God's favor to turn hearts and minds from a culture of death to a culture of life, thus bringing an end to abortion.""
The organization has shared multiple stories of people changing their hearts through prayer and conversations. Below are a few reports from the 40 Day campaign:
Day #6
""On a rainy Memphis day, an abortion-bound couple refused assistance from a trained sidewalk counselor named Tara. But before long, the man exited Planned Parenthood, offering to help shield vigil participants' materials from the rain.
Tara gladly used the opportunity to tell him all about the support available to help the couple choose life. The man said he would try to change the woman's mind, but when a half hour passed, hope began to fade.
Finally, they emerged from Planned Parenthood and announced they had decided against abortion!""
Day #20
""In Smithtown, which is hosting its first-ever 40 Days for Life campaign, a woman admitted she pressured a teenage girl named Jessica into an abortion a few months earlier.
Jessica–heartbroken and trying to make amends for the loss of her child–decided to get pregnant again. And the same woman who pressured her into an abortion had now brought her right back to Planned Parenthood for another one.
""The woman felt crushed, extremely guilty, and did not know what to do about this second pregnancy,"" wrote the Smithtown leadership team.
That's when Jessica burst out of Planned Parenthood, running toward the vigil, crying, and looking for help. Vigil participants were happy to offer it, setting her up with an appointment at a crisis pregnancy center.""
Day #30
""A regular campaign participant in Houston had planned to take a day off from the vigil. But before long, he found himself back out in front of Planned Parenthood.
That last-minute decision proved to be a good one. A driver headed for Planned Parenthood stopped to talk with the volunteer, who offered a coupon for a free ultrasound.
The mother accepted and, before long, she was on a mobile pregnancy center bus where she learned she was carrying TWINS!
The volunteer couldn't wait to share the news with his fellow prayer warriors. ""God be praised!"" he said.
Two lives saved–just like that!""
Day #38
""An expectant mother visited the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania vigil site, asking to speak with one particular sidewalk counselor she had met a few weeks ago.
""She said that she changed her mind about aborting her child after talking to this counselor,"" said Paul, the local leader. ""We were hugging her and thanking God. We all had tears in our eyes. It was a beautiful moment for the mom and all present.""
But there's more! It turns out this mother's teenage daughter is ALSO pregnant and was planning to have an abortion.
After her encounter with the 40 Days for Life team, the woman went home and talked her daughter out of having an abortion too!
One vigil site interaction spared a mother from having an abortion, spared her daughter from having an abortion, and spared both her child and grandchild from being aborted.
This family did not know about pregnancy resource centers, but the Harrisburg team was more than happy to help connect the mother-daughter duo with one.""

"Gay Mayor Joins Democrat Presidential Race, Surging to 3rd After Attacking Pence's Christian Faith",www1.cbn.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/gay-mayor-joins-democrat-presidential-race-surging-to-3rd-after-attacking-pences-christian-faith,"Vice President Mike Pence and Democrat presidential contender Pete Buttigieg (AP Photos) 6026376311001 Gay Mayor Joins Democrat Presidential Race, Surging to 3rd After Attacking Pence's Christian Faith
A long-shot Democratic candidate for 2020 is steadily climbing in the polls. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg officially announced his run for president Sunday.
""It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different. So that's why I'm here today. I'm here to join you to make a little news. My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete. I am a proud son of South Bend Indiana and I am running for president of the United States.""
""I'm here to make the case that a millennial Midwestern mayor might be exactly what we need,"" he said.
The latest Monmouth University poll shows Buttigieg has risen to third place at 9 percent among Iowa caucus-goers. Vice President Joe Biden is in first place with 27 percent of support even though he still has yet to announce whether he's running. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is in second with 16 percent.
A former intelligence officer and veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Buttigieg is a Rhodes Scholar who speaks eight languages and is a concert pianist.
Buttigieg has made waves in recent days, promoting his candidacy by attacking the Christian faith of Vice President Mike Pence.
If elected, the 37-year-old South Bend mayor would beat out Teddy Roosevelt and JFK as the nation's youngest president. He would also become the first homosexual president and the first president with a husband.
""When I was younger I would have done anything to not be gay,"" he said recently.
Now he says he's proud of it, claiming God made him this way, and he's attacking Pence for his biblical beliefs about sexuality. ""Your quarrel sir, is with my Creator,"" Buttigieg said.
He's pitting the freedom of religion against freedom from discrimination. ""That's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand, that if you've gotta problem with who I am, your problem is not with me,"" he said.
After Buttigieg decided to make the vice president his top target, Pence responded saying, ""I think Pete's quarrel is with the First Amendment. All of us in this country have a right to our religious beliefs.""
""I hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith,"" Pence said in a CNN interview.
As former Indiana governor, Pence worked closely with mayor of South Bend.
""My family and I have a view of marriage that's informed by our faith and we stand by that, but that doesn't mean that we're critical of anyone else who has a different point of view,"" Pence said in a CNBC interview.
Buttigieg's point of view places himself at the intersection of sexuality and religion. ""I'm not critical of his faith, I'm critical of bad policies,"" he claimed.
And it's the mayor's policies that will come under the spotlight in a presidential run. ""Some people I think voted to burn the house down because they'd seen how for years Democrat and Republican presidencies produced economic and social and political results that let them down.""
Buttigieg has defended liberal visions like the green new deal. He also supports a health care public option and even expanding the Supreme Court to up to 15 members - an idea which some liberals have embraced since the current court is slightly conservative."

Georgetown University will likely be the first school in the country to require students to pay a reparation fee benefiting descendents of slavery.
In 1838, the university sold 272 slaves to pay off the school's debt. Now students have voted overwhelmingly to give back to the slave descendents.
The measure, which has to be approved, would cost students $27.20 per semester. The fund will go toward projects in low-income communities where slave descendents now live.
The vote had a turnout of nearly 58 percent. Associated Press reports 2,541 students voted for the ""Reconciliation Contribution"" while 1,304 opposed.
It is unclear if the university will approve the measure, but in a statement after the vote, Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs at Georgetown University, stated, the ""university values the engagement of our students and appreciates that 3,845 students made their voices heard in yesterday's election. Our students are contributing to an important national conversation and we share their commitment to addressing Georgetown's history with slavery.""
In an interview with ABC News , Matt Hill, the university's media relations manager, stated, the university vows to ""carefully review the results of the referendum, and regardless of the outcome, will remain committed to engaging with students, descendants, and the broader Georgetown community and addressing its historical relationship to slavery.""
""So I think the atmosphere on campus is 'what next,'"" stated Nitya Biyani, a junior at Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service, to CBS News.
Biyani was one of the students who voted against the measure.
""My issue with this is that I felt like the university was sort of tossing the buck on to students,"" she said. ""I don't believe that students are the ones that need to be paying.""
If approved, this would be Georgetown's fourth action to help ease the ongoing tension between the university and slave descendents.
The school originally gave preferential status to descendants if they applied to the university. Secondly, they performed a liturgy service with descendants, where members of the university were part of an initiative to repent for the school's previous transgressions.
In 2017, the university renamed a building after Isaac Hawkins, one of the slaves who was sold in 1838.
The Students for GU272 advocacy group behind the measure is attempting to help other advocacy groups get reparations out of other universities as well."
