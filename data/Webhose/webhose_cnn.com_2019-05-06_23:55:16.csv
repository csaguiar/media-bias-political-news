'Never Been Kissed' turns 20 - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/entertainment/never-been-kissed-anniversary/index.html,"(CNN) It's time for South Glen South High School to have a class reunion.
Tuesday marks the 20th anniversary of the '90s rom-com in which Drew Barrymore stars as Josie Geller, a shy, 25-year-old junior copywriter at the Chicago Sun-Times, who poses as a student in her former high school to research teen culture for the newspaper. David Arquette co-stars as Josie's formerly cool kid brother, Rob, who tries to help her infiltrate the popular clique, while Michael Vartan plays the English teacher Josie falls for, Sam Coulson. The film has become a cult classic and was a labor of love for Barrymore. ""I wanted to make this movie because it taps into an emotion that everyone can identify with -- the awkward moments of our high school years. For Josie, high school was a horrible, humiliating experience,"" Barrymore said in an interview when the film debuted. ""She completely lacks in social skills, and now, when she has to relive those years by going back, she again misses the mark by the mile."" Read More Interview magazine talked to the film's costume designer Mona May about Josie's style evolution in the movie. ""Drew [Barrymore] is amazing, I've worked with her for many years -- she's so hands-on,"" May said. ""For 'Never Been Kissed' we went to Loehmanns to try clothes on because she really wanted to find the coolest, weirdest stuff to create this character."" If you want to relive your angsty high school memories, ""Never Been Kissed"" is currently streaming on HBONow. (HBO and CNN share parent company WarnerMedia.)"
The first-ever photos of a black hole may be coming very soon,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/world/first-black-hole-photo-scli-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) It's been a great year so far for space fans, with a partial solar eclipse , super blood wolf moon eclipse , and a Venus and Jupiter conjunction wowing onlookers.
Now there may be another exciting development to look forward to: the first ever photos of a black hole. Scientists from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration will present a ""groundbreaking result"" from the project on April 10, according to a media advisory. Anticipation is building ahead of the event, which will feature simultaneous press conferences in cities across the world and live streams in different languages. ""Have you heard that something is brewing on April 10th? It's no joke!"" reads a tweet from the collaboration. Read More The collaboration, called EHT, is a global network of telescopes that has been attempting to capture the first photograph of a black hole ever. The EHT project released this simulation image showing the accretion flow around Sagittarius A The first target is Sagittarius A, the site of a supermassive black hole 26,000 light years away from Earth, and the second is at the center of a galaxy known as M87. Black holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, according to NASA , creating a massive gravitational field which draws in everything around it, including light. These are the first massive black holes from the early universe In their attempt to capture an image of a black hole, scientists combined the power of eight radio telescopes around the world using Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry, according to the European Southern Observatory, which is part of the EHT. This effectively creates a virtual telescope around the same size as the Earth itself. Dong Lai, astronomy professor and black hole expert at Cornell University believes that the EHT team is gearing up for a big reveal. ""My guess is EHT will produce an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and also an image of one at the center of the nearby galaxy M87,"" said Lai, who is not involved in the EHT project, in a press release. Astronomers have found the fastest-growing black hole ever seen, and it's got a monster appetite ""More precisely, these are images of radiating hot gas orbiting very close to the black hole. The strong gravity -- the 'event horizon' -- of black holes create a dark shadow with a distinct shape where no light can be seen."" As Lai explained, it's hard to see black hole shadows clearly because any images are blurred by interstellar gas, which presents a complicated challenge for the EHT team. You can watch Wednesday's press conference in English via the European Commission YouTube channel or the National Science Foundation live stream at 9 a.m. ET. The existence of black holes is universally accepted among today's astronomers, but there is still a lot that we don't know about them. In June 2018, researchers at Australian National University found the fastest-growing black hole ever seen in the universe. The supermassive black hole, known as a quasar, is growing so fast it can devour a mass the size of the sun every two days. And in January 2019, scientists saw the oldest black holes in the universe for the first time. More than 13 billion years after they formed, the light that was released to create these distant massive black holes is now reaching our telescopes."

Researchers discover state of matter which is simultaneously solid and liquid,edition.cnn.com,Euan McKirdy,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/europe/potassium-solid-liquid-state-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) When is a solid not a solid?
Scientists have discovered that, under certain conditions, some elements could exhibit properties of both solids and liquids. A team of physicists based at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland used artificial intelligence to simulate what would happen if potassium was subject to huge pressure -- between about 200,000 and 400,000 times atmospheric pressure -- and heat -- between 400 to 800 Kelvin (260 to 980 degrees Fahrenheit). While potassium atoms, like most metals, behave in an orderly way under ordinary circumstances, the researchers noted that under extreme conditions they line up in complex arrangements -- a core of atoms lines up in a cylindrical tube, arranged in an ""X"" and four long chains sitting alongside this. The two distinct arrangements are referred to as ""host-guest structures,"" the study's co-author, Andreas Hermann told CNN. Read More The resulting substance is, on an atomic level, ""two intertwined, interlinked crystal lattices -- that in itself is a strange thing,"" he said. Chain-melted state The study, which is published this week in journal PNAS , found that under these conditions potassium atoms entered what is known as a chain-melted state, where one of the two lattices -- the ""guest"" part -- dissolved into liquid, while the ""host"" part remained solid. Scientists learn how to reverse time -- in theory ""Upon heating, the guest atoms can 'melt,' while the host atoms remain crystalline,"" the paper explains. ""The 'host' lattice is much stronger bound and so that remains a solid -- it needs more energy to melt it,"" he says. ""The 'guest' is weaker bound which is why it liquifies."" The two structures -- 80% host and 20% guest -- are identical on an atomic level, and only differ in how they line up. ""You can't distinguish the (atoms), when they forming you can't tell which one will go where,"" he says. ""If you could hold it, the liquid part could leak out, but because they're the same atoms, the solid will partially liquify to replace the liquid, and the liquid part will reconstitute itself (into the solid)."" Constantly reforming block of solid-liquid The resulting substance -- if it could be observed by humans -- would look like a solid block of potassium which is simultaneously leaking liquid and reforming as a solid. Hermann describes it as ""a sponge material that can soak up a liquid -- the sponge is solid, but in this case they are the same material. The sponge that soaks itself up. Then it leaks out it reforms the sponge around itself. As the structure is 80% ""host"" structure and 20% ""guest,"" the substance is ""always in a state of 80% solid, 20% liquid,"" he says. Machine learning advances Artificial intelligence models were developed to extrapolate what could be seen at the atomic level and apply these findings to much larger theoretical samples. Hermann says that the machine-learning modeling has implications for how other elements behave under similarly extreme conditions. ""We can replicate this modeling with other metals,"" he says. ""This machine learning technique is really taking off in the (physics) community right now -- it seems to be accurate enough to trust what comes up and we can upscale calculations and model entirely different processes. ""It's all driven by quantum mechanics calculations, which is restricted to hundreds of atoms, with machine learning we can upscale by a factor of a hundred. ""One can use machine learning to build a potential for how the atoms behave over a large temperature and pressure range."""
White nationalism hearing features Facebook and Google - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Donie O'Sullivan,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/white-nationalism-hearing-facebook-google/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) YouTube was forced to disable comments on a livestream of a House Judiciary hearing on hate crimes and white nationalism on social media Tuesday morning after it was flooded with racist and anti-Semitic comments.
The comments were an illustration of one of the issues at hand: Silicon Valley's ongoing struggle to stop the spread of hate across its platforms. Lawmakers are exploring possible legislative options on the issue. ""Due to the presence of hateful comments, we disabled comments on the livestream of today's House Judiciary Committee hearing,"" a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. ""Hate speech has no place on YouTube,"" they added. Even here, the divide between Democrats and Republicans on the prevalence of racist material online could be seen. Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat who chairs the committee, read during the hearing from a Washington Post story that referenced the hateful comments. Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert quickly responded, ""could that be another hate hoax? Just keep an open mind."" The hearing included representatives from Facebook and Google, who were appearing on a panel with six other witnesses, including civil rights activists, the father of two victims of an Islamophobic attack, invited by Democrats, and a prominent right-wing activist, Candace Owens of the conservative group Turning Point USA, invited by Republicans. Read More The hearing was held in an effort to inform lawmakers about possible legislative steps that could be taken to tackle online hate. But the event was highly partisan, with the Democratic and Republican members of the committee spending a good deal of time going after the opposing party's witnesses and in some instances defending their own. Even the witnesses themselves challenged each others' positions at times. For the most part the representatives from Facebook and Google didn't say anything their companies hadn't said publicly before, with both maintaining they were committed to tackling challenges on their platforms. The hearing was instead dominated by partisan sniping, including exchanges over past comments made by Owens. Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat, played audio of Owens appearing to defend Adolf Hitler. Owens had previously distanced herself from the comments and criticized Hitler. Lieu did not give Owens the opportunity to respond at the hearing, but Republican Rep. Greg Steube later did. Owens claimed that Lieu had purposely only played a short segment of the tape and said that in doing so, Lieu had been ""unbelievably dishonest."" The hearing came just a few weeks after a terror attack in New Zealand that was streamed live on Facebook . Fifty people at two mosques were killed in the attack. Social media networks have been criticized for the role their platforms can play in spreading extremist ideologies and radicalizing people, and for the lack of action they've taken on the problem of white supremacists and nationalists on their sites. Among those under fire are Facebook and Google, which owns the video sharing site YouTube, which has been blasted for hosting such content and for algorithms that can create a ""rabbit hole"" that takes users into more extreme videos. Another witness, Anti-Defamation League senior vice president of policy Eileen Hershenov, talked about the dangers of smaller platforms, which white supremacists have also been known to use. ""These platforms are like round-the-clock digital white supremacist rallies, creating online communities that amplify their vitriolic fantasies,"" Hershenov said. Mark Zuckerberg's new Facebook plan could make it harder to stop spread of violent videos Two weeks after the New Zealand massacre, Facebook announced that it would ban all ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on Facebook and Instagram. Previously, the company had banned white supremacy, but had viewed white nationalism differently. The company said it had decided to ban white nationalism after months of consultation with civil rights groups. Neither Google-owned YouTube nor Twitter have enacted similar blanket bans of white nationalism but both companies say they have policies to fight hate and the incitement of violence on their platforms."
Just a 'Little' black girl magic,edition.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/entertainment/little-cast-interview/index.html,"(CNN) Marsai Martin might want to work a little harder.
At least that's the joke her ""Little"" co-stars Issa Rae and Regina Hall made to CNN when asked why there haven't been more films like theirs, starring young actors of color. ""Cause she's lazy,"" Hall teased Martin. ""One movie and you're 14 already."" ""'Oh, I just started a production company just now,'"" Rae said, pretending to be Martin. ""I've been busy, I'm sorry,"" Martin said in a mock exasperated teen voice. Read More Indeed she has. As one of the stars of ABC's hit comedy ""Black-ish,"" Martin already had plenty on her plate. But when she was 13 she strolled into a pitch meeting with Universal Studios to suggest a reboot of the 1988 Tom Hanks hit, ""Big,"" modernized with a black female cast. ""The pitch meeting was actually pretty smooth,"" Martin told CNN. ""I wasn't nervous at all, because I didn't even know what nervous or afraid even meant."" The meeting eventually evolved, Martin said, into those gathered sharing memories from their childhoods. The young actress said she went to the ""Little"" pitch meeting dressed in a blazer to embody her character in the film, Jordan Sanders, the temperamental business woman who wakes up one morning having been thrust back to childhood. Hall portrays Jordan as an adult. The pair said they worked closely together to create continuity for their character. ""We talked a little bit before we actually started shooting and then we kind of grew with Jordan,"" Martin said. ""Regina was on set every single day. She was watching my scenes and I would watch hers to actually get the feel of what Jordan would be like."" And while the movie is based on the beloved ""Big,"" Rae, who portrays Jordan's much put upon assistant April Williams, said ""Little"" stands on its own. "" allowfullscreen> ""People are going to compare, but we really tried to make our own thing,"" she said. ""Little's"" director Tina Gordon said body-swapping movies are such a popular genre that she focused more on character development than the fact it's a reboot. ""I actually just delve deep into the characters and who those women would be, which is what you have to do, breathing life into any piece that you're writing,"" she said. ""Those characters are what make the story new."" That's where the black girl magic comes in. Not only is the movie about black female characters, conceived of and starring a young, black woman and directed by a black woman, but it also offers black women of all ages the opportunity to see themselves on the big screen. Will Packer produced ""Little"" and hopes it will create more opportunities for family films told from a black perspective, much like Jordan Peele's success with ""Us"" is stoking interest in black horror films and ""Black Panther"" has Hollywood on the lookout for the next big, black superhero movie. ""I think the world itself is changing, and so now you're going to see films that feel more diverse and more inclusive,"" Packer said before adding, ""Remember we're starting from such a deficit that now that there's more, it doesn't mean that we're anywhere near where we need to be."" Martin aims to do her part to get the industry there. She's already made history with ""Little"" as the youngest person to ever executive produce a major Hollywood film. Her next project actually came via Martin's first-look deal with Universal, where she will be developing scripted projects via her Genius Productions company . The teen will star in ""StepMonster,"" a comedy about a young girl trying to navigate life with her stepmother. Rae and Hall joked that they're cast in that film as well and teased their young co-star about a possible ""Little"" sequel, with Rae lamenting, ""Marsai, work harder!"" So will there be a ""Little"" sequel? ""We have to figure out how this 'Little' does first before there's a 'Little' sequel,"" Martin laughed. ""That's the answer."""
'Reconstruction' connects post-war past to 21st century,edition.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/entertainment/reconstruction-review/index.html,"(CNN) The legacy of slavery, the Civil War and its aftermath are much-discussed in American politics, but seldom expansively enough to bring genuine context to them. PBS and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. address that shortcoming in ""Reconstruction: America After the Civil War,"" a four-hour documentary that weaves together the past with policies and debates that remain much in evidence today.
Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves ""wasn't the end of the story. It was just the beginning,"" Gates explains near the outset, leading a tour through 50 years of US history, from Andrew Johnson becoming president through the release of D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation,"" a cinematic ode to racism -- dubbed by one expert ""the cultural apex of Southern redemption"" -- that shaped the modern image of the Ku Klux Klan. In between, ""Reconstruction"" enlists a host of academics to detail key events of the postwar years and connect policies designed to disenfranchise African-Americans to tactics that are still being widely employed. Later chapters look at the cultural response within the African-American community, and the disparate views of two key leaders of the era, W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, regarding the most effective means of pursuing racial justice. Many of the policies enacted during Reconstruction conspired to leave blacks mired in poverty, with the fallout from those actions lingering 150 years later. Legislative efforts were augmented by violence and disinformation -- the latter preying upon a relatively gullible, unsophisticated population in a manner, one historian notes, which mirrors the role social media has come to play this century. Read More All of that ties into the ugly specter of racism, which, author and Columbia University professor Eric Foner says, continues to be ""the deepest legacy of slavery in our society."" Nor does it require much of a stretch to chart a path, as the filmmakers do, from Jim Crow laws, efforts to rehabilitate the Confederacy's image and demonization of black men to racial profiling, a surge in white supremacy and attempts to suppress African-American political participation. Gates has become a regular presence on PBS, but file this under the more substantial side of that contribution, compared to, say, his popular ""Finding Your Roots"" series, which also pairs him with filmmaker Dyllan McGee. (The subject ties in with a related book by Gates that's being released this month.) In his introduction, Gates dubs Reconstruction one of American history's most consequential chapters, as well as one of the most ""misrepresented and misunderstood."" Even a four-hour documentary isn't sufficient to remedy that lack of understanding, but thanks to the artful way that ""Reconstruction"" lays out its case, it's a start. ""Reconstruction: America After the Civil War"" premieres April 9 at 9 p.m. on PBS."
"Randolph ""Tex"" Alles is being removed as United States Secret Service Director by Trump - CNNPolitics",www.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/randolph-tex-alles-secret-service-director/index.html,"Trump is removing US Secret Service director By Jake Tapper, Evan Perez and Betsy Klein, CNN Updated 4:36 PM EDT, Mon April 08, 2019
(CNN) United States Secret Service director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles is being removed from his position, multiple administration officials tell CNN.
President Donald Trump instructed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to fire Alles. Alles remains in his position as of now but has been asked to leave.
The USSS director was told two weeks ago there would be a transition in leadership and he was asked to stay on until there was a replacement, according to a source close to the director.
Secret Service officials have been caught by surprise with the news and are only finding out through CNN, according to the source. Stephen Miller wants Trump to oust more senior leaders at Homeland Security
In an email to employees at his agency obtained by CNN's Jim Acosta , Alles told the workforce he was not fired, but was told weeks ago that the administration would be making ""transitions in leadership"" at the Department of Homeland Security.
""The President has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction,"" he wrote.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said later Monday that Trump has picked James M. Murray, a career USSS official, to replace Alles.
""United States Secret Service director Randolph 'Tex' Alles has done a great job at the agency over the last two years, and the President is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country. Mr. Alles will be leaving shortly and President Trump has selected James M. Murray, a career member of the USSS, to take over as director beginning in May,"" she said.
A source familiar with the director said his ouster was not related to the recent scrutiny the Secret Service got after a Chinese woman illegally entered the President's Mar-a-Lago club carrying Chinese passports and a flash drive containing malware.
Just five days ago, Trump said he ""could not be happier with Secret Service"" following the Mar-a-Lago incident.
""Secret Service has done a fantastic job from Day 1. Very happy with them,"" Trump said during a White House event when asked by reporters about the Mar-a-Lago trespasser.
The Secret Service director reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned on Sunday amid growing pressure from the President. The director oversees the Secret Service's work on both protection and investigations.
""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" one senior administration official says. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick are expected to be gone soon, and the White House is eyeing others to be removed.
The President in recent weeks empowered Stephen Miller to lead the administration's border policies ""and he's executing his plan"" with what amounts to a wholesale decapitation or the Department of Homeland Security leadership, the official says.
Alles previously served in Customs and Border Protection leadership and also led that agency's Air and Marine Operations. He is a 35-year veteran of the Marine Corps.
CNN's Pamela Brown, Jim Acosta, Jeremy Diamond and Allie Malloy contributed to this report. This story has been updated. "

In another sign that the economy is cooling off, employers posted fewer job openings in February , after a year of mounting demand for workers.
The number of postings declined by 538,000 , the Labor Department reported Tuesday , down from 7.1 million in January. The job openings rate is still higher than it was at this time last year, but now there is definitely a slowdown.
The biggest drops came in the hospitality and food services sector, potentially an indication that leisure spending is weakening.
The rate of workers quitting their jobs, usually seen as a sign that employees are confident enough in the labor market to make a transition, has been trending sideways for half a year now after steadily rising out of the Great Recession.
February was also a bad month for job growth, with only 33,000 new positions created. Job openings may recover in March along with the more positive payrolls data released last week.

Chuck Grassley warns administration against dismissing more immigration officials,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/chuck-grassley-immigration-officials-purge/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is urging the Trump administration not to dismiss a top immigration official amid an ongoing exodus of Department of Homeland Security officials, according to the Washington Post.
In an interview with the paper late Monday, Grassley said he was ""very, very concerned"" about reports that Lee Francis Cissna, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, may follow several other top department officials out the door. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who had been on rocky terms with President Donald Trump, submitted her resignation, and last week, the White House abruptly withdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello for director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which caught Congress and the department by surprise. Additionally, on Monday, Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was also ousted. Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security ""One, those are good public servants,"" Grassley said of Cissna and Vitiello, according to the Post. ""Secondly, besides the personal connection I have with them and the qualifications they have, they are the intellectual basis for what the President wants to accomplish in immigration."" Read More The Post reported that Grassley, who represents Iowa, ""had already worked closely with Cissna, who had been detailed from the administration to work on the Senate Judiciary Committee"" when Grassley chaired the committee. Grassley said he told White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney Monday ""his concerns about Cissna's potential departure,"" according to the paper. Grassley said Mulvaney, who, according to the senator, ""didn't seem to know who (he) was talking about,"" planned to look into the issue after he raised it. Additionally, the Post reported Grassley was planning to make an appearance on Fox News -- the President's preferred news outlet -- ""to make his case publicly."" Grassley told the paper that Trump ""has to have some stability and particularly with the number one issue that he's made for his campaign, throughout his two and a half years of presidency."" ""He's pulling the rug out from the very people that are trying to help him accomplish his goal,"" he said, according to the Post."
Pew: Americans across racial backgrounds agree race relations are bad -- and they agree on little else,edition.cnn.com,Grace Sparks,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/pew-race-report/index.html,"(CNN) White Americans and people of color don't agree on much regarding race relations, except for the fact that they're generally bad, according to a new survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center .
Of those surveyed, 58% overall said race relations are generally bad. Blacks were the most likely to have said that race relations are bad (71%), followed by 60% of Hispanics, and 56% of whites. More than half of Americans said race relations are getting worse, 30% staying the same, and a low 17% said they're getting better. But there's little else people agree on, per the survey. While most black Americans feel the country has not gone far enough in its efforts to give black people equal rights with whites (78%), whites were more apt to say that the country's attempts to provide equal rights have been about right (43%) with slightly fewer seeing them as lagging (37%). And while half or more Hispanic (50%) and black (67%) adults say the country gives too little attention to race and racial issues these days, just 28% of whites agree. Read More The poll also finds sharp divides along racial lines on whether the bigger problem is overlooked racial discrimination (84% of blacks, 67% of Latinos and 71% of Asians said so, but just 48% of whites agree) or people seeing racial discrimination where it does not exist (52% of whites see this as the larger problem compared with 14% of blacks, 30% of Hispanics and 29% of Asian Americans). This comes as reparations for the descendants of slaves has become a key issue for Democrats seeking the 2020 nomination. Several candidates have voiced their support for legislation that would create a panel to study reparations. On Monday, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey -- one of the many Democrats running for president -- said he planned to introduce a Senate version of the plan. Almost two-thirds of Americans (63%) reported that the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in American society today a great deal or a fair amount, but blacks were much more likely to have said their position in society was affected (84%) while 58% of whites said the same. The poll also finds that partisanship is nearly as divisive as racial identity when it comes to views on race relations and the experience of race in America, with few seeing President Donald Trump as helping ease frayed racial tensions. Overall, 56% reported that Trump has made race relations worse. About a third of Republicans (34%) said Trump has improved race relations, while a quarter said he has tried but failed to make progress, 19% said he hasn't addressed the issue, and 20% said he has made the situation worse. A huge majority of Democrats (84%) said Trump has made race relations worse. Compared that to former President Barack Obama: In a previous Pew survey done earlier this year, 37% said he made progress in improving race relations. In Tuesday's survey, 15% said the same of Trump. Since Trump has been elected, 65% of Americans said it has become more common for people to express racist or racially insensitive views and fewer who said it's about as common (29%). A plurality (45%) also said it has become more acceptable for people to express those views since the president was elected and 31% said it is just as acceptable. Party identification was a much bigger divider than race in most of the survey. Three-quarters of white Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the bigger problem was seeing discrimination where it doesn't exist, while the same percentage of white Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said not seeing discrimination when it does exist was a bigger problem. White Democrats and leaners were also much more likely to have said that the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people (80%) than white Republicans and leaners (40%). Nine percent of Americans said that all or most white people in the US are prejudiced against black people, including 6% of white people and 20% of black people. On the other side, 13% of Americans said all or most black people are prejudiced against white people, including 14% of white people and 10% of black people. In general, black people are much more likely than white people to report in the poll that blacks are generally treated less fairly than whites in many different situations, including in dealing with the police, by the criminal justice system, and in hiring, pay and promotions. Three-in-10 white people said blacks are treated less fairly than whites when voting in elections, while 58% of blacks said the same. Slightly less than half of white Americans said that being white has helped their ability to get ahead, while another half said it hasn't made a difference. Fewer Hispanics and Asians reported that their race has neither helped nor hurt them (44% and 40%, respectively), while only 29% of blacks said so. Half of blacks said that their race has hurt their ability to get ahead. Black Americans are much more likely than Hispanics, Asians or whites to have said that their race is important to their identity -- 74% of blacks said it was extremely or very important compared to 59% of Hispanics, 54% of Asians, and 15% of whites. When talking about types of discrimination they've experienced, black Americans were much more likely to report people acting suspicious of them and like they weren't smart. Asians were much more likely than other groups to have said they were subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity (61%). The Pew Research Center survey is based on the American Trends Panel, conducted online. Interviews were conducted January 22 - February 5, 2019 among a national sample of 1,432 adults, 18 years of age or older, living in the United States."
9 top administration officials who told Trump 'no' -- and what happened next,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-mcgahn-tillerson-nielsen/index.html,"(CNN) Two weeks before she was fired, Kirstjen Nielsen told President Donald Trump ""no.""
Nielsen, at the time the head of the Department of Homeland Security, resisted Trump's order to close the US border with Mexico in El Paso; by telling Trump the move would be ""a bad and even dangerous idea, and that the governor of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, has been very supportive of the President,"" reported CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday .

Trump eventually scrapped the idea -- although he floated the idea of closing the entire US-Mexico border via Twitter soon after. Eventually he gave up on that idea as well . Nielsen joined a surprisingly long list of White House aides who told Trump ""no"" when he asked them to do something that they believed was either illegal, politically perilous -- or both. Not coincidentally, all of the people who told Trump ""no"" don't work for him anymore. My list of them is below. Did I leave anyone out? Email me at cillizza@cnn.com . Read More Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson : ""When the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it.' And I'd have to say to him, 'Well Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way . It violates the law. It violates treaty.'"" Former FBI Director James Comey: ""'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting [former national security adviser Michael] Flynn go,'"" Comey said Trump told him in a one-on-one meeting at the White House in 2017. ""'He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.'"" Comey recounted that he told Trump only that Flynn ""is a good guy"" but made no promise to end the FBI investigation. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis : Trump wanted Mattis to execute the withdrawal of troops from Syria. Mattis refused -- and resigned. Trump later agreed to leave 400 US troops in Syria. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly : Kelly repeatedly clashed with Trump -- and said in an exit interview with the Los Angeles Times that his time in the job should be measured by the things he kept Trump from doing. This, from The New York Times , is enlightening in that regard: ""In the Los Angeles Times interview, Mr. Kelly conceded that Mr. Trump often pressed against the legal boundaries of his role, as the former secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, said recently. ""The president would ask things like, 'Why can't we do it this way?' Mr. Kelly said."" Former White House counsel Don McGahn : In June 2017, Trump ordered McGahn to fire special counsel Robert Mueller . McGahn refused and said he would quit if Trump went through with it. Former Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn : Cohn was vocal in his opposition to Trump's plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump put them in place anyway. Cohn quit . Former national security adviser H.R. McMaster : The beginning of the end for McMaster was when he told the Munich Security Conference in 2017 that, contra Trump, evidence that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election was "" incontrovertible .""Trump publicly pushed back on that contention. Less than a month later, McMaster was gone. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions : Sessions repeatedly refused Trump's cajolin g to un-recuse himself in the Russia investigation being run by the FBI. Trump never forgave Sessions for that decision, publicly bullying him and undermining him until the President removed Sessions from the job the day after the 2018 election. White House lawyers Ty Cobb and John Dowd : Two of the original members of Trump's legal team focused on the Mueller report, both men repeatedly urged the President not to personally attack the special counsel . Trump, obviously, ignored that advice -- and eventually got rid of both men. The common thread here -- as you likely noticed by now -- is that a grand total of none of the people above who stood up to one of Trump's demands are employed by Trump's White House any longer. Which is, uh, not a coincidence. Trump has systematically eliminated opposition to even his wildest asks and demands over the past 18 months -- prizing unstinting loyalty to him over all other traits when it comes to searching for replacement to these ""no"" men and women. The formula to get -- and keep -- your job within the Trump administration is now clear: Don't tell the President ""no."""
$4 gas is nearly a reality for many Americans - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/gas-prices/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) US gasoline prices are becoming a real pain for motorists, particularly in the west.
A survey of more than 5,000 gas stations conducted by AAA shows that the average price for a gallon of regular gas is now $2.75, up 11% in the last month. And the average price is already above $3 a gallon in six western states: California, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and Alaska. Four-dollar gas is the average in a couple of California counties. Many others are within a few cents of that mark, including San Francisco, where the average price is $3.98. The statewide average in California is up 20 cents a gallon, or 5%, to $3.83 in just the last week. The Midwest has also been hit by price spikes. The average price in Chicago has jumped 46 cents a gallon, or 16%, to $3.27 in the last month. Unplanned refinery maintenance at several locations is responsible for the sudden, and uneven, increases across the nation, said Tom Kloza, head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. Western states are particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions because they have less refining capacity than other locations across the United States. Read More ""The western half of the country hasn't added any refining capacity this century,"" said Kloza. ""It's been a cluster of difficulties but not disasters hurting supplies, particularly out in the West."" America imported no oil from Venezuela last week. Here's why that's a big deal Kloza said $4-a-gallon gas will be common in California and perhaps in some other western states in the coming weeks. But most of the country could start to see some relief in gas prices soon as refineries along the Gulf Coast start to come back online from scheduled maintenance in the coming weeks. Crude oil prices have also played a role in the steady rise in gasoline prices, although gas prices increases have outpaced those in oil markets. US crude oil is up 51% since December 24. American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela and fighting in Libya have combined with a cutback on oil production by OPEC nations to drive up the price of oil. ""Almost every day since the day after Christmas, both gas prices and oil prices have crept up,"" said Kloza."

Democrats unveil bill to expand protections against workplace harassment and discrimination - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Clare Foran,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/workplace-harassment-discrimination-bill-congress-democrats/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A group of Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday are unveiling sweeping legislation to strengthen and expand federal protections aimed at preventing workplace harassment and discrimination nationwide.
The legislation, titled the ""BE HEARD in the Workplace Act,"" is being introduced in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a member of Senate leadership and the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. A number of high-profile congressional Democrats have signed on as co-sponsors, including 2020 candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker as well as Bernie Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats. A companion version of the legislation is also being introduced in the House, an effort led by Democratic Reps. Katherine Clark, Ayanna Pressley, Elissa Slotkin and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. While the Democratic-backed bill faces tough odds of passage given the Republican-controlled Senate, the effort comes after Congress passed long-stalled legislation at the end of last year to reform the way sexual harassment is handled on Capitol Hill. Read More As the #MeToo movement rose to prominence, Capitol Hill has been forced to confront its own problems with workplace harassment and a number of lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats, have had to resign as a result of sexual misconduct scandals. In the wake of Congress taking steps to get itself in order over sexual harassment, the BE HEARD Act represents a push to more broadly tackle the issue of harassment and discrimination in industries across the country. The legislation is focused on preventing sexual harassment as well as other forms of workplace harassment and discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, age and disability. The bill introduction follows a report on workplace harassment released by Murray last year. The report shared stories of harassment experienced by individuals working in a variety of jobs, including as nannies, fast food workers, and hotel housekeepers. That report concluded that existing protections enshrined in law are inadequate and outlined a series of recommendations for congressional action. The BE HEARD Act has a wide-ranging set of provisions that include convening a task force that will make recommendations on strategies to prevent harassment, facilitating research on workplace harassment, and eliminating the tipped minimum wage. According to a summary of the legislation provided by Murray's office, the bill requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ""to convene a harassment prevention task force that includes business leaders, researchers, employee advocates, and others."" The summary states that the task force will ""identify and recommend harassment prevention strategies"" as well as ""provide sector-specific guidance to industries with particularly prevalent or severe harassment."" Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Census Bureau and the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics will develop ""a national prevalence survey on harassment in the workplace"" that will be administered by the Census Bureau. The legislation would further require the US Commission on Civil Rights to ""study the enforcement of civil rights, nondiscrimination and laws prohibiting harassment"" and would require BLS to ""study the economic impacts of harassment in employment."" According to the summary, ""Employers with 15 or more employees are required to adopt, maintain, and periodically review a comprehensive harassment and nondiscrimination policy, which will establish policies and procedures to prevent and respond to discrimination and harassment."" The bill would also eliminate the tipped minimum wage, which the summary of the legislation says, ""exacerbates harassment of workers who rely on tips."" Among a number of other provisions, the legislation would also establish a ""grant program run by the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor for grants for private entities, including colleges, community based organizations, nonprofits, labor organizations, legal aid groups, to prevent and address employment discrimination, including harassment."" The legislation comes with endorsements from a long list of organizations, including the ACLU, NAACP, Human Rights Campaign, the Center for American Progress, National Women's Law Center and National Domestic Workers Alliance."
Boeing 737 deliveries fall by a third - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/boeing-737-max-deliveries/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Airlines are holding off on orders for Boeing's 737 Max ‚Äî the latest sign of how deeply the company's best-selling jet has been thrown into crisis.
Boeing ( BA ) released data Tuesday that showed only 10 of the planes were ordered in the first two months of 2019. There were no orders in March, the month that a 737 Max jet flown by Ethiopian Airlines pilots crashed in that country, killing everyone aboard. It was the second fatal crash involving a Max in recent months. That small number compares to 112 orders for the plane in the first quarter of 2018. At that time, Southwest Airlines ( LUV ) had ordered 40 of the jets, while Ryanair ordered 25. Orders for Boeing's other commercial jets actually increased slightly. The company sold 85 other commercial jets last quarter, compared to 68 a year earlier. But the sales data for the Max gives the clearest picture yet of how much scrutiny of that model could be hurting Boeing's bottom line. Investigators are still probing the cause of the Ethiopian crash, as well as the other Max crash involving a Lion Air jet last October. The two accidents killed 346 people in all, and eventually prompted the grounding of all 737 Max planes last month. Boeing also halted deliveries and announced last week that it was scaling back production of the 737 Max. Read More The focus of the crash investigations is the plane's automatic safety system, for which Boeing says it is developing a software fix . The fatal crashes are not the only cause of the sales drop, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst for the Teal Group. He attributed much of the change to the massive number of orders for the next generation of single-aisle jets that both Boeing and rival Airbus had previously booked. Airbus actually had worse first quarter orders for its A320, its 737 Max competitor. ""This is the mother of all frontloaded markets,"" said Aboulafia. Boeing has orders for 5,000 of the 737 Max jets on its books already. So far only one airline, Indonesia's Garuda, has outright canceled an order for 50 of the 737 Max jets since the grounding. Boeing also said Tuesday that all 737 deliveries in the first quarter fell by a third, to 89 from 132 a year ago. But most of that drop was caused by the reduced production and delivery of the older version of the 737 jet that Boeing is still building for some customers. Deliveries of the the older 737 jets fell by 66% to 32. Deliveries of the 737 Max increased by 54% compared to a year ago to 57, even with a two-week halt. That's because Boeing spent most of 2017 ramping up production of the Max."

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota defended herself Tuesday afternoon against Republican criticism she has faced over a tweet she wrote that slammed a senior White House adviser as a ""white nationalist"" Monday on Twitter.
""It is the most bizarre thing,"" Omar told CNN on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, when asked about the condemnation she's faced since she tweeted that ""Stephen Miller is a white nationalist"" on Monday. In her tweet, Omar pointed to reporting that Miller has been behind President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies and convinced the President to drop his nominee to lead US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and go in a ""tougher direction."" ""You know we are talking about someone who truly believes not a single refugee, not a single immigrant, should set foot on American soil,"" Omar told CNN Tuesday, referencing Miller. ""I am appalled by that. Because unlike him and others, I haven't forgotten my roots. I know what it meant for me to get the opportunity to come to the United States to start anew."" Omar also attacked Trump and Miller for what she saw as forgetting their own roots. ""And many of his family and Trump's family came here to get that opportunity and they forget,"" Omar said. ""They forget that that is how ... how they got the chance to become president or work in the White House. Because they got the chance to come to the United States because their families got a chance to come to the United States. So when you get that opportunity, you do not turn your back on the next person who is seeking that opportunity. And I am here to make sure they never forget."" Read More New York man charged with threatening to assault and kill Rep. Ilhan Omar Omar has faced criticism of her own in recent weeks. One of the first two Muslim women in Congress, she has been accused of pushing anti-Semitic tropes, which prompted a rebuke from several House Democratic leaders. Republican critics of Omar, including the President's son Donald Trump Jr., viewed the congresswoman's attack against Miller, who is Jewish, as anti-Semitic. When the President tweeted a news clip criticizing Omar, the congresswoman responded by tweeting, ""In the words of my 6 year-old daughter, 'Knock it off. You're the president.'"" Another House Democrat, Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, defended Omar, saying he was never accused of anti-Semitism when he also called Miller a white nationalist last year. ""Rather than attacking (Omar), why won't they stand up to white nationalism & President Trump's support for 'very fine people'?"" Pocan wrote on Twitter Tuesday, referring to the President's remarks about the 2017 Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Virginia. Late Tuesday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley dismissed Omar's remarks. ""Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has a well-documented history of anti-Semitic comments, social media posts and relationships -- so it's not surprising that she would wildly attack a Jewish member of the Administration,"" Gidley said in a statement. ""It is completely ignorant to slander a Jewish man as a White Nationalist, and it dishonors the Jewish victims of anti-Semitic persecution across the globe."" Trump appears to be in the midst of cleaning house at the Department of Homeland Security. Over the past two days , Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles were ousted, and at least two other officials have been named as possibly heading out the door. CNN reported that at least some of the sudden personnel changes came at the urging of Miller, who's been recently empowered by the President to lead the administration's border policies. Miller was the author of Trump's controversial travel bans and the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy that was halted due to the backlash over thousands of undocumented children separated from their families at the border.

Flying cars could save us from climate change - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jen Christensen,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/flying-cars-emissions-climate-change-scn/index.html,"(CNN) Maybe the Jetsons were climate change activists?
A new study shows that the cartoon family was on to something when they used a flying car for transportation. Several companies and even agencies such as NASA have been scrambling to create flying cars, hoping to launch the service in the next decade, and that may be a part of the answer to help curb climate change, according to a new study . The study, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications by authors from the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems and Ford Motor Company, compared the energy use of the electric version of flying cars, known as electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or VTOLs, to that of traditional and electric cars. The study also looked at the time-saving aspect of the vehicles and their overall energy use. It's not quite like having a car in the driveway that happens to have wings. The VTOLs are all in prototype stage, and none is commercially available. Read More There are different styles in the works. One example is Uber's model, which calls for air taxis that can cruise at 150 to 200 miles per hour at an altitude between 1,000 and 2,000 feet, with a battery lasting up to 60 miles before needing to recharge. Are flying taxis about to become a reality? According to the new study, fully loaded with a pilot and three passengers, flying electric cars would have about 52% lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional cars and would generate 6% lower greenhouse gas emissions than electric cars over trips of 100 kilometers, about 62 miles. Researchers used publicly available information from the companies that have created these prototypes to create a model that computes how much energy they would use and how much greenhouse gas they would generate. ""I grew up watching 'The Jetsons.' To see this becoming a reality is really something, "" said study co-author Gregory A. Keoleian, director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. ""We were very surprised by the results."" Are flying motorbikes the future for Dubai? The study found that flying cars wouldn't necessarily be more sustainable on a short commute compared with electric vehicles, but they would be a good sustainable alternative for longer trips. ""The energy implications of takeoff and landing are inherently higher than cruise,"" said Noah Furbush, a graduate student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering who worked on the study. ""So we tried to limit the time spent in takeoff hover or landing hover as much as possible, and we tried to spend as much time as possible in the most efficient cruise that we can."" In terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency, fully occupied flying cars could outperform ground-based cars for trips from San Francisco to San Jose, for example, the authors found. The Nigerian inventor who wants to build a flying jet car These types of cars would be especially useful in cities congested with traffic. They'd also be good for geographic areas that are isolated or have other mobility constraints, for example if you had to go over water, like on a commute from Detroit to Cleveland or London to Paris. They'd also be a much faster alternative than driving on the ground. The authors conclude that more research is needed to see exactly how viable flying cars are in terms of cost and noise. And to be sustainable, Keoleian said he would hopes the vehicles would be kept for this niche use of longer travel, with multiple passengers.

""We wouldn't want this to be too convenient where people would start to live further from work and encourage sprawl, because that defeats the purpose in terms of energy consumption,"" Keoleian said. ""We do live in a carbon constrained world and we need to invest in technology that will reduce energy use and emissions."""

Sisi emphasized through a translator that relations ""have not been better."" Trump also noted that first lady Melania Trump was recently in Egypt, having visited the pyramids in October. ""What she saw with the pyramids was -- you could call it the 7th wonder or the 8th Wonder of the World. She thought it was one of the most incredible things she's seen and we have lots of pictures,"" he said. ""But she's not easily impressed, she was very impressed."" Their meetings focused on security and the economy, but human rights were also to be discussed, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on a background call ahead of the visit. Sisi last came the White House in April 2017 , marking the first time an Egyptian leader had visited in seven years. Earlier Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Sisi. Pompeo ""re-affirmed the strength and importance of the US-Egypt bilateral relationship"" and discussed counterterrorism efforts, ""countering the Iranian regime's malign influence"" and ""cases concerning US citizens in Egypt,"" according to a readout.

""These suspects have strong (links) to kidnapping tourists,"" Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga told CNN on Tuesday of the eight Ugandan suspects. ""This is something they had been planning on doing -- to kidnap tourists with (the) intention (of getting a) ransom."" It was not clear if the suspects were targeting Americans or foreigners in general.

4 key takeaways from William Barr's testimony on the Mueller report,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/william-barr-mueller-report-donald-trump/index.html,"(CNN) For the first time since the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Attorney General William Barr faced questions on Capitol Hill regarding his handling of Mueller's findings, when he plans to release the report and how he will handle the issue of redacted information.
Barr was loath to provide many details other than to say that the Justice Department planned to release the redacted report in the next week. But in not answering some of the more pointed questions asked by House Democrats, Barr did reveal some important information that moves our understanding of not only the Mueller report but of his handling of it. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
Below, the key takeaways from Barr's testimony. Barr wouldn't say whether the White House has seen or will see the report before its release Barr repeatedly refused to answer a direct question as to whether the White House has seen -- or will see -- the full Mueller report prior to its release. That is a change from Barr's past statement just 11 days ago when he said in a letter sent to the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. ""Although the President would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report,"" Barr wrote in that letter , ""he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review."" Read More So as of March 29, there were ""no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review."" But as of today, Barr wouldn't answer whether the White House has or would see the report prior to its release. Which suggests, at least to me, that the White House either has or could see the report before its release. Barr later acknowledged that he advised the White House counsel before his letter went out on March 24. He said that the letter may have been read to them, but they did not get a hard copy of it. Congress will not see the unredacted version of the report ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr said in response to questions from Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Graves about whether leaking the full, unredacted report by a member of Congress would be a crime. Barr also said, in response to questions by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), that the redacted version of the Mueller report that Congress would see would be the same one that the public sees. The one possible exception he left open: If the chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees wanted to see the full report, Barr seems to suggest he would be willing to talk to them about that. Barr wouldn't say Trump is wrong about obstruction Lowey asked Barr a very simple question: Who is right -- the President, who says he was totally exonerated on the question of collusion and obstruction or Mueller, who Barr directly quoted in his summary letter, saying ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him?"" Barr didn't answer, insisting he has said everything he planned to say about the report until it comes out. Which means that Barr didn't want to say the President is wrong -- which he is, at least on the question of obstruction -- in a public setting. Barr had a head start on what was in the Mueller report One of the biggest focuses of House Democrats' on the committee was how Barr took a 300+-page report produced over a 22-month period and condensed its findings to a four-page letter summarizing its bottom-line conclusion in less than 72 hours. Barr shed some light on the ""how"" behind that fast read. He said that he had ""some inkling as to some of the thinking of the special counsel"" due to public reporting on indictments, etc. filed by Mueller. And, Barr said, he and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with the special counsel team on March 5, where they were briefed on the basic conclusions of the report."
Mnuchin acknowledges White House and Treasury lawyers discussed Trump tax returns,edition.cnn.com,Donna Borak,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mnuchin-tax-returns-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said his agency's lawyers consulted with but did not take direction from the White House on the issue of releasing President Donald Trump's personal tax returns.
""I don't see that as interference,"" Mnuchin said when asked by New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney at a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. ""They consulted with them before. It was not related to the President's tax returns, only the expectation of getting the request."" House Democrats last week formally requested Trump's tax returns from the Treasury Department using an obscure statute of tax law. Mnuchin, who has previously testified that he would comply with requests, added that he had not and would not ask the White House for permission. ""We would not ever ask for the White House's permission on this nor did they give us the permission. As I've said we consulted which I believe was appropriate of our legal department,"" Mnuchin said. Read More Maloney called ""any communication"" with the White House as ""troubling"" and said it ""violates the spirit of the law."" But Mnuchin sought to portray himself as independent of the White House. ""I am not afraid of being fired at all,"" Mnuchin said when pressed by Maxine Waters, the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, if anything would override his responsibility to the law. Waters separately pressed Mnuchin on his recent decision to lift sanctions on companies tied to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Mnuchin's appearance ended in a clash with Waters over his request to end the hearing in time for a previously scheduled commitment. ""Mr. Secretary, I want you to know that no other secretary has ever told us the day before that they were going to limit their time in the way that you're doing, so if you want to use them as examples, you have acted differently than they have acted, and as I have said, if you wish to leave, you may,"" Waters told him. ""If you'd wish to keep me here so that I don't have my important meeting and continue to grill me, then we can do that. I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here. I will be very clear if that's the way you'd like to have this relationship,"" Mnuchin responded. After further back and forth, Waters fired back: ""You are free to leave. Any time you want, you may go."" After conferring with staff, Mnuchin told the committee he would be willing to stay a little longer. In an earlier hearing Tuesday, Mnuchin acknowledged for the first time that White House and Treasury lawyers held conversations, which he later described as a consultation before the formal request was made. Mnuchin said he personally had not been involved in the conversations and had not spoken to Trump or anyone else inside the White House about the release request. ""I have not had any conversations with anyone inside the White House,"" Mnuchin told Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Illinois, chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Treasury. He also added that those conversations happened before House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, made a formal request for the President's records last week . When asked Tuesday night by CNN's Anderson Cooper whether it was acceptable that other Treasury Department employees have consulted with the White House, given that they are both part of the executive branch, Waters replied, ""No, it's not OK."" ""As a matter of fact, let me just say this: We cannot believe anything that's been said by this President or by Mr. Mnuchin,"" Waters added. Democrats have argued that the President and the Treasury secretary shouldn't be involved in their request for Trump's tax returns under the law Neal is using to request Trump's returns. Democrats have repeatedly expressed concern that the President's personal lawyers sent a letter directly to Treasury asking the department not to comply with the request. ""I do have some concerns because obviously Secretary Mnuchin has made it clear that he will do what the President asks him to do, and it's a little frustrating because when he was before the committee, he indicated the IRS commissioner would follow the law and it wouldn't be something he'd insert himself into or interfere with,"" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. ""The President obviously does not want to comply with this, but it's not an option,"" he added. ""The law is very clear."" Tuesday's hearings were the Treasury head's first appearance since the request. The Trump administration has until Wednesday to respond, which Mnuchin later committed to meeting. ""In general, we try to accommodate these requests,"" Mnuchin told reporters in a brief gaggle. ""I'm not going to make a specific comment on that, but it would be a good guess."" During the hearing, Mnuchin made clear that he was speaking for himself and not everyone at Treasury, which includes the IRS. ""I personally wasn't involved in those conversations,"" said Mnuchin. ""I acknowledge there were conversations. I was not fully briefed on the extent of those discussions."" He has said in previous hearings that he would ""comply with the law"" regarding the release of Trump's returns. Mnuchin also told the committee last month that he's not typically involved in handling other requests for tax returns and that is a job that is handled by the IRS commissioner. Trump has broken with previous presidential precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, both as a candidate and since taking office, as well as by declining to divest from his family business, the Trump Organization. Democrats have demanded greater transparency regarding Trump's personal financial commitments as well as any obligations held through his businesses, which are now overseen by his two eldest sons. Neal is using a little-known provision in the tax code that allows the chairman of House Ways and Means panel to make requests for an individual's tax information. Neal and other Democrats have argued that the law clearly states that if the chairman asks for the information, the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it. ""This was a very reasonable approach,"" Neal told reporters last week. ""We wanted to make sure that the case we constructed was one that stood up under the critical scrutiny of the courts."" On Friday, Trump's lawyers sent a letter to the Department of Treasury's counsel dismissing the request for tax returns as a politically-motivated pursuit, writing that ""Ways and Means has no legitimate committee purpose for requesting the President's tax returns or return information. While the committee has jurisdiction over taxes, it has no power to conduct its own examination of individual taxpayers."" Separately, Democrats in New York on Monday made a fresh push to release Trump's documents , introducing legislation that would give Congress access to Trump's state tax returns."
Trump's beef with Nadler is decades old.,edition.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-jerry-nadler/index.html,"(CNN) Decades ago, a businessman and a state assemblyman had a public and personal feud over New York real estate. It's 2019, and they're still fighting, but now, one is President of the United States and the other is chairman of the House committee that has the power to unravel his presidency.
The beef was revived Tuesday in a series of tweets from President Donald Trump following a report in The Washington Post outlining his long-antagonistic relationship with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, the one lawmaker with the unique qualification of having already fought Trump for years. With Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, Nadler has again become a thorn in Trump's side, newly empowered as one of the key leaders of Democratic oversight efforts, or what Trump and his administration frequently deem ""presidential harassment."" Last week, Nadler authorized a subpoena to obtain the full, unredacted report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election from special counsel Robert Mueller, teeing up a showdown between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over the nearly 400-page report. NY Rep.: If it's proven Trump directed Cohen payments, would be 'impeachable offenses' And last month, Nadler's committee announced a sweeping investigation into Trump's campaign, businesses, transition and administration, a probe that could lay the groundwork for Democrats if they choose to pursue impeachment proceedings against the President. Read More The investigation predictably and swiftly drew the ire of the White House and the President himself, who criticized Nadler both publicly and privately. During a trade meeting with House Republicans last month, according to The Washington Post, Trump referred to the New York congressman as ""Fat Jerry,"" a Trump-coined nickname that was first reported in New York Magazine in August 1995. Trump told the New York Daily News in 1995 that he called Nadler fat to ""inspire"" him. ""I feel that whatever can inspire him to go out and lose that tremendous amount of weight should be done. To be honest with you, he's a walking time bomb and if I can convince him to put himself, not in great shape, but in reasonable shape, I'm doing a great service to him and his family,"" Trump said at the time. Nadler lost a significant amount of weight following weight-loss surgery in 2002 and Trump himself is clinically obese, per his most recent physical . Trump spoke at length at the March meeting about Nadler's weight, which was embarrassing to several of his Republican House colleagues, per the Post's reporting. But, as Trump reportedly told the lawmakers, ""I've been battling Nadler for years."" The New Yorkers, now in their 70s, first encountered each other early in Trump's real estate career when Nadler was a state assemblyman. Trump faced opposition from New York lawmakers, including then-Mayor Ed Koch, when he wanted to develop property he purchased in 1985 on the West Side of Manhattan that required the movement of a highway.

Rep. Nadler: Congress has been shielding Trump 01:20 Even after he became a congressman in 1992, Nadler was a key opponent of the project, and the years-long dispute was well-documented in local publications at the time as it faced numerous zoning and tax obstacles. The New York Times characterized Nadler as ""among the project's strongest foes "" and at one point, he successfully cut off federal funds that would have allowed the development to proceed. The highway never moved, but in a twist of irony, Nadler ultimately voted for a transportation bill in 1998 that, at the last minute, allocated $6 million in funding to Trump's project. After the vote, Nadler told The Observer he was ""absolutely livid,"" criticizing Trump's motives. ""The real reason that he wants to move the highway is not out of the wonderfulness of his heart, but so the sightlines for some of the apartments will be clear,"" Nadler told The Observer. ""He will then be able to sell them for more money, and that will help with his financing."" Trump did build residential buildings, later selling the property, but as The Washington Post notes, ""After Trump's election, residents of the apartment complex voted to have his name removed from the property, a repudiation of the man who fought for its very existence."" Trump rehashed the history Tuesday on Twitter. ""Congressman Jerry Nadler fought me for years on a very large development I built on the West Side of Manhattan. He wanted a Rail Yard built underneath the development or even better, to stop the job. He didn't get either & the development became VERY successful,"" Trump wrote . He continued : ""Nevertheless, I got along very well with Jerry during the zoning and building process. Then I changed course (slightly), became President, and now I am dealing with Congressman Nadler again. Some things never end, but hopefully it will all go well for everyone. Only time will tell!"""
HHS official says administration doesn't have capacity to resume family separations,edition.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/hearing-family-separation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Health and Human Services does not have the capacity to care for the thousands of migrant children who could be separated from their families should the Trump administration reinstate the controversial policy, a senior agency official said Tuesday.
Senior administration officials told CNN that in the last four months or so, the President has been pushing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was forced to resign Sunday, to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy -- not just the original policy started by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and undone by the President once it was criticized. Jonathan White, Commander of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, said in a Senate hearing said the administration would not be able to receive the number of children the program would require if implemented again, ""nor do we have the capacity to serve them, nor is it possible to build a system that would prevent the mass traumatization of children."" White, who has been critical of family separations, told lawmakers Tuesday that he would ""never support the use of family separation, the systematic traumatization of children as a tool of immigration policy,"" when asked if he would support a reinstatement of the ""zero tolerance"" policy that led to family separations last year. ""I would never support the use of family separation, the systematic traumatization of children as a tool of immigration policy, but it's not about what I support,"" White said. Read More Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants He called for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, who asked the question of White, and other lawmakers to address the overall issue. ""Senator, it's about what you and your colleagues support,"" White said. ""And it's up to you to define the conditions under which a child may be separated. Congress hasn't done that and you need to."" According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers. Trump wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming. Sources told CNN's Jake Tapper that Nielsen tried to explain they could not bring the policy back because of court challenges, and White House staffers tried to explain it would be an unmitigated PR disaster. ""He just wants to separate families,"" said a senior administration official. The administration is still reeling from the ramifications of the policy more than a year after it was announced by Sessions. In a court filing Friday, officials said it could take up to two years for the government to identify potentially thousands of additional immigrant families US authorities separated at the southern border. The government's proposed plan outlined a strategy for piecing together exactly who might have been separated by combing through thousands of records using a mix of data analysis and manual review. While a federal court order forced the reunification of families separated as a result of ""zero tolerance,"" an explosive government watchdog report in January revealed there could be thousands more who hadn't previously been acknowledged by officials. And a federal judge last month ruled that this group should be included in the class-action lawsuit over family separations."
Former Treasury Secretary says Mnuchin should not block push for Trump tax returns,edition.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/lawrence-summers-steven-mnuchin-trump-taxes/index.html,"(CNN) An attempt from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to block the release of President Donald Trump's taxes would be ""inappropriate and probably illegal,"" according to Mnuchin's predecessor Lawrence Summers.
""The appropriate response of the treasury secretary is very clear: Under a long-standing delegation order, the secretary does not get involved in taxpayer-specific matters and has delegated to the IRS commissioner as follows: 'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Internal Revenue laws,'"" Summers, who served under President Bill Clinton, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Monday. Summers, a Harvard professor who also served as an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that the delegation is not ""readily revocable"" and Mnuchin, under law, would have to notify the relevant committees if he plans not to delegate this issue to the IRS chief. ""So for the secretary to seek to decide whether to pass on the President's tax return to Congress would surely be inappropriate and probably illegal,"" Summers added. He argued that neither he nor previous Treasury secretaries would have ""interfered with the IRS to contravene a nearly century-old statute that had been applied on many previous occasions."" Read More Summers also called Trump's claim that he cannot turn over his returns because they're under IRS audit ""wholly fictitious,"" saying there's no such IRS rule or practice.

Mnuchin vs. Democrats: 5 things to watch The Trump administration has until Wednesday to respond to the committee's request, but the President has already made clear that he has no plans to make this fight easy. Trump's lawyers sent a letter on Friday to the Treasury Department's general counsel dismissing the request as a politically motivated pursuit. Last month, Mnuchin told House lawmakers he would "" comply with the law "" if he received a written request from Congress to turn over Trump's tax returns, but also sidestepped the issue by suggesting the decision would ultimately fall to the IRS commissioner, the country's federal tax collector. Mnuchin was scheduled to appear at two back-to-back Capitol Hill hearings on Tuesday, his first appearance since Democrats formally requested Trump's tax returns."

Japanese F-35 fighter goes missing over the Pacific,edition.cnn.com,Brad Lendon,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/japan-f-35-stealth-fighter-missing-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) A Japanese F-35 fighter crashed into the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, raising questions about reliability and security of the most expensive weapons system ever made.
The stealth jet disappeared from radar minutes into a training mission from Misawa Air Base in northern Japan . Defense officials said its pilot signaled the need to abort the mission shortly before the plane was lost. Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said debris from the plane, parts of its two tail fins, was found early Wednesday. Japanese and US planes and ships, including a US guided-missile destroyer, were continuing to search for the pilot, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said, adding that the unnamed aviator was a male in his 40s with more than 3,200 hours of flying experience. A Japan Coast Guard's vessel and U.S. military plane search for a Japanese F-35 fighter jet, in the waters off Aomori, northern Japan on Wednesday. He was flying what is considered the best stealth jet technology in the skies. Read More With the world's most advanced avionics, engines and weaponry, the Pentagon touts the F-35 as the ""the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used."" As of August 2018, more than 310 F-35s have been delivered to militaries around the world, according to the plane's maker, Lockheed Martin. Japan's first squadron of the $100 million fighter jets went operational just 11 days ago, with 13 of the jets forming the 302nd Squadron at the Misawa base, according to a report from The Diplomat.com . Iwaya said Japan's remaining dozen F-35s would be grounded until the cause of Tuesday's crash is determined. But early reports suggest system failure and that's troubling because it might mean that something had been missed in the production process, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy officer and professor at Hawaii Pacific University. Japanese Air Self-Defense Force staff in 2016 in Arizona for the arrival of the first Japanese F-35A. ""Certification when it's new is pretty demanding. The checkout is very thorough in early production models,"" he said. While most F-35s are made in the United States, the one that crashed Tuesday was the first to come off an assembly line in Nagoya, Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said. Peter Layton, a former Australian Air Force officer and analyst at the Griffith Asia Institute, said the Japanese assembly line would be one of the first places to look for answers. ""There are several hundred F-35s flying (worldwide) suggesting a local not fleet wide problem,"" he said. The fact that the Japanese pilot called for a mission abort but apparently did not issue a mayday call indicates a possible instrumentation problem, possibly with the plane's wiring, Layton said. ""The pilot appears to have thought he was in command and not in imminent danger,"" Layton said. It's possible as the aviator was trying to troubleshoot he flew straight into the ocean, he said. The Japanese jet, an F-35A model, is the second lost to an accident. A US Marine Corps F-35B crashed in Beaufort, South Carolina, in late September. US defense officials in October said a faulty fuel tube was the likely cause , and all F-35s operated by the United States and its allies were temporarily grounded for inspection. Other incidents that have hit the F-35 program include a runway fire in Florida in 2014 which led to inspections of the plane's engines; and five incidents in 2017 where pilots reported oxygen deprivation problems. The F-35 comes in three versions. The one that went missing Tuesday is the Air Force's F-35A model. The F-35 comes in three versions. The F-35A, like the one Japan lost contact with Tuesday, is the one designed for air forces to use off conventional runways. The F-35B, like the one the US Marine Corps lost, is designed for short takeoff and vertical landings. The F-35C model is the US Navy's version, designed for use off its aircraft carriers. All contain an advanced electronic warfare suite which can allow seamless integration among users within one military or among allies. The jet's sophistication means the US and Japan would likely be acting quickly to recover any wreckage from the bottom of the Pacific before adversaries could get a look at it, Schuster said. Even getting a look at the wreckage via a close up underwater camera could provide China or another adversary like Russia valuable intelligence, Schuster said. ""They'll be worried about it,"" Schuster said of the US and Japanese militaries. ""China does have deep-sea recovery submarines."" Schuster recalled an incident in the 1980s when the US military rushed to recover the a US F-14 Tomcat -- then one of the world's best fighters -- that had crashed in the Caribbean before any adversaries could get a close look at it. Tuesday's crash is certainly a setback for Japan's ambitious F-35 program. With 147 of the planes in its fleet or on order, Tokyo is Lockheed Martin's second biggest customer for the plane. Japan has announced plans to buy 105 of the F-35A models and 42 F-35Bs, the latter of which it could eventually use to turn its Izumo-class helicopter destroyers into small aircraft carriers , its first since World War II. US F-35 fighter jet conducts first-ever airstrike In the Pacific, South Korea and Australia have joined Japan in acquiring the jets, and Singapore has announced it wants to buy them too. The F-35's are seen as strong counters to China's growing fleet of stealth aircraft, including the J-20 and J-31. The first US combat mission conducted by an F-35 happened in October when a Marine Corps jet launched off the amphibious warship USS Essex struck targets in Afghanistan. In May, Israel announced it had conducted the first combat missions using the F-35 but offered few details."
Brooklyn measles outbreak: New York City declares a public health emergency - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Susan Scutti,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/measles-new-york-emergency-bn/index.html,"(CNN) New York City has declared the measles outbreak affecting the Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg to be a public health emergency, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.
Unvaccinated people living in select ZIP codes will be required to receive the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, to curtail the outbreak and protect others, he said. 78 new measles cases reported nationwide since last week, CDC says Under the mandatory vaccinations, members of the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will check the vaccination records of any individual who may have been in contact with infected patients. Those who have not received the MMR vaccine or do not have evidence of immunity may be given a violation and could be fined $1,000. ""Every hour, every day matters here. If people would just go and get vaccinated, there's no cause for a fine,"" de Blasio said. ""It's not our goal to issue violations. We want to simply solve the problem."" New Yorkers should call 311 to access a list of facilities that can provide the measles vaccine at low or no cost, de Blasio said. Read More Outbreak began in October The public health emergency comes in response to 285 cases of measles reported in Brooklyn and Queens since the beginning of the outbreak in October. The same outbreak is responsible for 15 cases of measles in Orange County, New York, and 168 cases in Rockland County, New York. The outbreak began when, according to health officials, an unvaccinated child became infected with the illness while visiting Israel. 5 things to know about measles ""Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn and Rockland County,"" the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene says. Of the 285 New York City cases, the range of ages has been 1 month to 66 years, with 246 children affected, Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said Tuesday. Five of 21 hospitalized cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit, she added. Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Dr. Herminia Palacio warned of ""measles parties,"" where parents bring together unvaccinated children with a sick child to intentionally spread the disease. ""Avoid this practice,"" Palacio said. Measles parties are dangerous because the disease can be fatal. ""This vaccine is safe,"" she added, noting that it not only protects your child, it protects other people. ""A variety of misunderstandings and frank untruths that are being propagated through a variety of channels."" Despite problems, there are hopeful signs, Barbot noted. Since September, 8,000 people have been vaccinated. Measles outbreaks nationwide Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable respiratory illness characterized by a rash of flat red spots. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Amid measles outbreaks, Facebook considering how to reduce spread of anti-vaccine content Measles can also lead to death when complications become too severe, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1 child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis -- swelling of the brain -- that can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability. As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles will get pneumonia, the agency reports. ""You can be infectious four days before you actually develop the rash,"" Barbot said. Measles is an airborne disease, so a sneeze can spread it, and infectious germs can last two hours after a person has left the room. ""There's nothing in Talmudic law that prohibits vaccination,"" Barbot said. Nationwide, measles outbreaks have been reported in 19 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington. At least 465 cases of measles have been reported across the United States since January 1, according to numbers shared by the CDC on Monday. Measles rarely kills in the US -- but when it does, here's how The total number of measles cases nationwide this year ""is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000,"" the CDC says. That threshold was reached last week when the national total for the year surpassed last year's total of 372. The largest outbreak was in 2014, when there were 667 cases reported nationwide due to several large outbreaks. Along with the outbreak affecting Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community, Rockland County in upstate New York is also experiencing a high number of measles cases within its own Orthodox Jewish community. As of Friday, the county reported 153 confirmed cases, though state health officials noted that additional cases have not been reported. Last month, in an effort to contain this outbreak, Rockland County banned unvaccinated people under age 18 from public places. Late Friday, acting state Supreme Court Justice Rolf Thorsen issued a restraining order to block the county from enforcing the ban. Rockland County Executive Ed Day said Tuesday that he plans to appeal the judge's decision. He and members of the county's Department of Health spent the weekend working on potential strategies for thwarting the outbreak that ""jumped from 151 cases to 168 in just 10 days,"" he said. ""We are taking the steps we can take while waiting for the court to move forward."" Rockland County Commissioner of Health Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert explained that the county is in the process of developing new criteria to identify specific unvaccinated people who have been exposed to the measles in order to issue orders that require them to remain at home for 21 days, the length of the illness' incubation period. If caught in violation of this rule, people will be fined, she said. ""The MMR vaccine works faster than the incubation of the disease,"" Ruppert said. ""This disease has affected mainly children in the county,"" she said. ""Stay the heck home if you've been ill or exposed.""

New York City's mayor said a legal action like the one that blocked Rockland County's ban will not hinder its mandatory vaccination policy. The city's legal department has looked into the mandatory vaccination ""extensively,"" de Blasio said. ""We are absolutely certain we have the right to do this. If anyone is thinking of a legal challenge, we are absolutely comfortable that we will win that case."" He also emphasized the danger measles poses to children, pregnant women and immune-compromised people, who are at highest risk of an infection. ""We saw only two cases in New York City in 2017, so we have a very serious situation on our hands,"" de Blasio said. ""We cannot allow this dangerous disease to make a comeback in this city. We have to stop it now."""

There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter's never over till it's over.
The potential is there for a "" bomb cyclone "" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less two. Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb-cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week.

Blizzard vs snow storm explained 01:20 Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop nearly 40 degrees in just 12 hours, including in Denver -- which is expecting a high of 80 degrees Tuesday and blizzard conditions by Wednesday night . Winter storm warnings and watches stretch from the Rockies to the Great Lakes. There are blizzard warnings for almost 4 million people from eastern Colorado to southwestern Minnesota.
Up to 2 feet of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-55 mph across South Dakota and Nebraska, along with white-out conditions. A potentially historic winter storm Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow and wind. A foot of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis, where forecasters are calling for ""a potentially historic winter storm."" Winds will gust up to 45mph. While an April snowstorm seems like a punch in the gut, April snowstorms do happen. Just last year, the Twin Cities experienced their top April snowstorm with 15.8 inches of snow April 13-16, 2018. Air travel will become drastically slow, and road travel will be treacherous. Expect to stay put once the snow gets going. Severe storms could strike to the south of system The snow is not the only hazard from the storm. In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. Large hail, damaging winds and perhaps a tornado are likely with some of the storms. On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, with the main threat of damaging winds. High wind and possible fire danger are another big concern With all this talk of snow and cold, we might as well add fire to the mix. Red flag warnings cover over 4 million people from southeastern Arizona, through much of New Mexico into eastern Colorado Tuesday, where the combination of strong winds, low relative humidity and very warm to hot temperatures will create critical fire weather conditions. Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly and will be hard to control. High wind watches and warnings extend from California into Texas and Oklahoma. Wind gusts of up to 60 to 70 mph are expected in the Mountains outside of Los Angeles, with gusts up to 60 mph in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Scattered power outages are likely over much of the Southwest. The fire risk is even worse Wednesday, with extreme fire danger -- the highest category -- from New Mexico into West Texas. Flood threat to places drenched by last bomb cyclone Flooding in the already hard-hit Plains will be exacerbated due to the additional precipitation. The rain that moves in ahead of the snow in South Dakota and Nebraska could cause some immediate flood concerns , whereas the amount of fresh snow across the Plains and Midwest will be a more long-term threat. In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding as this additional snow will slow the rate at which waters recede. The Red River is experiencing significant flooding because of melting snow with this new storm likely prolonging the high water.

Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry up and stay."

Standard Chartered is paying $1.1 billion for breaking sanctions - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Charles Riley,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/standard-chartered-fine/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Standard Chartered is paying out huge sums of money for the second time in less than a decade to settle claims of sanctions busting.
The UK-based bank has agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle allegations that it repeatedly violated sanctions on Iran and other countries. US and British authorities announced the settlement on Tuesday, saying the bank had breached sanctions on countries including Iran, Myanmar, Cuba and Syria. Huawei pleads not guilty to charges it violated US sanctions on Iran The US Treasury Department said that Standard Chartered had ""acted with reckless disregard and failed to exercise a minimal degree of caution"" in processing nearly 10,000 transactions between 2009 and 2014 that moved a total of $438 million through the United States in violation of sanctions. While noting that Standard Chartered had provided ""substantial"" cooperation during the probe, officials said the bank had allowed dozens of companies subject to sanctions to access the US financial system. Read More UK regulators said they had also uncovered ""significant shortcomings"" in the bank's approach to identifying risks. They said one client had been allowed to open an account using a suitcase containing 3 million dirhams ($625,000) in cash, without providing evidence of where the money came from. Standard Chartered also failed to collect sufficient information from a customer exporting a product with potential military applications to 75 countries. Warren Buffett has weighed in on what kind of CEO Wells Fargo should hire Under the terms of the settlement, Standard Chartered has agreed to conduct regular risk assessments and improve its internal controls. ""We are pleased to have resolved these matters and to put these historical issues behind us,"" Standard Chartered ( SCBFF ) CEO Bill Winters said in a statement. ""The circumstances that led to today's resolutions are completely unacceptable and not representative of the Standard Chartered I am proud to lead today."" The settlement requires Standard Chartered to pay $947 million to US government agencies, while the UK Financial Conduct Authority will collect ¬£102 million ($133 million). The bank set aside $900 million to cover fines related to the allegations in the fourth quarter of 2018. It said Tuesday that it would take a final charge of $190 million in the first quarter of this year. Standard Chartered entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice in 2012, when it paid a total of $667 million over alleged sanctions violations. The agreement, which allows the company to resolve matters that would otherwise be prosecuted, had been extended multiple times."
Saudi Aramco bond: Investors offer $100 billion - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Zahraa Alkhalisi, CNN Business",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/investing/saudi-aramco-bond/index.html,"Dubai (CNN Business) International investors are falling over themselves to lend money to Saudi Arabia's hugely profitable state-owned oil company.
Saudi Aramco tapped international debt markets for the first time ever Tuesday, and demand for the bonds soared above $100 billion, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The bond issue will raise at least $10 billion for Aramco, the world's most profitable company. A spokesman for Aramco declined to comment. In such large transactions, where strong demand is expected, investors often inflate their orders to ensure they're allocated at least some of the securities. Saudi Arabia was planning to sell some shares in Aramco last year to raise money for the kingdom's economic transformation, but the IPO stalled. A lack of transparency over the size of the country's energy reserves had caused skepticism about the potential sale and the value of Aramco. Read More Since then, Saudi Arabia's vast energy reserves have been independently audited and shown to total 268.5 billion barrels. That estimate is slightly higher than the 266.3 billion barrel figure previously published by the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia may be courting Asian partners, but it will always need the US Earlier this month, Aramco issued a prospectus for the bond offering that showed it made $111 billion in profit last year. It was the first time the oil giant had revealed such financial details. The company has said it will use the proceeds from the bond sale for general purposes. Investors expect some of the money raised to fund its purchase of 70% of Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic), the state-owned petrochemical company. ""It's not a surprise that the most profitable company in the world... on a debut international bond sale is capturing tons of investors' interest,"" said Aarthi Chandrasekaran, portfolio manager at SHUAA Asset Management. Investors appear to have set aside concerns over the government's involvement in Aramco's finances, she added. Saudi Arabia has always claimed vast oil reserves. An audit just proved it's right Saudi officials had said that selling just 5% of Aramco in an IPO could generate $100 billion to fund Vision 2030 , a blueprint of what the country's economy should look like over the next decade. The country have been on an aggressive drive to attract international investment as it diversifies its economy away from oil. But relations with the West have chilled following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate last year."

Uber driver allegedly tries to break into house after taking residents to the airport - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Amanda Jackson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/uber-driver-attempted-burglary-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Police in San Mateo, California, have arrested an Uber driver who they say took his riders to the airport and then drove back to their home and tried to break in.
The passengers had reportedly rented the house through Airbnb. Surveillance footage from a doorbell camera showed a man approaching the front door on Thursday and then walking away from the house. Police say he was chased off when the security alarm went off. The man was then caught on camera breaking into another home a few blocks away. The house was ransacked and a number of items were stolen. ""(He'd) torn apart the whole house, tossed everything. Every piece of furniture moved.

The next day, police were able to use that information to arrest Jackie Gordon Wilson, 38, at a home in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento.

Inside Stephen Miller's 'under-the-radar' role in the Trump White House - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/stephen-miller-trump-dhs-purge/index.html,"(CNN) As Donald Trump pursues a purge of the Department of Homeland Security amid what he is promising will be a tougher immigration policy, attention has, again, turned to Stephen Miller -- one of the President's top aides. Miller is one of the youngest and least high-profile members of Trump's inner circle, but on immigration has long been a leading advocate of a strong hand as it relates to the handling of undocumented immigrants trying to enter the United States.
To get a fuller perspective on Miller and his influence on the President, I reached out to CNN White House correspondent -- and rabid Alabama fan! -- Kaitlan Collins . Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
Cillizza: What is the key to Miller's success -- and longevity -- in this White House and with this President? Collins : Our reporting shows Miller has already had a lot of success in serving the President. He's become one of the President's closest advisers, and while he may not be victorious with everything he pushes, he certainly has Trump's ear when it comes to immigration. Take for example what happened last week: Ron Vitiello was well on his way to becoming the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Miller went to the President and told him Vitiello wasn't in favor of him closing the southern border, as Trump had threatened to do for a week. Miller knew how the President would react to this. The White House quickly pulled the nomination -- so quickly that DHS officials thought it was a clerical error until Friday morning. The Homeland Security secretary was never officially informed about the withdrawal. And [Wisconsin Sen.] Ron Johnson, a Republican who chairs the Homeland Security panel, said he was ""completely surprised"" by it. Read More The episode was revealing of Miller's influence. Cillizza: Miller is much lower-profile than people like, say, Kellyanne Conway or Mick Mulvaney. Is that by choice? Collins : Very much so. Miller has made few television appearances, and my reporting shows that the low public profile is on purpose. He has a large presence inside the West Wing, but is someone who prefers to operate under the radar rather than in a public way. Miller is someone who wants to be involved in a lot of things, just not always with his fingerprints on it. Cillizza: How much of Miller's views on immigration are his own and how much is he channeling what he knows Trump wants? Collins : I think the mistake that gets made when talking about this is that people assume all of the immigration pushes coming out of the White House are masterminded by Miller. Yes, he carries significant weight in this department and can help put the President's ideas in motion. But a lot of it comes from Trump himself. The President's thoughts on immigration are not new. For example, it was the President's idea to close the border. He kept pushing it despite advisers like Kirstjen Nielsen telling him it was a bad idea with severe consequences. So other aides, like Miller and Mulvaney, were on the other side of things, brainstorming how he could close the border without devastating the US economy. Maybe he couldn't seal the entire border, but he could close certain ports of entry, stall some trade or slow walk entries into the US, they suggested. Cillizza: What is the general view of Miller inside the White House (aside from Trump)? Do Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner like him? Mulvaney? Collins : Miller is quite well-liked inside the West Wing. He has been here since the beginning, which can't be said for a lot of people anymore, and is seen as someone who is trustworthy. He often gets the description of the lone wolf pushing Trump's most extreme immigration proposals, but it's more complicated than that. Kushner has recently become more involved on immigration talks. Mulvaney has his hand in things too, telling the President that closing the border could appeal to his base. And Trump listens to a lot of outside advice, too. Now, Miller being liked outside of the West Wing is a different story. He's rankled a slew of officials at Department of Homeland Security because he has often acted as if he can overrule them since the early days of the Trump White House. In a normal administration, that might not work. In this one, sometimes it does."
United passenger David Dao says he 'just cried' after he saw video of himself being dragged off a plane - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jason Hanna, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/united-airlines-david-dao/index.html,"(CNN) Dr. David Dao doesn't recall officers dragging him off a United Airlines flight -- but he does remember being emotional after seeing cell phone video of the 2017 incident that created a firestorm of controversy for the airline, he told ABC News.
""I just cried,"" he told ABC in an interview shown Tuesday on ""Good Morning America"" when asked how he felt seeing the viral video. Dao, speaking publicly for the first time about the encounter that left him bloodied, said that he woke up in a hospital with no memory of being taken off the plane. Cell phone footage showed security officers dragging Dao by his arms and legs down an aisle before takeoff from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on April 9, 2017, after he refused to surrender his seat on the packed plane for commuting crew members. The incident left him with a concussion, two lost teeth and a broken nose. It ultimately led to a financial settlement with United and the firing of two Chicago aviation security officers , and spurred airlines to change some ways they do business. Read More ""The most important thing is the accident turned out the positive way,"" Dao told ABC. ""Airline business (is) willing to change policy."" Gate agents first asked for volunteers to give up seats The situation began when gate agents asked for volunteers to give up their seats on the Kentucky-bound plane for a United crew that needed to meet another flight. Dao and his wife, who were flying home, initially agreed to take a later flight, a fellow passenger told CNN, but the couple changed their minds when they learned the next flight wouldn't leave until the following day. United had offered compensation to anyone willing to give up their seats; Dao apparently was chosen when not enough people volunteered. Four Chicago aviation officers arrived when he declined to leave. In a video shot by two passengers sitting behind Dao, he repeatedly refused to get off the flight, telling officers he was a physician and had to work in the morning.

An initial letter sent to United employees appeared to blame Dao, referring to him as ""disruptive and belligerent,"" and praised employees for following ""established protocols."" But United came under fire for how it responded as the footage went viral. United CEO Oscar Munoz later apologized, calling the encounter ""truly horrific."" Less than a month afterward, United reached a settlement with Dao without disclosing the terms. Dao says he forgives the officers Dao, who has since retired, told ABC that he ""had to hide"" after the incident because of the attention it received. ""I (stayed) for months, months in (the) house,"" he said. He said he forgives the officers. ""I'm not angry with them. They have a job to do. They have to do (it),"" he told ABC. ""If they don't do it, they may lose (their) job. So I'm not angry with them or anything like this."" United and other airlines made changes The dust-up had national repercussions. United made several policy changes or clarifications. Among them: The airline won't remove boarded passengers involuntarily -- or call authorities -- unless there's a safety or security issue. Though United said the 2017 flight was simply full, and not overbooked, Southwest Airlines announced it would no longer overbook flights in an attempt to ensure ticket-holding customers would not be booted. Delta Air Lines and United said they would, if space is needed, offer volunteers up to $10,000 to give up their seats voluntarily."

Trump denies reports he will reinstate family separation border policy,edition.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-family-separation-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that his administration is not looking to resume the separation of parents and children at the US-Mexico border, denying reports that it is something he has been pushing for.
Senior administration officials told CNN's Jake Tapper that in the last four months or so, the President had been pushing then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy -- not just the original policy started by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and undone by the President once it was criticized -- that called for the prosecution of individuals crossing the border illegally between ports of entry, resulting in the separation of parents from children. According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers. The President wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming. JUST WATCHED Sources: Trump ordered El Paso port closed, told border agents to defy asylum laws Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Sources: Trump ordered El Paso port closed, told border agents to defy asylum laws 05:20 Sources told CNN that Nielsen tried to explain they could not bring the policy back because of court challenges, and White House staffers tried to explain it would be an unmitigated public relations disaster. ""He just wants to separate families,"" said a senior administration official. Read More Trump repeatedly denied that was the case on Tuesday. ""We're not looking to do that, no. We're not looking to do that,"" Trump said. But, he added, ""when you don't do it, it brings a lot more people to the border."" ""Now, I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'let's go to Disneyland,' "" Trump said. He also blamed the policy on the Obama administration. ""President Obama separated children. I was the one who that changed it,"" he claimed. But that's not exactly the case. The main difference between Trump and Obama , experts have said, centers on how they handled immigrants caught near the US-Mexico border. Under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department was given broad discretion on who should face criminal charges, and federal prosecutors rarely went after families. But in April 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would prosecute 100% of illegal border-crossers in a policy known as ""zero-tolerance."" Adults went to jails and awaited criminal proceedings. Children were sent to detention centers run by the Department of Health and Human Services, and some were eventually placed in foster care. This specific change is what led to the widespread separation of parents and children, according to Jessica Bolter, a researcher with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute who has published 200 pages of reports on Trump's immigration policies. CNN's Jim Acosta also reported Monday that Trump was considering a ""binary choice"" policy as an alternative to the zero-tolerance policy that resulted in family separations at the border. One official said the ""binary choice"" proposal puts that decision of separation in the hands of parents ."
Lori Loughlin and 15 parents hit with more charges in college admissions scam,us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/college-admissions-scam-superseding-charges/index.html,"(CNN) Actress Lori Loughlin and 15 other wealthy parents now face an additional charge of money laundering as part of the growing college admissions scandal.
The parents, who were charged last month with conspiracy to commit fraud, were charged on Tuesday in a superseding indictment with conspiring to launder bribes and other payments through a charity run by Rick Singer, the mastermind of the scam, as well as by transferring money into the United States to promote the fraud, prosecutors said. Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to Singer's fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits, even though the daughters did not participate in the sport. The couple appeared last week in federal court in Boston, but they have not publicly indicated how they plan to plea. Prosecutors want prison time for Felicity Huffman and other parents who pleaded guilty in college admissions scam In addition, Gamal Abdelaziz, Diane and Todd Blake, I-Hsin ""Joey"" Chen, Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez, Douglas Hodge, Michelle Janavs, Elisabeth Kimmel, William McGlashan Jr., Marci Palatella, John Wilson, Homayoun Zadeh and Robert Zangrillo were also charged in the superseding indictment. Read More Thirty-three wealthy parents were among 50 people arrested last month in a sprawling investigation that officials dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues."" Prosecutors said the parents used their wealth to cheat on standardized tests for their children and bribe college administrators and coaches who had say over who was admitted. The added charges come just a day after 13 other parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, and one coach agreed to plead guilty in the case. Huffman, the former star of ""Desperate Housewives,"" pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to the charity known as Key Worldwide Foundation to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs, the complaint said. In a statement, she expressed ""deep regret and shame over what I have done."" She has a plea hearing set for May 24 in federal court in Boston, prosecutors said on Twitter . Mounting troubles for Loughlin The money laundering charge is another blow for Loughlin, the ""Full House"" actress who was dropped by the Hallmark Channel and other brands in the wake of last month's charges. Sephora also ended a makeup partnership with her daughter, the social media influencer Olivia Jade, who was a student at USC. Loughlin's daughters were recruited to USC as coxswains -- the crew member responsible for steering -- even though they did not row competitively or otherwise participate in crew, the criminal complaint says. She and Giannulli even sent Singer photos of each daughter on an ergometer, the rowing machine, the complaint says. Lori Loughlin's 'When Calls The Heart' co-star offers message of support ""I wanted to thank you again for your great work with (our older daughter), she is very excited and both Lori and I are very appreciative of your efforts and end result!"" Giannulli allegedly wrote in an email to Singer that is included in the complaint. Also on Tuesday, attorneys representing some of the parents charged in the superseding indictment filed a letter with the US District Court chief judge in Boston, stating prosecutors were engaging in ""judge shopping."" The letter said that their clients shouldn't be included in the same indictment as David Sidoo, another parent charged last month with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. The attorneys charge that the move to include them in one indictment along with Sidoo is a maneuver by the US Attorney's office to evade the random assignment of judges. Citing that none of their clients have connections to or have done business with Sidoo, the attorneys say that the prosecutors' plan to join their clients into the Sidoo indictment ""is a clear form of judge shopping."""

Uber driver allegedly tries to break into house after taking residents to the airport,us.cnn.com,Amanda Jackson,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/uber-driver-attempted-burglary-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Police in San Mateo, California, have arrested an Uber driver who they say took his riders to the airport and then drove back to their home and tried to break in.
The passengers had reportedly rented the house through Airbnb. Surveillance footage from a doorbell camera showed a man approaching the front door on Thursday and then walking away from the house. Police say he was chased off when the security alarm went off. The man was then caught on camera breaking into another home a few blocks away. The house was ransacked and a number of items were stolen. ""(He'd) torn apart the whole house, tossed everything. Every piece of furniture moved. He opened my safe,"" Scott, who lives in the house with his girlfriend, Chana, told CNN affiliate KGO . They asked the station to only identify them by their first names. Read More Why it's so hard to give up ridesharing Chana told KGO that the man spent four hours ransacking the home and was seen on video taking bag after bag of valuables -- including heirlooms her grandmother had saved during the Holocaust. Scott posted video of the burglary online and the other homeowner saw it and showed it to his former guests. They recognized him as their Uber driver. The next day, police were able to use that information to arrest Jackie Gordon Wilson, 38, at a home in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento. They say some of the stolen property was found in the home and he had on the same clothes he was seen wearing in the videos. Wilson was charged with first degree burglary, attempted first degree burglary, and resisting arrest. CNN was unable to reach an attorney for Wilson for comment. ""We removed the driver's access to the app as soon as we were made aware of the allegations and stand ready to assist police in their investigation,"" Andrew Hasbun, Uber communications manager, told CNN in a statement.

Make sure you're aware of these safety tips The incident comes as ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft are facing intense questions about the security of their customers. University of South Carolina student Samantha Josephson was killed last month after mistakenly getting into a car that she thought was her Uber ride. Uber said in a statement it was devastated about the ""unspeakable crime,"" and that it's working with the university to ""raise awareness on college campuses nationwide about this incredibly important issue."" Uber said it plans to launch a ""Check Your Ride"" passenger awareness campaign on social media in the upcoming weeks and will purchase advertisements in college newspapers. A lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Friday alleges that Uber did not do enough to warn women about a series of rapes by fake Uber drivers. The company said it a statement it has been ""working with local law enforcement, including the LAPD, to educate the public about how to avoid fake rideshare drivers for several years. In 2017, we launched a national campaign to remind riders to make sure they get in the right car by checking the information, like the license plate and car make and model, shown in the app. These important reminders have been part of our safety tips, and our law enforcement team regularly discusses this issue with agencies across the country."""
William Barr's testimony on the Mueller report: 4 key takeaways CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/william-barr-mueller-report-donald-trump/index.html,"(CNN) For the first time since the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Attorney General William Barr faced questions on Capitol Hill regarding his handling of Mueller's findings, when he plans to release the report and how he will handle the issue of redacted information.
Barr was loath to provide many details other than to say that the Justice Department planned to release the redacted report in the next week. But in not answering some of the more pointed questions asked by House Democrats, Barr did reveal some important information that moves our understanding of not only the Mueller report but of his handling of it. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
Below, the key takeaways from Barr's testimony. Barr wouldn't say whether the White House has seen or will see the report before its release Barr repeatedly refused to answer a direct question as to whether the White House has seen -- or will see -- the full Mueller report prior to its release. That is a change from Barr's past statement just 11 days ago when he said in a letter sent to the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. ""Although the President would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report,"" Barr wrote in that letter , ""he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review."" Read More So as of March 29, there were ""no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review."" But as of today, Barr wouldn't answer whether the White House has or would see the report prior to its release. Which suggests, at least to me, that the White House either has or could see the report before its release. Barr later acknowledged that he advised the White House counsel before his letter went out on March 24. He said that the letter may have been read to them, but they did not get a hard copy of it. Congress will not see the unredacted version of the report ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr said in response to questions from Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Graves about whether leaking the full, unredacted report by a member of Congress would be a crime. Barr also said, in response to questions by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), that the redacted version of the Mueller report that Congress would see would be the same one that the public sees. The one possible exception he left open: If the chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees wanted to see the full report, Barr seems to suggest he would be willing to talk to them about that. Barr wouldn't say Trump is wrong about obstruction Lowey asked Barr a very simple question: Who is right -- the President, who says he was totally exonerated on the question of collusion and obstruction or Mueller, who Barr directly Quote: d in his summary letter, saying ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him?"" Barr didn't answer, insisting he has said everything he planned to say about the report until it comes out. Which means that Barr didn't want to say the President is wrong -- which he is, at least on the question of obstruction -- in a public setting. Barr had a head start on what was in the Mueller report One of the biggest focuses of House Democrats' on the committee was how Barr took a 300+-page report produced over a 22-month period and condensed its findings to a four-page letter summarizing its bottom-line conclusion in less than 72 hours. Barr shed some light on the ""how"" behind that fast read. He said that he had ""some inkling as to some of the thinking of the special counsel"" due to public reporting on indictments, etc. filed by Mueller. And, Barr said, he and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with the special counsel team on March 5, where they were briefed on the basic conclusions of the report."
HHS official says administration doesn't have capacity to resume family separations CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/hearing-family-separation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Health and Human Services does not have the capacity to care for the thousands of migrant children who could be separated from their families should the Trump administration reinstate the controversial policy, a senior agency official said Tuesday.
Senior administration officials told CNN that in the last four months or so, the President has been pushing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was forced to resign Sunday, to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy -- not just the original policy started by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and undone by the President once it was criticized. Jonathan White, Commander of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, said in a Senate hearing said the administration would not be able to receive the number of children the program would require if implemented again, ""nor do we have the capacity to serve them, nor is it possible to build a system that would prevent the mass traumatization of children."" White, who has been critical of family separations, told lawmakers Tuesday that he would ""never support the use of family separation, the systematic traumatization of children as a tool of immigration policy,"" when asked if he would support a reinstatement of the ""zero tolerance"" policy that led to family separations last year. ""I would never support the use of family separation, the systematic traumatization of children as a tool of immigration policy, but it's not about what I support,"" White said. Read More Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants He called for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, who asked the question of White, and other lawmakers to address the overall issue. ""Senator, it's about what you and your colleagues support,"" White said. ""And it's up to you to define the conditions under which a child may be separated. Congress hasn't done that and you need to."" According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers. Trump wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming. Sources told CNN's Jake Tapper that Nielsen tried to explain they could not bring the policy back because of court challenges, and White House staffers tried to explain it would be an unmitigated PR disaster. ""He just wants to separate families,"" said a senior administration official. The administration is still reeling from the ramifications of the policy more than a year after it was announced by Sessions. In a court filing Friday, officials said it could take up to two years for the government to identify potentially thousands of additional immigrant families US authorities separated at the southern border. The government's proposed plan outlined a strategy for piecing together exactly who might have been separated by combing through thousands of records using a mix of data analysis and manual review. While a federal court order forced the reunification of families separated as a result of ""zero tolerance,"" an explosive government watchdog report in January revealed there could be thousands more who hadn't previously been acknowledged by officials. And a federal judge last month ruled that this group should be included in the class-action lawsuit over family separations."
Mnuchin acknowledges White House and Treasury lawyers discussed Trump tax returns CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Donna Borak,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mnuchin-tax-returns-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said his agency's lawyers consulted with but did not take direction from the White House on the issue of releasing President Donald Trump's personal tax returns.
""I don't see that as interference,"" Mnuchin said when asked by New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney at a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. ""They consulted with them before. It was not related to the President's tax returns, only the expectation of getting the request."" House Democrats last week formally requested Trump's tax returns from the Treasury Department using an obscure statute of tax law. Mnuchin, who has previously testified that he would comply with requests, added that he had not and would not ask the White House for permission. ""We would not ever ask for the White House's permission on this nor did they give us the permission. As I've said we consulted which I believe was appropriate of our legal department,"" Mnuchin said. Read More Maloney called ""any communication"" with the White House as ""troubling"" and said it ""violates the spirit of the law."" But Mnuchin sought to portray himself as independent of the White House. ""I am not afraid of being fired at all,"" Mnuchin said when pressed by Maxine Waters, the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, if anything would override his responsibility to the law. Waters separately pressed Mnuchin on his recent decision to lift sanctions on companies tied to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Mnuchin's appearance ended in a clash with Waters over his request to end the hearing in time for a previously scheduled commitment. ""Mr. Secretary, I want you to know that no other secretary has ever told us the day before that they were going to limit their time in the way that you're doing, so if you want to use them as examples, you have acted differently than they have acted, and as I have said, if you wish to leave, you may,"" Waters told him. ""If you'd wish to keep me here so that I don't have my important meeting and continue to grill me, then we can do that. I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here. I will be very clear if that's the way you'd like to have this relationship,"" Mnuchin responded. After further back and forth, Waters fired back: ""You are free to leave. Any time you want, you may go."" After conferring with staff, Mnuchin told the committee he would be willing to stay a little longer. In an earlier hearing Tuesday, Mnuchin acknowledged for the first time that White House and Treasury lawyers held conversations, which he later described as a consultation before the formal request was made. Mnuchin said he personally had not been involved in the conversations and had not spoken to Trump or anyone else inside the White House about the release request. ""I have not had any conversations with anyone inside the White House,"" Mnuchin told Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Illinois, chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Treasury. He also added that those conversations happened before House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, made a formal request for the President's records last week . When asked Tuesday night by CNN's Anderson Cooper whether it was acceptable that other Treasury Department employees have consulted with the White House, given that they are both part of the executive branch, Waters replied, ""No, it's not OK."" ""As a matter of fact, let me just say this: We cannot believe anything that's been said by this President or by Mr. Mnuchin,"" Waters added. Democrats have argued that the President and the Treasury secretary shouldn't be involved in their request for Trump's tax returns under the law Neal is using to request Trump's returns. Democrats have repeatedly expressed concern that the President's personal lawyers sent a letter directly to Treasury asking the department not to comply with the request. ""I do have some concerns because obviously Secretary Mnuchin has made it clear that he will do what the President asks him to do, and it's a little frustrating because when he was before the committee, he indicated the IRS commissioner would follow the law and it wouldn't be something he'd insert himself into or interfere with,"" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. ""The President obviously does not want to comply with this, but it's not an option,"" he added. ""The law is very clear."" Tuesday's hearings were the Treasury head's first appearance since the request. The Trump administration has until Wednesday to respond, which Mnuchin later committed to meeting. ""In general, we try to accommodate these requests,"" Mnuchin told reporters in a brief gaggle. ""I'm not going to make a specific comment on that, but it would be a good guess."" During the hearing, Mnuchin made clear that he was speaking for himself and not everyone at Treasury, which includes the IRS. ""I personally wasn't involved in those conversations,"" said Mnuchin. ""I acknowledge there were conversations. I was not fully briefed on the extent of those discussions."" He has said in previous hearings that he would ""comply with the law"" regarding the release of Trump's returns. Mnuchin also told the committee last month that he's not typically involved in handling other requests for tax returns and that is a job that is handled by the IRS commissioner. Trump has broken with previous presidential precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, both as a candidate and since taking office, as well as by declining to divest from his family business, the Trump Organization. Democrats have demanded greater transparency regarding Trump's personal financial commitments as well as any obligations held through his businesses, which are now overseen by his two eldest sons. Neal is using a little-known provision in the tax code that allows the chairman of House Ways and Means panel to make requests for an individual's tax information. Neal and other Democrats have argued that the law clearly states that if the chairman asks for the information, the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it. ""This was a very reasonable approach,"" Neal told reporters last week. ""We wanted to make sure that the case we constructed was one that stood up under the critical scrutiny of the courts."" On Friday, Trump's lawyers sent a letter to the Department of Treasury's counsel dismissing the request for tax returns as a politically-motivated pursuit, writing that ""Ways and Means has no legitimate committee purpose for requesting the President's tax returns or return information. While the committee has jurisdiction over taxes, it has no power to conduct its own examination of individual taxpayers."" Separately, Democrats in New York on Monday made a fresh push to release Trump's documents , introducing legislation that would give Congress access to Trump's state tax returns."

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota defended herself Tuesday afternoon against Republican criticism she has faced over a tweet she wrote that slammed a senior White House adviser as a ""white nationalist"" Monday on Twitter.
""It is the most bizarre thing,"" Omar told CNN on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, when asked about the condemnation she's faced since she tweeted that ""Stephen Miller is a white nationalist"" on Monday. In her tweet, Omar pointed to reporting that Miller has been behind President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies and convinced the President to drop his nominee to lead US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and go in a ""tougher direction."" ""You know we are talking about someone who truly believes not a single refugee, not a single immigrant, should set foot on American soil,"" Omar told CNN Tuesday, referencing Miller. ""I am appalled by that. Because unlike him and others, I haven't forgotten my roots. I know what it meant for me to get the opportunity to come to the United States to start anew."" Omar also attacked Trump and Miller for what she saw as forgetting their own roots. ""And many of his family and Trump's family came here to get that opportunity and they forget,"" Omar said. ""They forget that that is how ... how they got the chance to become president or work in the White House. Because they got the chance to come to the United States because their families got a chance to come to the United States. So when you get that opportunity, you do not turn your back on the next person who is seeking that opportunity. And I am here to make sure they never forget."" Read More New York man charged with threatening to assault and kill Rep. Ilhan Omar Omar has faced criticism of her own in recent weeks. One of the first two Muslim women in Congress, she has been accused of pushing anti-Semitic tropes, which prompted a rebuke from several House Democratic leaders. Republican critics of Omar, including the President's son Donald Trump Jr., viewed the congresswoman's attack against Miller, who is Jewish, as anti-Semitic. When the President tweeted a news clip criticizing Omar, the congresswoman responded by tweeting, ""In the words of my 6 year-old daughter, 'Knock it off. You're the president.'"" Another House Democrat, Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, defended Omar, saying he was never accused of anti-Semitism when he also called Miller a white nationalist last year. ""Rather than attacking (Omar), why won't they stand up to white nationalism & President Trump's support for 'very fine people'?"" Pocan wrote on Twitter Tuesday, referring to the President's remarks about the 2017 Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Virginia. Late Tuesday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley dismissed Omar's remarks. ""Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has a well-documented history of anti-Semitic comments, social media posts and relationships -- so it's not surprising that she would wildly attack a Jewish member of the Administration,"" Gidley said in a statement. ""It is completely ignorant to slander a Jewish man as a White Nationalist, and it dishonors the Jewish victims of anti-Semitic persecution across the globe."" Trump appears to be in the midst of cleaning house at the Department of Homeland Security. Over the past two days , Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles were ousted, and at least two other officials have been named as possibly heading out the door. CNN reported that at least some of the sudden personnel changes came at the urging of Miller, who's been recently empowered by the President to lead the administration's border policies. Miller was the author of Trump's controversial travel bans and the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy that was halted due to the backlash over thousands of undocumented children separated from their families at the border. He played a key role in Nielsen's Sunday resignation. The staff shakeup appears to be indicative of the administration's attempts to redirect immigration policy following a surge of migrant apprehensions at the southern border in recent months.

Blizzard conditions likely for several US states under 'bomb cyclone' threat,us.cnn.com,Jennifer Gray,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/bomb-cyclone-blizzard-severe-storms-tuesday-wxc/index.html,"(CNN) While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, folks there shouldn't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter's never over till it's over.
The potential is there for a "" bomb cyclone "" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less two. Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb-cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week. Read More Get more maps and compare forecast models Blizzard conditions likely for many This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard conditions to the Plains on Wednesday. JUST WATCHED Blizzard vs snow storm explained Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Blizzard vs snow storm explained 01:20 Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop nearly 40 degrees in just 12 hours, including in Denver -- which is expecting a high of 80 degrees Tuesday and blizzard conditions by Wednesday night . Winter storm warnings and watches stretch from the Rockies to the Great Lakes. There are blizzard warnings for almost 4 million people from eastern Colorado to southwestern Minnesota.
Up to 2 feet of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-55 mph across South Dakota and Nebraska, along with white-out conditions. A potentially historic winter storm Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow and wind. A foot of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis, where forecasters are calling for ""a potentially historic winter storm."" Winds will gust up to 45mph. While an April snowstorm seems like a punch in the gut, April snowstorms do happen. Just last year, the Twin Cities experienced their top April snowstorm with 15.8 inches of snow April 13-16, 2018. Air travel will become drastically slow, and road travel will be treacherous. Expect to stay put once the snow gets going. Severe storms could strike to the south of system The snow is not the only hazard from the storm. In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. Large hail, damaging winds and perhaps a tornado are likely with some of the storms. On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, with the main threat of damaging winds. High wind and possible fire danger are another big concern With all this talk of snow and cold, we might as well add fire to the mix. Red flag warnings cover over 4 million people from southeastern Arizona, through much of New Mexico into eastern Colorado Tuesday, where the combination of strong winds, low relative humidity and very warm to hot temperatures will create critical fire weather conditions. Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly and will be hard to control. High wind watches and warnings extend from California into Texas and Oklahoma. Wind gusts of up to 60 to 70 mph are expected in the Mountains outside of Los Angeles, with gusts up to 60 mph in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Scattered power outages are likely over much of the Southwest. The fire risk is even worse Wednesday, with extreme fire danger -- the highest category -- from New Mexico into West Texas. Flood threat to places drenched by last bomb cyclone Flooding in the already hard-hit Plains will be exacerbated due to the additional precipitation. The rain that moves in ahead of the snow in South Dakota and Nebraska could cause some immediate flood concerns , whereas the amount of fresh snow across the Plains and Midwest will be a more long-term threat. In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding as this additional snow will slow the rate at which waters recede. The Red River is experiencing significant flooding because of melting snow with this new storm likely prolonging the high water. Extreme weather The latest weather stories and extreme weather videos making headlines around the globe.
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry up and stay."
Mueller report: Barr gives new clues about what to expect CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Marshall Cohen,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mueller-report-clues-barr-testimony/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr gave some new clues Tuesday about what special counsel Robert Mueller's report will look like when the Justice Department releases it in the coming days.
Barr's comments came at a House subcommittee hearing, where he was peppered with questions about the Russia investigation and a host of other department issues. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know. The wait is almost over. Barr said he will release a redacted version of Mueller's report ""within a week."" He said everything is on track to meet his goal of sending the report to Congress by mid-April, a timeline that he laid out in a letter to lawmakers last month. There will be redactions. This wasn't groundbreaking. But it demonstrates that Barr is holding steady to his position that there must be redactions in the report. So far, Barr has resisted demands from top Democrats to provide a full, unredacted copy to Congress. Read More Four types of redactions. The four categories of redactions are: Grand jury material, classified information, details about ongoing investigations , and information that harms ""privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties."" 4 key takeaways from William Barr's testimony on the Mueller report T he report will be colorful. Every redaction will be explained in the public version of Mueller's report. Barr told the subcommittee: ""We will color-code the excisions from the report and we will provide explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction."" Many cooks in the redaction kitchen. Mueller's team is helping Barr black out grand jury material and sensitive information about ""peripheral players...who shouldn't be charged,"" Barr said. The intelligence community is scrubbing the report for national security secrets. And federal prosecutors are redacting details about their ongoing investigations. No plan for executive privilege. President Donald Trump has previously said he wants the full report to be public. Barr told lawmakers that there was ""no plan"" for him or anyone else to assert executive privilege over parts of the report, which would trigger further redactions."
Trump attorney general on ACA lawsuit: 'Let the courts do their job' CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democrats-documents-white-house-aca/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday doubled down on the Trump administration's decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act, telling House lawmakers ""let the courts do their job.""
Barr was grilled about using the Justice Department's resources to take a stance that, if successful, would leave uninsured tens of millions of Americans who depend on the Obamacare exchanges and Medicaid expansion for their coverage. ""If you think it's such an outrageous position, you have nothing to worry about. Let the courts do their job,"" Barr told Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Pennsylvania Democrat, at a House Appropriations Committee hearing about the department's budget. The administration said last month in a federal appeals filing that the entire health reform law should be struck down, a surprising reversal of its earlier position that only parts of Obamacare were unconstitutional. The Justice Department said it now agrees with a Texas federal judge's ruling that invalidated Obamacare because Congress effectively eliminated the penalty levied on the uninsured. Trump administration now says entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down That decision, however, was preceded by a heated debate among several of President Donald Trump's top advisers about whether the administration should support the judge's ruling invalidating the entire law or instead maintain its position that only parts should be struck down, a White House official and source close to the White House told CNN. Read More The debate pitted Barr and Health & Human Services Secretary Alex Azar -- who opposed fully striking down the law -- against acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and policy officials allied with him, a source close to the White House said. In an exchange Tuesday, Barr defended the reversal, saying that if the President or executive branch agencies disagree with the attorney general's advice and want to take a different stance, then the nation's top lawmaker should follow that if it is a ""reasonable and defensible legal position."" Internal arguments preceded Justice Department's Obamacare move The hearing came a day after top House Democrats sent letters to Trump administration officials requesting documents and other information about the White House's role in not defending the landmark health reform law. In addition to Barr, the three letters were addressed to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, Azar and Administrator Seema Verma of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They ask for the information to be provided by April 22. In the letter to Barr, the Democrats wrote, ""We write to express our concern regarding the troubling decision by the Department of Justice ... not to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act."" ""This refusal appears to be violating longstanding policies to defend and enforce Acts of Congress, will have a significant negative impact on the accessibility of health care for Americans, and appears to be driven by political considerations rather than considered legal arguments,"" the letter continues. The Democrats request that the Justice Department ""make certain individuals available for questioning on this matter."" Here's what happens if the courts kill Obamacare The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the letters. The letters are signed by Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the House Oversight Committee chairman; Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman; Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman; Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the House Committee on Education and Labor chairman; and Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman. In the letter to Cipollone, the Democrats write, ""We are requesting documents and information regarding the involvement of the White House and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the troubling decision by the Department of Justice (DOJ) not to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)."" ""DOJ's sudden and significant reversal from its previous position was reportedly driven by officials inside the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) -- including Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Acting Director of OMB Russ Vought, and Director of Domestic Policy Council Joe Grogan -- over the opposition of Attorney General William Barr and HHS Secretary Alex Azar,"" the letter continues.

Former Treasury Secretary says Mnuchin should not block push for Trump tax returns CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/lawrence-summers-steven-mnuchin-trump-taxes/index.html,"(CNN) An attempt from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to block the release of President Donald Trump's taxes would be ""inappropriate and probably illegal,"" according to Mnuchin's predecessor Lawrence Summers.
""The appropriate response of the treasury secretary is very clear: Under a long-standing delegation order, the secretary does not get involved in taxpayer-specific matters and has delegated to the IRS commissioner as follows: 'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Internal Revenue laws,'"" Summers, who served under President Bill Clinton, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Monday. Summers, a Harvard professor who also served as an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that the delegation is not ""readily revocable"" and Mnuchin, under law, would have to notify the relevant committees if he plans not to delegate this issue to the IRS chief. ""So for the secretary to seek to decide whether to pass on the President's tax return to Congress would surely be inappropriate and probably illegal,"" Summers added. He argued that neither he nor previous Treasury secretaries would have ""interfered with the IRS to contravene a nearly century-old statute that had been applied on many previous occasions."" Read More Summers also called Trump's claim that he cannot turn over his returns because they're under IRS audit ""wholly fictitious,"" saying there's no such IRS rule or practice. Using a provision in the tax code, the House Ways and Means Committee last week requested six years of Trump's business and personal tax returns from the IRS which is overseen by the Treasury Department. Mnuchin vs. Democrats: 5 things to watch The Trump administration has until Wednesday to respond to the committee's request, but the President has already made clear that he has no plans to make this fight easy. Trump's lawyers sent a letter on Friday to the Treasury Department's general counsel dismissing the request as a politically motivated pursuit. Last month, Mnuchin told House lawmakers he would "" comply with the law "" if he received a written request from Congress to turn over Trump's tax returns, but also sidestepped the issue by suggesting the decision would ultimately fall to the IRS commissioner, the country's federal tax collector. Mnuchin was scheduled to appear at two back-to-back Capitol Hill hearings on Tuesday, his first appearance since Democrats formally requested Trump's tax returns."
Trump's beef with Nadler is decades old CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-jerry-nadler/index.html,"(CNN) Decades ago, a businessman and a state assemblyman had a public and personal feud over New York real estate. It's 2019, and they're still fighting, but now, one is President of the United States and the other is chairman of the House committee that has the power to unravel his presidency.
The beef was revived Tuesday in a series of tweets from President Donald Trump following a report in The Washington Post outlining his long-antagonistic relationship with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, the one lawmaker with the unique qualification of having already fought Trump for years. With Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, Nadler has again become a thorn in Trump's side, newly empowered as one of the key leaders of Democratic oversight efforts, or what Trump and his administration frequently deem ""presidential harassment."" Last week, Nadler authorized a subpoena to obtain the full, unredacted report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election from special counsel Robert Mueller, teeing up a showdown between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over the nearly 400-page report. NY Rep.: If it's proven Trump directed Cohen payments, would be 'impeachable offenses' And last month, Nadler's committee announced a sweeping investigation into Trump's campaign, businesses, transition and administration, a probe that could lay the groundwork for Democrats if they choose to pursue impeachment proceedings against the President. Read More The investigation predictably and swiftly drew the ire of the White House and the President himself, who criticized Nadler both publicly and privately. During a trade meeting with House Republicans last month, according to The Washington Post, Trump referred to the New York congressman as ""Fat Jerry,"" a Trump-coined nickname that was first reported in New York Magazine in August 1995. Trump told the New York Daily News in 1995 that he called Nadler fat to ""inspire"" him. ""I feel that whatever can inspire him to go out and lose that tremendous amount of weight should be done. To be honest with you, he's a walking time bomb and if I can convince him to put himself, not in great shape, but in reasonable shape, I'm doing a great service to him and his family,"" Trump said at the time. Nadler lost a significant amount of weight following weight-loss surgery in 2002 and Trump himself is clinically obese, per his most recent physical . Trump spoke at length at the March meeting about Nadler's weight, which was embarrassing to several of his Republican House colleagues, per the Post's reporting. But, as Trump reportedly told the lawmakers, ""I've been battling Nadler for years."" The New Yorkers, now in their 70s, first encountered each other early in Trump's real estate career when Nadler was a state assemblyman. Trump faced opposition from New York lawmakers, including then-Mayor Ed Koch, when he wanted to develop property he purchased in 1985 on the West Side of Manhattan that required the movement of a highway.

Rep. Nadler: Congress has been shielding Trump 01:20 Even after he became a congressman in 1992, Nadler was a key opponent of the project, and the years-long dispute was well-documented in local publications at the time as it faced numerous zoning and tax obstacles. The New York Times characterized Nadler as ""among the project's strongest foes "" and at one point, he successfully cut off federal funds that would have allowed the development to proceed. The highway never moved, but in a twist of irony, Nadler ultimately voted for a transportation bill in 1998 that, at the last minute, allocated $6 million in funding to Trump's project. After the vote, Nadler told The Observer he was ""absolutely livid,"" criticizing Trump's motives. ""The real reason that he wants to move the highway is not out of the wonderfulness of his heart, but so the sightlines for some of the apartments will be clear,"" Nadler told The Observer. ""He will then be able to sell them for more money, and that will help with his financing."" Trump did build residential buildings, later selling the property, but as The Washington Post notes, ""After Trump's election, residents of the apartment complex voted to have his name removed from the property, a repudiation of the man who fought for its very existence."" Trump rehashed the history Tuesday on Twitter. ""Congressman Jerry Nadler fought me for years on a very large development I built on the West Side of Manhattan. He wanted a Rail Yard built underneath the development or even better, to stop the job. He didn't get either & the development became VERY successful,"" Trump wrote . He continued : ""Nevertheless, I got along very well with Jerry during the zoning and building process. Then I changed course (slightly), became President, and now I am dealing with Congressman Nadler again. Some things never end, but hopefully it will all go well for everyone. Only time will tell!"""
Trump denies reports he will reinstate family separation border policy CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-family-separation-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that his administration is not looking to resume the separation of parents and children at the US-Mexico border, denying reports that it is something he has been pushing for.
Senior administration officials told CNN's Jake Tapper that in the last four months or so, the President had been pushing then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy -- not just the original policy started by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and undone by the President once it was criticized -- that called for the prosecution of individuals crossing the border illegally between ports of entry, resulting in the separation of parents from children. According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers. The President wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming. JUST WATCHED Sources: Trump ordered El Paso port closed, told border agents to defy asylum laws Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Sources: Trump ordered El Paso port closed, told border agents to defy asylum laws 05:20 Sources told CNN that Nielsen tried to explain they could not bring the policy back because of court challenges, and White House staffers tried to explain it would be an unmitigated public relations disaster. ""He just wants to separate families,"" said a senior administration official. Read More Trump repeatedly denied that was the case on Tuesday. ""We're not looking to do that, no. We're not looking to do that,"" Trump said. But, he added, ""when you don't do it, it brings a lot more people to the border."" ""Now, I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'let's go to Disneyland,' "" Trump said. He also blamed the policy on the Obama administration. ""President Obama separated children. I was the one who that changed it,"" he claimed. But that's not exactly the case. The main difference between Trump and Obama , experts have said, centers on how they handled immigrants caught near the US-Mexico border. Under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department was given broad discretion on who should face criminal charges, and federal prosecutors rarely went after families. But in April 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would prosecute 100% of illegal border-crossers in a policy known as ""zero-tolerance."" Adults went to jails and awaited criminal proceedings. Children were sent to detention centers run by the Department of Health and Human Services, and some were eventually placed in foster care. This specific change is what led to the widespread separation of parents and children, according to Jessica Bolter, a researcher with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute who has published 200 pages of reports on Trump's immigration policies. CNN's Jim Acosta also reported Monday that Trump was considering a ""binary choice"" policy as an alternative to the zero-tolerance policy that resulted in family separations at the border. One official said the ""binary choice"" proposal puts that decision of separation in the hands of parents ."

""We've never had a better relationship, Egypt and the United States, than we do right now,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, noting that the two will discuss military and trade during the meeting and adding that the two countries have made progress on combating terrorism. Trump was asked about Sisi's efforts to stay in power until 2034 . (A potential amendment to Egypt's constitution would extend Sisi's term in office.) ""I think he's doing a great job, I don't know about the effort, I can just tell you he's doing a great job,"" he said, calling Sisi a ""great person."" Human rights groups have accused the Egyptian regime of carrying out widespread and systematic torture of political prisoners, silencing dissidents and using death sentences to settle scores . Sisi's government has denied the allegations. Egyptian President: Trump would 'no doubt' make a strong leader Read More An administration official briefing reporters ahead of Monday's visit said that as it relates to human rights, the Trump administration is ""focused on getting the return of US citizens who are detained in Egypt,"" adding that they are also concerned about the treatment of religious minorities in Egypt. Sisi emphasized through a translator that relations ""have not been better."" Trump also noted that first lady Melania Trump was recently in Egypt, having visited the pyramids in October. ""What she saw with the pyramids was -- you could call it the 7th wonder or the 8th Wonder of the World. She thought it was one of the most incredible things she's seen and we have lots of pictures,"" he said. ""But she's not easily impressed, she was very impressed."" Their meetings focused on security and the economy, but human rights were also to be discussed, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on a background call ahead of the visit. Sisi last came the White House in April 2017 , marking the first time an Egyptian leader had visited in seven years. Earlier Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Sisi. Pompeo ""re-affirmed the strength and importance of the US-Egypt bilateral relationship"" and discussed counterterrorism efforts, ""countering the Iranian regime's malign influence"" and ""cases concerning US citizens in Egypt,"" according to a readout. A group of at least 15 Republican and Democratic senators sent a letter requesting that Pompeo broach the subjects of crackdowns on political freedoms and human rights and Egypt's reported purchase of 20 Russian fighter aircraft, during his meeting with Sisi.

Inside Stephen Miller's 'underthe-radar' role in the Trump White House - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/stephen-miller-trump-dhs-purge/index.html,"(CNN) As Donald Trump pursues a purge of the Department of Homeland Security amid what he is promising will be a tougher immigration policy, attention has, again, turned to Stephen Miller -- one of the President's top aides. Miller is one of the youngest and least high-profile members of Trump's inner circle, but on immigration has long been a leading advocate of a strong hand as it relates to the handling of undocumented immigrants trying to enter the United States.
To get a fuller perspective on Miller and his influence on the President, I reached out to CNN White House correspondent -- and rabid Alabama fan! -- Kaitlan Collins . Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
Cillizza: What is the key to Miller's success -- and longevity -- in this White House and with this President? Collins : Our reporting shows Miller has already had a lot of success in serving the President. He's become one of the President's closest advisers, and while he may not be victorious with everything he pushes, he certainly has Trump's ear when it comes to immigration. Take for example what happened last week: Ron Vitiello was well on his way to becoming the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Miller went to the President and told him Vitiello wasn't in favor of him closing the southern border, as Trump had threatened to do for a week. Miller knew how the President would react to this. The White House quickly pulled the nomination -- so quickly that DHS officials thought it was a clerical error until Friday morning. The Homeland Security secretary was never officially informed about the withdrawal. And [Wisconsin Sen.] Ron Johnson, a Republican who chairs the Homeland Security panel, said he was ""completely surprised"" by it. Read More The episode was revealing of Miller's influence. Cillizza: Miller is much lower-profile than people like, say, Kellyanne Conway or Mick Mulvaney. Is that by choice? Collins : Very much so. Miller has made few television appearances, and my reporting shows that the low public profile is on purpose. He has a large presence inside the West Wing, but is someone who prefers to operate under the radar rather than in a public way. Miller is someone who wants to be involved in a lot of things, just not always with his fingerprints on it. Cillizza: How much of Miller's views on immigration are his own and how much is he channeling what he knows Trump wants? Collins : I think the mistake that gets made when talking about this is that people assume all of the immigration pushes coming out of the White House are masterminded by Miller. Yes, he carries significant weight in this department and can help put the President's ideas in motion. But a lot of it comes from Trump himself. The President's thoughts on immigration are not new. For example, it was the President's idea to close the border. He kept pushing it despite advisers like Kirstjen Nielsen telling him it was a bad idea with severe consequences. So other aides, like Miller and Mulvaney, were on the other side of things, brainstorming how he could close the border without devastating the US economy. Maybe he couldn't seal the entire border, but he could close certain ports of entry, stall some trade or slow walk entries into the US, they suggested. Cillizza: What is the general view of Miller inside the White House (aside from Trump)? Do Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner like him? Mulvaney? Collins : Miller is quite well-liked inside the West Wing. He has been here since the beginning, which can't be said for a lot of people anymore, and is seen as someone who is trustworthy. He often gets the description of the lone wolf pushing Trump's most extreme immigration proposals, but it's more complicated than that. Kushner has recently become more involved on immigration talks. Mulvaney has his hand in things too, telling the President that closing the border could appeal to his base. And Trump listens to a lot of outside advice, too. Now, Miller being liked outside of the West Wing is a different story. He's rankled a slew of officials at Department of Homeland Security because he has often acted as if he can overrule them since the early days of the Trump White House. In a normal administration, that might not work. In this one, sometimes it does."
Oprah donates $2 million to Puerto Rico hurricane recovery efforts CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/oprah-puerto-rico-donation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Oprah Winfrey is pitching in $2 million to help Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017.

Principal Financial ( PFG ) signed a $1.2 billion deal on Tuesday to acquire Wells Fargo's ( WFC ) institutional retirement and trust business. The unit serves 7.5 million retirement customers across the United States, offering 401(k), pension, employee stock ownership and other services used by employers. Wells Fargo said the deal reflects its goal of focusing resources on areas it can grow and maximizing opportunities within wealth, brokerage and asset management. The Wells Fargo business had $827 billion in assets under administration at the end of the year. The decision to exit the retirement-plan business also comes as Wells Fargo deals with reputational problems , legal costs and unprecedented sanctions . Read More Wells Fargo's CEO is out. Here's how the bank can end its crisis The Federal Reserve, citing ""widespread consumer abuses,"" imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo in early 2018 that prevents the bank from growing its business.

""To the best of our knowledge, there weren't problems in this part of the organization,"" Principal CEO Dan Houston told CNN Business. Houston said Principal conducted ""extensive"" due diligence over the past six months examining the business and its employees. ""We feel very good about that,"" Houston said. Last month, Wells Fargo announced the abrupt departure of CEO Tim Sloan , a three-decade veteran of the bank and its troubled culture. Wells Fargo's board of directors promised to hire an outsider.

More than two-thirds of the accounts are from employers with plans ranging between $10 million and $1 billion. ""We're excited. This is a real win-win for our customers and shareholders,"" Houston said. The price tag on the deal could rise to $1.35 billion two years after closing if certain revenue targets are hit. The Wells Fargo retirement businesses are served by 2,500 employees, including US workers in Charlotte, Minneapolis and Waco, Texas, as well as overseas in the Philippines and India. Principal signaled it plans to keep most of those workers in place after the deal closes. That is expected to occur in the third quarter if regulators approve it. ""We don't anticipate much in the way of employees relocating to Des Moines,"" Houston said. ""This isn't the center of the universe."" Wells Fargo declined to comment beyond its press release.

""I just cried,"" he told ABC in an interview shown Tuesday on ""Good Morning America"" when asked how he felt seeing the viral video. Dao, speaking publicly for the first time about the encounter that left him bloodied, said that he woke up in a hospital with no memory of being taken off the plane. Cell phone footage showed security officers dragging Dao by his arms and legs down an aisle before takeoff from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on April 9, 2017, after he refused to surrender his seat on the packed plane for commuting crew members.

Dao and his wife, who were flying home, initially agreed to take a later flight, a fellow passenger told CNN, but the couple changed their minds when they learned the next flight wouldn't leave until the following day. United had offered compensation to anyone willing to give up their seats; Dao apparently was chosen when not enough people volunteered.

United made several policy changes or clarifications. Among them: The airline won't remove boarded passengers involuntarily -- or call authorities -- unless there's a safety or security issue. Though United said the 2017 flight was simply full, and not overbooked, Southwest Airlines announced it would no longer overbook flights in an attempt to ensure ticket-holding customers would not be booted. Delta Air Lines and United said they would, if space is needed, offer volunteers up to $10,000 to give up their seats voluntarily."

Japanese F-35 fighter goes missing over the Pacific,us.cnn.com,Brad Lendon,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/japan-f-35-stealth-fighter-missing-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) A Japanese F-35 fighter crashed into the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, raising questions about reliability and security of the most expensive weapons system ever made.
The stealth jet disappeared from radar minutes into a training mission from Misawa Air Base in northern Japan . Defense officials said its pilot signaled the need to abort the mission shortly before the plane was lost. Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said debris from the plane, parts of its two tail fins, was found early Wednesday. Japanese and US planes and ships, including a US guided-missile destroyer, were continuing to search for the pilot, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said, adding that the unnamed aviator was a male in his 40s with more than 3,200 hours of flying experience. A Japan Coast Guard's vessel and U.S. military plane search for a Japanese F-35 fighter jet, in the waters off Aomori, northern Japan on Wednesday. He was flying what is considered the best stealth jet technology in the skies. Read More With the world's most advanced avionics, engines and weaponry, the Pentagon touts the F-35 as the ""the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used."" As of August 2018, more than 310 F-35s have been delivered to militaries around the world, according to the plane's maker, Lockheed Martin. Japan's first squadron of the $100 million fighter jets went operational just 11 days ago, with 13 of the jets forming the 302nd Squadron at the Misawa base, according to a report from The Diplomat.com . Iwaya said Japan's remaining dozen F-35s would be grounded until the cause of Tuesday's crash is determined. But early reports suggest system failure and that's troubling because it might mean that something had been missed in the production process, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy officer and professor at Hawaii Pacific University. Japanese Air Self-Defense Force staff in 2016 in Arizona for the arrival of the first Japanese F-35A. ""Certification when it's new is pretty demanding. The checkout is very thorough in early production models,"" he said. While most F-35s are made in the United States, the one that crashed Tuesday was the first to come off an assembly line in Nagoya, Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said. Peter Layton, a former Australian Air Force officer and analyst at the Griffith Asia Institute, said the Japanese assembly line would be one of the first places to look for answers. ""There are several hundred F-35s flying (worldwide) suggesting a local not fleet wide problem,"" he said. The fact that the Japanese pilot called for a mission abort but apparently did not issue a mayday call indicates a possible instrumentation problem, possibly with the plane's wiring, Layton said. ""The pilot appears to have thought he was in command and not in imminent danger,"" Layton said. It's possible as the aviator was trying to troubleshoot he flew straight into the ocean, he said. The Japanese jet, an F-35A model, is the second lost to an accident. A US Marine Corps F-35B crashed in Beaufort, South Carolina, in late September. US defense officials in October said a faulty fuel tube was the likely cause , and all F-35s operated by the United States and its allies were temporarily grounded for inspection. Other incidents that have hit the F-35 program include a runway fire in Florida in 2014 which led to inspections of the plane's engines; and five incidents in 2017 where pilots reported oxygen deprivation problems. The F-35 comes in three versions. The one that went missing Tuesday is the Air Force's F-35A model. The F-35 comes in three versions. The F-35A, like the one Japan lost contact with Tuesday, is the one designed for air forces to use off conventional runways. The F-35B, like the one the US Marine Corps lost, is designed for short takeoff and vertical landings. The F-35C model is the US Navy's version, designed for use off its aircraft carriers. All contain an advanced electronic warfare suite which can allow seamless integration among users within one military or among allies. The jet's sophistication means the US and Japan would likely be acting quickly to recover any wreckage from the bottom of the Pacific before adversaries could get a look at it, Schuster said. Even getting a look at the wreckage via a close up underwater camera could provide China or another adversary like Russia valuable intelligence, Schuster said. ""They'll be worried about it,"" Schuster said of the US and Japanese militaries. ""China does have deep-sea recovery submarines."" Schuster recalled an incident in the 1980s when the US military rushed to recover the a US F-14 Tomcat -- then one of the world's best fighters -- that had crashed in the Caribbean before any adversaries could get a close look at it. Tuesday's crash is certainly a setback for Japan's ambitious F-35 program. With 147 of the planes in its fleet or on order, Tokyo is Lockheed Martin's second biggest customer for the plane. Japan has announced plans to buy 105 of the F-35A models and 42 F-35Bs, the latter of which it could eventually use to turn its Izumo-class helicopter destroyers into small aircraft carriers , its first since World War II. US F-35 fighter jet conducts first-ever airstrike In the Pacific, South Korea and Australia have joined Japan in acquiring the jets, and Singapore has announced it wants to buy them too. The F-35's are seen as strong counters to China's growing fleet of stealth aircraft, including the J-20 and J-31. The first US combat mission conducted by an F-35 happened in October when a Marine Corps jet launched off the amphibious warship USS Essex struck targets in Afghanistan. In May, Israel announced it had conducted the first combat missions using the F-35 but offered few details."
Researchers discover state of matter which is simultaneously solid and liquid,us.cnn.com,Euan McKirdy,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/europe/potassium-solid-liquid-state-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) When is a solid not a solid?
Scientists have discovered that, under certain conditions, some elements could exhibit properties of both solids and liquids. A team of physicists based at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland used artificial intelligence to simulate what would happen if potassium was subject to huge pressure -- between about 200,000 and 400,000 times atmospheric pressure -- and heat -- between 400 to 800 Kelvin (260 to 980 degrees Fahrenheit). While potassium atoms, like most metals, behave in an orderly way under ordinary circumstances, the researchers noted that under extreme conditions they line up in complex arrangements -- a core of atoms lines up in a cylindrical tube, arranged in an ""X"" and four long chains sitting alongside this. The two distinct arrangements are referred to as ""host-guest structures,"" the study's co-author, Andreas Hermann told CNN. Read More The resulting substance is, on an atomic level, ""two intertwined, interlinked crystal lattices -- that in itself is a strange thing,"" he said. Chain-melted state The study, which is published this week in journal PNAS , found that under these conditions potassium atoms entered what is known as a chain-melted state, where one of the two lattices -- the ""guest"" part -- dissolved into liquid, while the ""host"" part remained solid. Scientists learn how to reverse time -- in theory ""Upon heating, the guest atoms can 'melt,' while the host atoms remain crystalline,"" the paper explains. ""The 'host' lattice is much stronger bound and so that remains a solid -- it needs more energy to melt it,"" he says. ""The 'guest' is weaker bound which is why it liquifies."" The two structures -- 80% host and 20% guest -- are identical on an atomic level, and only differ in how they line up. ""You can't distinguish the (atoms), when they forming you can't tell which one will go where,"" he says. ""If you could hold it, the liquid part could leak out, but because they're the same atoms, the solid will partially liquify to replace the liquid, and the liquid part will reconstitute itself (into the solid)."" Constantly reforming block of solid-liquid The resulting substance -- if it could be observed by humans -- would look like a solid block of potassium which is simultaneously leaking liquid and reforming as a solid. Hermann describes it as ""a sponge material that can soak up a liquid -- the sponge is solid, but in this case they are the same material. The sponge that soaks itself up. Then it leaks out it reforms the sponge around itself. As the structure is 80% ""host"" structure and 20% ""guest,"" the substance is ""always in a state of 80% solid, 20% liquid,"" he says. Machine learning advances Artificial intelligence models were developed to extrapolate what could be seen at the atomic level and apply these findings to much larger theoretical samples. Hermann says that the machine-learning modeling has implications for how other elements behave under similarly extreme conditions. ""We can replicate this modeling with other metals,"" he says. ""This machine learning technique is really taking off in the (physics) community right now -- it seems to be accurate enough to trust what comes up and we can upscale calculations and model entirely different processes. ""It's all driven by quantum mechanics calculations, which is restricted to hundreds of atoms, with machine learning we can upscale by a factor of a hundred. ""One can use machine learning to build a potential for how the atoms behave over a large temperature and pressure range."""

Israel election: Here's what you need to know,us.cnn.com,"Andrew Carey, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/middleeast/israel-elections-explainer-intl/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) Israelis are voting in a closely watched general election on Tuesday, seen here as a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu.
On March 31, Netanyahu marked ten uninterrupted years as Israel's Prime Minister, in addition to the three years he led the country in the 1990s, and there is little doubt that he's won a place in the A-list of world leaders; for a man leading a country of fewer than nine million people , his clout and recognition are a remarkable achievement. But at home he has become a highly polarizing figure, inspiring devotion and revulsion in equal measure. Netanyahu has fought this election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offences. The Attorney General has called him for one final hearing before he decides whether or not to bring charges. Unbowed, Netanyahu has denied the charges and sought to turn these criminal investigations to his advantage, portraying them as a witch-hunt, led by a left-wing media elite. Trump backs Netanyahu, but will voters? Your guide to Israel's elections As CNN discovered when it visited a stronghold of his party Likud, in the desert town of Beersheva several weeks ago, that message resonates strongly with many blue-collar Israelis. The local Likud organizer in the town compared Netanyahu to Moses, saying, ""The more they go after him, the stronger he becomes."" Another key component of Netanyahu's campaign has been exploiting his status as a world statesman, with close ties to both the President of the United States and the President of Russia, both of whom have been quite ready to do him favors in recent weeks. On a visit to Washington, Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in defiance of overwhelming international consensus. This on top of earlier Trump decisions to switch the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal. Read More Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu votes on Tuesday. Just days before the election, on a visit to Moscow, Netanyahu was able to personally thank Vladimir Putin for Russia's key role in locating the body of an Israeli soldier who had been missing in Lebanon for nearly 37 years. Even Netanyahu's critics have been forced to acknowledge that the Israeli leader's relationship with Putin has been remarkably fruitful, allowing the Israeli military considerable freedom to operate against Iranian targets in Syria, which Netanyahu always cites as Israel's number one security consideration. The election was called in December, ostensibly after the government gave up on efforts to get a new military draft law through Parliament. It seems clear that Netanyahu believed the timing was right‚Äîsending voters to polls before any indictments were brought against him, and with a message he could sell to the electorate. Speaking to his Likud lawmakers on the day the election was called he said the outgoing government had ""outstanding achievements"" on which to campaign. Benny Gantz and his wife, Revital, cast thier ballot at a polling station in Rosh Ha'ayin. At first facing a diverse array of opponents, Netanyahu saw his challenge crystalize after a dramatic announcement in February, which saw three former army chiefs come together with a former TV news anchor-turned-politician to create the Blue and White party. The name was simple but significant. Blue and White are the colors of the Israeli flag. The message was equally simple: Blue and White had been created to reclaim the state of Israel from Prime Minister Netanyahu. The man who would lead that campaign and present himself as the anti-Netanyahu candidate was Benny Gantz, a former head of the army, who had held that position under Netanyahu, fighting two wars in Gaza during his tenure. How Israel's political debate moved from peace talks to annexation Gantz's entry into the political arena had been widely anticipated, and, indeed, hoped for in many quarters. Blue and White's polling numbers quickly surged, turning it into a two-horse race. The campaign was hard and personal. After it emerged that Iran had allegedly hacked Gantz's phone, Netanyahu questioned whether he could be trusted to keep the country safe if he couldn't look after his phone. Netanyahu loyalists also suggested Gantz had abandoned a dying soldier after an attack many years ago in the West Bank town of Nablus. Blue and White rejected the slur, Gantz was also cleared by an IDF inquiry. For his part, the Prime Minister announced he intended to sue Gantz and his key ally, Moshe Ya'alon, after the latter suggested Netanyahu could be guilty of treason in connection with an investigation into military procurement. As the election entered its final days, most polls showed Gantz with a slim lead over his rival. But the same polls suggested that Netanyahu's route to building a successful coalition would be more straightforward, due to the large number of other right-wing parties projected to win seats. Indeed, the projected success of several hard-right parties could be a key outcome of this election. Israel's election is a race to the right Netanyahu's final campaign move involved a series of major TV interviews in which he chose to push the issue of annexation of the West Bank. If re-elected, Netanyahu told one interviewer, ""I am going to apply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements. And I don't differentiate between the settlement blocs and the isolated settlements,"" a reference to three areas of the West Bank where most Israeli settlements are located, known as the blocs, and other, smaller settlements scattered across the territory. Any such move would be highly controversial. The international community regards the West Bank as occupied Palestinian land and remains committed to the eventual establishment there of a Palestinian state. Gantz called Netanyahu's remarks 'irresponsible' electioneering and said that as Prime Minister he would not make any unilateral moves in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
$4 gas is nearly a reality for many Americans,us.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/gas-prices/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) US gasoline prices are becoming a real pain for motorists, particularly in the west.
A survey of more than 5,000 gas stations conducted by AAA shows that the average price for a gallon of regular gas is now $2.75, up 11% in the last month. And the average price is already above $3 a gallon in six western states: California, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and Alaska. Four-dollar gas is the average in a couple of California counties. Many others are within a few cents of that mark, including San Francisco, where the average price is $3.98. The statewide average in California is up 20 cents a gallon, or 5%, to $3.83 in just the last week. The Midwest has also been hit by price spikes. The average price in Chicago has jumped 46 cents a gallon, or 16%, to $3.27 in the last month. Unplanned refinery maintenance at several locations is responsible for the sudden, and uneven, increases across the nation, said Tom Kloza, head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. Western states are particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions because they have less refining capacity than other locations across the United States. Read More ""The western half of the country hasn't added any refining capacity this century,"" said Kloza. ""It's been a cluster of difficulties but not disasters hurting supplies, particularly out in the West."" America imported no oil from Venezuela last week. Here's why that's a big deal Kloza said $4-a-gallon gas will be common in California and perhaps in some other western states in the coming weeks. But most of the country could start to see some relief in gas prices soon as refineries along the Gulf Coast start to come back online from scheduled maintenance in the coming weeks. Crude oil prices have also played a role in the steady rise in gasoline prices, although gas prices increases have outpaced those in oil markets. US crude oil is up 51% since December 24. American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela and fighting in Libya have combined with a cutback on oil production by OPEC nations to drive up the price of oil. ""Almost every day since the day after Christmas, both gas prices and oil prices have crept up,"" said Kloza."

Huawei pleads not guilty to charges it violated US sanctions on Iran The US Treasury Department said that Standard Chartered had ""acted with reckless disregard and failed to exercise a minimal degree of caution"" in processing nearly 10,000 transactions between 2009 and 2014 that moved a total of $438 million through the United States in violation of sanctions. While noting that Standard Chartered had provided ""substantial"" cooperation during the probe, officials said the bank had allowed dozens of companies subject to sanctions to access the US financial system. Read More UK regulators said they had also uncovered ""significant shortcomings"" in the bank's approach to identifying risks. They said one client had been allowed to open an account using a suitcase containing 3 million dirhams ($625,000) in cash, without providing evidence of where the money came from. Standard Chartered also failed to collect sufficient information from a customer exporting a product with potential military applications to 75 countries. Warren Buffett has weighed in on what kind of CEO Wells Fargo should hire Under the terms of the settlement, Standard Chartered has agreed to conduct regular risk assessments and improve its internal controls. ""We are pleased to have resolved these matters and to put these historical issues behind us,"" Standard Chartered ( SCBFF ) CEO Bill Winters said in a statement. ""The circumstances that led to today's resolutions are completely unacceptable and not representative of the Standard Chartered I am proud to lead today."" The settlement requires Standard Chartered to pay $947 million to US government agencies, while the UK Financial Conduct Authority will collect ¬£102 million ($133 million). The bank set aside $900 million to cover fines related to the allegations in the fourth quarter of 2018. It said Tuesday that it would take a final charge of $190 million in the first quarter of this year. Standard Chartered entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice in 2012, when it paid a total of $667 million over alleged sanctions violations. The agreement, which allows the company to resolve matters that would otherwise be prosecuted, had been extended multiple times."
White nationalism hearing features Facebook and Google,us.cnn.com,Donie O'Sullivan,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/white-nationalism-hearing-facebook-google/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) YouTube was forced to disable comments on a livestream of a House Judiciary hearing on hate crimes and white nationalism on social media Tuesday morning after it was flooded with racist and anti-Semitic comments.
The comments were an illustration of one of the issues at hand: Silicon Valley's ongoing struggle to stop the spread of hate across its platforms. Lawmakers are exploring possible legislative options on the issue. ""Due to the presence of hateful comments, we disabled comments on the livestream of today's House Judiciary Committee hearing,"" a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. ""Hate speech has no place on YouTube,"" they added. Even here, the divide between Democrats and Republicans on the prevalence of racist material online could be seen. Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat who chairs the committee, read during the hearing from a Washington Post story that referenced the hateful comments. Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert quickly responded, ""could that be another hate hoax? Just keep an open mind."" The hearing included representatives from Facebook and Google, who were appearing on a panel with six other witnesses, including civil rights activists, the father of two victims of an Islamophobic attack, invited by Democrats, and a prominent right-wing activist, Candace Owens of the conservative group Turning Point USA, invited by Republicans. Read More The hearing was held in an effort to inform lawmakers about possible legislative steps that could be taken to tackle online hate. But the event was highly partisan, with the Democratic and Republican members of the committee spending a good deal of time going after the opposing party's witnesses and in some instances defending their own. Even the witnesses themselves challenged each others' positions at times. For the most part the representatives from Facebook and Google didn't say anything their companies hadn't said publicly before, with both maintaining they were committed to tackling challenges on their platforms. The hearing was instead dominated by partisan sniping, including exchanges over past comments made by Owens. Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat, played audio of Owens appearing to defend Adolf Hitler. Owens had previously distanced herself from the comments and criticized Hitler. Lieu did not give Owens the opportunity to respond at the hearing, but Republican Rep. Greg Steube later did. Owens claimed that Lieu had purposely only played a short segment of the tape and said that in doing so, Lieu had been ""unbelievably dishonest."" The hearing came just a few weeks after a terror attack in New Zealand that was streamed live on Facebook . Fifty people at two mosques were killed in the attack. Social media networks have been criticized for the role their platforms can play in spreading extremist ideologies and radicalizing people, and for the lack of action they've taken on the problem of white supremacists and nationalists on their sites. Among those under fire are Facebook and Google, which owns the video sharing site YouTube, which has been blasted for hosting such content and for algorithms that can create a ""rabbit hole"" that takes users into more extreme videos. Another witness, Anti-Defamation League senior vice president of policy Eileen Hershenov, talked about the dangers of smaller platforms, which white supremacists have also been known to use. ""These platforms are like round-the-clock digital white supremacist rallies, creating online communities that amplify their vitriolic fantasies,"" Hershenov said. Mark Zuckerberg's new Facebook plan could make it harder to stop spread of violent videos Two weeks after the New Zealand massacre, Facebook announced that it would ban all ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on Facebook and Instagram. Previously, the company had banned white supremacy, but had viewed white nationalism differently. The company said it had decided to ban white nationalism after months of consultation with civil rights groups. Neither Google-owned YouTube nor Twitter have enacted similar blanket bans of white nationalism but both companies say they have policies to fight hate and the incitement of violence on their platforms."

Airlines have stopped ordering the 737 Max,us.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/boeing-737-max-deliveries/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Airlines are holding off on orders for Boeing's 737 Max ‚Äî the latest sign of how deeply the company's best-selling jet has been thrown into crisis.
Boeing ( BA ) released data Tuesday that showed only 10 of the planes were ordered in the first two months of 2019. There were no orders in March, the month that a 737 Max jet flown by Ethiopian Airlines pilots crashed in that country, killing everyone aboard. It was the second fatal crash involving a Max in recent months. That small number compares to 112 orders for the plane in the first quarter of 2018. At that time, Southwest Airlines ( LUV ) had ordered 40 of the jets, while Ryanair ordered 25. Orders for Boeing's other commercial jets actually increased slightly. The company sold 85 other commercial jets last quarter, compared to 68 a year earlier. But the sales data for the Max gives the clearest picture yet of how much scrutiny of that model could be hurting Boeing's bottom line. Investigators are still probing the cause of the Ethiopian crash, as well as the other Max crash involving a Lion Air jet last October. The two accidents killed 346 people in all, and eventually prompted the grounding of all 737 Max planes last month. Boeing also halted deliveries and announced last week that it was scaling back production of the 737 Max. Read More The focus of the crash investigations is the plane's automatic safety system, for which Boeing says it is developing a software fix . The fatal crashes are not the only cause of the sales drop, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst for the Teal Group. He attributed much of the change to the massive number of orders for the next generation of single-aisle jets that both Boeing and rival Airbus had previously booked. Airbus actually had worse first quarter orders for its A320, its 737 Max competitor. ""This is the mother of all frontloaded markets,"" said Aboulafia. Boeing has orders for 5,000 of the 737 Max jets on its books already. So far only one airline, Indonesia's Garuda, has outright canceled an order for 50 of the 737 Max jets since the grounding. Boeing also said Tuesday that all 737 deliveries in the first quarter fell by a third, to 89 from 132 a year ago. But most of that drop was caused by the reduced production and delivery of the older version of the 737 jet that Boeing is still building for some customers. Deliveries of the the older 737 jets fell by 66% to 32. Deliveries of the 737 Max increased by 54% compared to a year ago to 57, even with a two-week halt. That's because Boeing spent most of 2017 ramping up production of the Max."

That's what happened over the weekend to Evan Osnos, a staff writer at The New Yorker and a fellow at the Brookings Institution. He put out a tweet -- or a cry for help -- letting the world know of the little situation his toddler put him in. ""Uh, this looks fake but, alas, it's our iPad today after 3-year-old tried (repeatedly) to unlock. Ideas?"" Osnos tweeted. A photo of the iPad's screen noted the device was disabled.

Great, he'll have something to keep him occupied in the retirement home. Read More The iPad lockout is a security feature of Apple devices that kicks in whenever someone repeatedly types the wrong password. The more times an incorrect password is entered, the longer the lock-out time grows. Thankfully Osnos' Twitter followers gave all kinds of help in the comments, because there's nothing but good things in the comments, right? People offered hundreds of suggestions. Some were practical: ""Just connect it to the computer you originally synced it to iTunes on, let it sync and it'll be fine."" Others were nonsensical: ""Put it in a bag of rice."" One commenter had a novel idea: ""Time travel seems to be your best bet."" Yeah, probably. Another person suggested Osnos should ""reboot"" the 3-year-old, but that seems a tad bit unnecessary. Ready for a restore Several others said no worries --- just wait out the 48 years. Because you know folks on social media are known for their patience. So what does Apple suggest? Apple says you would need to perform a restore to use the device again (but you would lose the data on the device if you've never backed it up). Osnos told the New York Daily News on Monday he was still locked out of the device. ""It's down a few hundred minutes from yesterday, but it looks like we've still got 25 million minutes to go,"" he told the newspaper . ""The consensus seems to be that we're using an old operating system that won't let us restart fresh from iTunes."" CNN reached out to Osnos for comment and is waiting to hear back. Later on Monday Osnos tweeted that he'd managed to get the iPad into DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode and is in the process of restoring the tablet. Update on toddler-iPad-lock-out: Got it into DFU mode (don't hold down the sleep/power button too long or you end up in recovery). Now restoring. Thanks to those who shared advice!

IMF: Trade is dragging down global economic growth,us.cnn.com,Lydia DePillis,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/economy/world-economic-outlook/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The world economy is still slowing, the International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday, but a pickup is on the horizon ‚Äî growth is expected to recover next year unless ""policy missteps"" get in the way.
The organization, which monitors emerging risks and lends to countries in distress, cut its growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from 3.5% in January's edition of the World Economic Outlook. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's executive director, said the global economy is in a ""delicate moment."" ""Only two years ago, 75% of the global economy experienced an upswing,"" Lagarde said, according to the text of a speech she's due to give at the US Chamber of Commerce. ""For this year, we expect 70% of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth."" The downward revision came in part from a sharp drop in global trade volumes in recent months following an artificial run-up in imports and exports in 2018 in advance of tariffs imposed by the United States. Adding further duties, the report said, could prevent the global economy from stabilizing. Read More ""The main priority is for countries to resolve trade disagreements cooperatively, without raising distortionary barriers that would further destabilize a slowing global economy,"" the report read. President Donald Trump has recently pulled back on his threat to impose auto tariffs on a handful of countries, but maintains that he may use tariffs as leverage to push Mexico to do more to keep Central American migrants from reaching America's southern border. National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that further tariffs are far from a sure thing. ""He's just issuing a warning,"" Kudlow said, of Trump. ""If you know this president as I do, you better listen to him."" The authors of the IMF report did take heart in a move toward patience on behalf of central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, which signaled in March that it would hold off raising interest rates for the remainder of the year. The IMF stuck to its projection of 3.6% growth in 2020. Amid a global manufacturing malaise that seemed to be spreading to the United States, and a run of negative economic data, some analysts had begun talking about a return to rate cuts by the end of 2019, which Trump also called for last week. A robust employment report for US hiring in March, however, took the edge off those concerns. ""Last week's releases provide some reassurance that the world economy is not falling off a cliff, which had seemed a plausible, if relatively small, risk as recently as a month or so ago,"" wrote Capital Economics chief economist Neil Shearing in a note to clients on Monday. However, the IMF also signaled caution about the buildup of risky loans taken out by US companies as an area of concern. If interest rates were to rise suddenly, all that leverage could make for a much more severe downturn when the growth cycle comes to an end. -- CNN's Donna Borak contributed to this report."
Lloyd's of London is finally banning drinking and drugs,us.cnn.com,Michelle Toh,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/lloyds-of-london-drinking-ban/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) London's centuries-old insurance market is finally banning drugs and drunks.
Lloyd's of London said Tuesday that it will bar people believed to be drunk or on drugs from its premises. And anyone who attempts to enter its building while under the influence will have his or her security pass confiscated. It's not the first time that Lloyd's has cracked down on daytime drinking. In 2017, the insurance market banned its employees from drinking during work hours, saying the policy would ""remove ambiguity about what's acceptable."" The gender pay gap is getting worse at half of UK companies But that rule has largely been ignored, according to Bloomberg. It was also limited to Lloyd's employees, and did not apply to the huge number of brokers employed by other companies that work in the Lloyd's market. Read More ""We banned drinking during the working day and we believe the people who work for us have embraced that ban,"" a Lloyd's spokesperson said Tuesday. ""The insurance culture is changing, though the marketplace as a whole has more work to do."" The new policy has been implemented following the publication of a Bloomberg report that cataloged rampant sexual harassment at the insurance market, which it described as ""the most archaic corner left in global finance."" Bloomberg reported that much of the harassment of women was fueled by a culture where heavy drinking during work hours remained acceptable long after most London workplaces did away with lunch drinks. A doorman stands outside the Lloyd's building in London in 2017. Lloyd's, which got its start 330 years ago, outlined a plan last month to address complaints of sexual harassment, saying it would conduct a survey to examine the culture and ""identify the scale and scope of the issue."" It also said it would offer employees a confidential place to report inappropriate behavior, and vowed that anyone found to have committed misconduct would face penalties and possibly be banned from entering Lloyd's. ""The update to rules for accessing Lloyd's premises is just one part of our wider action plan to stamp out inappropriate behavior in the Lloyd's market,"" a spokesperson told CNN Business on Tuesday. ""We are serious about delivering on our commitment to change the culture for the better, ensuring Lloyd's is a safe and inclusive environment for all our members,"" the spokesperson added. The interior of Lloyd's of London photographed in 2016. Barbara Sch√∂nhofer, founder of the Insurance Supper Club, a networking group for women in the sector, said the move was a step in the right direction. ""In an attempt to try and reduce harassment of all forms in the work place we need to identify the behaviors that cause them,"" she said. ""It has become apparent that alcohol is a leading cause, but not the only [cause] that is driving these behaviors so I can only support Lloyd's of London in this new code of conduct."""
Saudi Aramco bond: Investors offer $100 billion,us.cnn.com,"Zahraa Alkhalisi, CNN Business",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/investing/saudi-aramco-bond/index.html,"Dubai (CNN Business) International investors are falling over themselves to lend money to Saudi Arabia's hugely profitable state-owned oil company.
Saudi Aramco tapped international debt markets for the first time ever Tuesday, and demand for the bonds soared above $100 billion, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The bond issue will raise at least $10 billion for Aramco, the world's most profitable company. A spokesman for Aramco declined to comment. In such large transactions, where strong demand is expected, investors often inflate their orders to ensure they're allocated at least some of the securities. Saudi Arabia was planning to sell some shares in Aramco last year to raise money for the kingdom's economic transformation, but the IPO stalled. A lack of transparency over the size of the country's energy reserves had caused skepticism about the potential sale and the value of Aramco. Read More Since then, Saudi Arabia's vast energy reserves have been independently audited and shown to total 268.5 billion barrels. That estimate is slightly higher than the 266.3 billion barrel figure previously published by the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia may be courting Asian partners, but it will always need the US Earlier this month, Aramco issued a prospectus for the bond offering that showed it made $111 billion in profit last year. It was the first time the oil giant had revealed such financial details. The company has said it will use the proceeds from the bond sale for general purposes. Investors expect some of the money raised to fund its purchase of 70% of Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic), the state-owned petrochemical company. ""It's not a surprise that the most profitable company in the world... on a debut international bond sale is capturing tons of investors' interest,"" said Aarthi Chandrasekaran, portfolio manager at SHUAA Asset Management. Investors appear to have set aside concerns over the government's involvement in Aramco's finances, she added. Saudi Arabia has always claimed vast oil reserves. An audit just proved it's right Saudi officials had said that selling just 5% of Aramco in an IPO could generate $100 billion to fund Vision 2030 , a blueprint of what the country's economy should look like over the next decade. The country have been on an aggressive drive to attract international investment as it diversifies its economy away from oil. But relations with the West have chilled following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate last year."

La Monica,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/investing/stock-market-fear/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Many value investors swear by the saying that the best time to be buying stocks is when there's blood in the streets. You can get rich by taking advantage of other investors' fears. But what do you do when absolutely nobody is afraid?
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all sporting double-digit percentage gains in 2019, and are inching closer to the record highs they set last year. Only 34 stocks in the S&P 500 were down for the year as of Monday's close. The VIX ( VIX ) , a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, has plummeted nearly 50% this year as anxiety has ebbed about an imminent recession and the Federal Reserve raising rates too aggressively. The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index , which looks at the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, isn't far from Extreme Greed levels. Welcome to the FOMO market Read More This investor giddiness is starting to make some people worried. The market often suffers from bouts of euphoria right before things turn south. People simply get too complacent. Analysts at Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Global Investment Committee wrote in a report Monday that investors appear to be suffering from a different type of fear these days ‚Äî the fear of missing out. The hope, according to Morgan Stanley, is that ""a Fed-engineered soft landing and lower real interest rates"" will justify current market valuations. The bull market turns 10 years old But John Norris, managing director with Oakworth Capital, told CNN Business that he's preparing his clients for more volatility ahead. ""We're telling people that this feels nice, but enjoy it while it lasts. We could have periods this year that could be gut-wrenching,"" Norris said. ""Expectations for earnings and the economy don't justify this rally."" Profits are expected to fall in the first quarter and expectations are for weak GDP growth too. Trade tensions haven't gone away either. The biggest risk on the horizon is if the United States imposes tariffs on Europe, said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, following the news that President Trump is threatening tariffs following a dispute over the EU allegedly providing subsidies to Boeing rival Airbus . But the good news for long-term investors who are planning for retirement is that any pullback in stocks isn't likely to be severe. Norris said stocks may still finish the year where they ended the first quarter. In other words, the market may meander a bit and fall slightly from current levels. But it's not going to plunge like a rock. ""We don't see a 2008 type event where there is a permanent erosion of capital,"" Norris said. ""There's no need to lose sleep over the stock market."" No need to freak out -- but it may be time to exercise caution Others agree that now is not a time for panic, but prudent and more cautious approach to the market seems justified. ""Volatility is still pretty low but financial conditions suggest you need to tighten your seat belts and stay put,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital.

But some longer-term investors are growing more worried. Commonfund, an asset manager that works with nonprofit institutions, recently surveyed investors from endowments, foundations and public pensions and found that many of them think the days are numbered for the current bull market. ""Investors have grown more skeptical about the longevity of this strong economy,"" said Mark Anson, CEO and chief investment officer of Commonfund in a statement. Nearly half of those surveyed think the market rally will end within the next year and almost a third think it will go for only another two years.

'Reconstruction' connects postwar past to 21st century,us.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/entertainment/reconstruction-review/index.html,"(CNN) The legacy of slavery, the Civil War and its aftermath are much-discussed in American politics, but seldom expansively enough to bring genuine context to them. PBS and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. address that shortcoming in ""Reconstruction: America After the Civil War,"" a four-hour documentary that weaves together the past with policies and debates that remain much in evidence today.
Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves ""wasn't the end of the story. It was just the beginning,"" Gates explains near the outset, leading a tour through 50 years of US history, from Andrew Johnson becoming president through the release of D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation,"" a cinematic ode to racism -- dubbed by one expert ""the cultural apex of Southern redemption"" -- that shaped the modern image of the Ku Klux Klan. In between, ""Reconstruction"" enlists a host of academics to detail key events of the postwar years and connect policies designed to disenfranchise African-Americans to tactics that are still being widely employed. Later chapters look at the cultural response within the African-American community, and the disparate views of two key leaders of the era, W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, regarding the most effective means of pursuing racial justice. Many of the policies enacted during Reconstruction conspired to leave blacks mired in poverty, with the fallout from those actions lingering 150 years later. Legislative efforts were augmented by violence and disinformation -- the latter preying upon a relatively gullible, unsophisticated population in a manner, one historian notes, which mirrors the role social media has come to play this century. Read More All of that ties into the ugly specter of racism, which, author and Columbia University professor Eric Foner says, continues to be ""the deepest legacy of slavery in our society."" Nor does it require much of a stretch to chart a path, as the filmmakers do, from Jim Crow laws, efforts to rehabilitate the Confederacy's image and demonization of black men to racial profiling, a surge in white supremacy and attempts to suppress African-American political participation. Gates has become a regular presence on PBS, but file this under the more substantial side of that contribution, compared to, say, his popular ""Finding Your Roots"" series, which also pairs him with filmmaker Dyllan McGee. (The subject ties in with a related book by Gates that's being released this month.) In his introduction, Gates dubs Reconstruction one of American history's most consequential chapters, as well as one of the most ""misrepresented and misunderstood."" Even a four-hour documentary isn't sufficient to remedy that lack of understanding, but thanks to the artful way that ""Reconstruction"" lays out its case, it's a start. ""Reconstruction: America After the Civil War"" premieres April 9 at 9 p.m. on PBS."

And while the movie is based on the beloved ""Big,"" Rae, who portrays Jordan's much put upon assistant April Williams, said ""Little"" stands on its own. "" allowfullscreen> ""People are going to compare, but we really tried to make our own thing,"" she said. ""Little's"" director Tina Gordon said body-swapping movies are such a popular genre that she focused more on character development than the fact it's a reboot. ""I actually just delve deep into the characters and who those women would be, which is what you have to do, breathing life into any piece that you're writing,"" she said. ""Those characters are what make the story new."" That's where the black girl magic comes in. Not only is the movie about black female characters, conceived of and starring a young, black woman and directed by a black woman, but it also offers black women of all ages the opportunity to see themselves on the big screen. Will Packer produced ""Little"" and hopes it will create more opportunities for family films told from a black perspective, much like Jordan Peele's success with ""Us"" is stoking interest in black horror films and ""Black Panther"" has Hollywood on the lookout for the next big, black superhero movie. ""I think the world itself is changing, and so now you're going to see films that feel more diverse and more inclusive,"" Packer said before adding, ""Remember we're starting from such a deficit that now that there's more, it doesn't mean that we're anywhere near where we need to be."" Martin aims to do her part to get the industry there. She's already made history with ""Little"" as the youngest person to ever executive produce a major Hollywood film. Her next project actually came via Martin's first-look deal with Universal, where she will be developing scripted projects via her Genius Productions company . The teen will star in ""StepMonster,"" a comedy about a young girl trying to navigate life with her stepmother. Rae and Hall joked that they're cast in that film as well and teased their young co-star about a possible ""Little"" sequel, with Rae lamenting, ""Marsai, work harder!"" So will there be a ""Little"" sequel? ""We have to figure out how this 'Little' does first before there's a 'Little' sequel,"" Martin laughed. ""That's the answer."""
Nearly 300 US mumps cases reported in March,edition.cnn.com,"Debra Goldschmidt, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/mumps-cases-us-cdc-bn/index.html,"(CNN) There have been 426 cases of mumps reported in the United States this year as of March 29, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
That's an increase of 275 cases in the last month. Previously, the CDC reported 151 cases of mumps as of the end of February. Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease that is caused by a virus. It is spread through saliva or mucus by coughing, sneezing or talking, and sharing eating utensils or cups, according to the CDC. It can also spread when an infected person touches items or surfaces that are then touched by someone else who picks up the virus. Outbreaks usually occur among people who have close contact, such as on college campuses and among sports teams. Read More Symptoms can appear 12 to 25 days after a person is infected and can include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite. The hallmark is swollen glands under the ears that are tender. But not everyone has symptoms, especially if they are experiencing a mild case of the illness. The best way to prevent mumps is with a vaccine. According to the CDC, the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is 88% effective when two doses are given.

""It's not really superstitious. It's a thing you do every time. There are guys literally that think they won't play good if they don't do the same thing (every time),"" Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Seth Jones tells CNN Sport, speaking ahead of the NHL Playoffs' start. Follow @cnnsport Let's face it, even if you might find it hard to admit, we all probably have a few habits that get us out of the house and through each day. A Montreal Canadiens video crew chronicled Andrew Shaw's intriguing pregame routine -- including slashing a teammate in the knee pad and orchestrating 50 different handshakes -- in which he admits: ""I've added little things that I find just help me get ready for the game. ""I think now it's just being superstitious going into every game. Most players do have a routine. If they say they don't, they are lying to you."" Read More 'Rigid routine' When NHL players are asked about their pregame routine, they often answer in a sheepish, almost noncommittal way -- ""Oh that's not me but let me tell you about my teammate."" Many players don't readily expand on their daily routines likely out of fear of not wanting to sound odd or give away a secret that an opponent, or even worse a teammate, can use against them. Winnipeg Jets forward Mark Scheifele warns: ""We have (Dustin) Byfuglien on our team who is a big jokester, so anyone who has a superstition probably needs to get rid of it if you play on the Winnipeg Jets. If you set your sticks up a certain way. You put your pads a certain way. Buff's gonna knock 'em over."" Even so, Scheifele, who is the Jets leading goal scorer, has a ritual that 'afflicts' several other NHLers -- wanting to be the last skater off the ice after the warm-up. ""I am the last one to go off. I like being on the ice. I like shooting around. I like it when no one else is out there. The way I look at it is that if I'm the last one off the ice, I've prepared the most."" JUST WATCHED Around the World with the Stanley Cup Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Obviously, we are competitors but that is a fun way to settle that score."" When St. Louis Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly arrives at the arena, he's intent on chilling rather than warming up. ""When I get to the rink, the first thing I do -- I get in the cold tub. Its one of those things that wakes myself up. It gets my legs feeling the right way.""

Compare this to three-time Stanley Cup champion Sidney Crosby. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain counts on a simple peanut butter and jelly before each game. But don't let the simple sandwich fool you. Crosby's before-the-puck-drop rituals might be the most well known. But as someone who has won multiple Olympic golds and Stanley Cups, who can say they aren't working? ""There is just too many, it's hard now after you do things for so long to know what is a superstition and what's just part of your daily routine,"" Crosby acknowledged in a 2017 post-practice interview. ""There's a lot of guys in here that have them -- they just don't want to admit it."" During Crosby's sixth season, a HBO camera crew followed ""Sid the Kid"" during his pregame routine -- willingly taking the long way around the arena as to not walk in front of the visitors' locker room. The aforementioned Jones, who says he is not really superstitious, is quick to smile and highlight one of his teammate's routines. ""Boone Jenner is one of the weirdest ones I've seen on the bench. Every time he comes on the bench from a shift, he'll take (a sip of) water, then Gatorade, water, Gatorade, spit, spit ... there is like a certain sequence to it. And if he messes it up -- he's done."" Jenner counters with, ""I'm not the worst."" But in jest seems to admit that if he has a good game or scores, the next pregame meal must be reenacted - right down to the same time, same table and same guy paying the bill. Meanwhile, the Columbus Blue Jackets' Cam Atkinson almost appears to laugh in the face of superstitions -- the All-Star forward wears the #13 on his back. When called out about the monotony of his chicken and pasta routine, Atkinson countered: ""you should ask (Johnny) Gaudreau about his pre-game lunch."" At this point Atkinson cracks a big smile. Atkinson knows the Calgary Flames star well. So, well that Gaudreau actually wears the #13 in homage to Atkinson. ""Gaudreau has pasta but has never had pasta sauce in his life. So he gets a big bowl of pasta with nothing -- not even butter, no cheese, nothing. I don't know how you can do that."" Gaudreau too seems impervious to all of this. ""I'm not superstitious at all.

Democratic socialism is the scenic route to serfdom,us.cnn.com,Jeffrey Miron and Ryan Bourne,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/democratic-socialism-is-the-scenic-route-to-serfdom-miron-bourne/index.html,"Jeffrey Miron is director of economic studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and the director of graduate and undergraduate studies in the department of economics at Harvard University. Ryan Bourne occupies the R. Evan Scharf Chair in economics at the Cato Institute. The opinions their own; view more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) In his 1944 book ""The Road to Serfdom,"" Nobel prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek argued that socialist economic planning resulted not just in accumulating losses of economic efficiency but ""the very destruction of freedom itself.""
Ryan Bourne Jeffrey Miron History was kind to Hayek's worldview. The United Kingdom , Sweden , and India tested socialistic planning without sustained repression. But people in the Soviet Union, Venezuela, Cambodia and Cuba were not so lucky. Natural experiments between socialism and capitalism in East Germany and West Germany, North Korea and South Korea, and Hong Kong and China, bore out the link between economic liberty and personal freedom. Upon reunification , for example, GDP per capita in East Germany was one-third of the West German level, and the latter did not require the East's Stasi or emigration restrictions. In criticizing socialism as it existed in the 1930s and 1940s, though, Hayek meant a government that owned and operated the means of production, controlled prices, and planned where and how production took place. Economists since have broadly agreed this type of ""planned"" economy is flawed, albeit recognizing every country has socialistic programs. In 2019, ""socialism"" is enjoying something of a revival in American politics. A Gallup Poll last year suggested Democrat voters now think more positively of socialism than capitalism. Sen. Bernie Sanders has self-described as a ""democratic socialist"" since the 1960s, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a card-carrying member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Democrats should restore capitalism's promise, not abandon it for socialism Interestingly, these modern socialists do not rhetorically echo their predecessors' definition. ""To me, socialism doesn't mean state ownership of everything,"" Bernie Sanders has said , ""...it means creating a nation ... in which all human beings have a decent standard of living."" Read More Lest we think socialism merely a lofty aspiration, Bhaskar Sunkara , editor of Jacobin magazine, recently claimed the key plank of socialism today is an expansive welfare state entrenching certain economic activities -- such as health care and child care -- as social rights. Social democracies, such as Sweden, have been held up by Ocasio-Cortez as her vision for the future . Superficially, this seems good news. If the ""socialism"" label now describes social democracy -- capitalist economies with highly redistributive welfare states -- then the ""red scare"" is overplayed. We need not worry about Hayek's highway to Havana, but can debate taking the street to Stockholm. Some liberals even endorse a grand bargain with ""socialists"": more social welfare in exchange for a lightly regulated economy with a well-designed tax system, to generate high levels of income to redistribute. What 2020 Dems can't afford to ignore about Bernie Alas, this sanguine view is delusional. Today's socialists, while jettisoning the desire for direct government ownership, would put us on a path to Hayek's destination, albeit via the scenic route. Their vision implies far more intrusive government than the social democratic rhetoric suggests. Sunkara, for example, has called for converting shareholder firms into worker-owned cooperatives ( something Sanders supports ). This ""market socialism"" saw Yugoslavia's economy run into the same stagnation and inefficiency as the centrally planned variant elsewhere. For a start, the problem that cooperatives have in raising capital will require national or regional investment banks to provide funds , thus government would be picking winners and allocating resources. Far from letting markets rip, the Green New Deal , or GND, advocates placing the economy on a war footing to reach a net zero carbon target within 30 years, including overhauling the transport sector and converting all buildings to make them energy efficient. This is the antithesis of market-led decision-making. The GND's social goals do not end with fiscal transfers, either. A jobs guarantee paying a family wage would see the federal government become the world's largest employer , placing workers into its favored environmental, infrastructure and caring sectors. The GND also demands emboldened labor unions, strengthened labor market regulation, and beefed up trade rules to protect domestic workers and manufacturing. Elsewhere, socialists have extolled ""free"" college , breaking up financial institutions , and a $15 minimum wage . Far from a broad-based, pro-growth tax system to deliver the revenues for this agenda, modern socialists range from favoring direct money printing (aka Modern Monetary Theory, a view dismissed as nonsense by every reputable economist across the spectrum ) to endorsing extraordinarily high, distortionary tax rates on the rich. In fact, some want punitive tax rates to reduce inequality, even if this raises less revenue. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Where today's socialists want more generous social protections through guaranteed health care, child care, and other benefits-in-kind, the distinction between government ownership and financing will be illusory in practice. Once government covers the costs of a service, it sets limits on how much it pays as the major consumer, creating de facto price controls. Governments attach conditions to their spending, too, defining who can work in an industry or the standards producers must meet. These regulations create shortages in high-cost areas, necessitating subsidized provision to meet demand. Before long the industry is effectively nationalized through regulation. Hayek's key observation was that intervention creates problems that encourage further corrective intervention, eroding freedom along the way. Today's socialists might not demand eliminating private property, nor be calling for gulags to enforce their vision. But, combined, their proposed regulatory, spending, and taxing onslaught would severely restrict freedom and undermine prosperity, just like the socialist experiments of old."
