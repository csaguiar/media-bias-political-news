From before the era of tent-pole summer blockbusters and superhero extravaganzas, comes The Rocketeer , one of my favourite genre movies of the last five decades. While the 1991 release is far from perfect, it certainly stands head-and-shoulders above many of the more explicit comicbook-inspired films we have seen in recent years, deliberately harking back to the black-and-white serials of the 1930s and ’40s (hence the contemporary description of “An airborne Indiana Jones “). And unlike those weekly shorts, it has aged remarkably well, the quality of the writing, performances and direction giving it a lasting appeal. The guys at Red Letter Media have given it a well-deserved retrospective review, featured below, with a great suggestion for a sequel. Share"

AAA
Iowa 10, Nashville 4
Game Recap
A 13-batter, 7-run 3rd inning propelled the I-Cubs to their second win of the season. It was an all-around solid performance by the team. Matt Swarmer struggled through the 4th, allowing three runs, but he held the Sounds off the board in his other four innings of work. They also got some good glove work.

Game Recap
A day after Cory Abbott impressed over five innings in his first AA start, Keegan Thompson offered a reminder why he was the first of the Cubs 2017 draft picks to reach Tennessee last season. He struck out eight, only walked one, and oh yeah, didn't give up a hit. It didn't quite measure up to his seven inning no-hit effort from last summer, but it will do for his first start of the season, I think. Bryan ( @cubprospects ) dug into Thompson's start yesterday in more detail on BN and it is worth checking out: https://t.co/pnF5Y06Imf

Game Recap
The Pelicans bullpen was in rough shape entering the game after a pair of blowout losses but Ryan Kellogg and Ben Hecht came through with a combined 5.1 innings of shutout baseball after starting pitcher Paul Richan maxed out his pitch count in the middle of the 4th inning. Richan was pretty good himself, he just struggled to put guys away.
Both of the runs the Pelicans scored were due to defensive miscues by Lynchburg, first a a fielding error by their right fielder, then a wild pitch.
Kevonte Mitchell threw out a runner at the plate to end the game.

A first half stoppage time goal seemed to have turned the tables in a match dominated by Toronto FC up until that point. A beautifully executed long pass over the top of the defense from Andrew Gutjahr, after Aleksandar Katai forced a turnover, found CJ Sapong streaking the other way. Sapong, with an equally impressive touch to gather the ball subtly chipped the ball past goalkeeper Alex Bono to level the match at 1-1.
The Fire took the lead in the 62nd minute. A sloppy TFC pass near midfield started the Fire on the counter with Dax McCarty feeding Katai on the run up the left side. Katai's cross found Nemanja Nikolic in front of the net for the Fire's second goal.
Toronto tied the match in the 76th minute when Jonathan Osorio headed in Jozy Altidore's service to the far post.

William Barr is a flat out liar and a traitor to his oath; Addendum,www.chicagonow.com,Sponsored,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-board-tirade/2019/04/william-barr-liar/,"Tweet By Bob Abrams , Sunday at 10:04 am
In an effort to keep my posts down to about 500 words, arbitrary cuts must be made. I usually stop writing after about 700-900 words, and then the cuts begin.
Last week I posted a piece entitled I s Robert Mueller the worst investigator on Earth or is William Barr a flat out liar and a traitor to his oath ?
A couple of readers asked why I had left out this or glossed over that and I replied to them with the above explanation; arbitrary cuts.
There's a lot about William Barr that disqualifies him from his current position, but his lack of qualification makes him a perfect fit in this administration.
There were a couple of things mentioned by readers that had been cut, and each one was a story in itself. While they help flesh out the story of William Barr, they also raise more questions than they answer.
One of those things involves a man named Tyler McGaughey, William Barr's son-in-law. Mr. McGaughey is now working for Donald Trump.
It's not clear what Mr. McGaughey's job entails, but I believe that it involves the Russia investigation and limiting it's release to the public.
Barr's daughter, Mary Daly is also a senior Justice Department official.
In his testimony before Congress, Barr said that he would present as much of the Mueller report as legally possible. If his 3-1/2 page summary of Mueller's 400-page report is any indication of Barr's intent, he was clearly lying to Congress.
It's worth mentioning here that each section of the Mueller report was already summarized by Mueller's team, all of whom spent significantly more time with the report than did Barr over the weekend during which he wrote his little white wash.
Mueller's team wrote those summaries mindful of what would be appropriate to release to the public, so any redactions made by Barr would only be for the purpose of hiding material that would be substantially harmful to Donald Trump.
Barr also told Congress that it would be his intention to protect Americans from discrimination against preexisting conditions. He said that the Affordable Care Act was the law of the land and that he would defend it.
Well, Mr. Barr, how is that you are now suing to have the entire Affordable Care Act declared unconstitutional? How is it that you are now OK with 20 million Americans being suddenly deprived of health insurance?
Remember that if the ACA is struck down now, Trump has already said that health care won't be taken up again until 2021, AFTER the 2020 election.
The first question we must ask ourselves is this: Was Barr lying to Congress when he said that he would defend the Affordable Care Act or has he succumbed to pressure from Trump?
The second, and possibly most important question is this: Does it really matter if Barr is a flat out liar or just another corrupt Trump toady?

Chicago Citywide Literacy Coalition Wins Adult Literacy XPRIZE,www.chicagonow.com,Sponsored,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/2019/04/chicago-citywide-literacy-coalition-wins-adult-literacy-xprize/,"Tweet By Gordon Dymowski , Sunday at 10:26 am
Last week, I wrote about the Chicago Citywide Literacy Coalition and their efforts to drive both digital and healthcare literacy in the city. In my previous post, I mentioned that the CCLC focuses on digital literacy as well as workforce development and healthcare literacy. As I mentioned in last week’s post, technology is at the forefront of their activities.
... the Chicago Citywide Literacy Coalition uses a blended model of community-based centers using technology. Although the CCLC does use apps to assist learners in developing their skills, providing a social/interactive environment not only allows those users to thrive but provides them with the support and motivation to stay on track.
The Chicago Citywide Literacy Coalition demonstrates a strong determination to integrate technology, community, and literacy in their work. It was that determination to make an impact that led the CCLC to apply for - and win a milestone award in the Adult Literacy XPRIZE Communites Competition .
As a global leader in designing and operating innovative competition models, XPRIZE focuses on efforts to make a positive impact on the world. With its focus on reaching the underserved adult learner community ( only 2 million of the 36 million adults in need are served by existing adult literacy program s [1] ), the CCLC thought the Communities Competition would be a method to increase its capacity. Although the CLCC believes it is only reaching ten percent of its total capacity, it also sees huge potential in integrating technology solutions for adult learning and encouraging the development of mobile apps to allow people to improve their skills independently. As a result of being a competitor in the Adult Literacy XPRIZE Communities Competition, next week CCLC will give individuals a code to download and use the Learning Upgrade mobile app to use for building their literacy skills.
With three million adults in Illinois lacking education beyond high school, the economic and social benefits of the CCLC’s work cannot be understated. It is expected that more than 67% of jobs in Illinois will require postsecondary education or training by 2020. Adult literacy and education can provide $2.50 in return for every $1.00 of Illinois tax money spent, saving the state millions and reducing the need for state-funded programs like Medicaid, corrections, housing unemployment, SNAP, and public aid.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday sought to delay Brexit before June 30 to avoid a disorderly withdrawal week, though an integral leader of the bloc suggested an even longer pause in the divorce proceedings.
The issue over timing is vital since Britain is set to leave the EU unless an agreement is reached at a Brussels summit set to take place. Get alerts:
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, May agreed to make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections May 23-26 if necessary and requested for an extension before the end of June. An earlier British petition for a delay before June 30 was rejected amid increasing aggravation about the turmoil in London from EU leaders. There also having been rising fears that the more the U.K. stays, the longer it will block EU policies and strategies.
Tusk suggested an extended time frame Friday and he urged that the 27 remaining EU nations to provide the U.K. a flexible expansion of around a year to ensure that the state doesn’t depart the bloc in a disorderly way that may undermine commerce and hurt many EU nations.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren’t authorized to disclose data before it had been made public.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. would need to participate in the elections to the European Parliament, something May has long argued wouldn’t be in both sides interest.
The elections pose a considerable block since Britain will be expected to take part, if it’s still an EU member, so its individuals have representation in the European Parliament. Officials fear that the validity of institutions could be jeopardized if the population of a member nation is not involved in the process.
EU nations have observed almost three years of political anxiety within Brexit.
French President Emmanuel Macron has thus far seemed about giving more time to Britain, saying the bloc can’t be held hostage from Britain’s political deadlock over Brexit.
Additionally, there are issues in Europe that some British politicians who want to provoke some”no-deal” Brexit might try to make trouble from in the bloc, a path that outspoken Brexit urge Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested Friday.
He tweeted that”if a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU, we should be as hard as you can.”
Even the Conservative Party lawmaker indicated using Britain’s positon block the formation of an EU military to veto any EU funding gains, and allow it to be impossible for Macron to drive on EU integration.
One EU diplomat stated that there was rising concern among member countries they would not have”genuine alliance” in Britain, which could hurt the method by which the bloc works.
“There are important choices to be taken after EU elections,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to remark on closed-door meetings preparing for next week’s summit.
There were worries about a chaotic Brexit on April 12.
There are worries that an abrupt departure with no deal could result in economic slowdown and a breakdown in medical and food supplies as boundary tests and tariffs are added instantly. Traffic jams may be expected on highways.
The intricate maneuvering on dates stems as Britain’s Parliament considers legislation designed to stop such a”no-deal” departure.
The upper House of Lords of britain is set to resume discussion over the measure Monday. It was endorsed prior to the House of Commons by one vote.
It is the first country to try to leave the bloc, and also the formal”Article 50″ depart process hasn’t been analyzed before. All 27 nations have to agree on an expansion.
The Europeans would favor if it is going to leave, that Britain not participate in the European Parliament elections even. April 12 is the final day for Britain to indicate whether it will field candidates.
May said in her correspondence that Britain is ready if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim to begin preparations for the elections. She stated she is making the preparations even though she thinks it isn’t in the pursuit of Britain or the EU for her country because it’s currently leaving the bloc, to take part.
May’s withdrawal program, reached with the EU over more than two decades of negotiations, has been rejected by the U.K. Parliament 3 days.
She’s now looking for a compromise in a collection of discussions with his deputies and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, together with hopes of opposition support to get a divorce bargain that is new.
The talks don’t appear to be advancing. Even the Labour Party said in an announcement Friday it’s”disappointed” that May’s team is not offering real shift.
“We do need change if we are going to undermine,” said Keir Starmer, the celebration’s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, stated, including that Labour wants the talks to last.
May plans if a strategy will emerge a series of votes in Parliament to see, if the discussions do not do the job.
Ideas include after it renders the bloc, in addition to the chance of a referendum maintaining Britain in a customs union with the EU. There is resistance from Brexit backers from the Party to those choices.

Stocks rose Friday morning after a better-than-expected report on U.S. projects eased worries that the market is slowing too sharply.
More to the point, it gave encouragement to economists that stated that the market can continue to grow and the jobs report, which was shockingly weak of the month, may happen to be an aberration , albeit at a slower rate. Get alerts:
The projects report also hit a happy medium strategists said. It was too low to reevaluate downturn worries nor too large to prod the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. The S&P 500 has climbed every day this week, even though most of the profits were just modest, and it currently sits only 1.6 percent from its most recent album high, that was set in September.
The indicator has been tacking on more gains since shutting out its very best quarter in nearly a decade, even with a 13.1 per cent rise in the first three months of the year. If the indicator ends Friday higher, it would clinch a streak, its maximum in a year and a halfdozen.
Stocks around the globe also have been climbing since the United States and China say they are currently making progress to ease their trade war. President Donald Trump said Thursday the U.S. and China were”rounding the flip” in the talks, which declared Wednesday from Washington.
Challenges still lay ahead such as expectations for earnings reports in years’ pile, however, for the market.
KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, at 10 a.m. Eastern time. Were high. Tech stocks, health care and energy helped direct the way.
JOBS REPORT: after the report of February originally said jobs were added throughout the month, that was sharply under the rate The stronger-than-expected projects report helped concerns about the market. The authorities on Friday revised that number to growth of 33,000.
Average hourly earnings climbed 3.2% in March from a year earlier, which had been weaker than economists’ forecasts. Markets pay careful attention to the numbers because while salaries help workers afford to buy more things, they crimp corporate profit margins.
UPCOMING EARNINGS: Profitability is one of the market concerns as firms lineup to begin reporting their own results weekly.
Analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 to record a nearly 4 percent fall in earnings per share from a year earlier, which would be the first decline since the spring of 2016. The drop in earnings is due entirely to weaker profit margins. Analysts are forecasting that revenue grew nearly 5 per cent for S&P 500 businesses and they held less of every $1 of that revenue as profit than one year ago.
BREXIT WOES: Britain’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5% after Prime Minister Theresa May asked a further Brexit expansion in the European Union until June 30 to provide the U.K. breathing room because it’s currently scheduled to depart the bloc in just one week.
European Council President Donald Tusk suggested a more extended time frame, urging the 27 other EU nations to provide the U.K. a elastic expansion up to a year to be sure that the state does not wreck out of the bloc in a disorderly and expensive way.

“I realized in seeking such an extreme sentence for her, I had denied her the opportunity to prove she could grow, change, rehabilitate and show she was worthy of a second chance. I was wrong about her. And current policies that deny children the opportunity to demonstrate that they can be rehabilitated are also wrong, both legally and morally.”

Courtney Cullison: Oklahoma lawmakers should restore the earned income tax credit
Want to reduce poverty and help working families get ahead in Oklahoma? Lucky us, we already have a great tool — the earned income tax credit (EITC). In 2000, Oklahoma lawmakers created the state EITC as a partner to the federal EITC with bipartisan support. It was a good idea then and it’s still a good idea. The EITC encourages work by supplementing income from low-wage jobs. Our state tax code already includes many deductions and credits for high-income families and businesses; this credit for low -and middle-income families is an important piece in making Oklahoma’s tax code more fair to all taxpayers.

Azam, who is Muslim, specifically pointed to “anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Muslim rhetoric” on the opinion side of Fox News, also owned by Murdoch, ahead of the 2016 election. “It became very profitable to kind of fall in line with some of the anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim rhetoric, and I was affected by that,” he said. Azam’s Sunday comments echo remarks he made to NPR in an interview last month , when he accused the network of ""scaring people"" and ""demonizing immigrants."" He added at the time that Fox News created ""a fervor — or an anxiety about what was happening in our country.” He also told CNN on Sunday that he “wasn't the only one who was troubled” at the company by “the dehumanization taking place in some of the coverage and the opinion shows.” “When you start getting people not agreeing on the facts, I think was troubling for a lot of folks,” he said.

"Republicans to spend millions in effort to split Democrats, Jewish voters: report",thehill.com,Zack Budryk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/437754-republicans-to-spend-millions-in-effort-to-split-democrats-jewish-voters-report,"Republicans to spend millions in effort to split Democrats, Jewish voters: report By Zack Budryk - 04/07/19 01:49 PM EDT
Republican groups reportedly plan to spend more than ever before in an attempt to court Jewish voters who historically vote for Democrats.
The organizations, led by the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), plan to spend over $10 million on the effort, according to Politico.
Republicans hope to exploit rifts in the Democratic Party over support for Israel while depicting President Trump Donald John Trump Chelsea Handler says she went into therapy after Trump's win Will it take more deaths or disaster for Washington to fix immigration and border security? Conspiracy theorists keep their Ginsburg death claims alive MORE as a stalwart defender of the nation, the news outlet added. ADVERTISEMENT
“This strain within the Democratic Party is making those centrist and center-left Jews who care about these issues feel more and more uncomfortable, and with the strength of Donald Trump and the Republican Party on these issues we believe that we’ll be able to bring those folks over to the Republican side,” RJC Executive Director Matt Brooks told Politico.
While Jewish voters have supported Democrats by substantial margins in recent elections, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, who sits on the RJC board, said conditions are right to sway enough Jewish voters to make a difference in key states.
“If you accept that there are sizeable Jewish populations in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, [and] Michigan, the Jewish vote – if we can make additional inroads – can be very helpful in putting you over the top,” Fleischer told the news outlet. “The White House knows that.”

Ilhan Omar 's hijab to threats against the Minnesota Democrat.
""Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this. Folks who imply we’re 'bad' for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language. Talk policy, not personal,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

Ocasio-Cortez was responding to the arrest of a man in New York who is accused of making death threats against Omar.
Prosecutors have said Patrick Carlineo's arrest stems from a phone call he made last month to Omar’s office. ""Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her? She's a f---ing terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her f---ing skull,"" Carlineo allegedly said during the call. Pirro was kept off air for two weeks last month after she suggested that Omar's religious beliefs were at odds with the U.S. Constitution.
""Omar wears a hijab, which, according to the Quran 33:59, tells women to cover so they won’t get molested."" Pirro said on her show, ""Justice with Jeanine.""
""Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?"" Pirro added."

Re: Daily exercise log Weights today: The routine is split into two circuits. After a quick warmup, the idea is to move from one exercise to the next with no rest, except perhaps 10-20 seconds after completing one circuit. I go through each circuit 3 times in a normal workout. However, I've started alternating where I do 6 passes through the first on one day, then 6 through the second on the next. Circuit 1 Curls (alternating two-handed curl bar and individual dumbells in each pass): Reps to failure at high weight immediately followed by reps to failure at low weight. Single-handed row, braced against bench Standing shoulder fly Reps to failure at high weight immediately followed by reps to failure at low weight. Weighted dips Circuit 2 Skullcrushers (two-hand curl bar) Flys (which apparently may also be a contributor to shoulder pain. I may rethink that and dips. But I don't have room for a full olypmic bench and there's no way my wife could spot for me). Reverse-flys Weighted dips horizontal pullups, aka, resting heels on bench w/ back facing floor (basement ceiling too low for a stand, and the door frame down there sucks so I can't use one of those clamp-on things). Sometimes: rep conditioning Quick alternation of dips (take ten pounds off per set until unweighted, then a few more sets) and pull-ups, sometimes going past not being able to do any more dips, switching to push-ups, then continuing until I can only complete one.

Why I am a Socialist,dissidentvoice.org,Todd Smith,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://dissidentvoice.org/2019/04/why-i-am-a-socialist/,"Why I am a Socialist by Todd Smith / April 7th, 2019
For starters, it sounds quite contrarian, antiquarian even, in this day and age, to assert one’s “socialism” in the obvious face of History, which changes its make-up several times a decade, anymore: a dab of recession here, a little more war-paint there.
Well, lipstick traces of all possible revolutions notwithstanding, it seems that most advanced Capitalist nations are, in fact, Socialist to a large degree; ironic that a country like China has emerged as an avatar of Capitalism after over half-a-century hatching a billion-plus plots behind its Great Wall of Communism.
The Man-in-the-Street might say: “Communism? Capitalism? It’s all Chinese to me…” Yet, in the West, it used to be Greek, as in Democracy, that most sacred of secular words, except that the man-in-the-street never got Greek: it all just sounded like “Bar-bar-bar”: a barbaric blur of barliamentary politics.
But I digress… In a nutshell, it seems to me that every Capitalist is a Socialist, yet the vast majority of Socialists are not Capitalists: or, at least, not very good ones. Capitalists, that is. Statistically stated, the so-called 1% depend upon the other 99%, in the same way that any given 1% of society—be they rich, poor, or possibly undecided—depend upon the other 99%, no matter how we slice the socio-economic pie. Ain’t nobody rowing the ship of Civilization alone.
Take away the other 99%, for example, and the remaining 1%–or the uncommonly wealthy—will have to work very hard, indeed. Hey: Who’s going to pick up the trash? Even the possibility of a high standard of living vanishes without the help of the other 99%. In reality, this “help” amounts to the most basic, and extensive, case of Welfare there can be.
The fact of affluence itself is entirely relative: one literally gets rich at the expense of all the others. Which is to say: everyone else foots the bill for one’s uncommon wealth. If you are outnumbered 99 to 1, it stands to reason that you will absolutely require more than a little acquiescence, or “help,” from the other 99 in order to produce and maintain your privileged status. Thus the curious paradox of our system, that the most affluent among us represent the most dependent class.
To restate things a scoche: everyone in society is by definition a Socialist; the Capitalist—strictly a fancy pants kind of Socialist.
Being a Socialist, for me, then, simply involves a basic reality check, which I would rather cash in the denomination of actual affirmation, a positive disposition. If I were to look in the mirror and declare: “Hey there, you Capitalist, you!”—that would be an exercise in sheer denial, a frivolous vain conceit. Narcissists, famously, don’t get along well with others, unless those “others” are mirrors.
Being a Socialist, then, is good for the self-esteem, and I recommend it—although 4 out of 5 doctors may disagree. Much better to recognize yourself as something you are, a social being, than to define yourself in terms of something you are, in all probability, not. Moreover, for the self-aware Socialist, the Future is Today: interest-bearing grave plots, not so much (how now: a Pyramid for your bones?) Co-operation, not Competition, is the engine that runs every society: how things get done. Competition itself is a derivative of Co-operation, and is meaningless outside of a co-operative framework to support it.
In conclusion, I’ll note that describing myself as a socialist does not imply any particular political party affiliation. It merely involves a critical awareness of the way things stand. Democrats and Republicans, for example, are all equally Socialists, too, no matter how many times they hit the snooze button on their “dogmatic slumber.”
Now, ever mindful of the Fairness Doctrine, beyond the landscape of this socialist analysis, I will propose an alternative model for your consideration: If the Owners, the Stakeholders, that exceptional One Percent, are still seen as “Capitalists,” then the rest of us, we Ninety-Niners, might be more accurately labeled as Table Scrapitalists.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Sunday called Democrats “moronic” for attempting to obtain President Trump’s tax returns through legislative action.
Romney added, however, that he wishes Trump would publicly release his tax returns.
“[Trump] said he would be happy to release his returns. So I wish he’d do that. But I have to also tell you I think the Democrats are just playing along his handbook, which is, going after his tax returns through legislative action is moronic,” he said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“That’s not going to happen,” Romney continued. “The courts are not going to say that you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns. He’s going to win this victory.”
VOTER POLL: Do You Support TERM LIMITS For Members Of Congress?
The Mittster did, however, voice his desire for the president to voluntarily release his tax returns like he did when he was accused of not paying taxes for ten years by then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Like the election itself, that didn’t really work out well for Romney and Reid never stopped gloating about it. Harry Reid is proud he lied about Mitt Romney's taxes http://t.co/kCHq01f1uf
POLL: Do you stand with TRUMP in his fight for the border wall?
Good for Romney even if the words burned like acid in his mouth because this authoritarianism has long passed the point of being damned anti-American as the Dems have become enamored with tactics that would have been commonplace in Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union.
Now that they have been deprived of the great Russian collusion delusion, the Democrats are going back to 2016 with their conspiracy-mongering over Trump’s tax returns and intend to get them come hell or high water

Via Politico “Cohen offers Democrats more help, in bid to stay out of prison” :
Michael Cohen is making a last-ditch effort to delay his prison sentence, writing to congressional Democrats to help him stay out of prison in exchange for help in their investigations.
Lawyers for Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, wrote to congressional Democrats on Thursday that their client recently gained access to files seized in a highly publicized FBI raid in 2018 and that he could provide further insights to help in their investigations into Trump’s affairs. The files include more than 14 million documents, the lawyers write, and Cohen would need substantial time to sift through them and make them useful to lawmakers.
Cohen is due to start his prison sentence in May after pleading guilty to a litany of crimes in Washington and New York.
Cohen’s lawyers also asked Democrats to attest that Cohen has been a helpful witness in their investigations into Trump’s dealings.
His lawyers hoped the endorsement from members of Congress could convince federal prosecutors in Manhattan that Cohen is necessary for their investigations, prompting a delayed and reduced sentence.
POLL: Should Crooked Hillary Be Tossed In Jail?
Congress will definitely deliver the hoped-for endorsements to the SDNY simply because their hatred for Trump is so intense that they would probably also sell their own grandchildren into sex slavery were it to advance their jihad to impeach the duly elected president.
Given their complete abrogation of any semblance of moral conduct, expect Nadler, Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and the rest of the mob to take Cohen up on his offer and to wine and dine him in high style with taxpayers footing the bill.

He is also trying to intimidate people into not blowing the whistle on Trump, or exposing his behavior. This is a real-life witch hunt that Devin Nunes has cooked up, and it is all about attacking people who either investigated Trump or released information to the public that was damaging for the president.
William Barr’s credibility is close to zero after his hatch and spin job on the Mueller report, but if he allows Nunes and Trump to weaponize the DOJ for use against people who the president views as enemies, it will be an action that will lead to severe congressional and popular backlash.

If God is addressing the worldwide problem of immigration, who is his spokesperson? by

""Compassion is not weakness, and concern for the unfortunate is not socialism."" —Hubert Horatio Humphrey, A Remark
It’s no one’s fault but it does pose something of a dilemma for citizens trying to impart meaning to current events.
The dilemma presented itself shortly after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was interviewed on The Christian Broadcast Network . The interview took place a few days after Mr. Trump had said it was time to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. During the interview, Mr. Pompeo was asked: “Could it be that President Trump right now has been sort of raised for such a time as this... to help save the Jewish people from the Iranian menace?” A beaming Pompeo responded: “As a Christian, I certainly believe that’s possible,” and he continued by saying he was “confident that the Lord is at work here.”
Although Mr. Pompeo was referring to Mr. Trump’s comments about the Golan Heights, it seems obvious that if God had raised Mr. Trump to take that action, as Mr. Pompeo suggested, he would not have cut him loose with respect to his other activities.
And that brings us then, to the question for this week. Is God making his wishes known through Mr. Trump, or, through Pope Francis? The question is presented because both men addressed similar problems during the last week of March, and had quite different ideas as to how they should be addressed. The problem the two men confronted was immigrants crossing borders.
On March 29, 2019, Mr. Trump announced steps he intended to take to deal with the thousands of immigrants seeking to enter the United States on its southern border. He believed it necessary to announce the new steps because of the unfavorable publicity he was receiving for his treatment of those seeking to enter the United States. Most notable, at the time of his declaration, was the fact that the United States was holding hundreds of men, women, and children who were fleeing terrible conditions in their home countries under a bridge in El Paso, Texas, an enclosure surrounded by fencing and razor wire. According to reports of conditions under the bridge, children were forced to sleep on gravel covered with trash, and they and the adults were sleeping outdoors as nighttime temperatures were as low as 40 degrees. In some instances, the detainees were deprived of sleep, access to medical care, and adequate food and water. Conditions for thousands of other immigrants, though not housed under a bridge, were hardly better.
Mr. Trump attributed the need to impose those conditions on immigrants, to the lack of a border wall to keep the immigrants out. And since there is no border wall and immigrants continue to come in vast numbers, he has said he will withhold aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, countries from which most of the problem immigrants are fleeing. By withholding aid to those countries, he believes, those countries will be more aggressive in restricting the flow of immigrants to the United States. Furthermore, he has often said that if there were a long, impenetrable wall along the southern border, all of the problems posed by illegal immigrants would be solved.
At the same time as Mr. Trump was announcing his proposals for addressing the problem of immigration in the United States, Pope Francis was on a trip to Morocco during which he hoped to support immigrants and establish closer ties between his Church and moderate Islam. In an address in Morocco to 10,000 people, many from sub-Saharan Africa, he told the crowd, “I encourage you to continue to let the culture of mercy grow, a culture in which no one looks at others with indifference, or averts his eyes in the face of their suffering.”
On the return trip to Rome, the Pope spoke with reporters accompanying him on the plane. In response to a reporter’s questions about steps the Spanish government was taking to keep immigrants out, the Pope responded that using barbed wire to keep out those seeking to enter Spain in search of better lives, as the Spanish government had done, was not only cruel, but “not a way to resolve the grave problem of migration.”
One reporter observed that much of Europe was responding to the Pope’s appeals to policymakers and government leaders to protect and help migrants, by doing the opposite. The Pope responded that the leaders were gripped by fear and fear is the beginning of dictatorships. He said that there is all of Europe in which to distribute migrants and it must be done with “an open heart, that accompanies, promotes and integrates.”
Addressing one of Mr. Trump’s favorite solutions to keeping out immigrants, the Pope disputed the value of building walls. He said that one of the phrases from Ivo Andrich’s novel The Bridge on the Drina had always stuck with him. It says that the bridge is made by God with the wings of angels so that men can communicate. Walls, the Pope said, are against communication and are for isolation and, as a result those who close the borders of their country to those seeking better lives “will become prisoners of the walls that they build.”
Here is the question for my readers. If God is addressing the worldwide problem of immigration, who is his spokesperson? Mr. Pompeo’s Trump or Pope Francis? This is the world we live in. This is the world we cover.

For my own part, I’ll say it again: the cheap feel-goodery of this “everyone is beautiful” flapdoodle actually negates the very idea of beauty itself. By definition, beauty is rare ; if everyone is beautiful, then “beauty” has been dumbed down to just another synonym for “common.”
Semantic arguments aside, what really IS rare is people who seriously think blubberous, grotesque manatees such as this are in any way beautiful. Well, aside from the statistically-negligible handful of twisted pervs skulking around those chubby-chaser Pr0n sites, that is."
