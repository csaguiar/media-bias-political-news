It was $17 Billion in 2018 alone.
https://dailycaller.com/201...
Central American Migrants Are Sending $120 Billion Back To Their Home Countries. Central American bank data indicates that the trend will keeping going.
Foreign nationals from three Central American countries that send some of the highest numbers of illegal immigrants to the U.S. are sending back a record amount of money to their home countries.
Immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras sent back a record $120 billion in remittances this decade, according to an immigration expert who spoke to the Washington Examiner using U.N. and Latin American banking statistics. The numbers are expected to keep rising, with immigrants from these three nations having sent $17 billion in 2018 alone, and Central American bank data indicates that the trend will keeping going.
“The sums of money involved are huge, particularly as a share of GDP and personal income in the Central American countries,” Jessica Vaughan, an immigration expert with the Center for Immigration Studies, said to the Examiner. “It offers a big clue as to why these countries are giving only token efforts to stem the tide of migrants to the United States, especially El Salvador and Honduras.”
The issue of remittances — money sent to the home countries of immigrants living and working in the U.S. — has remained a hot topic of debate. U.S. lawmakers have, in the past, proposed legislation that would tax remittances.
One proposal that did not make it through Congress would have taxed these payments at seven percent. If such a tax was levied on the $138 billion all immigrants sent in remittances in 2016, the revenue would have paid for President Donald Trump’s border wall within three years’ time.
However, the enormous size of the remittances play a significant role in the Central American economies — creating an incentive for their governments to not seek reform. Remittances to Honduras and El Salvador made up over 20 percent of their economies, with over 90 percent of remittances sent to these countries originating from the U.S.
While the Trump administration has threatened to withhold millions of dollars in aid to Central American nations for their continued toleration of migrant caravans into the U.S., the aid is just a fraction of the billions in remittances that are sent annually. (RELATED: More Than 400 Illegals Were Caught By Border Patrol In Five Minutes)
At the same time, people from Central America are making up a significant portion of the migrants attempting to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost, while speaking to a congressional committee in February, said the influx of Central American migrants and unaccompanied children — who cannot be quickly deported — has strained her agency’s resources.

XXXX SOMALI MUSLIM REFUGEES' DAYCARE FRAUD $72 MILLION
March 13, 2019
http://www.startribune.com/...
Audit: Fraud in Minnesota's child care program not $100 MILLION but all told, the fraudulent payments amounted to about $72 million over five years, according to the report, which was released Wednesday.
https://www.documentcloud.o...
But the review by the state’s Legislative Auditor also found that fraud in the Child Care
Assistance Program is LIKELY HIGHER THAN the $5 MILLION or $6 MILLION a year that has been documented by prosecutors.
The report, released Wednesday morning, also found a “serious rift” among officials overseeing the program’s integrity at the state Department of Human Services (DHS).
Several Republican lawmakers called Wednesday for the resignation of Carolyn Ham, the DHS inspector general. Sen. Mark Koran, R-North Branch, said the audit “details gross incompetence and mismanagement of the very agency responsible for rooting out fraud.”

"Medieval Diseases Are Making A Comeback: ""It's A Public Health Crisis""",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/medieval-diseases-are-making-comeback-its-public-health-crisis,"Authored by Dagny Taggart via The Organic Prepper blog,
A recent report from Kaiser Health News raises serious concerns about the spread of “medieval diseases” that are resurging in some parts of the US.
“Infectious diseases - some that ravaged populations in the Middle Ages - are resurging in California and around the country, and are hitting homeless populations especially hard ,” the report explains .
Los Angeles recently experienced an outbreak of typhus — a disease spread by infected fleas on rats and other animals — in downtown streets. Officials briefly closed part of City Hall after reporting that rodents had invaded the building.
People in Washington state have been infected with Shigella bacteria, which is spread through feces and causes the diarrheal disease shigellosis, as well as Bartonella quintana, which spreads through body lice and causes trench fever.
Hepatitis A, also spread primarily through feces, infected more than 1,000 people in Southern California in the past two years. The disease also has erupted in New Mexico, Ohio and Kentucky, primarily among people who are homeless or use drugs. ( source ) These diseases will eventually spread to the public.
While the outbreaks are occurring primarily among the homeless, public health officials warn that these diseases can easily spread outside of that population.
Terms like “disaster” and “public health crisis” are being used to describe the outbreaks.
In his State of the State speech in February, California Governor Gavin Newsom warned , “Our homeless crisis is increasingly becoming a public health crisis,” citing outbreaks of hepatitis A in San Diego County, syphilis in Sonoma County, and typhus in Los Angeles County.
“Typhus,” he said. “A medieval disease. In California. In 2019.”
The diseases sometimes are referred to as “medieval” because people in that era lived in squalid conditions without clean water or sewage treatment, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and public health at UCLA. The growing homeless population means more outbreaks are likely.
The report goes on to explain that the homeless population has grown in the past two years, and infectious diseases spread quickly and widely among those who are living outside or in shelters.
“About 553,000 people were homeless at the end of 2018, and nearly one-quarter of homeless people live in California,” the report says .
Sidewalks contaminated with human feces, crowded living conditions, weakened immune systems and limited access to health care are all factors contributing to the proliferation of these medieval diseases.
People living on the streets or in homeless shelters are vulnerable to such outbreaks because their weakened immune systems are worsened by stress, malnutrition. and sleep deprivation. Many also have mental illness and substance abuse disorders, which can make it harder for them to stay healthy or get health care. ( source )
Dr. Glenn Lopez, a physician with St. John’s Well Child & Family Center, who treats homeless patients in Los Angeles County, described what conditions are like for people living on the streets.
“The hygiene situation is just horrendous. It becomes just like a Third World environment where their human feces contaminate the areas where they are eating and sleeping,” he said . Don’t be fooled into thinking you are safe from these diseases.
Those infectious diseases are not limited to homeless populations, Lopez warned. “Even someone who believes they are protected from these infections are not.”
At least one Los Angeles city staffer said she contracted typhus in City Hall last fall. And San Diego County officials warned in 2017 that diners at a well-known restaurant were at risk of hepatitis A.
There were 167 cases of typhus from Jan. 1, 2018, through Feb. 1 of this year, up from 125 in 2013 and 13 in 2008, according to the California Public Health Department . ( source )
Typhus is a bacterial infection that can cause a high fever, stomach pain, and chills. It usually can be treated with antibiotics. Outbreaks are more common in overcrowded and trash-filled areas that attract rats. Clusters of the flea-borne disease were reported in downtown Los Angeles and Compton last fall. Health officials said they also have occurred in Pasadena, likely due to people feeding stray cats that are carrying fleas.
In February, the county announced another outbreak in downtown Los Angeles that infected nine people, six of whom were homeless. After city workers said they saw rodent droppings in City Hall, Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson briefly shut down his office to rip up the rugs, and he also called for an investigation and more cleaning. ( source )
There were 948 cases of hepatitis A in 2017 and 178 in 2018 and 2019, the state public health department said. That outbreak killed 21 people.
Hepatitis A is caused by a virus and is usually transmitted when people come in contact with feces of infected people. Most people eventually recover on their own, but the disease can be very serious for those with preexisting liver conditions.
Pneumonia and tuberculosis also occur among homeless populations, but are more often seen in shelters. Infectious disease outbreaks are a public health disaster.
Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer for Seattle and King County , Washington, said the infections around the country are not surprising. The lack of attention to housing and health care for the homeless and the lack of bathrooms and places to wash hands are contributing to the problem, he explained.
“It’s a public health disaster,” he said . He has seen shigellosis, trench fever, and skin infections among homeless populations in his region.
“It really is unconscionable,” said Bobby Watts, CEO of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, a policy and advocacy organization. “These are all preventable diseases.” These diseases will become a widespread problem if the SHTF.
If outbreaks like these are beginning to spread among the population now, can you imagine what things will be like if the SHTF?
If you think it can’t happen here, you’d be mistaken.
Just take a look at what happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit . Selco has outlined – in tragic detail – what life was like after SHTF after the Balkan War of the 90s.
In the article Venezuela Faces the Return of Forgotten Diseases , Jose explained that tuberculosis, diptheria, ehrlichiosis (a tropical variation of Lyme disease), and leishmaniasis are spreading quickly and are hard to treat due to the lack of medication and proper nutrition.
As Lizzie Bennett explained in Disease: 10 Conditions That Will Become Far More Common After A Collapse , “Many diseases are opportunists, they will surface at a time the conditions are right for them to flourish and most often this is at a time when humans really could do with concentrating on other stuff.” She goes on to outline ten diseases (typhoid is one of them) “that will make their presence felt after a major, long term, disaster be it war, societal collapse or in some cases even an economic downturn.”

"'Motel 6' To Pay $12 Million After Giving ICE Info On 80,000 'Latino-Sounding' Guests",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/motel-six-pays-12-million-after-giving-ice-information-80000-latino-sounding-guests,"0 SHARES
More than a year after Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson launched a lawsuit against Motel 6 when it was discovered that several locations gave information on thousands of guests to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without warrants, the hotel chain has agreed to a $12 million settlement .
AG Ferguson said on Thursday that Motel 6 shared the information of around 80,000 guests in Washington state between 2015 and 2017, according to NPR . Ferguson added that the lists resulted in targeted investigations of many guests with Latino-sounding names, and that ICE had questioned, detained or deported people as a result of the disclosures.
""ICE agents would circle the names that looked Latino-sounding and ran those names through a database and then would detain individuals based on those random checks,"" Ferguson told NPR 's Scott Simon last January .
The hotel chain has also signed a legally binding, nationwide commitment to stop sharing guest information without a warrant.
""Motel 6's actions tore families apart and violated the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,"" said Ferguson in a statement .
Motel 6 told NPR in an emailed statement that it would ""continue to enforce its guest privacy policy, which prohibits the sharing of guest information except in cases where a judicially enforceable warrant or subpoena is present, or local law requires this information.""
""The company has also implemented a system of additional controls to ensure corporate oversight and compliance in cases where law enforcement requests are made.""
The Phoenix New Times first uncovered the practice in September 2017 when reporter Antonia Farzan investigated two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix.
"" We got a tip that this was happening, started talking to local immigration attorneys and definitely kept hearing from people that this was a trend ,"" Farzan told NPR's Ari Shapiro at the time. ""They didn't really know what was behind it but that they kept seeing people get picked up at Motel 6.""
Following initial media reports, Motel 6 released a statement saying that the practice had been discontinued and that it would issue a directive to each of its locations to clarify ""that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists to ICE."" The hotel said at the time that the practice was implemented ""at the local level without the knowledge of senior management."" - NPR
Ferguson's statement on the settlement detailed several cases in which guests were detained and deported.
""ICE agents approached him in the hotel's parking lot, detained him and deported him some days later,"" adding ""The man was the sole provider for the household, and his wife is currently struggling to support their toddler and four other children.""
Some might argue that's the risk one takes when residing in a country illegally.
ICE agents in Phoenix would reportedly perform ""knock and talks"" at the locations after receiving the guest lists - in which officers would show up at the hotel without a warrant, knock on doors, and attempt to gain entry into hotel rooms to make arrests. Tags "
"Trump On Tax Returns: Law ""100 Percent On My Side""",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/trump-tax-returns-law-100-percent-my-side,"0 SHARES
President Trump on Friday said that the law is ""100 percent"" on his side in an longstanding battle with Democrats over his tax returns.
Trump, who has agreed to ""absolutely"" release his returns once they are no longer under IRS audit, told reporters ""Hey, I’m under audit. But that’s up to whoever it is. From what I understand the law is 100 percent on my side."" President Trump: ""From what I understand, the law is 100% on my side"" in battle with Democrats over release of tax returns. https://t.co/eaFJf8g2ry pic.twitter.com/2fbEvRLQqT — The Hill (@thehill) April 5, 2019
That's not good enough for Congressional Democrats
Wednesday evening Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-MA) said Wednesday evening that he had filed a formal request with the Treasury to obtain six years' worth of the president's tax returns , putting Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the hot seat.
"" [The] request tests Mnuchin’s oath of office: whether Mnuchin will faithfully execute the laws of the United States, or whether Mnuchin will bend to the will of the president ,"" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who testified before Congress in February about Trump's tax returns.
When asked on Thursday if he would instruct the IRS to withhold his returns, Trump said ""They’ll speak to my lawyers and they’ll speak to the attorney general.""
The IRS has stated that audits don't preclude people from releasing their own tax information, while House Democrats are attempting to use a provision in the federal tax code which allows the chairmen of Congressional tax committees to ask for tax returns for examination in a closed session.
The law says that the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" the documents for nonpublic examination - a virtually useless requirement given Capitol Hill's pervasive leaks.
Pushback
Several Key Republicans stand opposed to Neal's request, including Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas and Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.
"" Weaponizing our nation’s tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans’ privacy rights ,"" wrote Brady in a Wednesday letter to Mnuchin. ""As you know, by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns. ""
Key Republicans are critical of the request. The top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), argued in a letter to Mnuchin Wednesday that the request is “an abuse of the tax-writing committees’ statutory authority,” and he said it weakens Americans’ right to have their personal information kept private.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Thursday that courts have ruled that congressional requests for information need to have legitimate legislative purposes, and Democrats have fallen short on that front.
“They don’t have a purpose,” he said. “All they have are a lot of excuses.” - The Hill
Senator Lindsey Graham, on the other hand, suggested that all 2020 candidates should be requred to release their tax returns. Sen. Lindsey Graham: ""I think you should release your tax returns, if you're running for president in 2020."" Lawmakers split as they respond to Pres.

Texas House Speaker drops constitutional carry bill after gun rights activist shows up at his home | TheHill,thehill.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/437665-texas-gop-leaders-drop-constitutional-carry-bill-after-gun-rights,"Texas House Speaker drops constitutional carry bill after gun rights activist shows up at his home By Owen Daugherty - 04/05/19 08:37 PM EDT Texas's Republican House Speaker on Friday moved to drop the state's ""constitutional carry"" legislation after a gun rights activist showed up at his home to push for the bill. Dennis Bonnen said the bill was ""dead"" after Chris McNutt, the executive director of Texas Gun Rights, appeared at his home to advocate for the controversial legislation that would allow Texans to carry firearms without a license, The Dallas Morning News reported . McNutt, according to the outlet, drove 50 miles south of Houston last Wednesday before turning up at Bonnen's house to question why the legislation wasn't moving forward faster. The paper reported that McNutt had posted rants on Facebook about the lack of movement on the bill prior to driving to Bonnen's house. Bonnen said McNutt's decision to show up at his house unannounced was a demonstration of “insanity” and called him an ""overzealous advocate for criminals to get a gun."" McNutt also reportedly visited the homes of GOP state representatives Dustin Burrows and Four Price. Bonnen said his home has since been put on surveillance by the Department of Public Safety for his protection. ""If you want to talk about issues and you want to advocate, you do it in this building. You don’t do it at our residences,"" Bonnen said, according to the local news outlet. ""Threats and intimidation will never advance your issue. Their issue is dead."" McNutt called Bonnen’s decision to nix the legislation a ""deliberate overreaction."" ""If politicians like Speaker Dennis Bonnen think they can show up at the doorsteps of Second Amendment supporters and make promises to earn votes in the election season, they shouldn't be surprised when we show up in their neighborhoods to insist they simply keep their promises in the legislative session,"" McNutt told The Dallas Morning News. The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Jonathan Stickland (R), had remained pending in the House Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee for four months into the legislative session, according to the paper. Most Popular"

By April 5, 2019 5:34 pm CEST 14 Image: Minecraft
Minecraft is continuing to smash through barriers as the most popular game of all time and is today celebrating a new achievement. The PC version of the game has now been purchased over 30 million times since it was launched 10 years ago in 2009.
This latest milestone continues the amazon success story of Minecraft. Microsoft purchased its developer Mojang in 2014 and by then Minecraft was already half a decade old an extremely popular. Considering the shelf-life of some culture changing games, it was a fair argument to suggest Microsoft entered too late and the game’s popularity would soon decline.
Of course, that never happened as Minecraft has continued to grow and thrive under Microsoft’s wing. The company has expanded the scope of the game with the launch of Minecraft Education and sales have continued to soar of the back of continuous content-rich updates.
Just last year, Mojang announced Minecraft had 91 million active users, the most it ever achieved. Since launching a decade ago, the game has sold more than 154 million copies. It is comfortably the most popular game of all-time.

In other news, the Bedrock update edition of Minecraft (Xbox One version) is now available to subscribers of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass services. The game is now available on the platform that allows access to hundreds of titles for $9.99 per month. It is worth noting the game usually retails for $19.99 on Xbox One.
As you may know, Minecraft on Xbox One also supports Cross Play. This is a feature that lets users on mobile, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch all play the game inter-connected."

Lately, a great deal of attention has focused on the Trump administration’s struggles in court. One widely cited database at New York University notes that the administration has won fewer than 6 percent of court cases relating to its deregulatory efforts. While many involved minor issues such as delayed implementation deadlines , hiccups like these could be an omen that greater challenges lie ahead for Trump’s red tape cutters.
The courts have been right to chastise the administration for failing to follow the law in some cases, but the worst agency abuses continue to fly under the radar — and they aren’t unique to this administration.
Trump’s legal woes center around an influential federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act . Prior to the APA’s passage in 1946, regulators lacked a formalized process to follow, write and put into effect rules. Many regulations were crafted in secret without public input.
The APA’s most famous provision gives courts the authority to forbid “arbitrary” and “capricious” regulatory acts. Regulators typically have to, at a minimum, explain their actions in a reasoned way and seek input from the public, often through soliciting comments from citizens and businesses. If regulators don’t, their rules can be vacated by judges.
The APA makes it harder to regulate. But, as the Trump administration is learning, it also makes deregulation harder by forcing it through the same process for new regulations. In fact, this was a key reason mid-20 th century legislators rallied around the law.
After President Franklin Roosevelt passed away, Democrats worried that his New Deal-era reforms would be in jeopardy should a Republican win against the far less popular Harry Truman in the 1948 presidential election. Democrats — originally opposed to APA-style barriers to new regulations — changed their minds when they realized the same procedures could lock in existing regulations.
Given this history, the near-relentless growth in post-APA federal regulation should surprise no one. By virtually every measure, regulation has increased dramatically. Just look at staffing levels at federal agencies, budgets , page counts in the Code of Federal Regulations and Federal Register, or restrictive words in regulatory text.
The APA’s limits on arbitrary and capricious regulation are sensible. In fact, traditionally this has been an easy bar for federal agencies to overcome. One estimate put the typical administration’s win rate in related cases at 70 percent , far better than Trump’s record.
This could be a sign the courts are stepping up their oversight, which would be a welcome development because historically, courts have done far too little to combat arbitrary regulations. To this day, judges continue to overlook much larger regulatory shortcomings than delayed implementation deadlines or a lack of public comments.
One such area is federal agency economic analysis. Judges increasingly view regulators’ economic analysis as a part of the basic packet of evidence explaining agency decision making. For example, in the 2015 Michigan v. EPA case, the U.S. Supreme Court chastised the Environmental Protection Agency for focusing on benefits while refusing to consider costs when determining whether a regulation was needed to address hazardous air pollutants from power plants.
But if subpar economic analysis — particularly analysis that ignores critical costs and benefits — is a sign an agency is acting arbitrarily, then countless executive branch regulations, including and beyond the EPA’s, are on precarious legal ground.
Why? As far back as the mid-19 th century , a basic principle of economics has been to account for the unseen consequences of a policy, and not just those outcomes that are visible and measurable by the analyst. If a regulation forces a company to spend $1 million on regulatory compliance, this is an obvious “seen” cost. But there is an unseen cost as well: Some of the resources going toward compliance would have been invested and grown into something else.
There are unseen benefits, too. Regulations sometimes stimulate investment, the returns to which grow over time. The farther into the future we look, the more important the unseen costs and benefits become.
While some regulator economic analyses — those that focus exclusively on financial benefits and costs — account for these unseen effects, those accompanying social regulations (rules that relate to health, safety, and the environment) tend to ignore them entirely. This system-wide failure hurts people in the future most, since the unseen consequences of policy fall predominantly on them.
Trump’s red tape cutters are learning some hard lessons. Perhaps his administration is receiving more scrutiny in court than is typical. That may seem unfair, but in fact judges should expand their reviews to include supporting economic analyses, and the unseen costs and benefits that go systematically overlooked by regulators. If that doesn’t rise to the level of arbitrary and capricious, what does?

Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., changed Senate rules to shorten debate time for certain judicial and executive branch nominees. OGphoto/Getty Images Copied
Most people agree that our system of government depends on an informed, participating citizenry. It can be hard enough to understand what Congress is doing, but it’s even harder to grasp how Congress operates.
And yet, rules that govern how things get done often determine what those things end up being. As such, it’s very important that Americans understand how the Senate majority just changed—and hopefully, improved—the process for debating the president’s nominations.
Senate Republicans on Wednesday, in a pair of 51-48 votes almost entirely along party lines, revised one part of that process. The move will expedite the confirmation process for President Donald Trump’s district court nominees and sub-Cabinet posts at federal departments and agencies.
The Constitution doesn’t say much about this process, only that the president needs the Senate’s “advice and consent” before he can appoint someone he has nominated.
Then the Constitution gives the Senate authority to establish “the rules of its proceedings.” In other words, the Constitution assigns this role to the Senate, but without telling the Senate how to do it.
The process of the Senate evaluating nominees and deciding whether to give its consent is often called the confirmation process, and it operated pretty smoothly for nearly two centuries.
But as the federal government grew in size and power, the appointment of those who lead it has become more important and, therefore, more contentious.
Though designed to be the weakest branch, the judiciary has in recent decades become the strongest. Its power to determine what our laws mean is magnified because judges do not have limited terms. Once they are appointed, they serve until they decide to leave, an average of nearly 25 years.
As a result, the judicial confirmation process has become particularly difficult. Until the past couple of decades, 96% of federal judges were confirmed without even a roll call, or recorded, vote, and 97% had no opposition at all.
Those days are gone.
Trump is making significantly more judicial nominations—and the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings for far more of them—than under the previous five presidents.
Final confirmations by the full Senate, however, are off the pace. The cause is an organized campaign, utilizing several specific tactics, by Democrats and their liberal allies to make the rest of the process as slow and cumbersome as possible.
Senate Republicans have now neutralized one of those tactics.
Senate Rule 22 provides for a process to invoke cloture, or end debate, which is necessary before the Senate can vote on confirmation.
Even when the Senate votes to bring debate to a close, however, Rule 22 allows up to 30 more hours of debate.
Democrats had abused that part of the Rule 22 process. First, they refused to shorten that 30-hour period of debate even for nominations they didn’t intend to oppose. Second, they almost never actually went to the Senate floor and debated the nomination being considered.
That was just empty time, with the clock ticking for no purpose other than delaying the inevitable. Nominations that would have been confirmed in a few hours took several days.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave Democrats a final opportunity to dial back such obstruction. The Kentucky Republican brought up a resolution to shorten post-cloture debate for most nominations with limits very similar to those the Senate voted 78-16 to adopt for the 113th Congress (2013-14).
Democrats supported those limits when they ran the Senate under President Barack Obama, but filibustered them now that they are the minority under Trump.
On Wednesday, McConnell achieved the same reform in a different way. He proposed lower limits on post-cloture debate, not in the form of a written resolution, but as a “point of order,” or a question of procedure that required an answer from the Senate’s presiding officer.
The full Senate then voted on whether to endorse the presiding officer’s decision. McConnell used this approach because it could not be stopped by a filibuster the way the resolution had been the day before.
Remember, that is the very last step before a final confirmation vote. The Senate has already voted, often overwhelmingly, that it wants to end debate. Making that final period of available debate a little shorter is not, in the big scheme of things, a significant step.
It can, however, have a significant impact. When similar debate limits were in place in 2014, the Senate confirmed 89 judicial nominations, the second-highest annual total in American history.
Even if Democrats continue forcing the Senate to use the formal Rule 22 process to end debate, the Senate will be able to do so for more nominees in a shorter period of time.
Today, 142 positions across the federal judiciary are vacant, the highest number since June 1991. Of those vacancies, 90% are on the U.S. District Court, the lowest level of the judiciary, where every case must begin.
No business or organization could function properly if 17% of its workforce was absent, yet that is the condition of the federal judiciary today.
The bottom line is that the Senate’s process for considering nominations has become too divisive and subject to abuse. The judiciary, and the American people who depend on it, suffer as a result.
While controversies can arise about an individual nominee here or there, the process must be less cumbersome for the large majority, who should be easily confirmed.
Republicans have, in effect, opened one of the gates that have kept the process backed up. They need to seize this opportunity so that the government that Americans elected in 2016 can function as it should. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal More on This Issue "
Economic Freedom Is the Way Out of Extreme Poverty,www.heritage.org,"Patrick Tyrrell, Josh Cosby",04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.heritage.org/international-economies/commentary/economic-freedom-the-way-out-extreme-poverty,"Economic Freedom Is the Way Out of Extreme Poverty Apr 5th, 2019 1 min read Commentary By Josh Cosby Spring 2019 member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation Data show that countries that embrace economic freedom outperform others in reducing extreme poverty. Chaiyaporn Baokaew/Getty Images Copied
A recent report by McKinsey Global Institute contains a startling fact.
From 1990 through 2013, an estimated 1,122,000,000 people escaped extreme poverty—defined as subsisting on less than $1.90 per day—in the 71 developing countries covered by the report.
Of those individuals, an estimated 1,057,000,000—about 95 percent—lived in just 18 countries.
Interestingly, these are the 18 countries that the report labels “outperforming emerging economies,” based on their rapid and sustained economic growth.
Two of the outperformers, China and India, account for most of those escaping poverty.
That’s not surprising given their vast populations. But the other 16 outperforming nations account for the vast majority (158 million people) of the rest, who now enjoy greater prosperity and hope for the future.
Besides sharing a history of rapid and sustained economic growth, the 18 outperforming countries tend to have one other thing in common: They have expanded their degree of economic freedom far more, on average, than the 53 countries defined by the report as “middlers” and “underperformers.”
We measured this using data from the very first year that a country was scored in The Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, which, depending on the country was between 1994 and 2001. We also took Index data from 2013, the year that McKinsey provided numbers on individuals escaping poverty since 1990.
The 18 countries that accounted for 95 percent of the more than 1 billion people escaping from extreme poverty from 1990 to 2013 increased their Index of Economic Freedom scores by an average of 7.14 points through 2013, outpacing the average of 53 countries that fit the criteria of middlers or underperformers for having sluggish economic growth.
The middler/underperformer countries did only half as well in promoting economic freedom.
It just goes to show that the people who are empowered by policies that expand their economic freedom have the best chance of escaping extreme poverty. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal More on This Issue"

The Trump Administration has been increasing the cost of goods from China by increasing tariffs on imports. It considers these tariffs a way of building leverage in negotiations, and of forcing China to change its practices that lead to the transfer of technology from American businesses to Chinese competitors. To date, tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent have been placed on $360 billion worth of cross-border trade between the U.S. and China—artificially increasing the price of thousands of traded goods. REF
While the U.S. and China have yet to reach an agreement and settle the concerns over technology transfer, research shows that the increased cost of trade is having a negative impact on the U.S. economy. It is fair to say that these costs often go unnoticed by most Americans due to the strength and size of the overall U.S. economy. Nonetheless, Americans are paying a higher price for imports. Keeping these tariffs in place or increasing them any further will have lasting negative effects. Removing tariffs must be a priority in any agreement with China. The Cost of Tariffs
Though the Trump Administration’s efforts are an attempt to balance the commercial relationship between the U.S. and China, the ongoing dispute is not without costs. Since early 2018, the Administration has increased tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of imported goods globally, including solar-panel parts, washing machines, steel, aluminum, and certain products specifically from China. REF Of this $300 billion, roughly $250 billion worth are specifically on goods from China.
China has retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. exports. For now, the U.S. has suspended the increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports until further notice as a part of ongoing negotiations. REF
While the increased cost of imports negatively affects American consumers, it is American importers and exporters who have been facing some of the greatest costs from the dispute with China. President Donald Trump occasionally cites research that estimates that China is paying for 80 percent of the tariffs on Chinese imports. REF This research suggests that producers in China are cutting their production costs, thereby reducing their profits, in order to stay competitive in the U.S. market. However, this research is based on a simple economic model that assumes imports from China are easily substitutable—which is incorrect.
More detailed research by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) points to the contrary and shows that imports are not easily substitutable, China-based producers are not cutting costs, and Americans are paying the full price of tariffs as well as the resulting negative economic costs. REF There has been no significant change in the pre-tariff prices of the imports that have seen a tariff increase over the past year. While higher prices can sometimes lead consumers to find cheaper substitutes, these imports have not been found to be easily substitutable, either. NBER’s research leads to the conclusion that the total cost of tariffs has led to a loss for U.S. consumers and producers worth roughly $68.8 billion. Even after taking into account tariff revenue collected by the U.S. government, the overall economic loss for the U.S. has been estimated at $6.4 billion.
Research by the Centre for Economic Policy Research estimates that in 2018 the U.S. experienced at least $6.9 billion in deadweight loss, a loss in opportunity for Americans, given that importers had to pay a higher price than they otherwise would have in 2017. Producers alone, because of retaliatory tariffs, now face a $2.4 billion-a-month loss in exports. By November 2018, the loss to the U.S. from tariffs had increased to roughly $1.4 billion a month. REF If this costly trading environment was to stay consistent, the U.S. could see a loss of at least $16.8 billion in 2019.
The significant loss for U.S. producers is also supported in other research. The Institute of International Finance estimates that American exporters face higher costs than Chinese exporters. It estimates that the trade dispute with China is costing the U.S. an annual loss of $40 billion in exports. REF The Trade Partnership Worldwide estimates that tariffs on imports from China, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, will cost the U.S. an annual $62 billion over the next several years. REF Weakening Trade and Investment
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since May 2018, the terms of trade with China have been weakening. This means that the price of imports from China has become more expensive relative to exports to China, despite changes in the exchange rate. REF This suggests that Americans have to work more to buy the same amount of goods from China. Average exports to China by the end of 2018 were down 30 percent from 2017. Average imports had increased 3 percent. REF The decreased ratio in the U.S. terms of trade is likely a result of the increased cost of trade from tariffs and uncertainty in the bilateral economic relationship.
Tariffs on trade between the U.S. and China are having a negative effect on investment as well. Perhaps this is because 43 percent of China’s total exports comes from American and other foreign-invested enterprises. REF The Administration’s efforts could potentially lead to an improved investment environment in China. However, according to a recent survey of American and Chinese companies in China, due to recent tariffs, “nearly a fourth are delaying China investments or shifting supply chains out of the US.” REF
Tariffs are having a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Therefore, the Administration must: Remove tariffs as a part of negotiations with China. The U.S. should eliminate tariffs as soon as possible. There is very little research to suggest punitive tariffs are an effective tool in trade negotiations. Understand the harm that tariffs have created. Significant research shows the negative costs that tariffs impose on domestic and international supply chains. The Administration should be aware that its actions could lead to a reversal of decades of progress that the U.S. has made in reducing the cost of trade for Americans. Pursue more effective policies to deal with China. There are other ways to deal with Chinese practices relating to technology transfer that limit the cost to Americans. The U.S. should pursue policies that benefit Americans more than it harms them. Conclusion
Tariffs are a cost not every American can afford, yet virtually every American ends up paying. Furthermore, history has shown that once punitive tariffs are in place, they can be very hard to remove. Chinese commercial practices may warrant a U.S. response but not one that simultaneously harms Americans’ economic prosperity. Policymakers should avoid policies that create more harm than benefit.

Why China’s Intellectual Property Theft Is a Concern for National Security,www.heritage.org,"Riley Walters, Michael Maher",04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/why-chinas-intellectual-property-theft-concern-national-security,"Why China’s Intellectual Property Theft Is a Concern for National Security Apr 4th, 2019 2 min read Commentary By Policy Analyst, Asia Economy and Technology Michael Maher Spring 2019 member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation Temp.Periscope, a Chinese hacker group, has been blamed for cyberattacks that have resulted in the compromise of sensitive material related to military technology. BeeBright/Getty Images Copied
A wide-ranging series of cyberattacks by Chinese hackers has been uncovered by cybersecurity firm Accenture Security’s iDefense.
The hackers’ target, according to The Wall Street Journal ? At least 27 universities located across the United States, Canada, and Southeast Asia.
The connection among most of the affected institutions is reportedly their involvement in research of military-use maritime technology. Some of the schools have been the recipients of Navy contracts, host research hubs, or employ faculty with maritime expertise.
In 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that the same Chinese hacker group, sometimes known as Temp.Periscope, has been a persistent threat with a history of breaching Navy contractors.
Temp.Periscope has been blamed for cyberattacks that have resulted in the compromise of sensitive material related to military technology, including plans to construct a new supersonic anti-ship missile to be deployed by American submarines.
The recent cyberattacks reportedly sought to exploit the relationship between academic institutions and the information-sharing that takes place among them.
Spear-phishing emails containing malware, a common method for cyber-intrusion and information collection, were sent to the targets. The emails were disguised as legitimate correspondence from another affected university.
These types of efforts are anything but novel at this point, and the danger they pose to American national security remains high.
A 2018 indictment by the Justice Department revealed the extent of intrusions by another group of Chinese hackers, whose attacks gained unauthorized access to more than 45 technology companies and U.S. government agencies, stealing hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive information.
This rampant theft of intellectual property is not without its economic costs. Previous estimates suggest that intellectual property theft, including by China, costs the United States billions every year in potential revenue lost, placing strains on U.S. companies and hampering innovation and growth.
The theft of new technologies goes beyond the oft-reported economic concerns and presents a potentially larger national security issue.
The fact that many victims of these cyberattacks are upstream defense resources, such as contractors and universities, is concerning. It’s a reminder that China’s efforts to secure new technology are unbiased.
Because they are unlikely to have the same level of security infrastructure as that employed by some government installations, universities present a unique opportunity for malicious actors to gain access to new technical or industrial knowledge.
As such, universities can be low-hanging fruit for Chinese hackers.
Spending billions of dollars to develop and field new defense technologies, only to have their effectiveness compromised by a data breach, can be costly for developers and for taxpayers.
More importantly, it can endanger U.S. service members who rely on that technological advantage to accomplish their missions safely.
The United States must continue to take the dangers posed by cyberattacks and intellectual property theft seriously.
Encouraging U.S. companies and institutions to identify and secure vulnerabilities in their computer networks is an important step, but the U.S. must also develop and employ more direct deterrents against those actors that engage in cybertheft toward U.S. entities.
Strengthening U.S. defenses against cyberattacks can be a difficult task. Coordinating these efforts across a network of various institutions doesn’t make it any easier.
It remains clear, however, that China’s continuing theft of intellectual property creates economic and security risks that the U.S. cannot afford to leave unmitigated. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal More on This Issue"
Oman: America’s Unique Arab Ally in the Middle East,www.heritage.org,Luke Coffey,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/oman-americas-unique-arab-ally-the-middle-east,"Director, Douglas & Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Luke Coffey oversees research on nations stretching from South America to the Middle East.

More U.S. congressional delegations should visit Oman, and Oman should be a must-stop location for any future Middle East trip by President Trump. Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close
The United States and Oman share many geopolitical challenges, and have had good relations dating back two centuries. The recent announcement that Oman has given the U.S. Navy access to two of its strategic ports at Duqm and Salalah is a timely reminder of the importance of the U.S.–Omani relationship.
What U.S. policymakers often overlook in Middle East policy is America’s bilateral relationship with Oman. The Trump Administration should build on existing relations by conducting senior-level visits to Muscat, placing a renewed focus on ending the war in Yemen, and recognizing Oman as a trustworthy partner in meeting many of the challenges facing the region. An Old Ally
Oman, a relatively small oil-producing kingdom with one of the Arab world’s smallest populations, is one of the oldest countries in the region. Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al-Said has ruled since taking power from his father, with the help of the British, in a bloodless palace coup in 1970. Approximately 75 percent of Oman’s population observes Ibadi Islam—different from Sunni and Shia Islam, which otherwise dominate the region.
The first contact between the U.S. and Oman was in 1790, and the relationship became formalized in 1833 after the U.S. and Oman signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the first bilateral trade deal between the U.S. and an Arab Gulf state. In 1840, Oman sent the first accredited diplomat from the Arab world to the U.S.
Oman became regionally important in a military sense in 1980 when it became the first Gulf state to welcome a U.S. military base.
Today, the U.S.–Omani relationship is broad. Oman’s free trade agreement with the U.S.—its only bilateral trade agreement—has been in force since 2009. In addition to the recently announced port agreement giving the U.S. access to Duqm and Salalah, the U.S. (albeit with advance notice and for specified purposes) has permission to use Oman’s military airfields in Muscat, Thumrait, and Masirah Island. There is also a close military relationship. For example, the Royal Air Force of Oman operates U.S.-built F-16s, and each year around 100 Omani officers are trained at military schools in the U.S.
Although multilateral organizations, such as the Arab League or the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), exist, it is in America’s interest to maintain close bilateral relations with individual countries in the region. Oman is a pre-eminent example, and Muscat brings many important—and in some cases unique—attributes to the table. Specifically: Oman has served as an important interlocutor for the U.S. in the region. This brings an important dimension to U.S. engagement in the region. Since a majority of its citizens are Ibadi, Oman has been able to avoid the sectarian Sunni–Shia fault line that has been the origin of so much violence and conflict in the region. This position has allowed Oman to play a unique behind-the-scenes role in facilitating many diplomatic initiatives in the region. For historical reasons, Oman has a very close relationship with America’s closest ally, the United Kingdom. The current sultan owes his rule to the British. In addition, the U.K. helped Oman to quell the Dhofar Rebellion (1962–1975). There is already very close Anglo–American cooperation in the Gulf, and trilateral U.S.–U.K.–Omani cooperation in the region has strategic benefits for the U.S. For historical and geographical reasons, Oman has a unique relationship with Iran. Under certain circumstances, this relationship could be beneficial to the U.S. Over the years, Oman has helped to secure the release of U.S. hostages in Iran (and also in Yemen). Oman and Iran are the two countries on either side of the Strait of Hormuz. Like Britain, pre-revolutionary Iran provided 4,000 troops to help Oman defeat the Dhofar Rebellion. Often, Oman’s relationship with Iran is misunderstood by policymakers in the West. Publicly, Oman maintains cordial and pragmatic relations with Iran because of the geographical and historical links. Privately, senior officials express the concerns about Iran’s malign activities—which are concerns around the Gulf region. Last year Oman was credited by U.S. officials for enforcing re-imposed U.S. sanctions against Iran. Oman tends to offer an alternative and important point of view inside the GCC. With the Gulf crisis among Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar not ending anytime soon, Oman’s regional views should be seen by the U.S. as a strength, not a weakness. Oman is very cautious, continuously balancing its relations with all countries in the region including both Oman and Saudi Arabia. Oman sees Israel as an important actor for regional stability. This is why Sultan Qaboos hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Muscat last year even though Oman and Israel do not have diplomatic relations. Oman’s foreign minister also met with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Warsaw in February. It is likely that Oman will play a key role behind the scenes in any Israel–Palestinian peace proposal coming from the Trump Administration. Oman is a regional and Islamic leader in preventing radicalism and stopping the flow of foreign fighters. Not a single Omani citizen was known to have joined the ranks of ISIS. REF The Australian-based Institute for Economics and Peace’s Global Terrorism Index for 2018, which assesses the impact of terrorism on countries using a scale of zero to 10, ranks Oman a zero, making it one of only 26 countries in the world—and the only country in the Middle East and North Africa—to achieve this score. REF Building the Relationship
President Donald Trump has stated a preference for stronger bilateral relations with countries around the world rather than dealing with multilateral organizations. He has also committed to restoring America’s credibility in the Middle East. Building on America’s relationship with Oman is an important part of accomplishing these goals. This can be done by: Regular senior-level engagement. Then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited Oman in March 2018. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited in January 2019. Butthe last U.S. President to visit Oman was Bill Clinton in 2000. Muscat should be considered a must-stop location for any future Middle East trip by President Trump. Also, U.S. congressional delegations to Oman are few and far between. More U.S. congressional engagement with Oman would benefit and strengthen the U.S.–Omani relationship. Pursue a free trade agenda. The current steel and aluminum tariffs in place by the United States not only negatively impact the relations with notable American allies like Canada or the U.K., but also smaller ones, like Oman. Over the years, Oman has done much to diversify its economy, and the steel and aluminum sectors have played a key role. Not only are these tariffs bad for the American consumer, they also needlessly complicate America’s bilateral relationships—especially with Muscat. Expand U.S.–Omani defense cooperation to the security sector. Oman has a long and porous border with Yemen, and there have been concerns that Omani territory has been used by Iran to smuggle weapons to the Houthis in Yemen. However, there is no evidence of Omani authorities assisting Iran in its weapons smuggling, or of knowingly allowing it. Anyone who has traveled to the region knows how remote and destitute some areas are. If weapons are in fact making their way to Yemen via Oman, that is an affront to Omani sovereignty. The United States should help Oman with its border security and counterterrorism capabilities. Request that Oman collaborate on freeing U.S. hostages from Iran. Currently, four U.S. citizens are being held hostage in Iran—including Robert Levinson, who has been held since 2007. Because of Oman’s standing in the region, it has been able in a legal and honorable way to arrange the release of U.S. hostages in the past. The U.S. should continue to work with Oman on this very important issue. Explore ways to include Oman in America’s Indo–Pacific thinking. Because of its strategic location on the southeastern section of the Arabian peninsula, Oman sits at the northwestern periphery of the Indo–Pacific region. Historically, Oman has played a key role in the western section of the Indo–Pacific. The U.S. should explore military training opportunities with Oman and other friendly Indo–Pacific partners, such as India, who are focused on security in the region. Push for a political settlement in Yemen. Oman shares a 180-mile border with Yemen. Yemen’s eastern Mahra province is culturally and economically linked to Oman’s western Dhofar province—so Muscat has legitimate concerns about the situation in Yemen.Neither the Houthi–Saleh alliance nor the Hadi government is capable of scoring a decisive military victory in the grueling war of attrition. The longer the Yemeni conflict persists, the more that Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) will benefit from the chaos, and the more dependent on Iranian support the Houthis will be. The Trump Administration should throw its diplomatic weight behind a political settlement that can halt the fighting, meet legitimate Saudi, UAE, and Omani security needs, avert a humanitarian catastrophe, and allow Yemeni factions and the Arab coalition to focus more intensively on fighting AQAP. Conclusion
In a region where many issues are dangerously viewed starkly as “black or white,” Oman’s nuanced and deliberate approach to regional challenges makes Muscat an important voice in the Gulf. As the Trump Administration continues to advance U.S. interests in the Middle East, America’s relationship with Oman should not be ignored. For centuries, Oman has been a friend of the U.S. while serving as an important diplomatic actor behind the scenes. Good relations with Oman will benefit not only the U.S., but also Israel and other allies in the region.

The jobs report shows that the economy continues to be strong, so let’s keep the momentum going. Busà Photography/Getty Images Copied
The U.S. economy is strong and growing, according to the latest jobs report.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released a positive jobs report on March, showing gains of 196,000 jobs, after only 20,000 jobs were created in February. All the while, the U.S. continues to boast an almost record-low unemployment rate, and rising wages for workers.
Notable details of the March jobs report showed the unemployment rate held steady at 3.8 percent in March, and the labor force participation rate was essentially unchanged.
In addition, the U-6 unemployment number, which measured both discouraged workers who aren’t currently looking for work as well as those holding jobs part time for economic reasons, also held at 7.3%.
In addition, the African-American unemployment rate fell from 7% in February to 6.7% in March, teenage unemployment fell from 13.4% to 12.8%, and adult female unemployment fell from 3.4% to 3.3%.
Job numbers from January were revised up from +311,000 to +312,000, and the low 20,000 jobs created in February were revised up to +33,000.
With these revisions, employment gains in January and February combined were 14,000 more than previously reported. After factoring in these revisions, gains have averaged 180,000 jobs per month over the last three months.
Wages also continued rising.
In March, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents to $27.70, following a 10-cent gain in February.
Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 3.2%.
Continuing with the momentum, in a separate report released earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that initial jobless claims not only beat expert predictions, but they haven’t been this low in nearly 50 years.
So where were the jobs gained and lost? Health care: +49,000 jobs. Professional and Technical Services: +34,000 jobs. Food Services and Drinking Places: +27,000 jobs. Construction: +16,000 jobs. Mining: +2,000 jobs. Manufacturing: -6,000 jobs.
While there has been a net gain of 466,000 manufacturing jobs since President Donald Trump took office, last month’s manufacturing numbers present a bit of concern, given the primary losses occurred in the motor vehicle and parts sector.
Trump says he is imposing tariffs in order to save manufacturing jobs, and many of his supporters believe he is right to do this. Some believe it is a brilliant negotiation tactic. But history shows that tariffs do nothing but kill jobs .
While this is certainly not a trend in the jobs numbers, it would be a shame if this continued, and the great progress we have made over the last few years dissipates because of needless trade tariffs.
The jobs report shows that the economy continues to be strong, so let’s keep the momentum going.
We need to keep up the focus on building the workforce, not gambling with jobs as a tactic. We already know what works, and tariffs never have. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal More on This Issue"

American and Chinese negotiators are attempting to reach an agreement that will eliminate, or phase out, China’s commercial practices denounced by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) as a part of its Section 301 investigation—an assessment of how U.S. commercial interests are restricted in China.
The issue of enforcement continues to be a sticking point, potentially delaying any agreement. U.S. negotiators do not believe that China will uphold its end of the agreement unless there is a credible enforcement mechanism. The U.S. has an array of mechanisms with which to address the issues raised by the USTR—mechanisms that do not involve the punitive tariffs that the U.S. has placed on imports from China since July 6, 2018.
The U.S. should be concerned about upholding good investment practices, stopping the theft and proliferation of stolen intellectual property (IP), limiting how governments interfere in markets, and promoting free-market commercial practices instead of focusing on ways to enforce a Section 301 agreement. The Administration should pursue policies that benefit Americans by limiting the actions of bad actors by enforcing the rule of law and working with U.S. partners and allies to promote trade and investment. Current Enforcement Proposal
The USTR began its investigation into China’s acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer on August 18, 2017, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. During its investigation, the USTR found that “China’s policies result in harm to the U.S. economy of at least $50 billion per year.” REF The U.S. has since placed tariffs on over $250 billion worth of imports from China. Despite U.S. efforts through unilateral action against Chinese imports, bilateral negotiations, and international admonishments, China has failed to take any substantive actions to address U.S. concerns, according to the USTR. REF
This suggests that tariffs have failed to force China to change its practices. The current USTR proposal does suggest, however, continuing the use of tariffs as a means for enforcement. The proposal consists of three parts: REF Regular U.S.–China meetings. Monthly meetings are to be held at the office director level, quarterly meetings at the vice-ministerial level, and semi-annual meetings at the ministerial level. Anonymous complaint mechanism. U.S. companies will be able to complain to the USTR if they have reason to believe that China is not living up to certain parts of the agreement. This will inform the USTR on certain trends in China’s practices. Punitive tariffs. The USTR will attempt to solve complaints made by U.S. companies through the regular U.S.–China meetings led by the USTR. If these complaints are not solved either at the office director, vice minister, or ministerial levels, the USTR will impose proportionate tariffs on Chinese imports.
This process is akin to the Section 301 process itself—whereby a domestic industry can file a complaint with the USTR, the USTR determines whether to initiate an investigation under Section 301, and potentially apply punitive tariffs on foreign imports—except without regulatory and congressional oversight. It would grant the USTR significant discretionary power to apply punitive tariffs if there are complaints over foreign ownership restrictions, licensing agreements, technology transfer and acquisition, cyber-enabled theft, and any other terms agreed to in a Section 301 agreement, such as the issue of state subsidies and exchange rates. Enforcement
U.S.–Chinese economic relations do not end with a Section 301 agreement. Enforcing the rule of law, the issue at the center of the Section 301 investigation, should not be constrained and administered through an executive branch agreement. Congress should be critical of any such agreement that would give the USTR too much discretionary authority over U.S.–Chinese commercial relations.
Instead of using tariffs as a mechanism for enforcement, the Administration has a number of options that also limit the negative financial and economic impact on Americans. These include, but are not limited to: Applying sanctions to those who have violated U.S. IP rights. Executive Order 13694 grants the Treasury Department authority to sanction foreign entities that have used cyber-enabled means to acquire U.S. IP. REF In addition, the U.S. should pursue punitive action against those foreign entities that have violated U.S. IP rights abroad through non-cyber-enabled means. REF U.S. sanctions are successful in limiting the abilities of foreign entities doing business abroad. Funding and making use of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). The CFIUS was recently updated to help deal with threats created by China’s foreign investment in the U.S. REF Two important updates are (1) protecting Americans’ personally identifiable information and (2) preventing the creation of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Now it is up to Congress to appropriately fund the committee’s members and their activities. Supporting Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to combat malicious Chinese activity. The DOJ and DOD are actively working to deter and punish those bad actors that threaten the U.S. defense industrial base and commercial businesses. REF DOJ efforts to indict bad actors is important for building legal cases, such as in the case against Huawei Technologies, and potentially applying sanctions against Chinese companies that have violated American IP rights. Encouraging more Section 337 investigations. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930—by allowing the U.S. International Trade Commission to respond quickly on behalf of victims—is an effective tool in limiting the import of goods that violate U.S. IP rights into the U.S. market. REF Increasing opportunities to coordinate with Chinese officials. With the exception of the ongoing Section 301 negotiations, regular economic meetings with China have fallen by the wayside. The USTR’s efforts to restart regular meetings are a good start, but general meetings could limit negotiators’ ability to focus on China’s market liberalization. The U.S. should resume regular meetings on market liberalization in specific sectors. Collecting information on state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The USTR should demand that Beijing become transparent about the financial workings of its SOEs. The USTR and other agencies should collect information on SOEs in order to help build their case against China’s practices in both domestic and international legal action. REF Reforming and supporting the World Trade Organization (WTO). History shows that the U.S. is very successful in winning cases at the WTO. REF The WTO dispute-settlement system requires adjustments, and the Trump Administration should work with free-market allies to implement them. But even in its current state, using the WTO is ideal in building collective action against China’s practices that harms U.S. and foreign companies abroad. A More Effective Strategy
History shows that tariffs are easily levied, come with a cost, and are hard to remove. Given that the tariffs have yet to force China to change its practices, and have had a negative impact on the U.S. economy, REF the Administration should: Remove all tariffs related to Section 301 as soon as possible. This will reduce any further economic burden on American businesses and consumers. Pursue more effective policies toward China. The list above presents a wide variety of measures already being taken that can be further supported, or policies not yet pursued, that could address China’s practices effectively. The U.S. should be more concerned about stopping China’s bad practices instead of finding ways to make China live up to a Section 301 agreement.
Congress has a constitutional obligation to regulate U.S. commercial activity and therefore should: Review any new developments as part of Section 301 negotiations. Congress should be wary of handing over too much regulatory power to the USTR. The USTR’s actions should be held within the limits established under the law. Review existing trade laws. It is important for Congress to understand that any Section 301 agreement is an executive agreement between the USTR and a foreign country. It is not a trade agreement negotiated under the auspices of Trade Promotion Authority. Consider implications of new tariff authorities. An agreement that puts the burden on Beijing to settle U.S. concerns does not require changes to U.S. law or congressional action, but the application of Section 301 has been stretched beyond recognition. Congress should be wary of expanding the use of tariffs, even if under the guise of existing authorities, any further without additional legal authority. Conclusion
U.S. relations with China are anything but simple. This complicated relationship requires complicated actions for dealing with issues like IP theft. The U.S. has a variety of actions it can pursue in dealing with China’s bad practices besides resorting to tariffs.

Summary Relations between Kosovo and Serbia have declined to a critically contentious level. Kosovo’s failed bid in November 2018 to join Interpol reignited Kosovo’s frustration over Serbian efforts to stymie its inclusion in international organizations. In response, Kosovo imposed a 100 percent tariff against goods from Serbia.

This Issue Brief explains how U.S. policy can put the two countries back on a path to normalization and further progress. Key Takeaways After years of progress, relations between Kosovo and Serbia—two small but important countries in the Balkans—have reverted to a critically bad level. If Kosovo and Serbia are to find a way forward, U.S. engagement will be critical. Now is not the time to squander the decades of investment and sacrifice the U.S. has made in the western Balkans since the end of the Cold War. Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close
Relations between Kosovo and Serbia, two small countries in the western Balkans, have recently seen a precipitous decline. Kosovo’s failed bid in November 2018 to join Interpol, the international organization of police and law enforcement organizations, reignitedKosovo’s frustration over Serbian efforts to stymie its inclusion in international organizations. In response, Kosovo imposed a 100 percent tariff against goods from Serbia, as well as from Bosnia and Herzegovina, both of whom voted against Kosovo’s Interpol membership. REF The ongoing stalemate between the two countries has derailed normalization talks and threatens to pull the region back into a descending spiral of conflict, opening new rifts for nefarious actors, such as Russia, to exploit, and could feed regional instability.
If Kosovo and Serbia are to find a pathway forward, U.S. engagement will be critical. The U.S. has invested heavily in the Balkans since the end of the Cold War. Tens of thousands of U.S. service members have served in the Balkans, and the U.S. has spent billions of dollars in aid there—all in the hope of creating a secure and prosperous region that will someday be part of the transatlantic community. The Trump Administration has prioritized re-engagement with the region in its European strategy. Thus far, this fruitful approach has resulted in important policy outcomes including expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the region, support for the Three Seas initiative, and re-evaluation of harmful aid-distribution policies.
Kosovar–Serbian relations are often still a matter of one step forward, two steps back. A new concerted push of U.S. engagement seems essential for dislodging the current ongoing crisis. Origins of the Current Crisis
Following the sectarian wars of the 1990s, Kosovo was placed under United Nations administration in June 1999. On February 17, 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia and has been recognized by 114 countries, including the United States and all of its neighbors in the Balkans except Serbia, as an independent, sovereign nation. REF
While overall relations between the two nations had improved over the past decade, a baseline tension remains a stubborn reality. Recent proposals for a land-swap agreement would have undermined U.S. interests in the region while serving to catalyze greater regional instability. REF Ultimately, these proposals failed to gain significant support in either Kosovo or Serbia.
In early November 2018, Kosovo had initially imposed a 10 percent tariff on products made in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Serbia (exempting international brands). REF Kosovo imposed the tariffs on Serbia over Serbia’s opposition to Kosovo’s recognition as an independent country. According to Kosovo’s Minister of Trade and Industry Endrit Shala, Kosovo imposed tariffs on Bosnia due to “barriers for Kosovo products” inside Bosnia. REF
On November 20, Kosovo’s third bid to join Interpol failed to reach the two-thirds vote required for membership. REF Following the vote, the government in Pristina issued a statement blaming Serbia for the failed bid saying, “Serbia’s wild campaign shows once again its stand against Kosovo and against the idea of normalizing ties.” REF
On November 21, Kosovo raised tariffs on products from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia from 10 percent to 100 percent due to their opposition to Kosovo joining international organizations, including Interpol. Kosovo’s deputy prime minister, Enver Hoxhaj, framed the tariffs as a defensive measure because of Serbia’s “aggressive campaign against Kosovo in the int’l stage.” REF Serbia has argued that the tariffs are a violation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), of which all three nations are parties. European Union officials have confirmed that the tariffs are a “clear violation” of CEFTA. REF The Serbian economy lost $52.3 million between November 21 and December 31 because of the tariffs. REF
Serbia in response has refused to take part in EU-facilitated normalization talks until the tariffs are removed. REF Both the U.S. and EU have urged Kosovo to remove the tariffs; in January 2019, the American embassy in Kosovo issued a statement, which read: We call on Kosovo and other regional stakeholders to demonstrate commitment to normalization; regional peace and stability; and movement on the path to European integration. We reiterate our view that an immediate suspension of the tariff on imports from Serbia and Bosnia is one necessary measure to restore momentum to the Dialogue process. We expect other stakeholders to take constructive measures of their own. REF
Also in January, Ramush Haradinaj, prime minister of Kosovo, published a letter laying out terms for suspending the tariffs. These include the U.S. and EU disavowing support for land swaps, visa-free travel to the EU for Kosovar citizens, implementation of the Kosovo–Serbia energy agreement, and removal of all non-tariff barriers to Kosovar goods in Serbia. REF In addition, Haradinaj called for the Serbian president, prime minister, or foreign minister to publicly state “that all policies and actions of any nature directed against the aspirations of Kosovo as a sovereign state whether applying locally, regionally or internationally have ceased permanently.” REF
In February, a visit by the commander of Iowa’s National Guard was cancelled due to U.S. concern over the tariffs. REF Kosovo has conducted joint trainingwith the Iowa National Guard through the State Partnership Program (SPP) since 2011. REF In the future, the U.S. should avoid linking cooperation with Kosovo in the SPP, a valuable vehicle for further cementing ties, with disagreements over tariffs. Steps for Moving Forward
Heritage Foundation analysts have previously recommended a “five P’s” framework for engagement in the western Balkans: U.S. engagement should be to ensure that the Western Balkans are peaceful, making progress toward the West, and increasingly prosperous. In addition, U.S. policy should seek to make the most of the region’s significant potential. U.S. policy toward the Western Balkans should be pragmatic, and the U.S. should encourage the nations of the region to be pragmatic toward each other. REF (Emphases added.)
Adapting this framework to the current crisis, the U.S. should:
1. Peace Stay committed to NATO’s Kosovo Force (KFOR) mission. Ethnic tensions are increasing in Kosovo, especially in the ethnic Serb areas north of the Ibar River, often stoked by Russia. The U.S. needs to ensure that the KFOR mission, which ensures stability in Kosovo, continues with robust U.S. participation. Continue to support the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) through training. The U.S. should continue to exercise with the KSF—including through the SPP. The U.S. should avoid linking cooperation with Kosovo in the SPP, a valuable vehicle for further cementing ties, to disagreements over tariffs. The benefits of regular exercises far outweigh any temporary political messages communicated by their postponement.
2. Progress Support Kosovo’s inclusion in international organizations. Despite recent tensions, the U.S.–Kosovar relationship remains strong. The U.S. has invested much in ensuring the viability of Kosovo and its increasing worldwide recognition as a sovereign, independent state. During tempestuous times, it is important for the U.S. to stand by its allies. The U.S. should continue to use its diplomatic and political leverage to support Kosovo’s recognition as an independent country, and inclusion in relevant international organizations. Pressure Serbia to recognize Kosovo as an independent sovereign nation. Serbia’s continued failure to recognize Kosovo and its actions blocking Kosovo from international organizations impede progress in the western Balkans, including in Serbia itself. While China and Russia provide support for Serbian non-recognition of Kosovo, the U.S. should employ the tools at its disposal to dissuade Serbia from continuing on this path. Recognizing Kosovo will be a significant step for Serbia toward the West and toward a brighter future.
3. Prosperity Urge Kosovo to remove onerous tariffs. While the tariffs have caused pain to the Serbian economy, Kosovo’s economy is sure to face a negative impact as well. In 2017, Kosovo imported more goods from Serbia than from any other nation, REF and Serbia was the third-largest export market for Kosovar goods. REF Friendship often requires having difficult conversations, and the U.S. should encourage Kosovo to remove onerous tariffs. Economic freedom is the key to the region’s prosperity, and ensuring policies that further this prosperity should remain a centerpiece of U.S. engagement.
4. Potential Urge both sides to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. and the EU share a mutual interest in continuing to push the Kosovar–Serbian relationship toward normalization. The Trump Administration should encourage both nations to return to the EU-facilitated normalization talks. The U.S. should tell Belgrade that the road to integration into the transatlantic community runs through normalizing relations with Kosovo.
5. Pragmatism Encourage western Balkan nations to be pragmatic toward one another. The U.S. should encourage the nations of the western Balkans to put aside historical, cultural, or religious complaints and work constructively to increase trade relations, settle border disputes, and forego inflammatory rhetoric for the sake of stability. The U.S. should encourage all parties to be realistic in their negotiations and to view even partial progress as important steps toward normalization. Conclusion
Now is not the time to squander the decades of investment and sacrifice the U.S. has made in the western Balkans. U.S. policy in the western Balkans that follows the “five P’s” can help place Kosovo and Serbia back on the path toward normalization, overcoming the current crisis, while helping to counteract retrograde influences that seek to exploit the crisis to sow more distrust and division.

I had the privilege of serving in the United States Army for 36 years, retiring in 2016 as a lieutenant general (a three-star). I was a commanding officer three times for a total of six years.
Like all commanding officers, I was responsible for training and equipping soldiers, and was required to enforce good order and discipline of those troops. Good order and discipline are essential to accomplishing the mission—the defense of the nation.
As debate continues over how to handle sexual assaults in the military, and what role a commanding officer should play, I thought it would be helpful to share why commanding officers, such as I was, are critical to solving this problem.
Today, commanders have the authority to refer soldiers under their command to a court-martial if they believe there is probable cause that they committed a crime. But some, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and a group named “Protect Our Defenders,” are now seeking to strip commanding officers of that authority. Instead, they want that authority to be held by a military JAG who, in their judgment, would make a better decision.
This is terribly misguided. Removing accountability from us, and giving that authority to a so-called independent prosecutor, would only serve to weaken the military, its criminal justice system, and, ironically, result in fewer cases going to a court-marital.
I was trained as a warfighter, not a lawyer. But as I rose in rank, I relied on the sound judgment of Army JAGs who advised me on a wide variety of legal issues—the law of war, rules of engagement, contract law, personnel law, acquisition law, administrative law, and criminal law.
Their advice was invaluable, and provided me with information that, combined with other information and experience, helped me lead to the best of my ability.
During combat, commanders have the benefit of getting advice from a host of experts, including experts in intelligence, weather, ordnance, logistics, linguistics, law, and more.
Our military is the best-trained military in the world. Our leaders are highly intelligent, adept, and agile, and are required to operate on and off the battlefield in a complex and ever-changing environment.
Today’s successful military leaders make thousands of critical decisions each month, from the unseen to the widely known. We try to get it right all the time—though sometimes we fail, because we are human. But we exist in an ecosystem where accountability is part of our DNA, because the defense of the nation is at stake. The American people deserve no less.
The pinnacle of a military officer’s career is when he or she assumes command. As Richard Swain and Albert Pierce write in their seminal work on military leadership, “ The Armed Forces Officer ”:
Command is the acme of military leadership, the goal toward which officers most often aspire, and the route to the highest positions of trust in the profession of arms. Command is the authority that a commander in the armed forces lawfully exercises over subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. Commanders at every echelon have a unique responsibility to make sense of the situation in which they find their forces and take all necessary actions to achieve their superiors’ assigned or implicit ends. Commanders are uniquely empowered to enforce their orders and those issued under their authority. They retain comprehensive responsibility for the conduct, efficiency, effectiveness, and health and welfare of all the forces entrusted to them. Though seldom mentioned explicitly today, commanders are still expected, as the 1923 Army Field Service Regulation required, ‘never [to] hesitate to exact whatever effort is necessary to attain the desired end.’ (Chapter 6, p. 78)
Just as the role of the commanding officer in the military is unique, the military justice system is also unique, and for good reason . It is structured in order to help the military succeed in defending the nation. Its unique structure allows commanding officers, who have court-martial authority (called “convening authority”), to carry out the orders of their civilian leaders to fight and win wars.

Most commanding officers don’t have convening authority. But some do, including the ability to send cases to a special court-martial (misdemeanors) or a general court-martial (felonies).
I was a convening authority. When personnel under my command committed serious misconduct and there was probable cause to believe they had committed a crime, I had the responsibility and legal authority to send suspected criminals to a court-martial. Just as the role of the commanding officer in the military is unique, the military justice system is also unique, and for good reason.
I referred those cases to a court-martial after consulting my staff JAG and the JAG prosecutor. And once that case was sent to a court-martial, the JAG prosecutor essentially “owned” the case.
Efforts by some to strip commanding officers of this ability to refer cases to a court-martial are, from my perspective, dangerous and wrongheaded. Here are four reasons why.
1. It would weaken the military overall by stripping commanding officers of the ability to enforce good order and discipline for personnel under their command.
A commanding officer in the military has a wide range of tools available to enforce good order and discipline. These tools include mild administrative remedies, such as informal counseling, formal counseling, executive officer inquiry, and non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
These administrative tools allow for flexible, quick, and effective discipline to address misbehavior or lack of attention to detail by those who violate rules. They help the commander show the troops that there are consequences, immediate and swift, for poor decisions or performance and minor misdeeds.
The ultimate administrative remedy is the ability to “fire” a service member for misconduct. The power to send a soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to an Administrative Discharge Board (referred to as an “Admin Board” in the military) sends a clear message to all those who serve under the commanding officer: There will be consequences for misconduct or neglect of duty.
The ultimate remedy for any commanding officer is the power to refer a suspected criminal in their unit to a court-martial. Taking that power away from commanding officers eliminates an indispensable authority that cannot be delegated or transferred to another—at least not if we are to demand accountability from commanders for prosecuting and preventing sexual assaults and other serious crimes.
2. Removing this power from commanding officers would weaken the military’s unique criminal justice system.
Unlike the civilian criminal justice system , where prosecutors or police file charges against an accused in a standing court, the military justice system has no standing courts and must create one for each individual case. Courts-martial are “created” by the power vested in a convening authority. The convening authority creates a court-martial by issuing a convening order. Strip commanders of the ability to refer cases to a court-martial, and you send a loud and clear message to troops under her command that she does not really command them, in the full sense of the word.
The convening authority has a role that cannot be reduced to either a prosecutor nor judge. This authority assigns military personnel to be members of a court-martial, decides on the charges to be filed, decides whether to use non-judicial punishment or an administrative proceeding in lieu of a trial, approves or rejects requests for expert witnesses, and accepts plea agreements.
In contrast, civilian prosecutors decide only whom to investigate, whom to charge, and what to charge. The reason for the difference is that civilian prosecutors are not responsible for the defendant’s training, good order, and discipline in the way that a military commander is. Strip commanders of the ability to refer cases to a court-martial, and you send a loud and clear message to troops under her command that she does not really command them, in the full sense of the word.
3. If commanders are stripped of convening authority, fewer cases would go to a court-martial, including sexual assault cases.
As a non-lawyer and convening authority, I was not bound by the ethics rules that all lawyers are required to follow. When I believed that there was probable cause that one of my subordinates committed a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, I could refer that soldier to a court-martial. And I did several times in my career. Why? To hold them accountable for their suspected criminal misconduct. If commanders are stripped of convening authority, fewer cases would go to a court-martial, including sexual assault cases.
Whether the prosecutor proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt was beside the point. I had a duty to enforce good order and discipline. Sending a soldier to a court-martial when he was suspected of a crime sent a loud and clear message to my troops that I was in command, and that I would not tolerate misconduct in my ranks.
The charges against a soldier were brought, almost exclusively, by military prosecutors. But I, and I alone, was responsible for making the decision of sending that soldier to a court-martial and enforcing good order and discipline.
4. The number of sexual assault cases getting prosecuted would go down, not up.
If Gillibrand’s proposal became law, then military prosecutors alone would decide whether or not to prosecute personnel under my command. And because military JAG prosecutors are lawyers, they must abide by the ethics rules under their state bar and the special ethics rules applicable to federal prosecutors. They cannot prosecute cases, like I could, where there is mere probable cause (the lowest standard of proof in the law) to believe that a soldier committed a criminal offense.
Prosecutors, military or civilian, can only charge people with a crime if they have a “reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.” The American Bar Association’s rule regarding the standards for prosecutors ( Standard 3-4.3 ) states that a prosecutor cannot file charges unless the prosecutor believes the charges are supported by probable cause (the only standard for commanders), and that the evidence “will be sufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the decision to charge is in the interests of justice.”
There are, undoubtedly, thousands of cases that can be brought under a “probable cause” standard, but cannot be pursued under a “reasonable doubt” standard. Sexual assault cases are difficult enough to investigate and prove in court.
If commanders are stripped of their authority to send sexual assault cases to court-martial under a probable cause standard, then far fewer cases can, or will, be sent by lawyers, who must abide by the much higher standard.
Sexual assault is a cancer that destroys military units and individuals. It is intolerable in the military. Every commander has the responsibility to create an atmosphere of trust and respect in their unit, and to hold those accountable to meet that standard.
Placing that responsibility in the hands of lawyers, while appearing to be an easy solution, would directly weaken the ability of military commanders to rid their units of sexual assault. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal More on This Issue"

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) "" Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih is hoping Saturday's parliamentary elections will help him overcome a coalition split that has hampered his efforts to restore political freedoms and tackle corruption.
Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party is seeking at least 44 seats in the 87-member Parliament for a majority to pass legislation needed to implement pledges from last year's presidential campaign. His coalition currently has 52 seats, but one partner with 22 seats is now aligned with former strongman Yameen Abdul Gayoom.
Solih defeated Yameen last year, giving new hope to the young democracy that has gone through a tumultuous transition that threatened to drag the Indian Ocean archipelago back to its autocratic past. Yameen had curtailed freedom of speech and jailed his political rivals. "
