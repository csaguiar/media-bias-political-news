As well, ""It should be noted that the Posse Comitatus Act greatly limits, but does not eliminate the power of the President of the United States to declare ""martial law,"" the assumption of all civilian police powers by the military.
The president, under his or her constitutional powers to put down insurrection, rebellion, or invasion, may declare martial law when local law enforcement and court systems have ceased to function. For example, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, President Roosevelt declared martial law in Hawaii at the request of the territorial governor.""

They aren't treating the economy like a part of the nation, they are treating it like the nation.
No one has ever voted on a ballot for the 1965 Hart-Celler act, or any form of mass immigration that will inevitably change the European-derived identity and character of the United States. The immigration bill passed in 1965 promised in the words of Ted Kennedy: ""Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same...""
With all of the hostility directed at Americans of European heritage, while these politicians are scheming to increase immigration even further, it's time to wake up and take a stand. We must unite based on our common history, culture, and our European heritage in opposition to mass immigration; we must reacquire our identity. It's no longer only the most logical thing to do, but now a necessity."

After a marathon seven-hour Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister May told the country Tuesday night that she would seek another “short” extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day further, which she said would end once a deal is passed in the House of Commons.
While this move may have been expected, given that the prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement was voted down for a third time and two rounds of non-binding votes in the Commons resulted in no support for an alternative, May shocked the country by handing power over to the far-left leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn.
In the brief statement, the prime minister said she will to sit down with Corbyn “to try to agree a plan” on the “future relationship with the EU” which must also include the EU-approved Withdrawal Agreement. But she also added that if the two party leaders could not agree to a “single unified approach,” then “we would instead agree to a number of options for the future relationship which we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue” — handing the whole of the future of Brexit, in effect, over to the Opposition.

The traditional-conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland, whose ten MPs prop up May’s Conservative minority government, accused the prime minister of “sub-contracting out the future of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn” and condemned her “lamentable handling of the negotiations with the EU.”
Former foreign secretary and Vote Leave campaigner Boris Johnson wrote , “It now seems all too likely that British trade policy and key law making powers will be handed over to Brussels — with no say for the UK” and that the country would be forced to “agree to exit terms that in no way resemble what the people were promised when they voted to leave.”
“The PM and cabinet have concluded that any deal is better than no deal, and this is truly a very bad deal indeed — one that leaves us being run by the EU. I can under no circumstances vote for a deal involving a customs union as I believe that does not deliver on the referendum,” Mr Johnson added.

Speaking later that evening to the BBC, the Brexiteer warned that “if Corbyn gets his way, we remain in the Customs Union so that we can’t control our trade policy, huge areas of law making we can’t control, and Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration.”
While chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) Jacob Rees-Mogg said , “I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives.
“This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.
“People did not vote for a Corbyn-May coalition Government – they voted for a Conservative Government, which became a confidence and supply with the DUP.
“This is a deeply unsatisfactory approach – it’s not in the interests of the country, it fails to deliver on the referendum result and history doesn’t bode well for it.”

The prime minister is expected to meet with Corbyn later today. Mr Corbyn has said he wants a custom unions with the EU and access to markets — a soft Brexit that would stop the UK from signing her own trade deals, including with the U.S. — as well as protection of environmental standards and workers’ rights. While pro-Remain Labour MPs want a second referendum on the deal agreed between the EU and Parliament before the UK can leave the EU.
May will also be meeting with Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, whose far-left Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) backs EU Single Market alignment which includes uncontrolled migration from the bloc’s half a billion population.

Erdogan’s AKP and coalition partner won more than 50 percent of votes nationwide in Sunday’s local ballot, but defeat in both Turkey’s capital and its economic hub would be a setback after the party’s decade and a half in power.
The AKP appeals with electoral authorities, who have two days to decide whether the claims of irregularities have merit, may signal more ruling party challenges to the surprise opposition victories.
“We have filed our objections with the electoral authorities in all 39 districts,” AKP’s Istanbul chief Bayram Senocak told reporters. “We have identified irregularities and falsifications.”
He said the party had found an “excessive” difference between votes cast at ballot stations for their candidate and the data sent to electoral authorities.
Hakan Han Ozcan, AKP’s Ankara chairman, told reporters they were also filing an appeal in 25 districts of the capital. Anadolu state news agency said results showed CHP opposition candidate Mansur Yavas with 50.93 percent of votes against 47.11 percent for the AKP.
Istanbul, the largest city in the country, was a key prize for Erdogan and he had fielded former premier and loyalist Binali Yildirim as candidate for mayor.
But Istanbul was a very tight race and both Yildirim and the opposition CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu claimed victory in the early hours of Monday when tallies showed them in a dead heat.
Symbolic gesture
Electoral authorities on Monday announced Imamoglu was ahead by 28,000 votes with nearly all ballot boxes tallied, prompting AKP officials to challenge to the result.
Imamoglu had 48.79 percent of the votes while Yildirim had 48.52 percent, Anadolu reported on Tuesday, citing preliminary results.
Imamoglu on Tuesday traveled to Ankara to lay flowers at the mausoleum of modern Turkey’s founder Musfafa Kemal Ataturk in a highly symbolic gesture Erdogan often does himself soon after his election wins.
“Had the other party won, I would have said ‘congratulations Mr Binali Yildirim,’ which I do not say because I am the one who won,” Imamoglu told reporters.
“They are behaving like a kid who has been deprived of his toy.”
AKP party spokesman Omer Celik on Monday had said they had found discrepancies between reports from polling stations and vote counts in both Ankara and Istanbul.
Erdogan, himself a former Istanbul mayor, had campaigned hard in the city. But the ruling party may have been stung by the economy with Turkey in recession for the first time since 2009 and inflation in double digits.

Austria’s Kurz plans to strip far right of spy agency oversight – POLITICO,www.politico.eu,msn.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.eu/article/kurz-plans-to-strip-far-right-of-spy-agency-oversight/,"Laurenz Gehrke Kurz has called on his coalition partner to cut any connections between the party and the Identitarians, referring to recent newspaper reports that the Identitarians had rented space in an FPÖ-linked dormitory. “Any sort of entanglement with the Identitarians ought to be dissolved,” Kurz said Monday in comments aimed at the FPÖ. “Looking away is not an option.” The FPÖ has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin Also Monday, Peter Gridling, the chief of Austria’s domestic spy agency BVT, said that Vienna has been isolated in the Club de Berne, a forum in which European intelligence chiefs share information. The BVT withdrew voluntarily from the club’s working groups in spring 2018, in part due to concerns over a raid on the agency — ordered by FPÖ Interior Minister Herbert Kickl — in which police confiscated secret information, including details on investigations into far-right extremists. A planned return to full participation did not take place after the newspaper Falter in late 2018 published an internal club paper, Gridling said, according to Austrian media. In the paper, the Finnish intelligence service asked all its Club de Berne allies — except Austria — for help in investigating Russian spies. The FPÖ has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, having gone as far as to sign a “ cooperation pact ” with Putin’s party in 2016. Falter’s report has been “negative” for Austria’s return to full participation, Gridling said, speaking at a court hearing . (Kickl sued an opposition figure for describing him as a security risk following the raid.) Gridling added that Austria is still a member of the Club de Berne and has not been excluded from receiving intelligence, but that club members could decide “to what extent to cooperate with other members.”

"SCLC Releases First Communique, Condemns The Purported Kidnapping Of Barrister Akere Muna",www.bareta.news,Mark Bareta,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.bareta.news/sclc-releases-first-communique-condemns-the-purported-kidnapping-of-barrister-akere-muna/,"Comments
Ambazonians Deny Any Role in the Kidnapping of Akere Muna & Co.
WASHINGTON, DC, 2 April 2019 – The Southern Cameroons Liberation Council (SCLC) condemns, in the strongest terms, the reported kidnapping of an unknown number of civilians in the Republic of Ambazonia, formerly the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon. The victims include a former Bar Association president and former presidential candidate, Barrister Akere Muna, and an unknown number of people who were traveling in his convoy in the Northern Zone of Ambazonia.
The SCLC calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all those kidnapped and points an accusing finger at the regime of President Paul Biya for orchestrating the crime.
Ambazonian Restoration Forces operating in the Northern Zone, including the commander in charge of Ambazonian self-defense forces in the area, have denied involvement. One General issued an audio press release Tuesday, denying responsibility for the crime. In the audio, the commander prays that no harm be done to the victims if they are in the keeping of any Ambazonian forces; that no ransom be accepted and that victims be released if their safety cannot be guaranteed.
The SCLC also accuses thousands of pro-regime militia operating in Ambazonia who have specialized in hostage taking for ransom. Regime armed and security forces have also carried out abductions, kidnappings, deportations to jails outside Ambazonia, and raids on UN-managed refugee camps.
Massacres, targeted killings, extrajudicial executions are among a long line of desperate crimes by regime forces aimed at convincing the international community that the pro-independence campaign is a terrorist organization.
In October, November and December 2018 and in March 2019, masked gunmen, who were later revealed to be soldiers of the regime, kidnapped students in Bafut and Bamenda, in the Northern Zone, and in Kumba and Buea, in the Southern Zone.
In the November 2018 kidnapping of 81 students and their teachers in Bamenda, the regime appeared to have been seeking to generate the global outrage which followed the kidnappings, in April 2014 by Boko Haram, of 276 Chibok Girls in Nigeria’s Borno State. The lead kidnapper in that case was later positively identified as Armel Rostand Mveng, an officer in the Cameroonian army.
The SCLC reiterates that the only terrorists in the Cameroons are Biya’s colonial forces. After declaring war on Ambazonia on 30 November 2017, the regime issued radio announcements, promising to commit war crime. It ordered civilians to vacate villages suspected of hosting Ambazonian fighters, known to the regime as “rats”, “dogs”, “terrorists” and “secessionists”.
More than 10,000 civilians have been killed so far. Over a million Ambazonians now live in the forests, fleeing the colonial forces which have looted and razed nearly 200 villages. Related Items:"

Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on marriage in England and Wales revealed a dramatic drop in the proportion of people who had ever married from the 1970s, when more than a quarter (28 per cent) of women were wed by the age of 20 and more than nine-tenths (91 per cent) by 30.
But now, only one in three women have ever married by age 30 according to the most recent ONS data , which looks at the number of marriages which took place in 2016, when the share of men married by the time they were 30 slumped to less than a quarter, having stood at more than eight in ten in 1976.
Despite a wide body of evidence revealing that marriage is an important social good, associated with many positive outcomes for children, couples, and society, the ONS put a positive spin on the trend.
“Couples are now overwhelmingly likely to be ‘trying before buying’”, argues ONS head of life events, Nick Stripe, paying tribute to his own “wonderful blended family” in a commentary which noted that marriage rates “have more than halved since their high-water mark in the 1960s and 1970s”.
In an analysis of UK data throughout the decades, which showed “the average age at which people get married has climbed ever higher”, he said: “ONS figures show that in the 1970s the average age of people who got married for the first time was 22.8 years for women and 25.1 years for men.”
Attack on Marriage: ‘Revolution’ as ‘Conservative’ Govt to Introduce ‘No-Fault’ Quickie Divorce https://t.co/XjU4Yx9oko
— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 9, 2018
Recalling how, during the 1990s older family members “were disappointed that I had … been ‘living in sin’ with my partner”, Stripe puts the steep decline in marriage down to “a dramatic cultural change that has taken place over the last 50 to 60 years”.
“Back in the mid 1950s, before the ‘sexual revolution’ and the Abortion and Divorce Reform Acts, only about 5 percent of babies were born to parents who were not married. This is now the case for just under half of all newborn babies,” he writes in the analysis.
Another continuing trend which was apparent in this year’s data was the decline of religious marriages, the number of which fell by almost five points (4.1 per cent) from the year before, marking a drop of just over half (52.6 per cent) since 1990.
“This is partly due to the long-term decline in the overall number of all marriages but also the rise in popularity of civil marriage ceremonies,” the ONS said, noting that in 2016, “for the first time on record, there were more than three times as many civil marriage ceremonies as there were religious ceremonies”.

Everything that has been done to destroy marriage and sexual morality and the family is part of basic left wing tactics and policy to weaken and destroy society . Every society that has been taken over by the left has destoyed marriage and the family. This was the case in communist Russia back in 1917. Unless they destroy Christianity,marriage,family and societal norms the left knows it can never work its will on the people and exercise full control and domination over everything that is vital to a strong and healthy culture . The family ,via marriage, transmits the culture and traditions and societal norms. The Marxists therefore hate the family and the institution,marriage , that keeps society strong and stable."

In Skåne in southern Sweden, the judicial system’s resources have recently, among other things, been used to frame a 91-year-old man who wrote negatively about Islam and Muslims on Facebook.
The man who is from Bromölla was convicted of “ incitement to racial or ethnic hatred ” after he wrote “offensive” about Muslims, according to the local newspaper.
“You cannot, with the best will in the world, call these creatures humans. They seem to be inbred, the way they behave”, the elderly man supposedly wrote.
The local newspaper calls him “Sweden’s oldest online hater”.
The District Court argues that the comments are “clearly offensive to Muslims” and therefore sentences the man for hate speech.
According to the court, the usual punishment for the crime he committed is two months in prison, but the 91-year-old man evades the slammer and is let off with a conditional sentence and SEK 6,500 (€650) in daily fines.

Biden Pressured Ukraine into Firing Prosecutor Investigating Firm where his Son Worked – Dan Bongino,bongino.com,,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://bongino.com/biden-pressured-ukraine-into-firing-prosecutor-investigating-firm-where-his-son-worked/,"April 2, 2019 V ice President Joe Biden strong-armed Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor who just happened to be investigating a firm that his son, Hunter Biden worked for as a board member.
John Solomon of the Hill writes that last year, Biden bragged to an audience about threatening Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko that the Obama Administration would pull $1 billion in loan guarantees if he didn’t fire his Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.
What Biden failed to mention was that Shokin was “leading a wide-ranging corruption probe” into the natural fas firm Burisma Holdings which employed his son and was planning on interrogating Hunter as part of the investigation. Advertisement
Solomon writes :
U.S. banking records show Hunter Biden’s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts — usually more than $166,000 a month — from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015, during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.
**LISTEN: Dan discusses the explosive Biden-Ukraine scandal**
The general prosecutor’s official file for the Burisma probe — shared with me by senior Ukrainian officials — shows prosecutors identified Hunter Biden, business partner Devon Archer and their firm, Rosemont Seneca, as potential recipients of money.
Shokin told me in written answers to questions that, before he was fired as general prosecutor, he had made “specific plans” for the investigation that “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.” Advertisement

Many of CNN’s national security analysts have undisclosed ties to oppressive Qatari regime,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/many-of-cnns-national-security-analysts-have-undisclosed-ties-to-oppressive-qatari-regime.html,"Conservative Review April 3, 2019
Several of the so-called national security experts at CNN that you see on television every night have direct links to the nation of Qatar, a terror-funding , Islamist enclave in the Middle East that has placed itself on the warpath against America’s most important regional allies.
But you would never know about these connections, because none of the CNN regulars disclose their financial and/or institutional ties to Qatar when they appear on the airwaves. And off air, they are also not forthcoming about their Qatar-backed connections. Even when it comes to discussing issues where they have a clear conflict of interest, such as commenting on Israeli, Saudi, or UAE affairs, these CNN contributors have no issue going to bat against Qatar’s rivals, while never mentioning that their editorial freedom is restricted or that they are personally compromised.
These four CNN regulars, two of whom are full-time employees, double as Qatar-tied propagandists, but you would never know it if you only watched CNN.
Ali Soufan
A CNN regular who was prominently featured in the network’s anti-Saudi Arabia documentary , Ali Soufan is the executive director of the Qatar International Academy for Security Studies (QIASS), which is based in Doha and funded by the Qatari regime. Oddly, the leadership roster at the state-controlled Qatari institution is almost identical to his U.S.-based Soufan Group .
According to the Wall Street Journal, Soufan has a “ personal relationship ” with the top leadership of Qatar.
Soufan, like his Qatar-backed colleagues, frequently rails against the Saudis, Qatar’s top rival, for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. He has also pushed debunked conspiracy theories about Saudi Arabia hacking into the personal information of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Mehdi Hasan
CNN regular Mehdi Hasan is a longtime presenter for Al Jazeera, the powerful Doha-controlled state media entity that was the favorite network of deceased al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Hasan’s employer pushes out a steady stream of pro-Islamist, anti-Semitic propaganda. As a state-controlled institution, its founding and continuing purpose is the advancement of Qatar’s national interests.
“Mr. Hasan works for al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned media enterprise that advances the interests of the state and its royal family. When he speaks, he’s no less a government spokesman than Kellyanne Conway or Sarah Sanders,” explained David Reaboi of the Security Studies Group in a Washington Times column last week.
“But the government he represents — to millions of unsuspecting American viewers — has long promoted the Muslim Brotherhood, funds the bloodthirsty designated terror group Hamas, has helped al Qaeda and the Taliban fundraise, and is relentlessly hostile to American interests,” he adds.
Juliette Kayyem
Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst, is a board member of the the International Centre for Sport Security (ICSS), a front group controlled by Qatar that is an influence operation to secure and defend Qatar’s 2022 World Cup bid. Kayyem has regularly spoken on behalf of the organization and has been a media point of contact for the shadowy group. She has not been forthcoming about the reality that the ICSS is a Doha-controlled institution. A 2015 flyer from the group presents Kayyem as part of a group of “ICSS spokespeople” who can answer questions about a forthcoming two-day summit.
The leader of ICSS — which again, claims to be a sports-promoting outfit — is Mohammed Hanzab, who has a background as an intelligence and defense specialist in the Qatari military. Hanzab previously served as the president of Ali Soufan’s QIASS.
Kayyem regularly takes to the airwaves to bash Qatar’s rivals and has transformed her social media accounts into a one-stop shop for anti-Saudi Arabia talking points. When discussing issues involving Middle East politics, Kayyem does not disclose that she is on the board of a state-run Qatari institution.
Peter Bergen
Unlike the other individuals on this list, lead CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen does not appear to have a direct link to a Qatari state institution. However, Bergen, a regular visitor to the tiny, energy-rich nation, pushes blatant pro-Qatar agitprop when it comes to Middle East affairs.
Writing from Doha in November, in a piece that reads like propaganda from a state-run Qatari news site, Bergen commented that “Qatar looks like a far more natural ally for the United States than the Saudis.”
The CNN employee frequently lectures at Qatari-funded institutions such as Georgetown University Qatar. And last year, he moderated a panel at the Doha Forum, which is held under the auspices of the Qatari regime. Bergen’s bio states that he is a professor of practice at Arizona State University, which has the largest number of Qatari students at any U.S. university, many of whom are sponsored by Qatari state institutions, including its defense ministry. Additionally, Arizona State is among the top recipients of Qatari funding to U.S. universities.
CNN has not responded to a request for comment. This article was posted: Wednesday, April 3, 2019 at 5:21 am Share this article"
"SHOCK VIDEO: Migrants drag screaming children under water, through concertina wire to enter US illegally",www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/shock-video-migrants-drag-screaming-children-under-water-through-concertina-wire-to-enter-us-illegally.html,"American Mirror April 3, 2019
Disturbing video of illegal immigrants defying U.S. Border Patrol agents to push screaming children underwater and through razor wire to America offers latest evidence of the chaos on the border Democrats continue to ignore.
In one video, illegal immigrants pulled young children under a border fence and through large coils of concertina wire during a cold December morning near Yuma, Arizona, ABC News reports.
The video shows several adults crawling and hoisting about a half dozen youngsters through the barrier as U.S. Border Patrol urge them to reconsider as they repeatedly snagged their clothes on the wire, the traumatic experience punctuated by blaring sirens and flashing police lights. NEW: In video obtained by @ABC , a family of asylum seekers attempts to cross through a hole under the border wall near Yuma, Arizona, despite warnings from CBP agents—and a woman who makes it to the U.S. side is separated from her sister’s family.

“New: In video obtained by @ABC, a family of asylum seekers attempts to cross through a hole under the border wall near Yuma, Arizona, despite warnings from CBP agents – and a woman who makes to the U.S. side is separated from her sister’s family,” the news site posted to Twitter Monday. A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A second video involved illegal immigrants risking the lives of young children as they waded into a drainage ditch yards from the San Juan del Rio Colorado border crossing. Several children screamed loudly in Spanish as the immigrants forced them underwater to duck under the gate, then walked them through concertina wire to a bank on the U.S. side.
“Go back … don’t do this. Look at the child! Hey! Be careful with the child! Be careful with the child!” U.S. Border Patrol agents shouted in Spanish as the immigrants ignored them.
Mexican police intervene in the water crossing and prevent at least one child from going through the ordeal, though it’s unclear which immigrants are the parents of the children. The situation is literally chaos, with border patrol, Mexican officials, and the immigrants themselves shouting instructions as the children scream in terror.
“You’re going to traumatize this poor child,” a border agent shouted. “She’s crying, if she crosses the child can drown.”
After several immigrants and children cross, Mexican police eventually wade into the 55-degree water to physically block the path, ABC News reports.
The news site claims a woman was separated from her sister during the incident and forced to turn back to Mexico with her two children.
The months-old videos highlight the crisis situation created by the malfunctioning U.S. immigration system and bolster President Trump’s insistence that the situation in a national emergency. Top Democrats, including virtually all of the leading contenders to take on Trump in 2020, have repeatedly downplayed the border crisis and insisted it doesn’t exist.
Meanwhile, Border Patrol are busing hundreds of illegal immigrants each day to overwhelmed shelters in Texas and other states due to overcrowding at processing centers. Those shelters have begun simply dropping the illegal immigrants off at bus stations with a ticket to anywhere in the U.S. they want to go.
Federal officials estimate as many as 1 million illegal immigrants could cross into the United States in fiscal year 2019, though that figure doesn’t include the countless numbers that cross undetected through the porous border.
The figures and video also do not fully capture the treacherous journey immigrant parents are subjecting their children to, an experience that would land U.S. parents in prison for child abuse.
“Today’s migrant flows have created a humanitarian catastrophe,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said last month, according to Fox News . “In one study, more than 30 percent of women reported sexual assault along the way and 70 percent of all migrants reported experiencing violence.
“Very unfortunately, because of the increase in violence, at ICE, when he have families with children, we have to give every girl a pregnancy test over 10,” she said. “This is not a safe journey.” This article was posted: Wednesday, April 3, 2019 at 5:14 am Share this article"
