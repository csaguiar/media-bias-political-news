Drug Policy Psychology/Psychiatry Science Book Reviews In the 1950s and '60s, psychedelic drug research seemed to offer promising paths for treating schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcoholism, and other disorders. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 interrupted legitimate scientific inquiry, but there was a brief renaissance in the late '70s and early '80s, when psychiatrists embraced MDMA as a tool to catalyze the therapeutic process. By 1985, however, MDMA was better known as the street drug ""ecstasy"" and was added to the list of chemicals that the government defined as having a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.
In the early 1990s the tide turned again, as a new wave of research made a serious case that psychedelics should have a role in psychiatry. ""This research is no longer seen as uncomfortably fringe,"" says Rick Doblin, ""but is now being accepted more widely as promising and important and opening up a long-blocked avenue of research in psychiatry.""
Doblin, executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), has been at the forefront of this wave. His tale is one of the focal narratives in former Washington Post reporter Tom Shroder's Acid Test , a book that weaves intimate biographies of key players in psychedelic research with the stories of the patients they aim to help.
Another important figure in the book is Michael Mithoefer, a psychiatrist with a private practice in Charleston, South Carolina. Mithoefer's research team completed the first major study investigating MDMA as an aid to treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study, which was funded by MAPS, revealed its 83 percent success rate in the Journal of Psychopharmacology in 2010. A follow-up study published two years later emphasized that the results from the initial MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions were sustained for nearly all of the volunteers. Their symptoms were relieved, on average, for just under four years, though two of the subjects experienced a relapse. This is especially noteworthy because only a handful of psychotherapy sessions involved MDMA, compared to a dismal success rate of treatment with a daily regimen of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and in some cases even antipsychotics and tranquilizers.
These are still, to be sure, preliminary results. The study was conducted as a ""proof of principle"" trial, meaning that it focused on a small sample (just 20 volunteers) to show that the experiment could be conducted safely, that the credibility of the therapist training manual could be tested, and that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy could produce favorable results. With successful outcomes for all three objectives, the study provides a strong argument for further research. And indeed, a similar study was completed two years ago in Switzerland. Its outcome was not as dramatic—a third of the subjects experienced a reduction of PTSD symptoms from severe to mild—but it was still deemed a successful trial. Additional trials are still ongoing in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Israel; if they go well, researchers plan to petition the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve phase III protocols, the final step toward making MDMA an approved treatment.
When researchers investigate treatments for PTSD, their chief tool for measuring their results is the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), a structured clinical interview that measures the severity of the sufferer’s symptoms on a scale of 0 to 130. To meet the criteria for enrollment in Mithoefer's study, a CAPS score of at least 50 had to persist for at least three months while volunteers received antidepressant treatment and at least six months of psychotherapy. Before the MDMA sessions, the volunteers in Mithoefer's study averaged a CAPS score of 80. That dropped to below 30 just two months after their final MDMA session, less than half the average score of the placebo control groups. The dramatic reduction in CAPS score meant that the volunteers no longer met the minimum criteria for PTSD. In other words, they were essentially cured.
While these subjects are left anonymous in the scientific literature, Shroder puts names and life stories to the people behind the numbers: veterans, victims of sexual abuse, terminally ill cancer patients, and others desperate for relief. Nicholas Blackston, for example, served two tours with the Marines in the second Iraq war; he participated in Mithoefer's second MDMA study, which aimed to treat subjects whose PTSD stemmed from war-related trauma. Shroder devotes about half of Acid Test to Nick's story.
""PTSD was like a file folder sitting on a desk not knowing where to be stored, therefore piling up other file folders behind it, creating stress,"" Blackston tells me. ""The MDMA-assisted psychotherapy helped my mind properly file it away, allowing for peace of mind."" Blackston still has occasional issues with anxiety, but he says these are easy to manage and are not related to his PTSD. ""I experienced some pretty horrific things in war, and those images can never be erased,"" he says. ""Although they're still within my mind, I'm no longer haunted nor debilitated by those traumas. The therapy has allowed my mind to process trauma as information to learn from.""
MAPS is not the only organization working to bring psychedelic drugs back into the medical community. The Heffter Research Institute has been funding research with psilocybin—the active compound in so-called magic mushrooms—at UCLA, New York University, Johns Hopkins, and the University of New Mexico. The focus so far has been on psilocybin's ability to trigger a mystical experience, which may be useful in various applications of psychotherapy, from easing end-of-life anxiety to quitting smoking. The U.K.-based Beckley Foundation is partnering with researchers at Imperial College London to examine the effects of psilocybin and LSD on the brain. Additional research with ayahuasca, an Amazonian brew containing the psychedelic drug DMT, and ibogaine, an addiction interrupter from the African iboga plant, are ongoing in Europe, Latin America, and New Zealand.
Earlier this year, The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease published the first clinical trial in more than 40 years that used LSD for psychotherapy. Peter Gasser, a Swiss psychiatrist, conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled experiment in 12 people with debilitating anxiety associated with a life-threatening disease. All 12 subjects experienced significant reductions in their anxiety following only two LSD-assisted psychotherapy sessions, with their relief lasting at least 12 months through ongoing monitoring of symptoms.
Acid Test is a crucial addition to the story of science's psychedelic renaissance. By showing what researchers have accomplished, it makes a strong case against letting regulators close the door on their work again.

"With Facebook Ban On White Extremism, International Norms Apply To U.S.",wcqs.org,Aarti Shahani,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/facebook-ban-white-extremism-international-norms-apply-us,"/ Originally published on April 5, 2019 7:45 pm
The U.S. has long exported its culture abroad — think Coca-Cola, Hollywood and hip-hop. Facebook was once praised for spreading free-speech values. But the world is pushing back with different values, which Facebook is importing to the U.S. with the company's ban on white extremist content .
The ban goes into effect worldwide this week . Experts and advocates who've long lobbied Facebook to pull potentially dangerous speech saythe move — which is wrapped up in the U.S. culture wars — is the result of international pressure forcing the company's hand.
A Facebook spokesperson says that under the new rules, users can't post in a celebratory way on its News Feed or Instagram: ""I'm a white nationalist!"" But they can post: ""I'm a black nationalist!""
John Spier, a Facebook user in Central California, says that's ""ridiculous."" Spier, a self-described libertarian, says everyone should have freedom of expression. ""Even if they're an idiot. There's a lot of idiots in the world who say a lot of stupid things. We don't need to protect people from that,"" he says.
What racism is and who can be racist is a debate that's getting louder in the U.S. Spier says that while Facebook claims to be a neutral platform, the company is taking the liberal side.
""I know that the current popular mode of thought is that only white people can be racist,"" he says. ""But I don't agree with that. I grew up as a minority white person in a largely Latino community and believe me, I know what racism feels like.""
(Note: Facebook is among NPR's financial sponsors.)
According to Facebook leaders and civil rights advocates, this issue is not about speech but about safety. It's a well-documented fact: White extremists around the world are radicalizing men online , luring them into organized hate groups and promoting lone-wolf acts of terror.
Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, has been tracking extremist groups online for years, and making this point to Facebook: ""White supremacists are as much a global movement and interconnected — in other words sharing ideas, sharing money, sharing tactics, sharing propaganda, visiting each other ... just like you see with Islamic extremists.""
Dylann Roof, who murdered nine people in a church basement in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, got radicalized through Google search . The white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 that left three dead and dozens injured, was organized on a Facebook page. The shooter charged with attacking two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 50 people, used Facebook Live — an incredibly powerful broadcast tool.
Beirich says Facebook's latest move is in reaction to the PR disaster in New Zealand, as well as pressure from law enforcement — particularly those in Europe, who are worried about white extremist gunmen.
""That realization is dawning on the intelligence communities worldwide, and Facebook is hearing it from them,"" she says.
A spokesperson tells NPR that the tech company made the unusual move of adding the Christchurch massacre footage to a terrorism database that had been focused on Islamic extremism. The spokesperson says the company will continue to add white extremist content to the GIFCT database , which tech giants share to censor the most violent content.
Australia just approved a stringent law that threatens social media employees with prison time if they don't remove violent content "" expeditiously ."" The United Kingdom is about to unveil legislation . Germany has passed tough hate speech laws that carry heavy fines .
""The U.S. is behind the eight ball on this,"" Beirich says. ""[President] Trump doesn't seem to be interested in these issues at all. And I think Facebook is reacting to that in a good way, I would argue.""
About 90 percent of Facebook users are outside the U.S. and the largest single market is now India .
Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called on governments around the world to create, in effect, a global standard for speech. That has never existed before. It's a long shot.

Such Great Heights: 84-Year-Old Pole Vaulter Keeps Raising The Bar,wcqs.org,Laurel Wamsley,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/such-great-heights-84-year-old-pole-vaulter-keeps-raising-bar,"By Laurel Wamsley • 3 hours ago Flo Filion Meiler, 84, during pole vault training last month. She mostly works out alone, but has a coach to help refine her technique in events like shot put and high jump. Lisa Rathke / AP
Flo Filion Meiler is a world-class athlete who lives in Shelburne, Vt. At the indoor World Masters Athletics Championships in Poland last week, Meiler, who is 84, racked up medal after medal in her age division.
Golds in high jump, pentathlon, 60-meter hurdles, and pole vault. Silvers in long jump and triple jump. Oh, and another gold in the 4x200 relay . ""The four of us ladies in our 80s set a new world record,"" she told NPR this week.
But wait — the pole vault?
Indeed. Meiler took up track and field at age 60, and as she watched the pole vaulting competition at the Senior Olympics, she had a notion.
""They weren't pole vaulting very high,"" she remembers. ""And I said to myself, you know, I think that I could do better than that.
So at a sprightly 65, she took up the event. ""I love challenges, and the pole vault is a challenge. You have to have a really strong upper body, upper core and very strong arms.""
No problem for Meiler, who was competitive slalom water-skier for 30 years. ""I think that's why I've done so well in it, is because of the way I've always handled my body.""
At last week's world championships, she was the only pole vaulter in her age division, though there were a few men in the 80-84 field. Meiler notes that she was far from the oldest athlete taking part in the meet. ""There was a lady from India who was 103. ... She didn't run very fast, but she did it!""
All that winning takes a lot of training, and Meiler keeps a rigorous schedule. She says no longer has time to ski, as she devotes herself five to six days a week to her workouts.
""On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I will do track events. And on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I will do machine weights. Then I will play doubles tennis, but that's just social tennis.""
She mostly trains alone, but she has a coach at the University of Vermont to help her get competition-ready. ""I have her help me, let's say, with my shot put. And I have her help me doing the high jump and so forth.""
A year ago, she started having hamstring problems and knew it was due to getting older. So she doubled the time she devotes to stretching and warming up. ""It makes a world of difference in not being injured,"" she says.
The competition may be thinning, but Meiler doesn't see retirement anytime soon.
""You know, if the good Lord gives me my health, I'm going to keep going forever.""
Right now she's focused on the upcoming Senior Olympics in Albuquerque, N.M., and she's eagerly anticipating her birthday in June – an occasion that will shift her into the next age bracket.
""I'm looking forward to being 85,"" Meiler says, ""because then I'll be at the bottom of the ladder, and I'm going to look at all these records and see what I can do about 'em.""

Former WNC Congressman Charles Taylor's Russian Bank Stripped Of License,wcqs.org,Associated Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/former-wnc-congressman-charles-taylors-russian-bank-stripped-license,"By Associated Press • 3 hours ago Charles Taylor served as Congressman for North Carolina's 11th District, which encompassed the western most of portion of the state, from 1991 to 2007 Wikicommons
MOSCOW (AP) — A small Russian bank owned by former U.S. congressman Charles Taylor was stripped of its license Friday after allegedly breaking anti-money laundering rules.
Russia's central bank said that Commercial Bank of Ivanovo committed ""numerous"" breaches of anti-money laundering regulations — including by providing ""incomplete and unreliable information"" about transactions — and inflated the value of its assets.
The central bank has appointed administrators and says more than 70 percent of CBI's lending was ""low-quality loans.""
Taylor, a Republican widely considered a hard-line conservative, was a congressman serving North Carolina's 11th District, which encompassed the westernmost part of the state, between 1991 and 2007.
Central bank records show Taylor owns more than 80 percent of CBI, a regional lender based in the textile-manufacturing city of Ivanovo, just over 150 miles (245 kilometers) north-east of Moscow.
In a brief statement, CBI confirmed the loss of its license and directed deposit-holders to a government-run deposit insurance scheme. It didn't comment on the accusations made by the central bank. Taylor could not immediately be reached for comment.
Taylor bought CBI in 2003 alongside his business partner Boris Bolshakov, a former KGB agent and Supreme Soviet deputy who is listed as the bank's second-largest shareholder.
In 2003, two of Taylor's political associates testified that the congressman knew about fraudulent loans made by Asheville-based Blue Ridge Savings Bank, which he owned at the time, to a political supporter. Taylor denied any knowledge of the loans.
During his time in congress, Taylor was a strident backer of student exchange programs with Russia. When Democrat Heath Shuler defeated Taylor in the 2006 election, his campaign said Taylor's Russian ties were a distraction from working for North Carolina voters.

"In Ukraine, Presidential Candidates Trade High-Stakes Challenges",wcqs.org,Merrit Kennedy,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/ukraine-presidential-candidates-trade-high-stakes-challenges,"By Merrit Kennedy • 3 hours ago Ukrainian presidential candidate Petro Poroshenko takes a televised blood test.

Ukraine's presidential election – which was already high-drama — has taken an unusual turn. The two remaining candidates took highly public alcohol and drug tests on Friday, as part of an escalating series of challenges delivered on social media.
The runoff election on April 21 pits incumbent President Petro Poroshenko against Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian who plays a president on TV. Zelenskiy came out of the first round of election with 30 percent of the vote – nearly double the number of votes cast for Poroshenko.
""I took a blood test. They pumped all sorts of blood out of me. But thank God, I have enough of it. Young blood,"" Zelenskiy told reporters, as Reuters reported.
The incumbent leader has been pushing his rival, who has no political experience, to participate in a public debate. Zelenskiy had the issued the drug test demand to Poroshenko after he accepted Poroshenko's challenge to debate, as Reuters reported.
And he further upped the stakes – in a slickly produced video, the comedian strode in slow motion onto the field of Ukraine's largest sports arena, Kiev Olimpiyskiy Stadium.

The two candidates have called each other out on social media, and are now due to square off at the Olympic stadium. pic.twitter.com/XbHMVPYNt2 — BBC Monitoring (@BBCMonitoring) April 4, 2019
""The debate will take place before the Ukrainian people,"" he said, challenging the leader to take him on at the stadium, not a TV studio. ""I give you 24 hours. Think,"" the comedian added, according to a BBC translation .
It's a challenge that Poroshenko accepted in his own video, though he criticized the ""uncertainty"" involved. ""This is no joke. Being president and commander-in-chief is not a game,"" he said.
On Friday, Poroshenko took his drug test at the stadium. ""Poroshenko challenged Zelenskiy to take the test at the sports arena along with him, but Zelenskiy said he doesn't trust that lab and took his test at another one,"" The Associated Press reported. Вважаю, що процедура проведення аналізів взагалі має бути обов’язковою, тому що питання відсутності алко- та наркозалежності у кандидата у Президенти – це питання національної безпеки. pic.twitter.com/vGLboPzUOk — Петро Порошенко (@poroshenko) April 5, 2019
In a tweet after he had blood drawn, Poroshenko said he thinks these tests should be required, ""because the question of absence of addictions to alcohol and drugs in a candidate for President – is a question of national security.""
According to the Interfax Ukraine news agency, narcotics were not found in either candidate's blood.
In the first round of the elections, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko came in third place. Zelenskiy requested that she moderate their debate, which Poroshenko roundly rejected.
""Debates are not a show. I believe that such disparaging and frivolous treatment is disrespect for the politician, Yulia Tymoshenko,"" the incumbent added, according to Interfax Ukraine . Ukrainian presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who led the first round of presidential polls, took a blood test in a private clinic in Kiev on Friday. AFP/Getty Images
Some observers, such as BBC Kiev correspondent Jonah Fisher, see the back-and-forth as a miscalculation by Zelenskiy:
""Mr Poroshenko has nothing to lose and would dearly love to lock horns with the inexperienced Mr Zelensky. Perhaps it's the only way he might turn things around. ...
""This 'stadium debate' affair may turn out to be simply a disastrous episode on Mr Zelensky's path to the presidency.""
Throughout the campaign, the actor has appeared to draw support from a large cross section of the population. Zelenskiy adviser Dmytro Razumkov recently told NPR's Lucian Kim that he, ""already popular among young people, has widened his electoral base to include older generations and has evenly balanced support among Ukrainian- and Russian-speaking voters.""
His appeal, Kim reports, ""doesn't lie in any specifics of his platform but in the mere fact that he is a fresh face with no political baggage from the past.""
Poroshenko was elected in 2014 vowing to fight corruption, but Kim adds that goal is ""still out of reach.""
A major issue in this electoral race is the country's relationship with Russia, which annexed the area of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. As Kim notes, Poroshenko's campaign is pushing the idea that ""he is the only candidate who can stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.""
And, he's hoping to have multiple debates to make his case. As Interfax Ukraine reports, Poroshenko's campaign is arguing that there should be two rounds of debates – one in a stadium, and one in a TV studio. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"

Evergreen Elementary School in Columbus County is clean, tidy, and nearly 100 years old. Light comes in through parts of the roof in the gym where the dark brown floor boards have buckled up in little swollen hills two inches tall. Classrooms inside the main building are small based on today's standards, the auditorium is not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act and technology is an afterthought. Listen Listening... / Wilson Sayre reports for WUNC on how a proposed education bond could be a significant boon for rural schools in North Carolina.
“Its hard, it's really hard, because everything's old,” said Harvey LeSane, janitor at Evergreen Elementary. “There's a lot of bricks and stuff just worn out, sidewalks cracked, fences just torn from all the long years and wear and tear.”
North Carolina schools, including places like Evergreen Elementary, are in need of roughly $8 billion worth of renovation and construction, according to the latest state facilities survey . And there does seems to be bipartisan agreement in the General Assembly that the state should contribute to some of those repairs. House Speaker Tim Moore's version of that push, HB 241 , would prioritize low-wealth counties in the allocation of funds.
“One of the things that poses a problem for us is economics,” said Jonathan Williams, interim superintendent for Columbus County Schools. “We are one of the poorer districts in the state. We don't let that stop us of course, but that is [one] of the obstacles.”
In North Carolina, individual school districts pay for the upkeep, maintenance and construction of the school buildings. That money comes from property taxes or whatever grants the county can pull down from the state and federal governments.
In a county like Columbus, with lower incomes and a shrinking population, that’s a dwindling pool of funds.
“It's not fair,” said Williams. “[Our students] deserve anything on par with other children in the state of North Carolina. And there are many [counties] in our situation.”
After years of patching up Evergreen Elementary, the county is having to figure out an alternative: consolidating schools and – if the county can find the money – maybe building a new school.
“If you started talking about remodeling a building like [Evergreen], when you were finished you'd still have – see the cracking going up there?” Columbus County Interim Superintendent Jonathan Williams points to the corner of the Evergreen Elementary School gym. “You'd still have an old building with a fresh coat of paint, but the foundation [isn't there].”
Williams says you can find scenes like this all over the county.
“We are growing at a greater rate now than in any time anyone can think of in recent history,” said House Speaker Tim Moore. “Our unemployment rate is at record low levels. Wages are the highest they've been in many, many years. Taxes are the lowest they've been in decades … But it isn't necessarily always reaching to other areas of this state.”
Moore's bill would ask voters to approve a $1.9 billion bond in November 2020. Of that, $1.5 billion would go to districts for school repairs. The remaining funds would go for similar repairs and construction costs at state universities and community colleges.
Forty percent of the capital funds for public school is specifically targeted towards school districts in low-wealth counties. Additionally, Moore's plan would guarantees that counties like Columbus receive a minimum of $10 million for school construction.
“I represent a rural area,” said Moore, “and I've seen particularly our rural areas that have had some of the greatest challenges when it comes to affording school construction. And as I've traveled the state I've seen this from literally from Manteo to Murphy. And I think this is an opportunity to invest some funds back into those local communities.”
Moore also proposes that wealthier counties with booming populations like Mecklenburg and Wake match a certain percentage of the state dollars with local funds. These counties have their own set of challenges – they can't build schools fast enough.
Moore's bill easily passed the House with bipartisan support. However, there is a competing bill in the both Senate ( SB 5 ) and in the House ( HB 381 ). Those bills would fund the school repairs and capital projects directly with general revenue funds, instead of a bond. Bonds puts the state in debt and ultimately have to be approved by voters in a general election, but bonds also guarantee the money for a specific purpose over the duration of the bond. The competing bills would require the General Assembly to keep the money available each year, a pay-as-you-go approach.
Governor Roy Cooper has proposed $2 billion for school construction and maintenance as part of a larger General Obligation Bond in his recommended budget .
“We're early enough in the session where we can have the discussion, we can float the ideas around and in the end come up with something that's going to result in school construction,” he said, as long as it gets to the counties that need the money.
Jonathan Williams, the Columbus County interim superintendent, drove to Old Dock Elementary School in the southeastern part of the county to see how things were going. The school is an example of the kind of building they’d like to construct over the next few years. Old Dock once had floors so thin there were parts that were falling through. After a fire gutted the main building in 2015, insurance money paid for the new construction.
“This has really done wonders for our community and for our kids here, they love love love coming to school,” said Ronna Gore, principal at Old Dock. “Not that they didn't before, but they absolutely love coming now ... it's pretty and it's new, it's vibrant, it's colorful.”
And, it's changed how they're able to teach. The school now has the capacity for more than one computer lab and digital screens that are used as interactive blackboards.
“I mean if we are competing to be global citizens and competitive students and stuff we really really have to have these classrooms like this,” said Gore.
“I feel like our students deserve the best that we can give them,” said Williams. “We can't give them the Taj Mahal but we certainly deserve better. This bond, the $10 million for Columbus County, would go a long way.”

The foundation covers the six westernmost counties in North Carolina following the sale of Mission Health to for-profit health system HCA Health. The foundation was formed at the beginning of 2019. Candidates from all six counties and the Qualla Boundary were asked to serve based on criteria ranging from their expertise with social determinants of health to their community ties, according to the press release. “I’m so grateful for the incredible experience and dedication these board members bring to our newly-formed organization,” says Jane Kimsey, chair of the board. “Their investment in improving the lives of those in our community is inspiring and will make an impact on generations to come.” The new board members are as follows: David Garrett, Vice Chair (Regional Representative/Jackson County); Sonya Wachacha, Secretary (Qualla Boundary); Lisa Leatherman, Interim-Treasurer (Regional Representative/Macon County); Alison Cochran (Swain County); Jason Johnson (Cherokee County); Angie Knight (Graham County) and Debbie Mauney (Clay County). The board may still add up to six additional members, according to their by-laws. Dogwood Health Trust, the foundation created from Mission’s sale to HCA, has already promised $5 million for the next three years to all six of the regional hospital foundations. Each foundation has transformed to support the region instead of the for-profit hospital. Dogwood Health Trust recently launched their search for a CEO. The foundation headquarters is currently listed in Franklin, NC. They have not yet announced the opening of their offices."
Tamino Channels Voices From His Arabic Heritage Into His Own Eccentric Sound,wcqs.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/tamino-channels-voices-his-arabic-heritage-his-own-eccentric-sound,"By Noah Caldwell & Christina Cala • 4 hours ago Tamino's latest album, Amir, is out now. Ramy Fouad / Courtesy of the artist Listen / Originally published on April 5, 2019 7:45 pm
At 22 years old, Tamino possesses a voice that carries the hypnotic, immediate power of something much more ancient. Born Tamino Moharam Fouad and named after a prince in Mozart's The Magic Flute , the Belgian-Egyptian artist explores his heritage by combining his own sound with Arabic influences of his Lebanese and Egyptian ancestors. Tamino's debut album, Amir, out now , melds together the artist's eccentric vocal style with Arab musical theory.
When Tamino was a kid, he found an old guitar gathering dust in a cupboard while visiting family in Cairo, and brought it back home with him to Belgium. The guitar was once played by Muharram Fouad, Tamino's grandfather and a famous Egyptian singer who starred in Hassan and Nayima, which is, as Tamino tells it, ""the Romeo and Juliet of Egyptian cinema.""
""The songs played in that movie became hits, not only in Egypt but the whole Arabic world, actually,"" Tamino says. ""He had a very long career until the '80s, but he died unfortunately when I was 5, so I don't really have memories of him. I only have his music.""
Left behind for Tamino were cassettes of his grandfather's music. Tamino was able to incorporate the music on the cassettes into his own music for the album with the help of a friend. YouTube
""She takes the cassettes...she makes new sounds with them,"" Tamino says. ""You cannot recognize them anymore, but for me, it was symbolically very important that these sounds came from these cassettes that I had all my life.""
Amir alsofeatures Nagham Zikrayat , an orchestra of Middle Eastern instrumentalists, many of whom are refugees from Iraq and Syria. ""They capture the essence of Arabic music from like the '50s and the '60s — we call it the golden age of Arabic music,"" Tamino says about working with Nagham Zikraya. ""They add this individuality and charisma in what they are playing.""
Tamino says there's a lot he still has to discover about the country and culture of Egypt. Though he's visited many times, he has yet to play there.
""The language is gonna be hard. I know it's gonna be hard, but the one thing that's not hard is the music,"" he says. ""It's the one thing I've always had a connection to. It's the one thing that just feels like it's in me — like a homecoming."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
Paint-By-Numbers Maestro Dan Robbins Dies At 93,wcqs.org,Elizabeth Blair,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/paint-numbers-maestro-dan-robbins-dies-93,"By Elizabeth Blair • 4 hours ago Paint By Numbers Collection / NMAH Archives Center Listen / Originally published on April 5, 2019 7:45 pm
Critics were aghast, but hobbyists couldn't get enough of it: In the mid-1950s, paint-by-numbers kits were all the rage. Dan Robbins, the artist who helped invent those kits, died at a hospice on Monday in Sylvania, Ohio, at age 93.
After World War II, Robbins was working as a package designer for Palmer Paint Company in Detroit. Company owner Max Klein was looking for a product that would appeal to adult hobbyists, and Robbins remembered something he learned in high school: Leonardo da Vinci's numbering system.
""I remembered hearing about how Leonardo da Vinci would challenge his own students or apprentices with creative assignments."" Robbins wrote in his autobiography. ""He would hand out numbered patterns indicating where certain colors should be used in specific projects such as underpainting, preliminary background colors or some lesser works that did not require his immediate attention.""
Palmer began to produce paint-by-number kits under the name Craft Master. At first, Robbins created his own compositions for the kits. ""Dad was strong in seascapes so he did a lot of those at first,"" says his son, Larry Robbins. ""Then he'd go back, lay a clear plastic sheet over the original and assign numbers to the colors he'd laid down."" Beginner kits might have only 20 colors, intermediate kits as many as 30 or 40. Leisure time being at an all-time high after the war, some 20 million paint-by-number kits sold in 1955 alone.
In 2001, the Smithsonian Museum of American History explored the, er, style with the exhibition Paint by Number: Accounting for Taste in the 1950s ,curated by William Lawrence Bird — now curator emeritus. What astonished Bird most was how Klein and Robbins figured out what people wanted to paint in order to keep up with the craze. ""They had a customer base that was dependent on them to produce new subjects. So they'd read the mail,"" People wanted pets, he adds — kittens, puppies and horses. The Last Supper was a particularly big hit. ""And some people, when they would finish a painting, they would sign it."" He put brushes into the hands of people. - William Lawrence Bird
But Klein and Robbin's Craft Master paint-by-numbers kits didn't strike gold or even silver for their company, which faced bankruptcy at the height of their popularity. ""Dan told me some 30 other companies entered the field, producing kits left and right,"" says Bird. ""So it became a craze that was beyond his power to control.""
Robbins kept on making his own art and working freelance for commercial clients. Curator emeritus Bird says one of those jobs was designing Happy Meals for McDonald's.
As for the critics who dismissed paint-by-numbers as a ridiculous endeavor, Larry Robbins says his dad didn't seem bothered by it.
""The big dilemma was 'Is it art or not?' I don't think dad got caught up in defending it one way or another,"" he says. Robbins believes his father took pride in giving people who might not otherwise have the opportunity ""the experience of what it was like to paint,"" regardless of their ability.
Bird agrees. He says Robbins ""democratized access to the apparatus of art for people who would never have been exposed to them otherwise. He put brushes into the hands of people."" And, he adds, some of those people might have even been inspired to pick up their brushes and paint ""without numbers."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
"Report Finds More Than 47,000 'Structurally Deficient' Bridges In The U.S.",wcqs.org,Samantha Raphelson,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/report-finds-more-47000-structurally-deficient-bridges-us,"By Samantha Raphelson • 1 minute ago New York's Brooklyn Bridge is one of more than 47,000 bridges identified as ""structurally deficient,"" according to the annual report from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images Originally published on April 5, 2019 4:01 pm
The collapse of a bridge earlier this week in Tennessee is raising new alarms about the delicate state of infrastructure across the U.S.
Tennessee Department of Transportation engineers say that a concrete overpass spanning an interstate highway in Chattanooga fell when a truck carrying an oversized load hit the bottom of the bridge and sliced through steel beams underneath. One person driving underneath the bridge was injured, police say.
The accident is renewing concerns about the deterioration of bridges across the country. According to a new report from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA), more than 47,000 bridges in the U.S. are in poor condition and in need of urgent repairs. The organization, which analyzes data from the Federal Highway Administration and releases an annual report on bridges, estimates it will take more than 80 years to fix all of the nation's deficient bridges.
""Structurally deficient"" doesn't mean the bridges are about to collapse, says Alison Black, chief economist for ARTBA. It just means the bridges are in need of renovation but are not unsafe for crossing, she tells Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd.
The number of structurally deficient bridges is actually down by about 7,000 from 2017, but those bridges weren't fixed. The number fell because the Federal Highway Administration weakened the standards of what it means for a bridge to be deficient, the report explains.
""What we saw in Tennessee this week was an extreme case, but these are bridges which again are in poor condition, and they do need to be fixed,"" Black says. ""And in addition to those bridges that are structurally deficient, about four out of 10 bridges across the country need some sort of major rehabilitation work. So unfortunately, it's not just these 47,000 structures that need to be fixed.""
The report notes that these deficient bridges are crossed some 178 million times a day. Some of the most notable bridges deemed deficient in the report include New York's Brooklyn Bridge, which opened in 1883; Memorial Bridge connecting Washington, D.C. to Arlington, Va., across the Potomac River; the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge, which spans California's San Francisco Bay; and Florida's Pensacola Bay Bridge, which is known among locals as the Three-Mile Bridge.
The idea that bridges in the U.S. are crumbling isn't a new discovery. What's significant about this report is that repairs in 2018 were at their slowest pace in five years. A lack of federal funding is contributing to the downturn, Black says. State initiatives to raise gas taxes are helping, but it's not enough.
""There's not a lot of new money. It really is just keeping pace with project costs and inflation,"" Black says. ""I think if we saw a significant increase in the federal funding side of this that would really go a long way to help states that are trying to provide some of these repairs and fix these bridges.""
President Trump has repeatedly vowed that he will fix the nation's infrastructure, and he unveiled a $1 trillion proposal last year. There are now discussions between congressional leaders and the administration on a possible bipartisan infrastructure bill .
Last week, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, announced her own infrastructure plan – similar to Trump's in its price tag – that would raise the corporate tax rate to help states pay for repairs to bridges, roads and highways.
While bridge collapses are rare, Black says states will be forced to place new restrictions and even close some bridges if the current pace of repairs continues. That happened just last week in Mississippi, when the state Department of Transportation identified 34 bridges that need to be closed. But, Black notes, there is an economic cost when bridge closures divert freight shipping.
""Public safety is absolutely the No. 1 concern of state [departments of transportation] and local governments, and what you're seeing in Mississippi is taking that responsibility to close those structures that are unsafe,"" Black says. ""The other steps that we see, which might be very common, is if you're driving over a bridge and you see that there are weight restrictions, but there's also a cost to that."" Copyright 2019 NPR.

The End Is Near For 3.2 Beer,wcqs.org,Frank Morris,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/end-near-32-beer,"By Frank Morris • 4 hours ago Beginning April 1, grocery stories in Kansas no longer have to sell beer limited to 3.2 percent alcohol. Frank Morris / KCUR Originally published on April 5, 2019 6:23 pm
For many decades now, the only beer you could buy in Kansas grocery and convenience stores was limited to 3.2 percent alcohol.
But on Monday, that 3.2 beer became a thing of the past.
""It's a big step for the groceries and the state of Kansas,"" says Dennis Toney, an executive with Ball's Food Stores. ""We've all wanted this for quite some time.""
Kansas is one of the last states to do away with this Depression-era alcohol, which looks likely to soon die out altogether.
The ""long shadow of Prohibition""
To understand where 3.2 beer came from, you have to go back 86 years to 1933. Nine months before Prohibition was completely repealed, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, fulfilling a campaign promise. The compromise ended up being 3.2 and it frankly, it's an arbitrary number. There's nothing magical about it. - Maureen Ogle, beer historian
Because Prohibition was still officially the law, there had to be a limit on the amount of alcohol allowed in beer. Hearings were held and the political process worked out a standard that could gather the necessary votes — 3.2 percent alcohol by weight.
""The compromise ended up being 3.2 and it frankly, it's an arbitrary number. There's nothing magical about it,"" says Maureen Ogle, author of Ambitious Brew: The Story of American Beer .
Ogle says that after the federal government legalized all liquor, the 3.2 percent alcohol by weight standard took hold in many states as a middle course between allowing alcohol and not — a sort of temperance light.
""I just call it the 'long shadow of Prohibition,' "" Ogle says.
Regulators set 3.2 beer apart from other drinks. An influential study in the 1930s labeled it a non-intoxicating beverage.
After Prohibition, states established a crazy quilt of alcohol regulations. Many, including Kansas, made special provisions for 3.2 beer. In some states, it was the only drink allowed. Other states made it easier to buy than stronger beer, wine and spirits.
Teen consumption fueled 3.2 sales
Sales of 3.2 were big about 40 years ago, in the 1970s, says Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. This was fueled, in part, by teen consumption. ""That's a time when a lot of states had rules that differentiated consumption for 18- to 21-year-olds,"" Watson says.
In other words, 18-year-olds could legally drink, in many states, as long as they were drinking 3.2 beer. Younger kids found it easy to get, too.
American teen drinking peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By the mid-1980s, the country adopted a uniform minimum drinking age of 21. Watson says that one by one, states scrapped special rules for 3.2 beer.
""So the types of carve-outs that said grocery stores, convenience stores, chain retailers can only sell 3.2 started to slowly go away,"" says Watson. ""Generally this kind of category of 3.2 has been slowly regulated out of existence.""
Oklahoma and Colorado changed their laws last year. The new standard in Kansas, which took effect on Monday, lifts the cap on beer alcohol levels, but only to a degree. The new maximum is 6 percent alcohol by volume. Frank Morris / KCUR
The new standard in Kansas, which took effect on Monday, lifts the cap on beer alcohol levels, but only to a degree. The new maximum is 6 percent alcohol by volume. That will allow for a wide selection of beers but will exclude many high-end craft brews, some of which come in at more than twice the strength the new Kansas limit allows.
Still, brewers are also happy to see the end of the 3.2 percent alcohol by weight standard.
Jeff Krum, president of Boulevard Brewing Co. in Kansas City, talks with distaste about decades of making 3.2 beer for Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado grocery stores.
""It was just a pain in the posterior, you know, for everyone,"" says Krum. ""We're ... very excited to get out of the 3.2 business.""
Other brewers have abandoned the segment as well because the market for 3.2 is drying up.
Utah brewers will ditch the 3.2 standard on Nov. 1. That will leave just one state, Minnesota, selling 3.2 beer.
And Jamie Pfuhl, president of the Minnesota Grocers Association, says store owners are already beginning to have a hard time finding the stuff.
""It does feel lonely and it's frustrating because nobody wants to be last,"" says Pfuhl. Copyright 2019 KCUR 89.3. To see more, visit KCUR 89.3 . © 2019 BPR"
"In 'What You Have Heard Is True,' A Poet Bears Witness To Devastating Civil War",wcqs.org,Craig Morgan Teicher,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/what-you-have-heard-true-poet-bears-witness-devastating-civil-war,"By Craig Morgan Teicher • 4 hours ago Originally published on April 5, 2019 2:04 pm
The poet Carolyn Forché was 27 when a stranger showed up on her doorstep, unrolled a giant sheet of paper on her dining room table, and proceeded to give her a masterclass in Central American geopolitics and the crisis unfolding in El Salvador.
""There is soon going to be a war,"" the man says.
This is how What You Have Heard Is True begins. It is Forché's extraordinary memoir of the late 1970s, the years after she published her first book of poetry, when she traveled to El Salvador in the lead up to that country's devastating 12 year civil war, in which tens of thousands were killed. Written with a thriller writer's knack for narrative tension and a poet's gorgeous sentences and empathy, it is also an intimate portrait of Leonel Gómez Vides, the stranger who drove up from El Salvador on a tip from a mutual friend and dramatically altered the course of Forché's life. He was a shadowy and contradictory figure — a revolutionary, an activist and organizer, a political chess player. He worked on behalf of the campesinos ( the peasant farmers), was neither on the side of the guerrilla fighters nor the U.S.-backed military dictatorship, and ultimately helped broker peace between the two sides, and the birth of El Salvador's democracy in 1992.
Gómez invites Forché to his country, drafting her as a kind of factotum, a witness and helper in his campaign: ""you could see quite a bit of the country, I think, and you could learn about the situation, and then you could come back here, and when the war begins, you would be in a position to explain it to the Americans,"" he says.
Much of the book unfolds in the passenger seat of Gómez's car, where his lessons continue. Forché is transformed from a young poet with an unfocused ""urge to do something in the face of some wrongdoing or injustice inflicted against another"" into the lifelong activist and a ""poet of witness"" she has called herself since.
By Gómez's side, she meets campesinos , mixes with insurgents, endures anxious interviews with military personnel, and evades death squads. Gómez's goal is to show her the contradictory truths of his country, a model of corrupt rule and the careful, painful process by which it is overthrown, so that she can ultimately show us. ""What do you see?"" Gómez asks again and again.
Though it took Forché half a lifetime to fully share what she saw — this time is also more cryptically recalled in her second book of poems, The Country Between Us (1982) — now is precisely when we need to see it. Forché paints a beautiful and chilling portrait of pre-war El Salvador, with its ""fields of corn and cane and cotton crops broken by bony, pastured cattle, and along the road, walking the shoulders on both sides, women with clay water urns balanced on their heads, barefoot children following behind them."" The campesinos live in houses ""made of mud and twigs, and things you would find in a dump,"" while the colonels own vast mansions. Driving the dangerous roads between the two, Forché sees many victims of the government death squads, ""bodies lying on the shoulder of the road, a turkey buzzard alighting on one.""
In Forché's stark rendering — she struggles at first to accept what she sees, and then her vision gains a camera's coldness — all of this is simply heart-stopping, and feels utterly present, utterly pressing. There may never be a world without corrupt and murderous governments — as the headlines of the last three years more than attest — and so, Forché argues, through the work of description and narration, we must bear witness, must never look away.
""It isn't the risk of death and fear of danger that prevent people from rising up,"" says Gómez, whom Forché portrays as a hero on a massive scale. ""It is numbness, acquiescence, and the defeat of the mind. Resistance to oppression begins when people realize deeply within themselves that something better is possible.""
This lesson, one of many Gómez has for us, is as relevant in today's America as it was in El Salvador 40 years ago. In a small way, this book may help us heed it. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"

"Rohingya Settle In For The Long Haul, Even As Bangladesh Wants Refugees To Go Home",wcqs.org,Jason Beaubien,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/rohingya-settle-long-haul-even-bangladesh-wants-refugees-go-home,"By Jason Beaubien • 5 hours ago Children play at a Rohingya refugee camp outside Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. Mahmud Hossain Opu for NPR Listen / Originally published on April 5, 2019 9:18 pm
Along the edge of the largest camp sheltering Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, hundreds of men and women with shovels and wicker baskets are turning a barren hill into a parking lot-sized plateau. The newly leveled land will eventually hold new stronger shelters for refugees from overcrowded parts of the camps.
Under the direction of engineers from the World Food Program, the day laborers are building retaining walls, terracing slopes and digging massive drainage ditches. Rohingya day laborers terrace a hillside on the edge of the world's largest refugee camp in Bangladesh. Jason Beaubien/NPR
""We are here creating safe land for living,"" declares Mosa Alshalabi, a WFP engineer. ""Because that soil,"" he says pointing at some sandy cliffs in front of him, ""that soil is not safe at all. All these houses when it rains, the soil [beneath them] will be washed away.""
The Bangladeshi government continues to insist that the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees crammed into camps like this one outside Cox's Bazar are just temporary visitors. It wants them to go home. But a year and a half after most of the refugees arrived, there are few signs that they will leave anytime soon. Shoring up land for new homes, growing their own food and enrolling in religious schools, they appear to be settling in for the long haul. There are even playgrounds popping up in some places, with solid metal slides and swing sets.
For aid groups, the response has had to shift from treating Rohingya needs as a short-term humanitarian crisis to coming up with longer-term ways to support the refugees.
Alshalabi says over the last few weeks, the work crews have literally been moving mountains.
""For example, that road wasn't here,"" he says. Pointing in the opposite direction, he adds, ""That was a mountain. We cut that mountain to make a platform safe for living.""
More than 1,000 Rohingya refugees, working on a recent day for the WFP's construction crews in an area called Camp 4 Extension, earn roughly $5 a day to move buckets of sand and dig drainage ditches.
At one point last year, in a desperate push ahead of the monsoons, Alshalabi says the WFP employed more than 5,000 Rohingya day laborers to reinforce drainage canals, build bamboo bridges and install other basic infrastructure in the sprawling refugee camp. Construction is underway to put in drainage ditches and stabilize hillsides on the edges of the Kutupalong section of the sprawling refugee camp. The shored-up land will be used for new shelters for residents currently living in overcrowded areas of the settlement. Mahmud Hossain Opu for NPR
The expanse of newly terraced hillsides, shored-up roads, dump trucks and work crews looks anything but temporary. Yet the Bangladesh government bans Rohingya from building what it calls ""permanent"" houses. So even the new shelters are made of plastic tarps wrapped around solid bamboo frames.
""I would like to go back to Myanmar""
Most of the Rohingya refugees took shelter in these camps late in 2017, after escaping brutal attacks on their villages in Myanmar by pro-government militias. Nearly 700,000 Rohingya fled across the Naf River into southeastern Bangladesh. They joined roughly a quarter of a million other Rohingya who had already fled earlier violence.
Aid officials are cautious about speculating on how long the Rohingya might stay in Bangladesh. U.N. and other humanitarian officials stress that any return to Myanmar should be voluntary. A student holds an Islamic text at a madrassa in the Kutupalong Rohingya refugee camp. With limited educational opportunities for children in the camps, many Rohingya families are sending their kids to madrassas to study Arabic and Islamic studies. Mahmud Hossain Opu for NPR
Rohingya Muslims are a long-persecuted ethnic and religious minority in Myanmar (previously known as Burma). They have lived in the region for generations, but officials in Myanmar refuse to recognize them as citizens, referring to them as ""Bengali"" — suggesting that they are from Bangladesh, even though they don't speak the same language — and limiting their movement inside Myanmar. Rohingya girls study at a madrassa in the Balukali refugee camp in Bangladesh. Jason Beaubien/NPR
In 2017, after an armed Rohingya separatist group attacked a police station, Myanmar soldiers and pro-government militias launched what the U.N. and human rights groups have denounced as a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Entire villages were burned to the ground. Thousands were killed.
Myanmar officials say the violence was a security operation targeting terrorists, and the Rohingya refugees are welcome to come home. Myanmar has refused to allow United Nations investigators or international journalists into the country to investigate the alleged massacres. It has jailed two Myanmar reporters who were investigating the killing of Rohingya Muslims for Reuters.
Bangladesh says the refugees have overwhelmed the area around Cox's Bazar and has been pushing for them to return to Myanmar as soon as possible. Host countries seldom have the ability or desire to absorb huge numbers of refugees. But Bangladesh's campaign late last year offering free transportation and resettlement benefits to any refugee willing to go back to Myanmar had exactly zero takers.
In fact — if other refugee crises around the globe are a reasonable guide — it is rare for people fleeing conflict to return home very quickly. Some studies have said that the average refugee will end up in exile for 17 years, although that number has been disputed recently.
Balukali is a densely settled part of what is now the largest refugee camp in the world — it merged with another camp, Kutupalong, and the combined camp now holds nearly 650,000 people. This is more than twice the size of the world's next-biggest camp in Uganda , and about three times as large as the infamous Dadaab camp in Kenya.
The Rohingya refugees in Balukali are packed so tightly together that the residents of one shelter can often reach out and touch their neighbors' hut. Workers have been trying to install solar street lights but have struggled to find enough open space to install concrete footings for the lamp poles.
Noor Kamal, 40, arrived in Balukali along with almost everyone else here in the fall of 2017. Like so many of the residents, he says he fled the militias torching their villages.
""I would like to go back to Myanmar,"" he says. But he quickly adds that it could be years before he's able to do so. For now, he says it wouldn't be safe to return and he doesn't know when it will be.
Evolving needs — and demands
Ever since the wave of Rohingya started pouring out of Myanmar in 2017, the refugees have had a fairly consistent set of demands for Myanmar: safety, citizenship and a return of their land. Now Kamal and many others in the camps have a new priority on their list: justice. They want the people who organized and carried out the attacks to be held accountable.
""We want them prosecuted for the crimes they committed against us,"" Kamal says.
Given that Myanmar denies the attacks and journalists who have tried to investigate the atrocities have been arrested, prosecution appears a long way off.
""It may take a long time,"" Kamal concedes.
To ease the long-term environmental impact of so many refugees — a population roughly the size of Denver's living in what used to be a nature preserve — international aid groups have built a massive sewage treatment plant on the edge of the Kutupalong section of the camp. Deep wells have been dug to try to make sure the refugees have access to clean drinking water.
Originally, every family cooked over open fires made from wood gathered from nearby hillsides. Eventually, the hillsides were stripped bare. As more and more areas were denuded, women and children walked for miles to collect wood further and further from the camps. It was clearly unsustainable, yet families still needed to cook. A Rohingya refugee carries a gas cylinder back to his shelter in the Balukali refugee camp. The U.N. refugee agency, along with other aid organizations, has launched a program to replace wood cooking fires with gas stoves. Mahmud Hossain Opu for NPR
In response, aid groups have begun distributing single-burner gas cookstoves to every household in the camps. This has meant setting up distribution points for residents to swap their used canisters of bottled gas. The U.N. refugee agency and other groups have budgeted $30 million a year for the bottled gas program.
In another sign of this refugee situation shifting from crisis to long-term humanitarian problem, the World Food Program is moving away from handing out monthly rations of rice, beans and cooking oil to every family. Instead, it is creating retail stores where refugees can shop for groceries using electronic rations cards. Each month, rather than shipping tons of food, the agency will simply load credit onto the refugees' cards.
Refugee children still aren't officially allowed to go to schools. Bangladeshi officials don't want the kids settling in. UNICEF and other agencies have instead set up ""learning centers"" and ""child-friendly spaces"" where Rohingya kids go for an hour or two a day to study math and English. But Bangladeshi officials don't allow the Rohingya-speaking children to learn Bengali.
Mohammed Arfaan, who is also a Rohingya refugee runs the Al Jamia Darul Arfaan madrassa in the Balukali 1 camp. He says many Rohingya parents are sending their kids to religious schools — 400 students are enrolled at his alone, from nursery school to 12th grade. After a break this spring for Ramadan, his school will add room for another 100 students, he says.
Arfaan's seminary is funded by an aid group from Malayasia. Classes focus on the Quran and Islamic studies, but students can also learn Arabic and English. The madrassas fill an important role for many Rohingya in the camps, he emphasizes.
""It's important for us to study our religion because we will die one day,"" he says. ""It's important for us to study languages to be able to speak with you in English and with people in Arabic for business. We need to educate teachers so they can educate our children.""
In another sign that refugees have moved beyond just thinking about daily survival, many have started planting gardens. Fatima Katu, 40, has started a small garden at her home in the refugee camp. Compared to her previous shelter in the camp, she says, ""We have more space here and now it feels like home."" Mahmud Hossain Opu for NPR
""I'm very happy here,"" says Fatima Katu, a 40-year-old mother of six standing next to a huge squash vine that's climbed up on to the roof of her shelter. Katu recently moved with her husband and children to a new cluster of homes in Camp 4 Extension, among the neat rows of shelters made of tarps and bamboo.
In addition to the squash vines, Katu has planted beans and chili peppers in a small plot along the south side of their shelter.
Back in Myanmar, her family had a much larger farm, with animals and rice fields. But now, with at least a small plot to grow vegetables, she says she is getting used to a new life in Bangladesh.
Compared to the cramped shelter they first lived in, she says, ""We have more space here and now it feels like home.""
She can easily see staying in the Bangladesh camp for another five years, she says, maybe even 10. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
All Right. Some Cats Do Fetch,wcqs.org,Matthew S. Schwartz,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/all-right-some-cats-do-fetch,"By Matthew S. Schwartz • 5 hours ago Some cats can be trained to do the same things dogs can do. Diane Bondareff / AP Images for Purina Pro Plan Originally published on April 5, 2019 7:06 pm
A tongue-in-cheek NPR.org headline comparing the fetching abilities of cats and dogs revealed a truth known by countless cat owners: Some cats do fetch.
""Cats Don't Fetch, But Know Their Names As Well As Dogs, Researchers Say,"" the original headline proclaimed. This didn't sit well with some readers.
""In what world do cats not fetch?"" Kate Haffey commented on Facebook.
""Artemis knows her name and fetches,"" Brandi Whitson said on Twitter. ""She's obsessed.""
""My cat fetches, but only when he wants to,"" commented Charlie Whelan. ""Which is why I like cats.""
So if cats can fetch, why have they earned such a reputation for recalcitrance, especially compared with dogs?
""The success of dogs is built around their ability to please people — this is how they get their food and shelter,"" Jeff Podos, an animal behavior specialist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, told NPR. ""This is what dogs are all about. The more they please their owners, the more benefits they gain. Whereas cats just don't have this same imperative."" Not all cats will play fetch but mine sure does! pic.twitter.com/3nh5BZAHzm — onetoad3 (@onetoad3) April 5, 2019
Yet in their natural, wild state, ""cats are actually probably more prone to fetching things, and bringing things to you, than dogs,"" said Andrea Tu, medical director at Behavior Vets in New York City. Think about people who come home to see that their cat has brought a half-eaten present, she said. In the wild, bringing things back to the den — the natural-world equivalent to a game of fetch — is natural behavior for cats. Not so much for wild dogs.
We've been domesticating dogs for much longer than we've been domesticating cats — so long that we even have a breed called a retriever, bred solely for their inclination to retrieve. So humans have essentially bred the game of fetch into modern dogs, Tu explained. That's not to say all dogs will fetch — but they're more likely to be into it than domesticated cats.
Still, cats are absolutely trainable, Tu said. She has had luck with click training, where people play a distinctive sound every time the cat performs a desirable behavior. This can even work if the cat doesn't instinctively run after a ball when you throw it, she said: Just click, and give the cat a treat, every time it looks at the ball rolling past. Once the cat gets used to that, change the criteria — wait until the cat turns its head, then click. Keep delaying the reward to encourage fetching behavior.
As NPR has reported , even a bumblebee could probably learn to fetch. Clint Perry, a cognitive biologist at Queen Mary University of London, taught bees to roll a ball to the center of a platform in exchange for sugar water. Shown with a puppet how to complete the task, the bees quickly caught on. They even improved on what they were shown, finding a more direct route for the ball. ""This all shows an unprecedented level of cognitive flexibility, especially for a miniature brain,"" Perry said. YouTube
""There are certainly lots of animals who could fetch, but for whom it would never cross their mind,"" said Podos. ""Most any primate could in theory do it — but they have no motivation.""
Cats have a more limited attention span than dogs, Tu said. They might focus for only a few minutes, after which they'll need a break. But keep at it, and Tu thinks someone could train a cat to fetch in just a couple of days.
The cat might think: "" 'Humans are weird,' "" she said, "" 'but I get treats!' "" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
How Will Buncombe County's Education & Non-Profit Institutions Be Affected By Murdock Revelations?,wcqs.org,Matt Bush,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/how-will-buncombe-countys-education-non-profit-institutions-be-affected-murdock-revelations,"10:19 BPR's Matt Bush speaks with Asheville Citizen-Times reporter Jennifer Bowman...
Reverberations will continue to be felt in Asheville and Buncombe County's educational and non-profit institutions following the renewed attention given to retiring Eblen Charities CEO Bill Murdock's 1988 guilty plea to a misdemeanor sex crime with a minor. UNC Asheville and A-B Tech were the first to be in the spotlight, but the Buncombe County and Asheville City school systems continue to face questions about Murdock, who was hired by the city school system after his guilty plea, and was appointed to the A-B Tech Board of Trustees in 2016 at the recommendation of the county school system.
Asheville Citizen-Times reporter Jennifer Bowman has had a busy week covering the fallout of the new Murdock revelations. On Monday, the A-B Tech Board of Trustees held its first meeting since Murdock announced his resignation from the board on March 22nd. That meeting featured heated discussion on who knew how much and when about Murdock's criminal past. Then on Thursday and Friday, the Citizen-Times published a two-part story with interviews from the victim of Murdock's abuse Shelley Love Baldwin. In it, she described how she felt let down by both school systems as well as the legal system. Murdock was initially charged with a felony count, but that was later reduced to a misdemeanor charge which authorities say does not exist in North Carolina criminal code. Murodck co-founded Eblen Charities following his guilty plea, and announced his retirement as CEO when the new revelations from Baldwin were first reported by CNN.
Bowman was the first to report on the UNC Asheville Board of Trustees holding an emergency meeting in secret on March 8th, the first inkling that larger revelations about Murdock's past were about to go public. That meeting was eventually found to be about the honorary degree the school had given Murdock in 2018. He has since returned that degree to the school. Bowman sat down with BPR's Matt Bush to discuss the latest in the story.
Disclosure: A-B Tech and UNC Asheville are both business sponsors of Blue Ridge Public Radio. Dr. Dennis King, the president of A-B Tech, is also a member of the Western North Carolina Public Radio Inc. Board of Directors, which oversees Blue Ridge Public Radio. Tags:"
