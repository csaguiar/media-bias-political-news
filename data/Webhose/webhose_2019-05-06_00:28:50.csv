EXCLUSIVE: Leaked Assange Court Transcript Sheds Light on US-Backed Ecuadorian Expulsion Plans,dcgazette.com,505335761211,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://dcgazette.com/2019/exclusive-leaked-assange-court-transcript-sheds-light-on-us-backed-ecuadorian-expulsion-plans/,"EXCLUSIVE: Leaked Assange Court Transcript Sheds Light on US-Backed Ecuadorian Expulsion Plans 04/07/2019 The Gateway Pundit has exclusively obtained a court transcript of an appeal made by WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange in an Ecuadorian court, in which the publisher accused the Ecuadorian government of preparing to revoke his political asylum at the behest of the United States and United Kingdom.
Assange has not been heard from in public since March 28, 2018 after an executive gag order by the government of Ecuador. The following, unpublished, “leaked” transcript of Assange asking an Ecuadorian court for an urgent injunction (“protection order”) against his gagging and isolation is from October 29, 2018.
Journalists and media were banned from recording the proceedings, but a court record was later obtained through legal process and provided to The Gateway Pundit. It has never before been revealed.
“I have been in this embassy without sunlight for six years and essentially isolated from most people for seven months and, including electronic communication, the telephone etc, from my young children,” Assange told the court according to the transcript.
“It has … interfered with my ability to work, to make a living, and with my deeply held principles that I have fought for all my life, which is to uphold the right of freedom of expression, the right for people to know, the right of the freedom of the press and the right for everyone to participate in their society and the broader society.”
Assange also told the Ecuadorian court that his gag order meant that he could not respond to false statements about himself.
“Due to my isolation, I have not been able to participate in the debates occurring around me and that has resulted in a climate of libel and fake news that might be expected for someone who has been in the business of exposing very large and very powerful corrupt organisations or organisations that abuse human rights.”
Assange also aid that members of the Ecuadorian Government had been involved in spreading information denigrating his character, something that he said saddened him given how proud he was of becoming an Ecuadorian citizen in 2017.
The publisher, who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, went on to detail the importance of his work. He specifically highlighted his publication of US diplomatic cables which revealed hard truths about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“There was no allegation that I had done anything other than what a journalist does, just that I have been a rather good one and effective one.”
The publisher stated that he did not apply for asylum at the embassy to live there. He applied so that he may go and live safely in Ecuador, but that the UK’s efforts to arrest him have made that impossible.
He went on to highlight the level of interference and security risks he faces at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has claimed asylum for the past seven years. Assange spoke of signal jammers placed in the embassy to prevent him making phone calls, as well as repeated attempts by unknown persons to break through his windows at night. He said that someone had even attempted to breach the window the night before this very testimony.
“I am an assassination risk. It is not a joke. It is a serious business,” Assange said.
The WikiLeaks publisher explained that he had claimed asylum on Ecuadorian soil on the basis that the country “was a democracy, that it respected the rule of law, that it was not a totalitarian, arbitrary or dictatorial State.”
Assange also listed key areas of the Ecuadorian constitution to protest the government’s gag order against him:
“Article 16.2, which says “all persons have the right to universal access to information and communication technologies.”
Article 66.2, which says “the following rights of persons are guaranteed: the right to voice one’s opinion and to express one’s thinking freely in all its forms and manifestations”.
Article 20, which says “the State shall guarantee the confidentiality of journalists’ sources.”
Article 41, which says “persons who have been granted asylum or sanctuary shall benefit from special protection, guaranteeing the full exercise of their rights” and that “the State shall respect and guarantee the principle of non-return,” meaning that refugees and asylum-claimants cannot be expelled.
Article 79, which says “in no case shall the extradition of an Ecuadorian be granted.”(Assange became an Ecuadorian citizen in 2017).”
Assange went on to discuss how political changes in Ecuador had caused his asylum to come under threat.
“Due to various weaknesses in the Ecuadorian Government, namely the split – which I do not want to have any part of – within the Government’s Party, it has become weak and it has therefore started to lean on the United States and the UK for various kinds of support and this has caused an undue amount of influence by the United States,” said Assange.
This agitated the Attorney General of Ecuador, who was present at the hearing along with the presiding judge. “I have decided not to remain quiet, given the malicious and perverse insinuations about what Ecuador is doing, it has been influenced by foreign States,” he said. He added that “Ecuador is a sovereign country.”
Last December the New York Times revealed the country’s president tried to sell Assange to the US for debt relief . Ecuador received $4.2 billion in a US backed IMF bailout on February 4. The US seeks Assange’s extradition over WikiLeaks’ 2010 publications on war and diplomacy. His alleged source, Chelsea Manning, was re-jailed last month to coerce her into a secret interrogation against him.
Assange’s testimony continued, and he asserted that the Ecuadorian Government is “positioning itself in order to violate the asylum.” He accused them of “deliberately leaking out to the press selective scandalous material” and gagging him so he cannot rebut the allegations.
“It’s all about setting the ground in order to violate the asylum, to hand me over to the United States. It’s come off the back of our March 2017 publication, the largest-ever in the history of the CIA, that resulted in many threats against WikiLeaks and, as of June this year, my alleged source Joshua Schulte, a CIA intelligence officer, was seized, put into prison, and they are trying to sentence him to 135 years,” Assange told the court.
“We know that Senators have written to [US Vice President] Mike Pence, telling him to tell President Moreno to hand me over.”
He noted that on June 28, US Vice President Mike Pence met with Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno and that the White House publicly stated that “the Vice-President raised the issue of Mr Assange with President Moreno. It was a constructive conversation. They agreed to remain in close coordination on the potential next steps going forward.”
“This is what we are talking about. So let’s not play games here. The Ecuadorian State, for various political reasons, seeks to violate the law and conduct a public campaign in order to make it acceptable to hand over a persecuted journalist to the United States as a result of pressure, well-documented pressure, from the United States Government,” Assange asserted.
On Friday WikiLeaks revealed that two government sources said Mr. Assange’s expulsion would be in a matter of “hours or days” leading to a public backlash against the government and the intervention of two UN Special Rapporteurs.
In response, Ecuador’s ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a menacing statement released at 3am this morning (GMT), stated that the revocation of asylum is a “sovereign act” but that his expulsion is not “imminent” — but declined to define what was meant by “imminent.”
In March 2018, Ecuador’s President took effective control of most courts, removing judges at will, even from the nation’s Constitutional court . Assange’s judge did not grant the injunction.
Assange has been living in the embassy since 2012 when when he was granted asylum. On Thursday evening, WikiLeaks tweeted that a “high-level” source within the Ecuadorian state has informed the publisher that he will be expelled “within hours to days” using the INA papers offshore scandal as an excuse.
Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno is currently being investigated by the National Assembly of Ecuador for corruption, based on the INA Papers leak.
“The INA Papers are a set of documents published in February 2019, allegedly uncovering the operations of INA Investment Corp, an offshore tax haven created by the brother of Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno. The trove of emails, phone communications and expense receipts are said to link the president and his family to a series of corrupt and criminal dealings, including money laundering and offshore accounts. The leak has sparked a congressional investigation into President Moreno for corruption. Moreno can’t be summoned for a criminal probe while he remains president. He is currently being investigated and risks impeachment,” WikiLeaks reports .
Last Monday, this journalist visited Assange in the embassy and was locked in a room as an argument ensued between the publisher and Ecuador’s Ambassador Jaime Alberto Marchán.
Assange claimed that he was being treated as a prisoner, that they would not let him meet a journalist in a room that did not contain surveillance equipment, and that the Ecuadorian ambassador was acting as an agent of the US government.
Members of the US government believe Ecuador is in fact giving them what they want regarding Assange. A former senior State Department official told Buzzfeed in January, “as far as we’re concerned, he’s in jail.”"
Conservatives Call for Tech Giants to Split Ties With SPLC,dcgazette.com,505335761211,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://dcgazette.com/2019/conservatives-call-for-tech-giants-to-split-ties-with-splc/,"Conservatives Call for Tech Giants to Split Ties With SPLC 04/07/2019
Silicon Valley has enormous power over the flow of information that reaches people around the globe.
That’s why it’s vital for Americans to understand how tech giants can manipulate information, either intentionally or unwittingly, to advance a political agenda.
Now, 34 conservative leaders are banding together to call for tech giants Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and Google to “cut ties” with the Southern Poverty Law Center.
The letter states in part, “It is now clear that the SPLC has proven to be a hate-filled, anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization and nothing more than a weapon of the radical Left, whose goal is to bully people into compliance with their ideology.”
As we’ve discussed on previous episodes of “Media Misses,” the SPLC is a far-left civil rights organization that has made wild claims about conservative organizations over the years, lumping them in with hate groups like neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.
It has come under scrutiny after its founder, Morris Dees, resigned over accusations of discrimination and improper behavior.
The issue has garnered the attention of those in Congress as well.
Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called on the IRS to look at the SPLC’s tax exempt status. He wrote in a letter to the agency:
Recent news reports have confirmed the long-established fact that the SPLC regularly engaged in defamation of its political opponents. In fact, the SPLC’s defining characteristic is to fundraise off of defamation.
The question also turns to media outlets as well.
Will they stop using this organization as an authoritative source?
Perhaps a turnaround is coming.
The New Yorker , for instance, recently ran a piece called “The Reckoning of Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center,” and acknowledged that the SPLC has shifted its focus from shedding light on actual, serious extremist groups to exaggerations for the purpose of money making.
And perhaps the media should be more skeptical of other similar groups and flawed studies about rising hate crime that simply fit a narrative they want to push.
As Robby Soave wrote in Reason:
When it comes to misleading hate crime data, the SPLC is far from the only offender. Many in the media have exaggerated a finding by the Anti-Defamation League that anti-Semitic hate has increased 57 percent under Trump. (Bomb threats made by an Israeli teenager were largely responsible for the perceived increase: anti-Semitic assaults actually decreased substantially.) The FBI’s hate crime data has also been widely mischaracterized .
Hopefully, tech giants and media outlets learn a lesson from the SPLC mess and stop using it to malign Americans as a whole."

"Apple Scammed For Nearly $900,000 By Chinese Nationals Living In Oregon, Washington | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/apple-scammed-nearly-900000-chinese-nationals-living-oregon-washington,"0 SHARES
Knockoff iPhones have gotten so good that a pair of Chinese nationals were able to scam Apple out of nearly $900,000 in a counterfeiting scheme involving roughly 3,000 devices, according to federal prosecutors .
The two men - who were both engineering students in the US on F-1 student visas at the time - allegedly imported over 3,000 fake iPhones, which they would then claim were broken. Apple replaced 1,493 of the phones with warranty claims linked to Yangyang Zhou and Quan Jiang. The pair would then ship the genuine iPhones back to China where they would be resold for a profit.
According to the complaint, Jiang coordinated the iPhone shipments to different addresses in the US in order to evade Customs and Border Protection, while Jiang's mother allegedly collected his share of the profits in China - then deposited it in an account he was able to access. Jiang also paid friends to help with the fraud.
The 1,576 claims that were denied were rejected for tampering, however none of the phones were identified by Apple as counterfeit , according to the filing. As NPR notes, the successful claims suggests that Jiang and Zhou had access to authentic iPhone serial or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers - which include information on the origin, model and serial number of the mobile device. The complaint does not state how the men obtained this information, while Apple has not clarified if it required either of the numbers before approving claims.
Hilariously, one of the warranty claims submitted in April 2018 was for a customer named ""Apache Helicopter."" This fake (made-in-China) iPhone looks so good it almost fooled the Experts https://t.co/bJ4dx0znaE — BenTallmadge (@BenKTallmadge) April 6, 2019
Apple took losses of around $600 per phone for an overall estimated loss of $895,000, a company official told the Department of Homeland Security.
According to court documents Jiang laid out the entire operation in a December 2017 interview with Thomas Duffy, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations. Jiang admitted he received the dummy phones from an ""associate"" in China, 20 to 30 at at time . He said he used friends, relatives and name variations to receive the packages from China, as well as the replacement phones from Apple . - NPR
US Customs and Border Protection seized three international shipments totaling 95 counterfeit iPhones sent to Zhou. In March 2018, Homeland Security's investigators based out of Portland executed a search warrant at Jiang's residence, where they discovered more than 300 counterfeit iPhones, shipping records and warranty submission records.
Four boxes were also addressed to Yangyang Zhou at four different mailbox facilities in the state of Washington.
Zhou was stopped at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in August, 2018 with several iPhones - one of which was the genuine replacement for the ""Apache Helicopter"" warranty claim. On one of Zhou's other electronic devices, investigators found photographs showing what appear to be boxes of iPhones.
Jiang faces charges of trafficking in counterfeit goods and wire fraud, while Zhou is being charged with ""submitting false or misleading information on export declaration.""
Their scam is not new - in fact, fake iPhone laundering has been around for several years. As NPR notes, the problem is so severe in China that "" Apple has already developed a more rigorous replacement plan to avoid "" fraud.
In 2015, a Chinese-language online forum, called Chinese In LA, warned readers about a job posting seeking to recruit students to return inoperable iPhones from China to U.S. Apples stores. The ad targeted non-English speakers without a Social Security number, promising a ""rebate"" of $30 per replacement and suggested that 8 to 10 devices a day could be returned. - NPR
Last year a Chinese national living in New Jersey admitted to selling fake iPhones and iPads - pocketing $1.1 million in revenue from the scheme. Tags "

“You bozos simply don’t care,” Pirro said. “You want open borders for one reason and one reason only – to make sure you get more people here on your side to vote Democrat so you never have to worry about getting re-elected again so that a Donald Trump can never happen again.

Progressives have shared a common hatred of President Donald Trump and a faith in special counsel Robert Mueller and his “dream team.” They believed over the last two years that the Mueller investigation was slowly grinding down Trump.
The unifying progressive creed assumed that Mueller’s team would eventually find Trump unequivocally guilty of “collusion” with Russia. That buzzword was the non-criminal euphemism for felonious conspiracy to rig an election.
The hunt would end with the holy grail of Trump’s impeachment and removal from office. In 2020 there would be an almost automatic progressive takeover of government.
The anti-Trump echo chamber lessened the need for progressives to offer a comprehensive, coherent and winning alternate agenda. Damning Trump was unity enough.
But as Mueller was supposedly about to indict Trump, a divisive, hard-left agenda was almost imperceptibly floated to the public: the Green New Deal, reparations for slavery, abortion redefined as permissible infanticide, open borders, packing the Supreme Court with liberal justices, the abolition of the Electoral College and ICE, free college tuition, the elimination of student debt, Medicare for all, a wealth tax, a 70 percent top marginal income tax rate, a 16-year-old voting age, voting rights for ex-felons, and on and on.
It seemed as if today’s radical proposal would become yesterday’s sellout within 24 hours, as progressives awaited tomorrow’s even more revolutionary idea.
While progressives were celebrating the seemingly inevitable Mueller indictment of Trump, they were also increasingly at odds over many of these divisive and mostly unpopular new issues and over the self-created paradoxes of identity politics.
Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, a lifelong beneficiary of wealth and influence, did his best to blast his own past white privilege.
Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders talked in the abstract, as if an old white guy like himself in the concrete had no business running for president.
Current front-runner Joe Biden tried hard to trash his own white male culture as the root of many of America’s problems.
How odd that three of the anti-white-male party’s leading presidential contenders were none other than the white male trio of Biden, Bernie and Beto.
Now, Mueller has gone, his report having found no evidence of an election conspiracy. There is no longer a rallying cry of Trump-Russia collusion.
An investigation that for two years had reconciled the irreconcilable serves no longer as a source of Democratic unity.
We are going to see hard-left Democrats and socialists force their mostly unpopular agenda on politicians and candidates from their own party. And they are now putting their identity-politics money where their mouth is by openly discouraging candidates on the basis of their race and gender.
With the end of the Mueller investigation, thousands of government documents, mostly unredacted, will be released. The result may be that the hunters of Trump soon become hunted by federal prosecutors. Sworn statements of Obama administration officials in the Justice Department, CIA, FBI and other bureaucracies will contradict newly released documents.

Gatchel,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20190406/my-turn-theodore-l-gatchel-are-we-prepared-for-war,"My Turn: Theodore L. Gatchel: Are we prepared for war? Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 11:03 PM
The early Latin saying ""Si vis pacem, para bellum"" translates to ""If you want peace, prepare for war."" Unfortunately, the United States has a poor record of following that advice.
We have a long record of being unprepared for war and having to work overtime to get fully prepared once a war has started. Having won a war, however, we then usually dismantle our forces as if there will never be another.
Right now, American forces are still fighting in places such as Syria and Afghanistan and must be prepared to engage potential enemies in other places such as the South China Sea. Except for carriers, the Chinese have more warships and are building islands there to use as naval and air bases.
President Trump and the Pentagon are now faced with overcoming various weaknesses and shortages that have occurred over the last 10 years and dealing with military problems in general. We have an exceptional military force capable of fighting small operations, but we are lacking the forces needed to fight a major war.
The U.S. military has a wide range of the most modern weapons and related equipment, but most of them are outrageously expensive. The Air Force recently noted that the cost of one F-35A fighter is expected to drop below $80 million per fighter in 2023.
Although we have up to-date weapons of all types, we also have unbelievably old ones. The Air Force's B-52 bomber is still a major part of its arsenal even though it was first flown in 1952. Some say it will continue on to 2052.
Weapons are only one major requirement of a fighting force. Personnel are another.
Several problems facing the military today make rapid increase of the armed forces difficult. The lack of a full-scale draft, for example, makes assembling a large number of troops capable of fighting a major war difficult. The problem is exacerbated at the moment by the large number of jobs available to young workers outside the military.
The problem is made even worse by the large number of military age candidates who are not eligible for service for reasons that include obesity, lack of education and criminal records. Nearly three-quarters of Americans from 17 to 24 fall into that category.
Given the technology involved in most modern weapons, they are almost always produced by civilian technical experts in technical companies. That has been a normal situation in the past, but a new problem has started to arise. Although the military continues to acquire very expensive and effective modem weapons, workers from several companies are telling their leaders that they will not help produce weapons of war.
Recently, for example, workers at Microsoft sent a letter to their CEO and their president stating that they would not participate in a project called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System that the Army described as a way to ""increase lethality by enhancing the ability to detect, decide and engage before the enemy."" Those workers have said, ""Intent to harm is not an acceptable use of our technology.""
Apparently, some workers care less about helping American soldiers stay ahead of our potential enemies on the battlefield than about their personal concerns. That approach is particularly disappointing because the ability of U.S. industry to produce weapons has been a major factor in winning wars.
Those workers may well believe that their good intentions are keeping the United States out of war. Before they pursue those good intentions any further, they might want to review American military history and give some serious thought to the Latin warning: Si vis pacem, para bellum.

Daniels: Labor interests dig into your wallet Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 11:02 PM
Evergreen contracts. Binding arbitration. Expanded overtime for firefighters. We’re only three months into the General Assembly’s legislative session, and we’re already seeing the return of these perennial special interest bills for public sector unions, plus some new ones tossed in for good measure. It’s enough to make a mayor’s head spin and a taxpayer weep.
Mayors and town managers are united in their commitment to protect local taxpayers. They have an obligation to provide an affordable place to live. Approximately two-thirds of city and town budgets come from property taxes. The Tax Foundation ranks Rhode Island as having the sixth highest property tax burden in the country, so municipal leaders have been tightening their belts to control spending. In the last five years, total property tax collections have risen about 2% per year — just above inflation — well below the 4% annual cap permitted under state law.
Key to controlling costs is managing personnel, which is the largest component of municipal budgets; as much as 75% of local spending is for employee wages, health care and retiree benefits. Unfortunately, state laws currently limit the ability of mayors and town managers to negotiate good deals for the taxpayer, and bills in the General Assembly would make the problem even worse. If legislators force higher personnel costs on cities and towns, the only alternatives are property tax increases or deep cuts to important services.
Back again is the evergreen contracts bill (H5437, S512), which would let municipal employee and teacher collective bargaining agreements remain in effect after they have expired, potentially letting the contract terms go on indefinitely. Without an expiration date to compel parties to negotiate, municipal officials will not be able to make realistic and needed changes — particularly in a recession when employees are better off keeping what they already have. Gov. Gina Raimondo rightly vetoed this legislation in 2017, and the League will continue to oppose it.
In addition to contracts that go on in perpetuity, the expansion of binding arbitration will put up to 75% of a city’s budget in the hands of an unelected arbitrator (H5260, S511). The League has proposed legislation reforming binding arbitration by requiring mediation first, limiting the scope of arbitration decisions and preventing an arbitration award from exceeding budgeted levels and creating a deficit. We hope that the General Assembly shows a commitment to these reforms before expanding arbitration.
Finally, a new bill in the General Assembly would require firefighters to be paid overtime for any hours above 42 per week (H5662). It appears that this legislation is intended to limit local officials’ ability to modify platoon structures in a way that meets the community’s needs. Last December, the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council found that Rhode Island had the highest per capita spending on fire protection services in fiscal year 2016 — more than double the national average.
The Federal Fair Labor Standards Act recognizes that public safety officials have more complex schedules, in some cases working one long shift and then having multiple days off. Under federal standards, firefighters are not required to receive overtime unless they have worked more than 53 hours in an average week. With the highest fire protections costs in the nation, Rhode Island should not be setting a lower threshold for overtime than required under federal law.
Our mayors and town managers recognize the vital contributions of municipal workers. In nearly every community, municipal leaders have good working relationships with their employees and support harmonious labor negotiations.
However, municipal officials must also protect their residents’ wallets, and each contract negotiation is a careful balancing act among many needs. Unfortunately, the bills in the General Assembly would tilt the playing field and tie the hands of municipal leaders who were elected to act in the best interest of taxpayers.

My Turn: Froma Harrop: Is Sanders behind Biden attack?,www.providencejournal.com,Froma Harrop,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20190406/my-turn-froma-harrop-is-sanders-behind-biden-attack,"My Turn: Froma Harrop: Is Sanders behind Biden attack? Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 11:02 PM
There was always something fishy about the #MeToo complaint against Joe Biden. Putting hands on Lucy Flores' shoulders and smooching the back of her head is in no way sexual. Even Flores admitted that.
Nonetheless, Flores gave a dramatic rendition of the distress it caused her. ""I just froze,"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do. Because again the only thing that you're processing is that there is a very powerful man standing next to you ... and you just don't know how to respond.""
What doesn't add up? Everything.
Flores was not a preadolescent nymph but rather the 2014 Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor. If a kiss on the back of her head made her freeze, how would she have responded to a genuine crisis, say, a terrorist attack? And if this bothered her so much, why did she wait five years to ""come forward""?
The most plausible answer is that this stunt isn't about Biden but about helping Bernie Sanders. Lo and behold, polls show Biden leading Sanders among Democratic voters — as Sanders faces his own accusations of disrespecting women.
Some backstory: In 2016, Flores joined the Sanders campaign, becoming a surrogate. She also joined the board of Our Revolution, an advocacy group backing Sanders.
Biden advisers share the hunch that the Sanders campaign is behind her charges, according to Mike Allen of Axios.
We expect that, in the future, Biden will desist from getting so affectionate with women and will lose the grandfatherly touch.
But let's look at Sanders' lamentable record on women. Women who worked on the 2016 campaign complain that they were made subservient to the boy geniuses. And there was that unforgettable moment when the Bernie bros hurled the C-word at Democratic women running the Nevada State Democratic Convention. Sanders responded to the use of that vilest of words against women with the mildest of hand slaps. Then he blamed both sides. (The official statement has been removed from his website.)
Because everyone is delving into Biden's beliefs of decades ago, consider Bernie's. In 1969, he opined that sexual maladjustment was linked to breast cancer. ""You might very well be the cause of cancer,"" he wrote with his trademark air of authority. Even back then, mainstream science rejected theories that psychological factors caused cancer.
Sanders also found fault with mothers unhappy that their 16-year-old daughters spent a night out with their boyfriends. ""Are you concerned about her happiness,"" he wrote, ""or about your 'reputation' in the community?"" In this worldview, not putting out is an emblem of female repression.
Zoom to 2019. Sanders says he believes Lucy Flores, as do a number of other opportunistic Democrats. Thing is, we all believe Flores' account of what Biden did. Videos show Biden hugging, kissing and rubbing shoulders of numerous women over the years.
What we can't believe is Flores' claim that she is bringing this up now to fix a grievous wrong done her — rather than an innocent gesture by a national politician who went out of his way to help her campaign. That Sanders and his people are fueling these petty attacks is something we can believe.

Bret Hart was attacked at this year's WWE Hall of Fame, and fortunately wasn't hurt.
Fortunately is the case, because the 61-year old stroke victim Hart was attacked by a 26-year old Zach Madsen, who Fightful Select learned is actually an amateur MMA fighter. He's listed as 6'2"" and competes in the welterweight division regionally in Nebraska, where he's 2-1. If you want a good time, you can see him getting choked out below in his most recent fight.
Madsen actually wore a Jack Swagger t-shirt to his first MMA fight.
Unfortunately for Madsen, the WWE is full of legit fighters. Ironically, it was two not signed by WWE -- UFC veteran Travis Browne and Davey Boy Smith Jr. -- that got ahold of him before Dash Wilder also rocked him with a huge punch.
Fightful spoke to one fighter Madsen spoke with on the condition of anonymity who said that Madsen ""seemed harmless and nice, but often didn't make sense."" We're told Hart's Attacker Zach Madsen actually quit his job at Allstate to focus on an MMA career, which obviously hasn't worked out. Prior to that he worked at the Allstate Contact Center on a chat team primarily assisting insurance agents via IM on life insurance policies.
We also learned that Madsen was arrested in December 2018 for violating a protective order.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke a diplomatic taboo on Saturday night when he promised to annex portions of the West Bank territory in Area C, in which all of the Israeli settlements are located.“I will apply sovereignty,” Netanyahu said . It’s the first time since he took office in 2009, that he has used the word “sovereignty” when speaking of Judea and Samaria. Netanyahu did so in an interview with Rina Matzliach on Channel 12, just three days before the April 9 election. Matzliach pushed him on the issue, asking why, as the leader of a right-wing government, he has not annexed the settlements during his last four years in office.“What have you accomplished? Why haven’t you annexed [the] Gush Etzion [bloc]? Why haven’t you applied sovereignty on [the settlement of] Ma’aleh Adumim?” she asked.Netanyahu responded: “Who said we are not going to do this? We are in the process [of doing this]. We are in discussions. We are discussing this and other things.”Until this interview, Netanyahu had remained almost the only politician on the right of Israel’s political map who had not yet sworn his support for that unilateral step.Even before Netanyahu announced new elections, his chief right-wing rival, Education Minister Naftali Bennett – who now heads the New Right Party – underscored the prime minister’s weakness on the issue, attacking him for failing to annex Area C. Those who want the Israeli government to take such a step should strengthen parties to the right of the Likud, such as his, Bennett said.Annexation is the kind of unilateral step that could not have happened in the aftermath of the 1993 Oslo Accords under the tenure of former US president Bill Clinton.It was presumed that any change to the territorial status of the West Bank – which Israel captured from Jordan during the defensive Six Day War in 1967 – could only occur as part of a final-status agreement for a two-state resolution to the conflict with the Palestinians, which would place a Palestinian state in the West Bank.It would have been equally difficult to speak of annexation when former presidents George Bush and Barack Obama were in office, as both men held that settlements were a stumbling block to the peace process, and believed that the establishment of additional ones should be frozen.But from the moment US President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, right-wing politicians in his Republican Party, as well as Bennett’s former party Bayit Yehudi, stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to apply sovereignty out of the belief that the absence of a peace process and Trump’s break with past US policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict provided a unique window of opportunity.Instead of pushing forward with such an initiative, however, Netanyahu thwarted one legislative attempt after the other, including drives to annex the West Bank or portions of it.Over the weekend, the left-wing group Yesh Din published a data base with 60 such Knesset legislative attempts at either sovereignty or an initial form of de facto annexation during the last government. Some 25 of those initiatives were direct attempts to impose sovereignty over West Bank territory, including the Ma’aleh Adumim settlement, the Jordan Valley and the Gush Etzion bloc.But none of those 25 bills were advanced to a final vote. Out of all the 60 initiatives, the only eight which passed were those that are seen as initial steps toward de facto annexation and dealt with the application of Israeli law to the territories.In the final days of the election, however, as Netanyahu pushes to garner votes from smaller right-wing parties for his Likud, he has finally put forward a pro-annexation agenda.If reelected, Netanyahu told Matzliach, “I will not uproot a single settlement. I will ensure that we will continue to rule over the territory west of the Jordan River.”It is a line Netanyahu has often used in the past years. But on Saturday he gave it a new twist. “Now you are asking an interesting question. Will we continue onto the next phase? The answer is yes. We will continue onto the next phase: the application of sovereignty.”Netanyahu was careful to distinguish himself from the centrist Blue and White Party led by former IDF chief-of-staff Benny Gantz, whose platform hints at the application of sovereignty to the settlement blocs. Blue and White has also promised not to evacuate the isolated settlements unless there is a referendum or the approval of a special majority of the Knesset.“I will apply sovereignty, but I won’t distinguish between the settlement blocs and the isolated settlements,” Netanyahu said. “From my perspective, every settlement point is Israeli. We have an obligation as the government of Israel. I won’t uproot a single person. I won’t transfer them to Palestinian sovereignty.” He added that he had no intention of giving Israel’s “heartland” to the Palestinians.There was no immediate response from Trump, who on Saturday delivered a heavily pro-Israel speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition, with an eye toward shoring up support for his own reelection campaign in 2020.The left-wing Jewish American group J Street denounced Netanyahu’s statement , warning that it would lead to permanent occupation and a one-state nightmare.“While the Trump administration has actively enabled and empowered Netanyahu and the settlement movement, all responsible American elected officials and presidential candidates must make clear that Netanyahu’s statement is dangerous and unacceptable – and that any West Bank annexations would bring about a major crisis in the US-Israel relationship,” J Street said.But the settler leaders – who have advocated, lobbied, pleaded and dreamed of the moment when Netanyahu would bravely speak of annexation – were strangely silent.The only one to proactively issue a statement was South Hebron Hills Regional Council head Yohai Damri.“We have waited for many long years for the Israeli government to take this moral and correct decision. We are happy that this day has arrived,” Damri said.“We call upon Prime Minister Netanyahu to apply sovereignty as his first step after the establishment of a new government,” he said. He also urged the premier to stand firm against any pressure from the Trump administration, particularly in light of the president’s expected roll-out of his peace plan to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.“This is the time to commit ourselves to sovereignty,” Damri said.The Sovereignty Movement said it was cautiously welcoming Netanyahu’s words, noting the uncertainty of such a declaration in the heat of an election battle.“This is a historic moment. Even if it was a promise made during the elections, it is still the first time that a prime minister of Israel views Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria as a viable diplomatic plan that can be acted on,” the movement said.It noted that Netanyahu’s statements fell in line with early indications of what might be in Trump’s much anticipated peace plan. This would include a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria simultaneously with the declaration of sovereignty over the settlements.Just last week, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told the Arab League in Tunisia that he believed Trump would allow Israel to annex portions of the West Bank.Under former Likud prime minister Menachem Begin, Israel annexed territory the IDF had captured in the Six Day War: east Jerusalem in 1980 and the Golan Heights in 1981.Last month, Trump recognized Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, a move that led to speculation that he could also support the annexation of some or all of the settlements in the West Bank.Netanyahu has a history of making last-minute campaign pledges that he goes back on once the election is over and he is securely at the country’s helm. After the 2015 election, Netanyahu was able to reassure Obama that his pre-election statement, in which he appeared to dismiss the possibility of the creation of a Palestinian state, had been misunderstood. Netanyahu explained that he had simply provided an assessment of what was diplomatically possible and had not rejected Palestinian statehood.With regard to the annexation pledge, the possibility that Netanyahu will actually apply sovereignty in the next government depends in part on who his coalition partners are and how stiff the opposition, if any, is within the Trump administration. It is likely that the right-wing parties would place a demand for sovereignty into any coalition agreement they might draw up with Netanyahu.But even if Netanyahu uttered the word sovereignty as a pre-election ploy, knowing it would be diplomatically impossible to uphold, the fact that he said it at all speaks to a dramatic shift in the dialogue around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – from evacuation to acquisition. In that conversation, the Palestinian demand for a withdrawal to the pre-1967 line appears to be totally irrelevant.In 2005, when former Likud prime minister Ariel Sharon wanted to make his mark on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he destroyed 25 settlements. Now, just 14 years later, the specter of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal feels so remote that Netanyahu feels emboldened not just to keep the settlements but to unilaterally speak of redrawing the map of sovereign Israel to include all of them.Should Netanyahu’s words be a harbinger of things to come, whether in the coming government or a future one, then this Channel 12 interview will become a significant watershed moment when it comes to the contours of Israeli sovereignty.

Liberal left-wing NGO J Street has slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his comments on annexing territories of the West Bank if reelected as Israel's leader.J Street president Jeremy Ben-Ami called Netanyahu’s promise ""outrageous,"" adding that this confirms ""what was already clear: The Israeli Right is determined to annex the West Bank and permanently prevent the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel."" ""If carried out, even a partial annexation would be a disastrous blow to Israel’s security and democracy - and a severe violation of international law,"" he said. ""Israel cannot rule permanently over millions of Palestinians while denying them equal civil and political rights.Ben-Ami explained that while the Trump administration has actively enabled and empowered Netanyahu and the settlement movement, ""all responsible American elected officials and presidential candidates must make clear that Netanyahu’s statement is dangerous and unacceptable - and that any West Bank annexations would bring about a major crisis in the US-Israel relationship.""He called on all American Jewish organizations that claim to support a two-state solution to ""come together"" and ""unequivocally condemn the direction in which Netanyahu and his political allies are leading the State of Israel.""The J Street leader later added that, ""at such a pivotal time, any silence or equivocation will be seen as condoning the prime minister’s vision of permanent occupation, unending conflict and a one-state nightmare.”Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with Channel 12 on Saturday night, in which he vowed to annex territories in settlements and evacuate the illegal West Bank herding village of Khan Al-Ahmar, if he wins another term.“We are dealing [with the Americans] on exercising Israeli sovereignty on Ma’aleh Adumim and other things,” Netanyahu said. “Everyone understands that the next term will be fateful for guaranteeing our security and our control over key territory in Judea and Samaria.” Gil Hoffman contributed to this report.

Yeshiva leaders defend call not to ordain gay student,www.jpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Liberal-Orthodox-yeshiva-leaders-defend-decision-to-deny-ordination-to-gay-student-585983,"LGBT flag on Jerusalem's King George Street, July 31, 2018. (photo credit: MARC ISRAEL SELLEM)
NEW YORK – The leaders of a liberal Orthodox rabbinical school are standing behind their decision to deny ordination to a rabbinical student who is openly gay, even as Jewish LGBTQ leaders have criticized the move. Daniel Atwood, a rabbinical student at Yeshivat Chovevei Torah in New York City since 2015, came out years ago, but only recently learned that he would not receive ordination , called semicha in Hebrew. Neither Atwood nor Rabbi Dov Linzer, the school’s president and rosh yeshiva, would comment on the specific reason ordination was denied.But Linzer told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the decision came because of something, which he did not specify, that happened in the past several months.Six months ago, Atwood and his partner got engaged on the stage of a concert in New York City.“He came out to us in the end of his first year and we were fully prepared to give him semicha until certain circumstances arose over a few months ago,” Linzer told JTA. “Because this is such a sensitive issue, it took us a few months to come to the decision that I came to. I was trying to figure out if there was a possible way forward. I came to the conclusion there was not.”Linzer said the process of denying Atwood ordination “was not handled well.”Atwood, speaking to JTA on Thursday, declined to comment on the decision. But, he said, “I’m feeling hopeful that the community will move forward.”The decision has sparked a backlash in part because, while Orthodox Judaism prohibits same-sex marriage, liberal Orthodox institutions have tried to welcome LGBTQ Jews. In 2010, the International Rabbinic Fellowship, which counts many YCT graduates among its members, put out a statement urging that LGBTQ Jews be treated with dignity and respect.“Jews with homosexual orientations or same sex-attractions should be welcomed as full members of the synagogue and school community,” the statement said.Since then, the movement’s leaders and synagogues have hosted events with LGBTQ groups and spoken out in favor of LGBTQ rights.“Regarding halakha, as I am sure you are aware, there is a Biblical prohibition for two men to have (anal) sex with one another,” Linzer wrote in 2015 , using the Hebrew term for Jewish law. “This does not necessarily mean that two men cannot, within halakha, live in the same home, have a committed, loving relationship, and raise children (if they choose) together as a family.”Rabbi Avi Weiss, the founder of YCT and perhaps the most prominent leader of the liberal Orthodox community, defended Linzer’s record on LGBTQ issues and told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that he agreed with the decision.“Rabbi Linzer has always been at the forefront of respecting and advocating for the gay community within Orthodoxy — to suggest otherwise is not fair and not true,” Weiss said in a statement to JTA. “I — like many others — am pained that Daniel will not be receiving semikha, but am in full agreement with Rabbi Linzer’s decision.”Weiss has also written that a gay Jewish couple should be able to build a life together in the confines of an Orthodox community. In a chapter of his new book called “Welcoming LGBT+ Jews,” Weiss said that Jewish law does not allow gay couples a religiously consecrated wedding, but that it’s unreasonable to deny them a relationship.“To demand that gay people not have a life partner is, for many, akin to a death sentence,” he wrote. “While halakha limits kiddushin and nissuin (betrothal and marriage) to the relationship between a man and a woman, we must do all we can to find a way for halakha to help guide gay couples to live in loving partnerships.”In an email to YCT alumni on Friday, Linzer wrote that Orthodox rabbis are held to a higher standard than the rank and file. No Orthodox institution has sanctioned same-sex marriage or ordained openly gay rabbis.“One of the big challenges for us as a rabbinical school is that there is a difference between communal inclusion, and between what it means to be ordained as an Orthodox rabbi,” he wrote. “So much more is expected and demanded from our rabbis than from our laity.”But Atwood is not the only gay prospective rabbi that YCT has denied. Linzer acknowledged that one other applicant who is gay was accepted, then told to wait before enrolling until YCT clarifies its policy on the matter. Linzer said there was never a policy not to admit gay students. He said that YCT expects to release a clear policy by May 2020 after consulting with rabbis, lay leaders and leaders from the LGBTQ community.“That student was told we were working out our policy, and to come back after we had a chance to clarify it,” Linzer said. “Until now, this has been such a complicated and difficult issue that we’ve been muddling through.”Mordechai Levovitz, executive director of Jewish Queer Youth, a Jewish LGBTQ group, said the lack of a clear position on LGBTQ Jews in Jewish law keeps LGBTQ Orthodox Jews in a damaging state of limbo, though he wrote on Facebook that he believes Linzer had good intentions.“They’re inviting us to a house that’s unfinished,” he said. “The floors are not secured. And they don’t have to worry because they’re not the ones at risk. We’re the ones at risk.”Jewish Queer Youth is helping Atwood receive ordination from another Orthodox authority via a fundraiser that has brought in more than $8,000 since Thursday. Its deputy executive director, Rachael Fried, said the group has received many calls, emails and text messages in the wake of the decision “from people who are feeling the hopelessness and feeling they have no future.”“It’s really easy for people to say, from an intellectual perspective, this is hard and this is something we’re working on,” she said. “But at JQY, we see the actual ramifications. It’s extremely real.”

And why (if you choose to explain) (1) Gonzaga vs (1) Virginia would have looked so much better. "" You gotta love the one who loves you "" Posts 4,648 I know nobody's following the analytics anymore, but the Zags are #2 on KenPom ( #1 offense, #12 defense ). TeamRankings have them at #1 . Barttorvik has them at #1 as well ( #1 offense, #9 defense, #1 overall ). Too bad they ran into a bad matchup (or maybe a ref). The stats validate how strong the Zags were this year. I'd love to see an analysis of the frequency of fouls called as you get closer to the final four. I sat through the TTech/MSU game keying on Tech's defensive play. ""Foul... Foul. That's a foul. Another foul. That's not vertical...it's a foul."" Over and over. Three-fourths through the game and a bunch of Tech's players all equally have 3 fouls. I wonder what the statistical probability of that is. Yeah, anyone who knows about random chance knows it is infinitesimally small. Refs can and do change outcomes. Auburn could have easily been in the Final 2. As someone who loves the rigid numbers and statistical validity of same in basketball, I think unquestionably the biggest problem with (college) basketball is the SUBJECTIVITY of referee calls (or maybe the rules are objective, but not called in that fashion during the game). It absolutely drives me nuts. There has to be a better way. When Few went completely nuts on that ref, you know he had very good reason. That almost never happens during the rest of the season (or even in his career). Monday's outcome will be very interesting, and will very likely be dependent upon which zebras were selected for the game that makes the most money of the entire season. My prediction will be whistles swallowed. What that leads to, I'm not sure. Posts 4,648 I'll add that on KenPom currently, Virginia is #1 and Texas Tech is #5 (Zags #2). Interestingly, Barttorvik (whose algorithms are basically KenPom before the weird changes he made a couple years ago) has: 1. Zags .9745 2. Virginia .9726 3. TTech .9707 I'm inclined to go with Bart's T-Rank over KenPom these days. Either way, the numbers suggest a very close game. I guess I'll root for the Raiders only because they faced (and beat) my favorite team, but honestly, the only next game that matters to me is the exhibition the Bulldogs play next fall. Yeah, beat Brewster Packing or whomever. Posts 2,044 If TTU wins on Monday they will be the first school to win the championship in their first trip to the FF since UCONN in 99. Both beat Gonzaga in the West region championship game to get to the FF. I saw the part about TTU and UConn on ESPN last night but they didn’t make the GU connection. In 2017 GU should have been the first since 99 to win in their first FF trip. Dang it. Posts 12,897 What is absolutely amazing is the jump in offensive efficiency that Texas Tech made within season. It has to be close to record breaking in the Pomeroy era. I'm telling you, in early January, there were jokes being made about the Red Raiders during podcasts and such because of how BAD their offense was that they simply couldn't score. The defense was always great, but so many people didn't trust them because they had so many problems getting the ball in the basket outside of Culver. They were ranked in the high 90's and at times in the low 100's. And then is just got better, and better, and better. While some of that could possibly be attributed to the Big 12 not being as strong as it usually is, it's still a power league with some pretty good defensive teams in it (Kansas State = #3; Kansas = #17; OU = #23; Texas = #25). But Beard made some amazing in-season adjustments to their offense, and clearly brought confidence out of some of his players. BTW - Dixon is apparently out with UCLA. They couldn't get over the buyout thing. The LA Times is saying that Cronin is the next man in line, but what about Beard? Does he have a massive buyout at Tech? I doubt it. Then again, UCLA has humiliated itself so many times does anyone of substance really wish to coach there? And BTW - how does AD Dan Guerrero still have a job. Not enough universities fail to understand that the source of their problems isn't their coaches, but the person who is hiring them. 6,523 Originally Posted by CDC84 What is absolutely amazing is the jump in offensive efficiency that Texas Tech made within season.

On the surface I would agree, but their next target, Mick Cronin, has teams that routinely play at a pace that ranks over 300 at kenpom.com. As discussed many times, pace of play is very important to UCLA fans and boosters. Cincy, like Texas Tech, plays a defense first, physical brand of ball. Both Beard and Cronin seem the have similar personalities. Mick might be a little more hot-headed. But Cronin has more experience, and I believe Cincy has made the tourney 8 years in a row (something around that - I think they rank 5th of all programs in consecutive tourney appearances). The other thing is that he has an outstanding and longstanding tradition of graduating players and avoiding scandal. Very important in the current climate, and especially after the Ball family nonsense. Plus, if Beard wins this title tonight, he might command, believe or not, more money. The situation at Cincy with Cronin is not good. They have not shown a long term commitment to him as their head coach. Despite their success, they seem indifferent to him as a head coach. At this point, I don't feel we can rule anything out when it comes to UCLA and their crazy basketball coaching search. Any AD who spent his whole season trying to lure Calipari to Westwood when every college basketball pundit on the planet could've told Guerrero that it was never going to happen (that Cal was using it as leverage as a business man) is liable to do anything. Posts 12,897 Back to the original topic I am going with Texas Tech. Part of it is self serving. It will lessen the pain of losing to them if they win it all. Also, when it comes to UVA, they have lucked out so many times in this tourney at some point they aren't going to be able to pull another one out of their collective rear ends. I like how Texas Tech has beaten three straight teams with defensive efficiencies in the 20's. They have shown that they can score enough to win against defenses as stout as UVA's (Michigan State = #9; Gonzaga = #12; Michigan = #2). UVA has not faced a defense this whole tourney that is nearly as tough as Tech's. 6,523 Originally Posted by CDC84 Why so?

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Blasts Jeanine Pirro, Fox News After Ilhan Omar Receives Death Threat",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-blasts-jeanine-pirro-fox-news-after-ilhan-omar-1388229,"The fallout continues weeks after Fox News host Jeanine Pirro made comments that saw her temporarily bumped from the network for comments some called Islamophobic.
Last month, freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar received a call to her Washington D.C. office where Patrick Carlineo Jr. threatened to ""put a bullet in her f--king skull"" and asked if the Minnesota congresswoman was working for the Muslim Brotherhood.
While the call from Carlineo hasn't been linked to comments Pirro made during her March 9 Justice with Judge Jeanine television show , New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used a tweet to discuss both situations on Saturday.
""Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this. Folks who imply we’re “bad” for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language. Talk policy, not personal,"" the New York congresswoman said.
Pirro's comments on March 9 stemmed from r emarks made by Omar that some have said were anti-Semitic.
“[Democrats are] not anti-Israel — she is. Think about this. She’s not getting this anti-Israel sentiment doctrine from the Democrat party. So, if it's not rooted in the party, where is she getting it from? Think about it. Omar wears a hijab, which according to the Koran 33:59, tells women to cover so they won't get molested. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?,"" Pirro said, addressing her comments to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.
Omar has pledged her support for Ocasio-Cortez's cornerstone legislation, the Green New Deal, and the two women have frequently been paired with Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib as ground-breaking freshman lawmakers.
The threat called into Omar's office last month is not the first for the congresswoman. Omar was among several politicians and media personalities on a hit list compiled by U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant Christopher Hasson who was arrested in February on drug and weapons charges and believed to have been planning acts of domestic terrorism, though he has not been charged.
Pirro's show was missing from Fox News' schedule on March 16 and 23 but returned on March 30 following repeated calls from President Donald Trump to put Pirro back on the air.
""Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro. The Radical Left Democrats, working closely with their beloved partner, the Fake News Media, is using every trick in the book to SILENCE a majority of our Country. They have all out campaigns against @FoxNews hosts who are doing too well. Fox must stay strong and fight back with vigor. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country. The losers all want what you have, don’t give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die! Stay true to the people that got you there. Keep fighting for Tucker, and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine. Your competitors are jealous - they all want what you’ve got - NUMBER ONE. Don’t hand it to them on a silver platter. They can’t beat you, you can only beat yourselves!,"" the president wrote in a series of tweets.
Following Pirro's comments, Fox News issued a statement saying that the network ""strongly condemns Jeanine Pirro’s comments about Representative Ilhan Omar. They do not reflect those of the network and we have addressed the matter with her directly.""
This story has been updated to add a statement from Fox News about Jeanine Pirro's comments on Rep. Ilhan Omar.

Is 'SNL' on Tonight? Watch Kit Harington Host 'Saturday Night Live',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/saturday-night-live-kit-harington-1386499,"On 4/6/19 at 11:20 AM EDT Share Culture
The King of the North, and quite possibly the true King of the Seven Kingdoms, is headed to Saturday Night Live . Kit Harington, who stars as Jon Snow on the award-winning HBO series, Game of Thrones , is set to host SNL for the first time on Saturday.
His hosting gig also marks his first official SNL appearance, although his famous character has been featured on the sketch comedy show. After Melisandre (Carice van Houten) brought Jon back to life on GOT Season 6, the SNL team had a little resurrection of their own with their hilarious “Game of Thrones: Jon Snow” skit, in which Kate McKinnon, channeling her best Red Woman, breathed life back into the “super dead” Jon, played by Pete Davidson.
Although Harington is typically a more serious actor, the 32-year-old is quite ready for his comedic debut on SNL —well, sort of. Harington said he was “intermittently terrified and confident” about his upcoming SNL appearance during a recent visit to The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon .
“One minute, I’m like shaking with terror in my dressing room going, ‘Why did I ever agree to do this, I’m the most unfunny person in the world.’ And the next minute I’m like king of comedy, I know what I’m doing. So it’s like a roller coaster,” Harington said Thursday. “Ultimate admiration for those guys that do it.”
If the latest SNL promo of Harington helping Leslie Jones act out her GOT fantasy is any inkling on what to expect from Harington’s hosting, then we’d say the English actor has it in the bag.
Read on for more info on Harington’s SNL debut below.
Who’s performing: Sara Bareilles will also make her SNL debut when she takes to the stage on Saturday. The singer will likely perform tracks from her new album, Amidst the Chaos , which released on Friday.
When: Harington and Bareilles will appear on SNL during its usual Saturday timeslot at 11:30 p.m.
Where: SNL airs on NBC.
Can it be live streamed?: If you don’t want to miss any potential GOT sketches featuring the actor behind Jon Snow, then you can catch the SNL episode via live stream on NBC’s website and app. Viewers with Hulu will also be able to watch SNL there. Those only interested in the best clips of the night can check SNL’s YouTube for all the highlights shortly after the show airs. Meanwhile, GOT and SNL fans will likely be flooding social media with all their SNL banter, which you can chime in on by following the hashtag, #SNL."
