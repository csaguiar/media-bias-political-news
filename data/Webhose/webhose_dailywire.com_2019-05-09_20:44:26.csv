Millionaire Senator Bernie Sanders' Old Comments About Millionaire Senators Resurface | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46394/millionaire-senator-bernie-sanders-old-comments-ryan-saavedra,"Millionaire Senator Bernie Sanders' Old Comments About Millionaire Senators Resurface Sergio Flores/Getty Images April 24, 2019 views
Democratic presidential candidate and millionaire socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) previously described millionaire senators as being ""immoral"" during his first campaign for office in 1971, according to a new report from CNN.
CNN's Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott reported that Sanders ""harshly criticized the wealth of US senators"" at the time, ""calling it 'immoral' that half the members of the Senate were millionaires.""
""Sanders' decades-old comments, which were picked up in December 1971 by the Bennington Banner, a local Vermont newspaper, are resurfacing as the US senator from Vermont has acknowledged that he is now a millionaire in large part due to his 2016 best-selling book, 'Our Revolution,'"" CNN's report added.
The Sanders campaign responded by acknowledging that Sanders did make the comments and noted that ""Sanders believes elected officials should represent the interests of working people, not corporations, special interests or the ultra-wealthy.""
""This view has guided his work in politics, not the pursuit of personal wealth,"" Sanders campaign spokesman Josh Orton added. ""Senator Sanders' family has been fortunate, and he is grateful for that because he knows the stress of economic insecurity. That is why he works every day to ensure every American has the basic necessities of life, including a livable wage, decent housing, health care and retirement security.""
Critics of CNN's report on Sanders noted that the report highlighted that ""taking inflation into account, $1 million in 1971 is nearly $6.2 million in 2019.""
CNN further noted that Sanders made the comments while he was running for Senate ""under the banner of the Liberty Union Party, a self-described 'radical political party' that advocated nationalization of industries and redistribution of wealth to tackle inequality.""
Sanders, who owns three homes , has not dealt well when pressed about living by the policies that he has advocated for his entire political career.
During a Fox News town hall event two weeks ago, Sanders exploded when asked about ""accepting tax breaks that he voted against and why he did not send the money back given the fact that he constantly is claiming that the wealthy need to pay more in taxes,"" The Daily Wire reported.
Fox News host Bret Baier pressed Sanders on the issue. Sanders responded: ""Pfft…come on…I am, I paid the taxes that I owe...why don’t you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes.""
Moments later, Fox News host Martha MacCallum pressed Sanders again, asking: ""So would you be willing to pay 52% on the money that you made? You can volunteer, you can send it back.""
""You can volunteer too,"" Sanders responded. ""Martha, why don’t you give? You make more money than I do.""
""I didn’t suggest a wealth tax,"" MacCallum replied.
""And she’s not running for president,"" Baier added.
Sanders had decried the notion of millionaires getting a tax break during his 2016 presidential campaign.
""Our movement understands that what we don't need is Trump's huge tax breaks for millionaires,"" Sanders tweeted. Our movement understands that what we don't need is Trump's huge tax breaks for millionaires. #RNCwithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016
In 2017, Sanders tweeted: ""How many yachts do billionaires need? How many cars do they need? Give us a break. You can't have it all."" How many yachts do billionaires need? How many cars do they need? Give us a break. You can't have it all."
Here's The Letter 'Empire' Stars Sent To Fox Demanding The Return Of Jussie Smollett | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46395/heres-letter-empire-stars-sent-fox-demanding-james-barrett,"Here's The Letter 'Empire' Stars Sent To Fox Demanding The Return Of Jussie Smollett ""He is honest and above all he is filled with integrity."" FOX via Getty
In a letter sent to Fox and ABC executives and producers Friday, six of the biggest stars behind Fox's hit show ""Empire"" demand the rehiring of Jussie Smollett despite the ongoing controversy and legal actions stemming from his alleged ""hate crime hoax.""
Just over a week after the City of Chicago filed a civil suit against Smollett for $130,000 for ""his refusal to reimburse the City of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report on January 29, 2019,"" and just a few days before the two Nigerian-American brothers who say they helped Smollett carry out the alleged hoax sued the actor's lawyers for defamation, six of Smollett's fellow ""Empire"" actors — Terrence Howard, Taraji P. Henson, Bryshere Y. Gray, Trai Byers, Gabourey Sidibe, and Nicole Ari Parker — sent a letter to several Fox Entertainment and ABC Entertainment executives and producers involved in the series. The central claim of the letter: the actor has been completely exonerated and thus should be allowed to return to the show.
In the letter, sent on April 19 and obtained and published by Deadline , the ""Empire"" stars claim that the Smollett debacle has reached ""a conclusion."" The actor, they insist, is not only ""innocent and no longer subject to legal uncertainty,"" he has demonstrated that he is ""honest and above all he is filled with integrity"" while suffering through this ""traumatic event.""
Though the Cook County State's Attorney's office did agree to drop the 17 felony charges against the actor without requiring an admission of guilt, Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats, who made the widely criticized decision, has made clear that the office did in fact believe he was guilty. The City of Chicago's subsequent lawsuit against Smollett — filed by the city's Law Department a little over a week before the ""Empire"" cast's letter — alleges that Smollett ""knew his attackers and orchestrated the purported attack himself,"" and ""when police confronted him with evidence about his attackers, he still refused to disclose his involvement in planning the attack.""
After listing Smollett's various social justice credentials, the cast issues what Deadline describes as an overtly ""political"" assertion about the circumstances surrounding his case: ""It’s clearer every day that the extreme political climate in our country has only made our system of justice and the court of public opinion more unjust.""
They conclude by calling on executives and producers to ""keep Jussie on the cast so that we can all put this behind us and move forward.""
The letter is addressed to Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier, DisneyTV Studios and ABC Entertainment chair Dana Walden, Fox Entertainment president Michael Thorn, Empire co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, and other executive producers on the show, Deadline notes. Below is the full letter as published by Deadline:
Dear Charlie, Dana, Michael, Lee, Danny, Francie, Brian, Sanaa, Dennis, and Brett,
The letter is addressed to Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier, DisneyTV Studios and ABC Entertainment chair Dana Walden, Fox Entertainment president Michael Thorn, Empire co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, and other executive producers on the show, Deadline notes.
Together, as a united front, we stand with Jussie Smollett and ask that our co-star, brother and friend be brought back for our sixth season of Empire.
We understand the past months have been difficult to process—sometimes the headlines brought more confusion than clarity, yet we now have a conclusion to this ordeal. Throughout Empire’s five seasons working with Jussie and watching how he has conducted himself throughout this traumatic event, we have come to know not just the character Jussie portrays, but also truly come to know Jussie’s personal character. He is kind. He is compassionate. He is honest and above all he is filled with integrity. He is also innocent and no longer subject to legal uncertainty with the criminal charges against him having been dropped. We are confident in his lawyer’s assurance that the case was dismissed because it would not have prevailed.
Jussie has shown us on and off the set who he really is as a leader. In addition to being a caring friend and cast member who treats every crew member with love and respect, he has spent time with our families and individually supported each of us. These recent and detailed letters from The Black AIDS Institute, the Rainbow Push Coalition and the City Lights Orchestra shine a light on his commitment to true community service. Just a few months ago, Jussie partnered with the Trevor Project to provide support to their volunteer program that allows LGBTQ youth in crisis access to vital counseling services. Prior to that, he gave every cent from his sold out world tour to numerous charities. He has adopted a school in Chicago, taught songwriting to incarcerated youth at the Cook County Jail last year and bought the family of Kayden Kinckle, a six-year-old, double amputee, a wheelchair accessible van due to his school district not having a wheelchair accessible school bus. He has traveled to South Africa for service as well as to Jamaica to quietly meet about the safety of LGBTQ youth. This was all done without posturing, the need for attention or even discussion.
This is the Jussie we know.
It’s clearer every day that the extreme political climate in our country has only made our system of justice and the court of public opinion more unjust.
It is why now, more than ever, we must stand together as a family. A family is there for us in good times and bad. It can cut through the noise and confusion to understand that there is a person in the center of all this who deserves nothing more than to move forward with his life. We understand that this show is a business. And that business matters to us as well. We are confident our fans will welcome our “Jamal” back into the Empire family as enthusiastically as we will.
That is why we write today to ask you to keep Jussie on the cast so that we can all put this behind us and move forward. Thank you for taking time to hear us. It’s our hope that together we will move into our sixth season as the entire Empire family should.
SINCERELY,"
WATCH: Tucker Carlson Shreds Democrat Pete Buttigieg | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46398/watch-tucker-carlson-shreds-democrat-pete-ryan-saavedra,"
Fox News' Tucker Carlson slammed far-left Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Wednesday night over his religious attacks on Vice President Mike Pence, which members of the LGBT community have called a hate hoax similar to what Jussie Smollett pushed.
""In 2019, whining is power. Pete Buttigieg understands this,"" Carlson said (transcript via Fox News ). ""Buttigieg may be the least oppressed of all. Both his parents were college professors. He went to Harvard, and then to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. After that, Buttigieg spent three years at McKinsey. That’s where ruling class drones are taught the finer points of sucking up to corporate America. He got an 'A' in that class.""
""Our system has been very good to Pete Buttigieg. If he’s a 'victim,' who isn’t? The term has no meaning. So how does Buttigieg win his party’s victimhood olympics?"" Carlson continued. ""Simple: with the Mike Pence story. Pence was the governor of Indiana when Buttigieg became mayor of South Bend. As Buttigieg has suggested recently, this set the two on a collision course. Buttigieg is gay. Pence is a traditional Christian. Meaning he pines for the social structure of 12th century, and above all passionately hates gay people. How much does he hate them? Watch this explosive exchange from 2015, where Pence was asked directly about Buttigieg. You can see the rage in his eyes, the venom that flecks his lips. He looks dangerous. Brace yourself for this.""
Carlson then cut to a clip of Pence saying the following about Buttigieg: ""I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. We have a great working relationship. I see him as a dedicated public servant, and a patriot."" ""See that? Could you feel the hate?"" Carlson continued. ""'Highest personal regard.' In other words, 'away from me, sinner! You are filthy and disgusting.' 'Great working relationship,' says Pence. Sure. Among evangelicals, that’s code for, 'Once I establish my theocracy, I will throw you in my dungeon and let you rot for eternity.' 'Dedicated public servant. Patriot.' Oh please. Pence might as well have spit in Buttigieg’s face and called him a reprobate. It’s the same thing: gay bashing."" ""Buttigieg responded to attacks like these as you’d expect. He gave Governor Pence an 'I Love South Bend' shirt and joined him on a fitness walk. Buttigieg wrote about it on Facebook at the time if you want to read the unnerving details. To this day, he seems traumatized by the experience. Buttigieg recently told a crowd in Austin to not, quote, 'judge my state by our former governor.' He accused Pence of 'social extremism' and dubbed him a 'cheerleader of the porn star presidency.' On CNN, he suggested that even god disapproves of Mike Pence."" Carlson then slammed Buttigieg for what he suggested is religious hypocrisy, saying, ""He expresses his Christian faith by defending late-term abortion and relentlessly attacking people who’ve been kind to him. It’s more effective than talking about the city he leads. In 2015, South Bend had a higher murder almost the same as Chicago’s. Aggravated assaults more than tripled since Buttigieg became mayor. Rapes have nearly doubled. Buttigieg doesn’t want to talk about any of that. He wants to talk about the real victim here: himself.""

Lara Trump: Biden 2020 Announcement Was Just Race-Baiting With Zero Substance | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46410/lara-trump-biden-2020-announcement-was-just-race-paul-bois,"April 25, 2019 views
It seems that the only trick in former Vice President Joe Biden's deck is demagoguing racial issues. From ""Republicans want to put you all back in chains"" to his 2020 announcement in which he characterized President Donald Trump as a defender of white supremacists, the former vice president has become a race hustler of the Al Sharpton variety. Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" President Trump's 2020 campaign adviser, Lara Trump, said Biden's announcement on Thursday shows he has officially positioned himself as a far-left candidate.
"" Joe Biden is just among a sea of other [Democratic] candidates who quite frankly are all trying to out-Bernie one another, [they are] so far left, [have] become so radical,"" Lara Trump said, according to Fox News .
In his campaign announcement on Thursday, Biden cited Trump's statement after the Charlottesville attack (""fine people on both sides"") to suggest the president defends white supremacists.
""The core values of this nation… our standing in the world… our very democracy...everything that has made America — America — is at stake,"" Biden tweeted. ""That’s why today I’m announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.""
""We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,"" Biden said in his announcement video. ""If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation — who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.""
Lara Trump denounced the announcement as simple ""race-baiting"" with little substance or proposals for Americans. Though Biden will inarguably present himself as the most electable, most moderate, Lara Trump says he is now radicalized like Bernie Sanders.
""When you look at things like Bernie Sanders running on socialism … when he claims that the Boston Marathon bombers should have the right to vote — that is so far outside what I think most Americans can back.""
As to whether President Trump would match up well against Joe Biden, Lara Trump said that the president would not only do well, but would also do well in Biden's home state of Pennsylvania.
""Pennsylvania is a state that Donald Trump won because he promised the people there that he would get them their jobs back,"" she said. ""The manufacturing jobs that were taken away that Barack Obama — who I might remind folks was a partner right alongside Joe Biden and got a lot of nothing accomplished — said we had lost for good and would never get the manufacturing jobs back. Donald Trump brought them back. That's something the people of Pennsylvania are incredibly grateful for.""
Lara Trump added that the 2020 election will come to people taking inventory of how their lives have improved since the 2016 election: ""Whether you are talking about Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, people are going to look at their lives in 2020 and say, 'Is stuff better for me now than it was before Donald Trump took office or will we give Joe Biden a chance to do nothing like we saw during the Obama years?'""

Florida House Passes A Bill Banning Sanctuary Cities.

ACLU Issues Travel Warning. Joe Raedle/Getty Images April 25, 2019 views On Wednesday, the Florida House of Representatives passed a bill that would ban sanctuary cities and require local law enforcement agents to cooperate with federal immigration authorities such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The bill passed 69-47 along party lines in the Republican-controlled House, reported NBC News . The bill was sponsored by Rep. Cord Byrd, a Republican representing the Jacksonville Beach area.​ Last week, in an interview on Fox Business Network, Byrd said that the bill would allow for transparency between federal and local law enforcement. “Here’s the problem: Our state and local law enforcement officers don’t have access to the federal indices, so we don’t know if that person in Florida is using an alias,” Byrd said. “They may have committed a serious violent crime in another state, been deported, and now have come back into the United States. We see that scenario over and over and over. So before we release this potentially dangerous person back into our communities, we want to know whether or not the federal immigration authorities have reason to detain this person further.” . @CordByrd on new bill he's co-sponsoring to BAN #SanctuaryCities in #Florida , watch: pic.twitter.com/jLcBr8dlwc — Trish Regan (@trish_regan) April 18, 2019 According to the bill, local governments will be fined $5,000 each day they do not comply with the ban, reported The Hill .​ A similar bill in the Florida Senate is currently pending. Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is pushing for an amendment that would allow him to “initiate judicial proceedings in the name of the state” against local governments which do not cooperate with federal immigration officials, reported CBS Miami .​ “The governor is supportive of this measure which reiterated his constitutional authority to remove an executi ve or administrative state, county or municipal” officer for violating state law, said Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis.​ Cue the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Following the passage of the bill, the ACLU issued a travel alert for Florida if the bill indeed becomes law. “If Florida State Bill 168 and House Bill 527 pass, it would undermine local governments’ ability to protect the civil rights of their residents by forcing local officials to cooperate with ICE,” the ACLU wrote in a statement. “It would also put immigrants at risk of violence, potentially forcing victims and witnesses to stay silent for fear of deportation.”​ “Both Florida residents, citizens and non-citizens, and travelers could face risks of being racially profiled and being detained without probable cause,” the statement added. The bill sparked protests around Florida, including in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, reported ABC WWSB.​ Miami police chief Jorge Colina says he opposes the bill because he claims it would stop people from reporting crimes for fear of being turned over to immigration authorities. “The truth is I’d prefer not to have this job if I have to ask fellow officers to go check where someone came from before helping them,” Colina said, reported the Miami Herald .​ Florida reportedly does not currently have any “sanctuary cities” — unlike many other large states which have major cities that are formally declared to be sanctuary cities, including New York City, San Francisco, Seattle."
Feds Probing Illinois Governor's Finances Over Alleged 'Missing Toilet' Tax Scam | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46427/feds-probing-illinois-governors-finances-over-emily-zanotti,"Feds Probing Illinois Governor's Finances Over Alleged 'Missing Toilet' Tax Scam Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images April 25, 2019 views
Illinois' new governor, Democrat J.B. Pritzker, has only been in office a few months, but he's already following the proud Illinois gubernatorial tradition of being investigated by the Federal government. This time, though, it's not a public corruption investigation -- it's a probe into whether Pritzker and his wife deliberately removed toilets from their Chicago mansion to avoid paying around $300,000 in property taxes.
WGN News reports that the Feds are looking into claims, which surfaced during the Illinois gubernatorial campaign last year, that Pritzker's wife, MK, directed contractors to remove all of the toilets from a mansion the pair were remodeling in Chicago's tony Gold Coast neighborhood, so that the mansion could be declared ""uninhabitable."" The move allegedly reduced the value of the home by $5 million and the Pritzkers' tax burden by $331,000.
""The report also found that [Pritzker aide Christine] Lovely and the governor’s brother-in-law, Thomas J. Muenster, made 'false representations' on tax appeal documents,"" WBEZ adds . The pair reportedly declared to the county that that the home had no working bathrooms for the two years prior to the toilet removal project, which allowed the Pritzkers to reclaim around $132,000 in taxes they'd already paid to Cook County.
The Cook County IG that issued the report called the incident a ""scheme to defraud taxpayers,"" and suggested that the Pritzkers could be guilty not just of lying to tax assessors, but of perjury and mail fraud.
When the reports surfaced, in the form of an inspector general's report released in October, Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune with a net worth of approximately $3.2 billion, cut Cook County a check for the missing money, with a note that said the ""gift"" was “in no way an admission of any wrongdoing.”
The Pritzkers also said, at the time, that they did have at least one working toilet in the home.
Simply repaying the county $331,000 doesn't absolve Prtizker or his wife of attempting to commit tax fraud, and, shortly after the IG report surfaced in October, the Federal government began an official inquiry into what, precisely, the Pritzkers were trying to do.
Pritzker wrote off the tax fraud claims during the campaign as ""politically motivated."" Through a spokesperson, Pritzker told media that he does not believe he or his wife engaged in any wrongdoing.
""Neither the Governor nor the First Lady have been contacted by law enforcement regarding the property tax appeal,” the spokesperson, a high-powered attorney whose firm worked with Pritzker during the campaign, told WBEZ. “We are confident that any further review of the matter will show that the appropriate rules were followed.”
Pritzker himself told media that he has “no concerns at all” about the probe and that he knows as much about the Federal government's investigation as reporters do: ""what I know is what you all know from the reporting that was done this week.”
The news of an Illinois governor under Federal investigation may not be very novel -- many of the state's former governors often live out their ""retirement' behind bars -- this one comes at a particularly fraught time for Illinois and for the governor, who is trying to convince Illinois residents that a significant tax hike is needed in order to address the state's overwhelming financial issues.
Pritzker is proposing changing the state's ""flat"" income tax to a graduated income tax in order to ensure that the state's rich pay their ""fair share."" His Republican opposition have already pointed out -- quite cleverly -- that even given the opportunity, it appears Pritzker -- one of the state's wealthiest businessman -- may have resorted to breaking the law in order to avoid paying his own fair share to the citizens of Cook County."
"'LET TERRORISTS VOTE': RNC Releases Brutal Ad Blasting Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46434/let-terrorists-vote-rnc-releases-brutal-ad-ryan-saavedra,"April 25, 2019 views
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a brutal ad slamming socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) over their stances on letting convicted terrorists vote while they are in prison.
The video features news coverage of the tragic Boston Marathon Bombing and shows a picture of the Islamic terrorist who committed the attack, saying: ""Democrats believe this terrorist should be allowed to vote from prison.""
""On April 15, 2013, the excitement of Marathon Monday was shattered as two bombs exploded near the finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 280,"" MassLive.com reported . ""When the bombs exploded, three people were killed: 8-year-old Martin Richard, restaurant manager Krystle Campbell and Boston University graduate student Lu Lingzi. Many more were seriously injured, some with limbs amputated.""
WATCH:
During a CNN town hall event on Monday, Sanders said that the Boston Marathon Bomber should be allowed to vote from prison.
""Would [you] support enfranchising people like the Boston Marathon bomber, a convicted terrorist and murderer?"" Sanders was asked by an audience member. ""Do you think those convicted of sexual assault should have the opportunity to vote for politicians who could have a direct impact on women’s rights?""
""If somebody commits a serious crime, sexual assault, murder, they’re going to be punished,"" Sanders responded. ""They may be in jail 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole life. That’s what happens when you commit a serious crime.""
""But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy,"" he continued. ""Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away … you’re running down a slippery slope … I believe even if they are in jail, they’re paying the price to society, that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.""
CNN's Chris Cuomo, who hosted Sanders' town hall, pressed Sanders over his answer. Sanders doubled down.
""Look, this is what I believe. Do you believe in Democracy?"" Sanders continued. ""Do you believe that every single American 18 years of age or older who is an American citizen has the right to vote. Once you start chipping away at that, believe me that's what our Republican governors all over this country are doing.""
""I believe every single person does have the right to vote,"" Sanders added.
Harris echoed a similar sentiment to Sanders when she was asked the question on Monday night.
""Another issue that I want to talk to you about — this is really important — I'm not sure if you were watching earlier, but Senator Bernie Sanders said that he is in favor of felons being able to vote while serving in prison,"" Lemon began. ""He was asked specifically about people like the Boston Marathon bomber, also people who are convicted of sexual assault. And he said, this is a quote, 'The right to vote is inherent to our democracy, yes, even for terrible people.' Do you agree with that, Senator?""
""I agree that the right to vote is one of the very important components of citizenship and it is something that people should not be stripped of needlessly, which is why I have been long an advocate of making sure that the formally incarcerated are not denied a right to vote, which is the case in so many states in our country, in some states permanently deprived of the right to vote,"" Harris responded.
""But people who are in — convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row, people who are convicted of sexual assault, they should be able to vote?"" Lemon fired back.
""I think we should have that conversation,"" Harris responded.
Harris walked her comments back less than 24 hours later, saying: ""Do I think that people who commit murder, people who are terrorists should be deprived of their rights? Yeah, I do."" "

Soon after former Vice President Joe Biden officially announced his long-expected 2020 presidential candidacy on Thursday, former President Barack Obama, whom Biden served under for eight years, notably stopped short of endorsing his former VP for the job.
""President Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made,"" Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill told MSNBC in a statement. ""He relied on the Vice President's knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today.""
Biden promptly trotted out his deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, to inform the mainstream media that he asked Obama not to endorse him.
""The vice president actually asked the president not to endorse,"" argued Bedingfield, adding, ""He wants to make his own case. He is running on an incredibly strong message of wanting to restore the soul of the nation."" Biden's Deputy Campaign Manager says Biden asked Obama not to endorse him.

Similarly, when Biden himself was pressed by a Fox News reporter about the Obama snub, the former VP claimed, ""I asked President Obama not to endorse and he doesn't want to — whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits.""

Obama will surely throw his weight behind whomever the Democrat Party chooses to be their nominee. But the notion that Biden didn’t want the former president’s endorsement and preemptively asked him not to endorse is, well, hard to accept.
Though Biden was leading most polling concerning the 2020 Democrat nomination even before he officially declared his candidacy, the former VP was plagued with controversies from the far-left base of the party. For example, Biden found himself on the defensive when numerous women accused the Democrat of inappropriately touching them. Additionally, he has been buried in criticism over his anti-woke past takes on issues concerning race and sexual orientation.
In other words, an endorsement from Obama, who is still largely beloved by Democrats, would have been monumentally helpful for Uncle Joe.
Trying to earn Woke points on his own, Biden announced his candidacy on Thursday with a racially charged video, castigating President Donald Trump as a defender of white supremacists based on the president’s ""very fine people on both sides"" comment following the violent Charlottesville protest.
""In that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I'd seen in my lifetime,"" Biden says in the video, adding that Trump must be stopped in 2020 or ""he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are."""

In the recent instance, the complaint was accepted on appeal, according to a source, and may have been granted after recent criticism of the office’s alleged discrimination against men.
A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by Kursat Christoff Pekgoz, who has filed multiple complaints alleging anti-male bias at various institutions across the country, revealed that the Boston office had never previously accepted a Title IX complaint in the sexual harassment category from a male accuser or an accused male since 2011, when the Obama administration implemented new, draconian rules regarding campus sexual assault. At the same time, the Boston office aggressively prosecuted academic institutions, such as Harvard Law School, for alleged bias against female accusers.
The office accepted the complaint from a male on appeal after the FOIA documents were received.
The Boston office did not respond to a Daily Wire inquiry prior to press time.
As Pekgoz explained to the Daily Wire, the “overwhelming majority of Title IX complaints in OCR's docket are either Title IX: sexual harassment complaints, which can be filed either by accusers or the accused, or complaints about athletic facilities.” A tiny percentage of cases are labeled “other,” and refer to cases such as those filed by Pekgoz that challenge female-only programs at various colleges and universities.
One recent complaint Pekgoz filed, which was dismissed by the Boston office, was in response to the recent guidelines put out by the American Psychological Association (APA) claiming traditional masculinity was “harmful.” Pekgoz filed the complaint against Harvard University, alleging the university discriminates against men because it is a “sponsor and accomplice of the APA.” As part of the complaint, Pekgoz alleged that “By using APA’s guidelines, Harvard University discourages men from seeking counseling services.”
“No reasonable male person would seek counseling at a clinic where his gender is considered to be a form of mental illness (or a driving factor for mental illness),” the complaint continued. “Such dissuasion is prohibited by Title IX.”
When dismissing Pekgoz’s complaint,” the Boston office said that the content of the guidelines was the issue, and that Harvard was not responsible for those guidelines.
“OCR determined that while you disagree with the Guidelines, you did not provide any information indicating that the University took actions with respect to the Guidelines that subjected men to different treatment, denied them any aids, benefits or services, or were otherwise discriminatory based on sex.”
Pekgoz told the Daily Wire he would not appeal the dismissal.
Hans Bader, an attorney in the Education Department’s Office of General Counsel, who has been a staunch critic of the Department’s sexual assault policies that were unfair to men, said OCR, in this instance, made the right call. Bader said in an email responding to Pekgoz (which he allowed the Daily Wire to quote) that he didn’t believe “Harvard’s mere ties to the APA create a hostile environment, even if its guidelines are to some extent sexist in how they treat masculinity.”
Further, Bader said that “Disputes about appropriate treatment should be resolved through academic and scholarly debate, not administrative dictates from Washington.”
Pekgoz’s complaint fell into the “other” category. While his complaint may have been dismissed for valid reasons, it would be difficult for the Boston office to justify why out of all the complaints it has received, it has until recently never accepted one from a male alleging to have been sexually harassed or treated unfairly.

WOW: Beto O’Rourke Claims That Planned Parenthood Saves Lives | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46459/wow-beto-orourke-claims-planned-parenthood-saves-josh-hammer,"April 26, 2019 views
Planned Parenthood, the nation's number one abortion mill , snuffs out more unborn lives than does any other entity presently operating in the United States. But apparently former Texas congressman and current 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke thinks that Planned Parenthood actually saves lives.
The Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra tweeted out a video yesterday of the underlying incident: Asked about late-term abortions, Democrat Beto O’Rourke says Planned Parenthood saves lives pic.twitter.com/wQmbVusL40 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 25, 2019
And here is the full video from the Republican National Committee's ""GOP War Room"" account:
In the exchange, O'Rourke is asked how, if elected president, he would safeguard ""safe and legal abortion"" throughout the nation. O'Rourke then says, ""as we shut down all these family planning clinics in my home state of Texas, we've made it so hard for women to just get any kind of healthcare at all — including access to a legal, safe abortion."" He continued, ""When I connect the fact that family planning clinics — Planned Parenthood, to be specific — in Texas is saving the lives of our fellow women, and it's a life-and-death matter in this country.""
According to the Washington Examiner , Planned Parenthood reported a whopping 332,757 abortions conducted in the U.S. last year — averaging out to over 900 per day:
The number of abortions by Planned Parenthood increased by 11,373 over the course of a year, according to the organization's 2017-2108 annual report released this weekend.
The report shows that Planned Parenthood conducted 332,757 abortions for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2018, an increase from 321,384 during the previous fiscal year.
Abortions make up 3.4 percent of the services Planned Parenthood performs, an increase from 3 percent the previous year. More than half of its clinics, or 357 out of roughly 600, provide medication abortions, which women can use up to roughly 10 weeks into a pregnancy. The annual report does not indicate the amount of revenue collected from providing abortions. Some health insurance companies cover abortions, other women receive financial help, and others pay out of pocket.
Alas, O'Rourke seems rather indifferent to these positively galling figures.
This is hardly the first time this week that O'Rourke has made unfortunate national headlines. As The Daily Wire reported on Wednesday, an officer at the scene of the presidential candidate's well-documented 1998 DWI crash scene recently confirmed that O'Rourke tried to flee the scene of the wreck he caused back then. The Texas Tribune noted :
The former police officer who arrested Beto O’Rourke for driving drunk in 1998, along with the sergeant who signed the incident report, both say they believe now what they reported at the time: that O’Rourke tried to leave the scene of the wreck he caused.
O’Rourke admits he was intoxicated and says there is no justification for his actions, but he has denied that he tried to flee. ...
Neither the investigating officer, Richard Carrera, nor his former supervisor, Gary Hargrove, specifically recalls the events of that night more than 20 years ago. But both of the former Anthony Police Department officers told The Texas Tribune they have no doubt the report they compiled and signed is accurate.
""I believe we have contradicting stories here,"" said Carrera, who arrested the 26-year-old O’Rourke and took him to a police station to undergo a breath test. ""I stand by my report."""
Obama White House Sought Ukraine’s Help In Taking Down Trump: REPORT | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46449/obama-white-house-sought-ukraines-help-taking-down-ashe-schow,"April 26, 2019 views
The Obama White House brought in Ukrainian authorities to help jumpstart the Russian collusion narrative and to help then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son out of a jam.
John Solomon, an opinion contributor to The Hill, lays out the results of a meeting between Obama White House officials and the Ukrainian authorities. Solomon spoke to multiple participants in the meeting and viewed memos from the time to bring us the story.
“The agenda suggested the purpose was training and coordination. But Ukrainian participants said it didn’t take long — during the meetings and afterward — to realize the Americans’ objectives included two politically hot investigations: one that touched Vice President Joe Biden’s family and one that involved a lobbying firm linked closely to then-candidate Trump,” Solomon wrote.
Andrii Telizhenko, who was at the meeting, told Solomon that the Obama officials “kept talking about how important it was that all of our anti-corruption efforts be united.” Telizhenko at the time was a political officer at the Ukraine’s embassy in Washington, D.C. He said U.S. officials said during the meeting that they wanted to see a 2014 investigation into payments made from Ukraine’s Russia-backed Party of Regions to U.S. citizens, including Paul Manafort, reopened. At the time of the payments, Manafort was a lobbyist. Manafort would be hired to then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign in March 2016.
The 2014 investigation was closed without charges filed against Manafort. Telizhenko told Solomon he didn’t remember if Manafort’s name was mentioned during the meeting with White House officials, but he remembers the investigation being brought up.
“It was definitely the case that led to the charges against Manafort and the leak to U.S. media during the 2016 election,” Telizhenko said.
Another participant in the meetings, Nazar Kholodnytskyy, told Solomon he didn’t attend all the meetings in January 2016 and couldn’t remember the specific cases that were mentioned. But he did say he thought it “was extremely suspicious” that after these meetings, a ledger showing payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions suddenly became public knowledge. The existence of the ledger was released 10 days after Manafort was promoted to Trump’s campaign chairman.
“Somebody kept this black ledger secret for two years and then showed it to the public and the U.S. media. It was extremely suspicious,” he said.
He also said he had told the investigators who leaked the ledger not to do so.
“I ordered the detectives to give nothing to the mass media considering this case. Instead, they had broken my order and published themselves these one or two pages of this black ledger regarding Paul Manafort,” Kholodnytskyy said.
“For me it was the first call that something was going wrong and that there is some external influence in this case. And there is some other interests in this case not in the interest of the investigation and a fair trial,” he continued.
Solomon wrote that a Ukrainian court ruled the ledger’s leak “was an illegal attempt to influence the U.S. election.” Further, “a member of Ukraine’s parliament has released a recording of a NABU official saying the agency released the ledger to help Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign.”
And this was all started by the Obama White House.
The other investigation discussed at these meetings involved Biden’s son, which Solomon reported on earlier this month . Biden had bragged about getting Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin fired, leaving out the part that Shokin was investigating corruption involving Biden’s son’s company."
A Harvard Conference Keynote Speaker Has Written That Religious Jews And Christians ‘Deserve To Be Locked Up’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46463/harvard-conference-keynote-speaker-has-written-josh-hammer,"A Harvard Conference Keynote Speaker Has Written That Religious Jews And Christians ‘Deserve To Be Locked Up’ Paul Marotta/Getty Images April 26, 2019 views
Yesterday, Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts & Sciences (FAS) hosted an event entitled, ""FAS Diversity Conference: A Decade of Dialogue."" The event description highlighted that ""anti-racism"" activist Tim Wise would be the featured keynote speaker:
Over the last ten years, the FAS Diversity Dialogue Series has sparked conversation about diversity, equality and inclusion in the FAS community and beyond. Join us for a retrospective look at diversity and inclusion, a discussion of current issues, and practical guidance on how we can move toward greater inclusion and belonging at Harvard.
We are pleased to announce that our keynote speaker will be Tim Wise, prominent anti-racism writer, educator, and activist. A moderated discussion with Tim will be led by Renee Graham, an associate editor and columnist at the Boston Globe.
Hold aside for a second why Harvard would invite a white, reportedly heterosexual man to lead its ten-year commemoration conference on a diversity initiative. Because as conservative campus watchdog site The College Fix reports , this ""anti-racism"" activist has a rather colorful online history of grotesquely bigoted statements against religious Jews and Christians. Most specifically, Wise has publicly called for those who actually believe in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament to be ""locked up.""
Per The College Fix :
Tim Wise, an ""anti-racism writer, educator and activist,"" has denigrated Christians as ""Jeezoids and fascists and called Pope Francis evil. He has tweeted that ""people who believe in a God of hell/damnation deserve to be mocked viciously and run out of the public square.""
Those who base their morality on the Hebrew Scriptures ""deserve to be locked up,"" he said in 2015, claiming to be ""sorta kidding but not by much.""
The Diversity Dialogue Series provides a ""retrospective look at diversity and inclusion, a discussion of current issues, and practical guidance on how we can move toward greater inclusion and belonging at Harvard,"" according to the event description.
Here is the full underlying Facebook post from 2015, which features Wise commenting derogatorily about former U.S. congresswoman Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) and which he set to a public viewership:
This is America...people basing their beliefs on the fable of Noah and Ark, or their interpretation of Sodom and Gomorrah...rather than science or logic...If you are basing your morality on a fairy tale written thousands of years ago, you deserve to be locked up...detained for your utter inability to deal with reality...NO, we are not obligated to indulge your irrationality in the name of your religious freedom...but we will provide you a very comfortable room, against which walls you may hurl yourself hourly if your choose. Knock yourself out....seriously, knock yourself out, completely, for weeks at a time...I'm sorta kidding but not by much...I don't believe lunatics like this should be locked up, but I do think they have to be politically destroyed, utterly rendered helpless to the cause of pluralism and democracy ...the world is not theirs. They have no right to impose their bullshit on others. They can either change, or shut the hell up, or practice their special brand of crazy in their homes...or go away. Their choice. And this argument applies to any fundamentalist religionist of any faith who thinks they have a right to impose their beliefs on a secular, pluralistic society. Go away.
In Wise's extremely limited defense, The College Fix notes that the noted ""anti-racism"" activist avoided any bigoted anti-Jewish/anti-Christian language during his Harvard appearance yesterday. "
Scarlett Johansson: 'Democratic Party Is Broken In A Lot Of Ways' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46443/scarlett-johansson-democratic-party-broken-lot-paul-bois,"April 26, 2019 views
In recent interview, ""Avengers: Endgame"" star Scarlett Johansson said the Democratic Party is ""broken in a lot of ways"" and ""damaged from these past several years.""
Speaking with Variety on Thursday, the actress said that she has to do a ""little soul searching"" before she decides upon who to vote for in 2020.
""Although now is certainly the time to back someone,"" she told Variety, in comments highlighted by Fox News . ""I think I have to do a little soul searching. I think the Democratic Party is broken in a lot of ways and just damaged from these past several years. For me, if there was one candidate that I felt we could all unite behind, certainly that would be the candidate that I would back.""
""They're out there, certainly. I mean it's been a strange few weeks,"" she continued. ""I think it was clear and then it became sort of unclear.""
When asked for her thoughts on former Vice President Joe Biden entering the race, Johansson simply said. ""I don't know."" As to whether or not allegations of past inappropriate touching will sink him, the actress also said, ""I'm not sure.""
Variety also asked Johansson if she would consider her own political run one day. She effectively punted the question by emphasizing the importance of local politics. ""I think the greatest way to effect change is in local politics,"" she explained. ""Maybe at some point in the distant future, I will feel that calling, but I just haven’t.""
Scarlett Johansson endorsed Barack Obama in the 2012 election and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
""Hillary is the right candidate for right now,"" Scarlett told Variety for their Power Of Women issue. ""I think she’s got a lot of integrity. She’s got a lot of stamina. She’s a very clever politician, and that’s actually important to me. Maybe it’s because I have a daughter now.""
At the 2012 DNC, the actress extolled the importance of government-funded services like Medicaid and abortion-conglomerate Planned Parenthood. ""We went to public schools and depended on programs for school transport and lunches, as did most of my friends,"" she said of her childhood. ""My girlfriends from high school to this day still depend on Planned Parenthood and often Medicaid for important health care services.""
Johansson saw her star power slightly slip in 2017 when both films in which she headlined – ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Rough Night"" – failed to attract audiences and critical acclaim. Leading up to the release of ""Ghost in the Shell,"" Johansson actually said that audiences who disagree with her politics should stay home rather than a buy a ticket.
""If fighting, you know, for women’s rights, for women’s reproductive rights, and you know, in support of Planned Parenthood, if that’s going to, you know, mean that some people don’t want to buy a ticket to see 'Ghost in the Shell', then … I’m OK with that,"" she told ""Good Morning America.""
""Ghost in the Shell"" went on to reportedly lose $60 million . She later faced heavy criticism from the Left when she accepted a role to play a transgender man, which she eventually dropped after the intense backlash."
Federal Judge Halts A High-Profile Anti-BDS Law In Texas | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46468/federal-judge-halts-high-profile-anti-bds-law-josh-hammer,"Federal Judge Halts A High-Profile Anti-BDS Law In Texas Fairfax Media via Getty Images April 26, 2019 views
In 2017, Texas passed into law a statute that forbids government agencies in Texas from doing business with contractors who boycott Israel. The bill passed the Texas House of Representatives by a 131-0 margin. At the time, Joel Schwitzer, the regional director of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) in Dallas, told The Jerusalem Post : ""We appreciate the leadership of Representative Phil King in authoring the bill. It is gratifying to see our elected officials sending such a clear and principled message that Texas will not do business with those who boycott our friend Israel.""
Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott was positively emphatic , upon signing the bill into law, referring to anti-Israel policies as necessarily also being ""anti-Texas policies"":
""I am proud to have commemorated Israel’s Independence Day by signing into law Anti-BDS legislation in Texas,"" said Governor Abbott. ""As Israel's number one trading partner in the United States, Texas is proud to reaffirm its support for the people of Israel and we will continue to build on our historic partnership. Anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies, and we will not tolerate such actions against an important ally.""
The law, according to the governor's press release , ""prohibits the state of Texas from conducting business with companies involved in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.""
This past December, after groups such as the ACLU filed First Amendment claims against Texas's law, Texas Rep. Phil King (R-Weatherford) announced a plan to tweak the measure to better assure its constitutionality. USA Today reported :
The Texas lawmaker who wrote an anti-boycott of Israel law that has led to the canceling of contracts for a debate judge, a translator, a speech therapist and a public radio station reporter said Thursday that he will introduce legislation next month to clarify individuals were never the intended targets.
The comments by Texas Rep. Phil King follows the filing of a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas over the 2017 law that requires contractors doing business with the state to certify they are not engaged in boycotts of Israel.
Earlier this month, the Texas Legislature ratified King's legislative amendments. According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , King stated from the Texas House floor: ""Two years ago, the Legislature put this policy in place that said we didn’t want taxpayer dollars being spent to promote a boycott against Israel. The intent of this legislation is to narrow the (law)...which had some unintended consequences."" The Sun-Sentinel confirms that King's amended law would make categorical exceptions for ""individuals and smaller companies, such as those with fewer than 10 full-time employees or valued under $100,000.""
Alas, there was still a major setback yesterday for anti-BDS activists. Judge Robert Pitman of the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Texas, an Obama judicial nominee, enjoined enforcement of the initial 2017 statute on First Amendment grounds. The Texas Tribune reports:
A federal judge has temporarily blocked the enforcement of a state law that prohibits government agencies in Texas from doing business with contractors who are boycotting Israel.
U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman issued an injunction Thursday against the law, saying it threatens to suppress unpopular ideas and manipulates “the public debate through coercion rather than persuasion.”
""This the First Amendment does not allow,"" he wrote.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has already announced that he will appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit."
WALSH: The Horrifying Case That Proves Our Parental Rights Are Under Serious Attack In This Country | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46455/walsh-horrifying-case-proves-our-parental-rights-matt-walsh,"April 26, 2019 views
Reason has a horrifying and harrowing report from Robby Soave detailing the months-long saga of corruption and abuse that a family suffered at the hands of law enforcement and child protective services. It is well worth reading the whole article, which I will only briefly summarize here.
The Lowther family of New Mexico found themselves in the crosshairs after a teacher at the four-year-old daughter’s school claimed that the girl reported that she’d been sexually abused by her father and her seven-year-old brother. The district attorney (DA) would eventually decline to move forward with the case because there was no evidence whatsoever, the child’s story changed wildly in the telling and included a number of obviously fantastical details, the father passed multiples polygraph tests, and it’s likely that the girl was really just describing her father helping her wipe after using the toilet (something all parents have done for their children many times). But in between the initial “report” from the girl and the DA’s decision to drop the whole matter, the Lowther family was ripped apart, the children were placed in foster care, the father was fired from his job and labeled a child rapist by the media, the young girl was subjected to lengthy interrogations and extraordinarily invasive physical exams, the family was forced to shell out $300,000 in legal expenses, and the accused father and his wife were both summarily stripped of all parental rights, not to mention their Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendment rights as well.
The most frightening aspect of the story is the malicious and underhanded manner with which the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) and local police operated throughout the proceedings. They decided from the outset that Adam Lowther must be guilty (because who has ever heard of a four-year-old kid telling fanciful stories?) and treated him like a child-raping felon, accordingly. These agencies were interested in establishing guilt by whatever means necessary, not ascertaining the objective truth. They also had the advantage of a system that automatically turns entire families into wards of the state as soon as someone in government decides that someone in that family may have done something wrong.
After being contacted by the school, the police forced their way into the family’s home, without a warrant, and forbade the mother, Jessica, from speaking to her children. Eventually, the children would end up in foster care. They were briefly returned to Jessica’s custody (Adam was not allowed to see his kids for several months after the initial arrest), but she had to have her parents move in and act as “safety monitors.” The children were removed from their mother’s custody once again when CYFD got word that the safety monitors didn’t believe in Adam’s guilt.
As I said, read the whole report. I recently finished the second volume of The Gulag Archipelago — Solzhenitsyn’s magnum opus about the Soviet labor camp system — and the Lowther family’s experiences seem to bear certain uncomfortable resemblances. And their story is not unique. Many innocent mothers and fathers have similarly discovered that they have no rights and no presumption of innocence once the despots at child services come knocking.
It is the nightmare scenario that every parent dreads. What if your child goes to school with a story he made up in his head, or repeats something he heard from a friend, or for whatever other reason says something that accidentally implicates you as an abuser or worse? My five-year-old daughter likes to erroneously claim that her twin brother “punched her in the head.” I’ve seen both of them smack each other on various occasions, but I’ve never seen my son punch anyone. Kids make up stories. And if they’re young enough, they don’t even know that they’re making it up. Children before the age of reason cannot fully distinguish between a lie and the truth. So, what if my daughter went out in public one day and told a slightly different version of her familiar yarn: ""Daddy punched me in the head?""
That would be enough, it seems, to land my kids in foster care and me behind bars. Every parent is in this boat. The only thing keeping our parental rights intact is that our kids haven’t made up the wrong kind of story and told it to the wrong person — which is another way of saying that we don’t really have parental rights. If child services can revoke those rights at any time, without evidence, without investigation, without reasonable cause, without even a consistent or credible accusation, then what does it mean to say we have the ""rights"" in the first place?
I believe, of course, that actual allegations of abuse must be investigated. Certainly we can’t ignore a child who claims that her parents are abusing her. Some parents really are guilty of these horrible crimes. But due process cannot go out the window. Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats from social services cannot be empowered to act as prosecutor, judge, and jury. The rights of the parents, and the best interest of the children, must be absolutely preserved and respected at all times. But that is simply not how these cases often play out. Recommended For You"
Deputy AG: Obama Admin Didn't Tell Public 'Full Story' On Russia; 'Someone' Selectively Leaked Classified Info | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46471/deputy-ag-obama-admin-didnt-tell-public-full-story-james-barrett,"April 26, 2019 views
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein delivered some remarks at the Armenian Bar Association’s Public Servants Dinner Thursday night — and made several assertions about the Russia investigation, including the role of the ""previous administration,"" that have turned some heads.
""At my confirmation hearing in March 2017, a Republican Senator asked me to make a commitment,"" said Rosenstein. ""He said: 'You’re going to be in charge of this [Russia] investigation. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that you’ll do it right, that you’ll take it to its conclusion and you’ll report [your results] to the American people.'""
""I did pledge to do it right and take it to the appropriate conclusion,"" he said in defense of his handling of the investigation. ""I did not promise to report all results to the public, because grand jury investigations are ex parte proceedings. It is not our job to render conclusive factual findings. We just decide whether it is appropriate to file criminal charges.""
Rosenstein then dropped a series of loaded claims about the Obama administration's handling of Russian meddling, ""selectively leaked"" classified information, and the actions of fired FBI Director James Comey (h/t Ed Morrissey ).
""Some critical decisions about the Russia investigation were made before I got there,"" said Rosenstein. ""The previous administration chose not to publicize the full story about Russian computer hackers and social media trolls, and how they relate to a broader strategy to undermine America. The FBI disclosed classified evidence about the investigation to ranking legislators and their staffers. Someone selectively leaked details to the news media. The FBI Director announced at a congressional hearing that there was a counterintelligence investigation that might result in criminal charges. Then the former FBI Director alleged that the President pressured him to close the investigation, and the President denied that the conversation occurred.""
He followed up that rather damning critique with an understated one-liner: ""So that happened."" He then turned to a humorous reference to describe how he felt walking into his role as acting attorney general. ""There is a story about firefighters who found a man on a burning bed. When they asked how the fire started, he replied, 'I don’t know. It was on fire when I lay down on it.' I know the feeling.""
The ""bottom line,"" he said, is ""there was overwhelming evidence that Russian operatives hacked American computers and defrauded American citizens, and that is only the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive Russian strategy to influence elections, promote social discord, and undermine America, just like they do in many other countries.""
Rosenstein also took a few lethal shots at the ""mercenary critics,"" who ""get paid to express passionate opinions about any topic, often with little or no information,"" and apparently believe it's their job to ""launch ad hominem attacks unrestricted by truth or morality,"" ""make threats,"" and ""spread fake stories.""
Below are Rosenstein's full remarks ( transcript provided by the Department of Justice):
“Peri yerego.” Good evening.
Rick, I am grateful for your friendship and for your 20 years of exceptional service to the Department of Justice — including seven years as the United States Attorney for Northern New York.
I am pleased to see several U.S. Attorneys here tonight: Geoff Berman from Southern New York, Richard Donoghue from Eastern New York, Grant Jaquith from Northern New York, and Craig Carpenito from New Jersey; as well as eight former U.S. Attorneys, and many other current and former government employees.
I am thankful to Armenian Bar Association Chair Gerard Kassabian, and Vice Chairs Kathryn Ossian and Lucy Varpetian.
My wife served on your board of governors from 1993 to 2002. I got to know many of the members, particularly the group that traveled with us to Armenia in 1994 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the University of Yerevan.
When I met Lisa in 1988, some of her relatives viewed me as “odar,” an outsider to the culture. But recently a friend introduced me as “Armenian by Choice.” After tonight, I have an even stronger claim to be an honorary Armenian.
“Shot Shenorhagal em.” Thank you very much.
Our wedding featured an Armenian opera singer who is in the audience tonight, Maro Partamian. One of my favorite songs was “Lerner Hyreni,” or “Mountains of Armenia.” We hired the “Dark Eyes” band to play at the reception, which was great except that I chose a country song called “I Swear” by John Michael Montgomery for the first dance. It did not sound quite right with an Armenian accent.
One of Lisa’s relatives was raised in Syria, where government service was not highly valued. Before he approved of the marriage, he wanted to know when I planned to get a real job, in the private sector.
Unfortunately, many native-born Americans also are skeptical about government service. My Uncle Harold was a self-employed carpet installer. One beautiful spring afternoon in 1994, I called him from an office in the Department of Justice headquarters building. It was a Saturday. And when I told him that I was working through the weekend, he said, “I’m sorry to hear that.”
And I said, “You don’t understand. There is no place that I would rather be.”
I first walked into that building as a federal prosecutor on December 3, 1990, at age 25. I remember how honored I felt to represent the people of the United States. I will still feel the same way when I walk out for the last time next month.
I joined the Department of Justice because I believe in the mission. I stayed because I believe in the people who carry out the mission.
Our agents, analysts, and attorneys demonstrate great intellect and integrity. They possess superb academic credentials and exceptional character. They pass rigorous screening interviews and face thorough background checks every few years. They are ethical, honorable, and admirable people.
No organization with 115,000 employees is error-free. But we have serious, professional, nonpartisan internal watchdogs. We investigate credible misconduct allegations. We correct mistakes and punish wrongdoers.
I have served under five Presidents and nine Senate-confirmed Attorneys General — ten, if you count Bill Barr twice. I served mostly outside the D.C. beltway, but I worked at Department of Justice headquarters three times — four years in the early 1990s as a career prosecutor, four years in the early 2000s as a supervisor, and two years in my current job.
Our headquarters is a beautiful Depression-era building. I frequently speak about the inspiration that I draw from three aspects of the building – the art it contains; the people it employs; and the principles it represents.
There are reminders of heroes, mentors, and friends on every floor. They taught me that our Department stands for the principle that every American deserves the protection of the rule of law.
We use the term “rule of law” to describe our obligation to follow neutral principles. As President Trump pointed out, “we govern ourselves in accordance with the rule of law rather [than] … the whims of an elite few or the dictates of collective will.”
Justice Anthony Kennedy explained it this way: in a rule of law system, when you apply to a government clerk for a permit and you satisfy the objective criteria, you are not asking for a favor. You are entitled to the permit, and it is the clerk’s duty to give it to you.
The idea that the government works for the people is relatively novel. In some countries, that concept of a government bound by law to serve the people does not exist.
When I visited Armenia in 1994, the nation was emerging from seven decades of Soviet domination. Gyumri and other northern cities were not yet rebuilt after the 1988 earthquake. The six-year war with Azerbaijan was halted by a recent ceasefire, but the blockade over Nagorno-Karabakh crippled the economy.
We flew on Air Armenia, which used a shabby old Russian jet. Our plane needed to stop for fuel in Bulgaria, and we heard that the pilots paid with cash.
Armenia faced many challenges in 1994. Many skilled and educated people had left the country. When we hired a taxi to visit Lake Sevan, the driver turned off the engine at every downhill stretch to conserve gasoline.
We stayed at a nice hotel near Republic Square, but some mornings there was no water to flush the toilets, and some evenings there was no electricity to cook the food.
I gave a lecture at the University of Yerevan about public corruption. When I finished, a student raised his hand. He asked, “If you can’t pay bribes in America, then how do you get electricity?”
I repeat that question in many speeches. It usually elicits laughter. But the point is profound.
The question illustrates how that young man understood Soviet society. Corruption undermines law. It stifles innovation, creates inefficiency, and inculcates distrust.
The question explains why I devoted my career to law enforcement: because the rule of law is the foundation of human liberty. The rule of law secures our freedom. It will secure our children’s freedom. And we can only achieve it if people who enforce the law set aside partisanship, because the rule of law requires a fair and independent process; a process where all citizens are equal in the eyes of the government.
I do not care how police officers, prosecutors, and judges vote, just as I do not care how soldiers and sailors vote. That is none of my business. I only care whether they understand that when they are on duty, their job is about law and not politics.
There is not Republican justice and Democrat justice. There is only justice and injustice.
In the courtyard of the Department of Justice headquarters, there is an inscription that reads, in Latin: “Privilegium Obligatio.” It means that when you accept a privilege, you incur an obligation. Working for Justice is a privilege.
Our commensurate obligations are established by our oath to well and faithfully execute the duties of the office. To honor that oath, you need to know your office’s unique duties. At our Department, our job is to seek the truth, apply the law, follow the Department’s policies, and respect its principles.
The rule of law is our most important principle. Patriots must always defend the rule of law. Even when it is not in their personal interest, it is always in the national interest. If you find yourself asking, “What will this decision mean for me?” then you probably are not complying with your oath of office.
At my confirmation hearing in March 2017, a Republican Senator asked me to make a commitment. He said: “You’re going to be in charge of this [Russia] investigation. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that you’ll do it right, that you’ll take it to its conclusion and you’ll report [your results] to the American people.”
I did pledge to do it right and take it to the appropriate conclusion. I did not promise to report all results to the public, because grand jury investigations are ex parte proceedings. It is not our job to render conclusive factual findings. We just decide whether it is appropriate to file criminal charges.
Some critical decisions about the Russia investigation were made before I got there. The previous Administration chose not to publicize the full story about Russian computer hackers and social media trolls, and how they relate to a broader strategy to undermine America. The FBI disclosed classified evidence about the investigation to ranking legislators and their staffers. Someone selectively leaked details to the news media. The FBI Director announced at a congressional hearing that there was a counterintelligence investigation that might result in criminal charges. Then the former FBI Director alleged that the President pressured him to close the investigation, and the President denied that the conversation occurred.
So that happened.
There is a story about firefighters who found a man on a burning bed. When they asked how the fire started, he replied, “I don’t know. It was on fire when I lay down on it.” I know the feeling.
But the bottom line is, there was overwhelming evidence that Russian operatives hacked American computers and defrauded American citizens, and that is only the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive Russian strategy to influence elections, promote social discord, and undermine America, just like they do in many other countries.
In 1941, as Hitler sought to enslave Europe and Japan’s emperor prepared to attack America, Attorney General Robert Jackson admonished federal prosecutors about their role in protecting national security. He said: “Defense is not only a matter of battleships and tanks, of guns and [soldiers]…. It is raw materials, machines and [people who] work in factories. It is public morale. It is a law abiding population and a nation free from internal disorder . . . the ramparts we watch are not only those on the outer borders which are largely the concern of the military services. There are also the inner ramparts of our society — the Constitution, its guarantees, our freedoms and the supremacy of law. These are yours to guard and their protection is your defense program.”
As acting Attorney General, it was my responsibility to make sure that the Department of Justice would do what the American people pay us to do: conduct an independent investigation; complete it expeditiously; hold perpetrators accountable if warranted; and work with partner agencies to counter foreign agents and deter crimes.
Today, our nation is safer, elections are more secure, and citizens are better informed about covert foreign influence schemes.
But not everybody was happy with my decision, in case you did not notice.
It is important to keep a sense of humor in Washington. You just need to accept that politicians need to evaluate everything in terms of the immediate political impact.
Then there are the mercenary critics, who get paid to express passionate opinions about any topic, often with little or no information. They do not just express disagreement. They launch ad hominem attacks unrestricted by truth or morality. They make threats, spread fake stories, and even attack your relatives. I saw one of the professional provocateurs at a holiday party. He said, “I’m sorry that I’m making your life miserable.” And I said, “You do your job, and I’ll do mine.”
His job is to entertain and motivate partisans, so he can keep making money. My job is to enforce the law in a non-partisan way; that is the whole point of the oath of office.
In our Department, we disregard the mercenary critics and focus on the things that matter. As Goethe said, “Things that matter most must never be at the mercy of things that matter least.” A republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle. Some of the nonsense that passes for breaking news today would not be worth the paper was printed on, if anybody bothered to print it. It quickly fades away. The principles are what abide.
America’s founders understood that the rule of law is not partisan. In 1770, five American colonists died after British soldiers fired on a crowd in the Boston Massacre. The soldiers were charged with murder. Many people believed that they deserved the death penalty.
John Adams agreed to represent the soldiers. His political beliefs were firmly against them. But Adams felt obligated to protect their rights under the law.
Defending British soldiers was a very unpopular cause, to put it mildly. Adams faced a serious risk, in his words, of “infamy,” or even “death.” In a diary entry about the trial, he wrote as follows: “In the evening I expressed to Mrs. Adams all my apprehensions: That excellent Lady, who has always encouraged me, burst into … Tears…. [S]he was very sensible of all the danger to her and to our children as well as to me, but she thought I had done as I ought, [and] she was … willing to share in all that was to come and place her trust in Providence.”
The rhetoric mirrors an earlier letter that Adams wrote to explain his preference for integrity over acclaim. Adams wrote that in theaters “the applause of the audience is of more importance to the actors than their own approbation. But upon the stage of life, while conscience claps, let the world hiss.”
Adams endured harsh criticism in the court of public opinion. But in the court of law, he secured the acquittal of the British captain and six soldiers.
At the trial, Adams delivered a timeless tribute to the rule of law. He said that “[f]acts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.”
Adams’ words remind us that people who seek the truth need to avoid confirmation bias. Truth is about solid evidence, not strong opinions. A 19th century Philadelphia doctor remarked that “sincerity of belief is not the test of truth.” Many people passionately believe things that are not true.
I spent most of my career prosecuting cases in federal courthouses. My past trials in courts of law contrast with my recent tribulations in the halls of Congress, the channels of cable television, and the pages of the internet.
The difference is in the standard of proof. In my business, we need to prove facts with credible evidence, prove them beyond any reasonable doubt, and prove them to the unanimous satisfaction of a neutral judge and an unbiased jury of 12 random citizens.
Pursuing truth requires keeping an open mind, avoiding confirmation bias, and always yielding to credible evidence. Truth may not match our preconceptions. Truth may not satisfy our hopes. But truth is the foundation of the rule of law.
If lawyers cannot prove our case in court, then what we believe is irrelevant.
But in politics, belief is the whole ball game. In politics – as in journalism – the rules of evidence do not apply. That is not a critique. It is just an observation.
Last year, a congressman explained why he decided not to run for reelection. He said, “I like … job[s] where facts matter. I like jobs where fairness matters. I like jobs where, frankly, … the process matters.”
He was describing an American courtroom. “I like the art of persuasion,” he said. “I like finding 12 people who have not already made up their minds and ... may [let] the facts prevail. That’s not where we are in politics.”
That congressman spoke the truth. It may never be where we are in politics. But it must always be where we are in law.
Attorney General Jackson spoke about the fiduciary duty of government lawyers, the obligation to serve as a trustee for the public interest. He contrasted the special duties of government lawyers with what he called “the volatile values of politics.” That was in 1940.
Jackson understood that “lawyers must at times risk ourselves and our records to defend our legal processes from discredit, and to maintain a dispassionate, disinterested, and impartial enforcement of the law.”
“We must have the courage to face any temporary criticism,” Jackson urged, because “the moral authority of our legal process” depends on the commitment of government lawyers to act impartially.
Jackson also spoke about the role of lawyers in preserving liberty. He used a parable about three stonecutters asked to describe what they are doing. The first stonecutter focuses on how the job benefits him. He says, “I am earning a living.” The second narrowly describes his personal task: “I am cutting stone.” The third man has a very different perspective. His face lights up as he explains what the work means to others: “I am helping to build a cathedral.”
“[W]hether we are aware of it or not,” Jackson explained, lawyers “do more than earn [a] living[]; we do more than [litigate] [individual] cases. We are building the legal structure that will protect … human liberty” for centuries to come.
As my time in public service comes to an end, I encourage each of you to remember the cathedral. You are always building a legacy. You set an example for your colleagues, and you lay a foundation for your successors.
Time flies when you get to work with good and honorable people. In the words of an Eagles song: “I’d do it all again; If I could somehow; But I must be leaving soon; It’s your world now… Use well your time; Be part of something good; Leave something good behind; … It’s your world now.”
Ladies and gentlemen, this evening means a great deal to Lisa and me.
“Shot Shenorhagal-em yev Pari Keesher.” Thank you, and good night."
Trump Never Called Neo-Nazis ‘Fine People’ In Charlottesville | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Michael J. Knowles,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46473/trump-never-called-neo-nazis-fine-people-michael-j-knowles,"Trump Never Called Neo-Nazis ‘Fine People’ In Charlottesville Joe Biden has launched his campaign on a lie. AFP Contributor / Getty April 26, 2019 views
Republicans owe a debt of gratitude to Joe Biden for launching his presidential campaign on the oft-repeated lie that President Trump referred to neo-Nazis and white nationalists as “very fine people” in Charlottesville. “With those words,” Biden intoned, “the President of the United States drew a moral equivalence between those who were spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it.”
Except he didn’t. On April 12, 2017, the very morning of the clash in Charlottesville, President Trump tweeted, “We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets [sic] come together as one!” We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017
Later that afternoon, President Trump addressed the Charlottesville violence on camera. He insisted, “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides, many sides,” referring to weapon-wielding Antifa activists, who even the New York Times admits became violent in Charlottesville. “What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives,” Trump concluded.
Two days later, amid continued accusations that he condoned racial bigotry, President Trump made his point more explicit. “Racism is evil,” he explained. “And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups, that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”
Undeterred by Trump’s clear condemnation of bigotry, the mainstream media continued to harangue the President for his allegedly ambiguous response to the violence, prompting the “very fine people” comment on which Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign. Finally, the media got what they wanted: President Trump defended neo-Nazis and white nationalists.
Except he didn’t. Here is what President Trump actually said:
If you reported it accurately, you would say that the neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville. Excuse me. They didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis. You had some very bad people in that group. You also had some very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down -- excuse me. Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him. Good. Are we going to take down his statue. He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? It is fine. You are changing history and culture.
You had people—and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists. They should be condemned totally. You had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.
President Trump began by acknowledging that neo-Nazis started the rally. He then observed that the organizers hid their ideological extremism. They titled the rally “Unite The Right,” rather than, say, “Three Cheers For Hitler” in order to blur the distinction between conservatism and fascism. To this end they also focused the event around mainstream opposition to the removal of historical monuments. Trump then explained the moral dilemmas raised by the removal of historical monuments. Finally, he specifically and explicitly “condemned totally” the “neo-Nazis and the white nationalists” present at the rally.
One might respond by denying that any fine people at all marched in Charlottesville, as Robert Tracinski argues at The Bulwark . Surely those elusive fine people must have heard the others chanting bigoted slogans. If they chose to remain in their company, they couldn't have been all that fine in the first place. Fine. But that would simply mean President Trump imagined fine people who never existed. Regardless, he never spoke well of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and in fact he condemned them repeatedly.
Joe Biden, a longtime race-baiter , launched his campaign on a shameless lie. Unfortunately for him, conservatives have taken the opportunity to recall that hoax and expose the truth."
BREAKING: New Details Released On Health Of 5-Year-Old Thrown Off Balcony In Mall Of America | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46475/breaking-new-details-released-health-5-year-old-ryan-saavedra,"New Details Released On Health Of 5-Year-Old Thrown Off Balcony In Mall Of America Mark Erickson/Getty Images April 26, 2019 views
The 5-year-old Landen Hoffmann, the boy who was thrown off a third-story balcony at the Mall of America earlier this month, is ""alert and conscious"" following weeks of hospitalization after the vicious attack.
In a statement posted to the GoFundMe for Hoffmann, which raised over $1,000,000, Hoffmann's family said:
All praise, glory and honor to God! He saved our son’s life and is healing him in the most miraculous ways. We are so elated to let you know that our son is now alert and conscious and is no longer in critical condition! We are now turning our focus to additional surgeries, healing, rehabilitation and eventually a return home, which we hope will happen by June. We want to personally thank each and every one of you for your love, prayers and support. We are astounded and so blessed by the over 28,000 individuals and families, from literally around the world, that have donated to our gofundme page. Your love and generosity overwhelms and means so much to us! We have no idea where we would be without you - God and your prayers have sustained us. As we have done before, we want to continue our plea and gratitude for your continued respect of our family’s privacy. The road to recovery remains long, but with God and you, we are assured to make it through. Please keep praying for our son and may our loving God bless you and everyone you love.
The update comes days after Mac Hammond, a pastor at the family's church, gave an update on the boy's condition, the Daily Wire previously reported .
""There was zero evidence of brain damage - there wasn't even swelling,"" Hammond said. ""No spinal chord injury, no nerve damage, no internal injuries that were life-threatening.""
""The family's attorney did not confirm nor deny Hammond's remarks but did clarify that the comment comparing the boy's injuries to a bike accident referred only to his facial injuries, not his health overall,"" The Daily Mail reported .
The Daily Wire previously reported that, according to Bloomington police, ""Emmanuel Aranda, 24, was arrested and charged with attempted premeditated first-degree murder after approaching Landen Hoffmann, 5, and his mother, who were standing outside the Rainforest Cafe on the third floor, when Aranda allegedly asked if he was in their way. When Landen's mother said no, Aranda allegedly grabbed the little boy and threw him over the balcony, according to witnesses. While Landen’s mother screamed, a bystander tried to catch Aranda, who pushed him aside and ran from the scene before police caught him on the light-rail train near the mall. Video of the incident was captured on security cameras.""
The New York Daily News noted that Aranda has a history of getting into legal trouble as he ""was arrested in Chicago, after hitting a restaurant patron with a plate before wielding a knife and repeatedly tried to stab the man before threatening other customers, according to Amanda Granlund, a server who recalled the encounter to the Chicago Tribune. Aranda’s other incidents included two, both in 2015, at the Mall of America, leading to him being banned."""
Lawmaker's Harrowing Testimony: I Saw Born-Alive Babies Drowned In Saline After Botched Abortions | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46456/lawmakers-harrowing-testimony-i-saw-born-alive-amanda-prestigiacomo,"April 26, 2019 views
Testifying in support for a bill (Bill 359) seeking to protect babies born alive from botched abortions in North Carolina, Republican state representative Pat McElraft recalled horrifying experiences that she witnessed at the hands of a late-term abortionist when she previously worked in the medical field.
After passing the state House and Senate, the bill was eventually vetoed by Governor Roy Cooper (D-NC). But McElraft’s harrowing testimony offers a chilling inside looks at late-term abortion, which is increasingly being relentlessly pushed by the Democratic Party.
""You will hear from opponents of Bill 359 that there is no need for this bill. 'We don’t have is happening in North Carolina.' I can testify to the fact that infanticide has happened in North Carolina. I’ve been witness to the results of those late-term abortions,"" stated the lawmaker, reported Live Action.
""There was an abortionist in Jacksonville, North Carolina, who was known nationally for performing late term abortions,"" the Republican continued. ""We heard of many girls who came from other states to North Carolina — Jacksonville, North Carolina, to have their late-term abortions. Even hitchhiking down from New York, some of them did, to come in — those were the days when saline abortions were performed.""
""The salt content of the saline was so strong that it burned the little baby’s skin,"" said McElraft.
""Nurses told of stories of the babies that were born alive and [had] been taken by the doctor and turned over with their faces down in the saline to drown,"" she recalled. ""Most of the nurses refused to work with this abortionist. He only did his abortions on the weekends.""
McElraft said she once saw a bucket of what she thought were ""little pigs,"" only to be informed that they were murdered babies:
One day I was on a break, [and] went in to visit with the pathologist in the pathology lab, and I asked him, I said, ""What are all these little pigs doing in these buckets?"" He told me, ""Pat, look again."" And I did. They were perfectly formed little human babies in those buckets. Their skin was even pinker than a normal baby would be, because it had been burned by the saline. Those were the weekend’s abortions.
As noted by Live Action, saline abortions were common back in the 1970-80s, but are very seldom carried out today. ""Once committed in the late second and third trimesters, these abortions were done by injecting a caustic saline solution into the uterus,"" explained the outlet. ""The baby would die over the course of a few hours and then the mother would go through labor to deliver her dead baby. Sometimes the saline failed to kill the baby and the baby was born alive.""
Today, late-term abortion procedures entail an abortionist injecting the viable unborn baby, who can feel pain with a drug called Digoxin. As explained by former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino, Digoxin is used to spark fatal cardiac arrest and kill the child. The mother's cervix is then opened with sticks of seaweed called laminaria. After carrying her dead baby inside of her for two to three days, barring any other complications, the mother will give birth to the dead body.
New York recently became one of eight states to effectively allow abortion up to the moment of birth via the euphemistically named ""Reproductive Health Act."" According to Live Action, the legislation allows for the ""remov[al of] protections for babies born alive after an abortion — meaning they could be left to die after birth — by rescinding a portion of New York’s public health law."""
"DNC Chair Tom Perez: GOP Shouldn’t Use Ill-Gotten Info, But We Can | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46467/dnc-chair-tom-perez-gop-shouldnt-use-ill-gotten-ryan-saavedra,"April 26, 2019 views
Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Wednesday that Republicans should not use any ill-gotten information against the Democrats in the upcoming elections, but, when pressed, did not seem to think that Democrats should be held to the same standard.
""And what we saw in the 2016 election, a foreign adversary — and not just any foreign adversary, our — our most — our fiercest foreign adversary attempted to interfere with our election to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton,"" Perez said . ""And what we said in 2016, and my predecessor asked her counterpart at the RNC back then to do the same thing, don't use stolen information. That's what we're saying again.""
""It sounds like they're saying that,"" Camerota responded. ""I mean when they say it's an affront to all of us, any breach of political organizations, and we come together to prevent it, it sounds like they're saying that.""
""We are at war right now. It is a cyber war. Unfortunately, because our commander in chief is compromised, the federal government is asleep at the switch,"" Perez claimed without evidence. ""And that is why the DNC and others in the Democratic Party ecosystem are working tirelessly to make sure that we are protecting our data, making sure — we're working with every campaign to provide cybersecurity training because we can't expect help from the — from this administration.""
""But what if you get something really juicy, say President Trump's taxes, then should one of the Democratic candidate be able to air those?"" Camerota asked.
""Well, that's going to be a product of a subpoena process where we are —"" Perez responded.
""Maybe. I mean maybe it's going to be leaked,"" Camerota responded. ""What if that's leaked to you? Are you saying that the Democrats shouldn't use that?""
""Well, again, I think we are entitled to that,"" Perez said, which contradicted his earlier point about not using ill-gotten information for political gain. ""If you look at the law that Chairman Neal of the House Ways and Means Committee is using, it's a very — it's very clear. It's not — it doesn't say you're entitled to taxes unless it's the taxes of the president of the United States. So firmly believe that we will get access to those.""
""Right. I just mean — I just mean the tactics,"" Camerota responded. I just mean that — you're sticking with this, even if you get juicy oppo research of some kind about President Trump through ill-gotten tactics somehow, you are sticking with this position?""
Perez responded by refusing to answer the follow-up question from Camerota and instead deflected to talking about the 2016 election. ""Well, here's what I'm sticking with. And this isn't about right versus left. This is about right versus wrong,"" Perez responded. ""A foreign adversary, Russia, they hacked the DNC, they hacked others. They did so with the intent to interfere with our presidential election. And what we said in that letter is, when we have such activity, if someone calls you and tells you, I'm going to rob a bank, your response should be, I'm going to call the authorities. When the Russians called Donald Trump and said, I got dirt on Hillary Clinton, they should have called the authorities. Instead, they said, tell us what you got. That's not right.""

PRAGER: Why Hillary Clinton And Barack Obama Tweeted About 'Easter Worshippers' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Dennis Prager,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46480/prager-why-hillary-clinton-and-barack-obama-dennis-prager,"PRAGER: Why Hillary Clinton And Barack Obama Tweeted About 'Easter Worshippers' Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images April 27, 2019 views
Sometimes, a few sentences tell you more about a person — and, more importantly, an ideology — than a learned thesis. That is the case with tweets from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama two days ago in response to the mass murder of more than 300 Christians and others in Sri Lanka.
Their tweets are worth serious analysis because they reveal a great deal about the left. Of course, they reveal a great deal about Clinton and Obama, too, but that doesn't interest me.
And that, too, is important. Many Americans — especially conservatives and ""independents"" — are more interested in individual politicians than in political ideologies.
Many conservatives have long been fixated on Clinton — so much so that probably any other Democrat would have defeated Donald Trump, as conservative anger specifically toward her propelled many people to the polls. Similarly, Republican Never-Trumpers are fixated on Trump rather than policy. They care more about Trump's personal flaws than about the mortal dangers the left poses to America and the West or about the uniquely successful conservative policies Trump promulgates.
And independents all claim to vote ""for the person, not the party.""
Only leftists understand that one must vote left no matter who the Democrat is, no matter who the Republican opponent is. Leftists are completely interchangeable: There is no ideological difference among the 20 or so Democrats running for president. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is not one degree to the right of Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren.
That is why it is important to understand Clinton and Obama's tweets: to understand the left, not to understand her or him.
Here are the tweets:
Obama: ""The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka.""
Three hours later, Clinton tweeted: ""On this holy weekend for many faiths, we must stand united against hatred and violence. I'm praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attacks on Easter worshippers and travelers in Sri Lanka.""
As they both spelled ""worshipers"" the same idiosyncratic way and used the term ""Easter worshippers,"" it is likely they either had the same writers or Clinton copied Obama.
Here's what's critical: Neither used the word ""Christians."" And in order to avoid doing so, they went so far as to make up a new term — ""Easter worshippers"" — heretofore unknown to any Christian.
When Jews were murdered at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Clinton mentioned the synagogue in a tweet. But in her post-Sri Lanka tweet, despite the bombing of three churches filled with Christians, Clinton made no mention of church or churches. In a tweet after the massacre of Muslims in New Zealand, she wrote that her heart broke for ""the global Muslim community."" But in her latest tweet, not a word about Christians or the global Christian community.
Obama similarly wrote in his tweet about New Zealand that he was grieving with ""the Muslim community"" over the ""horrible massacre in the Mosques."" But in his tweet about Sri Lanka, there is no mention of Christians or churches.
The reason neither of them mentioned Christians or churches is that the left has essentially forbidden mention of all the anti-Christian murders perpetrated by Muslims in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and of all the Muslim desecration of churches in Europe, Africa and anywhere else. This is part of the same phenomenon — that I and others have documented — of British police and politicians covering up six years of rape of 1,400 of English girls by Muslim ""grooming gangs"" in Rotherham and elsewhere in England.
Essentially, the left's rule is that nothing bad — no matter how true — may be said about Muslims or Islam and nothing good — no matter how true — may be said of Christians or Christianity.
Clinton's post-New Zealand tweet also included these words: ""We must continue to fight the perpetuation and normalization of Islamophobia and racism in all its forms. White supremacist terrorists must be condemned by leaders everywhere. Their murderous hatred must be stopped.""
She made sure to condemn ""Islamophobia,"" but she wrote not a word about the far more destructive and widespread hatred of Christians in the Muslim world, seen in Muslims' virtual elimination of the Christian communities in the Middle East, the regular murder and kidnappings of Coptic Christians in Egypt and the murder of Christians in Nigeria.

MALKIN: Beware Soros-Funded Hijacking Of US Census | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Michelle Malkin,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46482/malkin-beware-soros-funded-hijacking-us-census-michelle-malkin,"""Are you a U.S. citizen?""
Only in self-defeating, sovereignty-eroding America is the idea of asking whether people living in America are American citizens for the American census a matter of controversy.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the Trump administration can include a citizenship question on the high-stakes 2020 Census questionnaire. Thank goodness, the conservative majority indicated support for allowing it. There's already such a question on the annual American Community Survey administered by the Census Bureau. It was asked in long-form questionnaires sent to a sample of households in 2000. And it was regularly asked in historical census forms from 1820-1950.
But we live in a Trump-deranged age, so now it's tantamount to an international human rights crime to ask anyone about citizenship status at any time for any reason. Heaven forbid we inconvenience or discomfit legal noncitizens or illegal immigrants with a question!
Open borders activists, left-wing immigration lawyers and identity politics radicals exploded on cue:
—Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder decried the ""unconstitutional and irresponsible action"" to ""suppress the count in minority communities.""
—The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee fumed about the ""political stunt that unfairly targets immigrant communities throughout our country in an attempt to SILENCE immigrants and benefit Republicans.""
—Histrionic social justice actress Alyssa Milano called it an ""attack on immigrant communities and our democracy itself.""
—Jorge Luis Vasquez Jr. of LatinoJustice, funded by George Soros' Open Society Foundations, vented that a citizenship question would ""damage all our daily lives for decades.""
—Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, another Soros-funded outfit, which sued over the citizenship question, blasted the ""scheme to hijack the 2020 Census.""
—The Soros-funded Asian Americans Advancing Justice lobbying group condemned Trump as ""racially and politically motivated.""
Let's all practice our deep pranayama breathing and ground ourselves in reality. It's the radical left, much of it fueled with Soros' money, that has hijacked the U.S. Census, not President Donald Trump. ""No Illegal Immigrant Left Behind"" is crucial to their strategy. Why?
Remember: The Census is used to divvy up seats in the House as a proportion of their population based on the head count. The redistribution of power extends to presidential elections because the Electoral College is pegged to the size of congressional delegations. More people equal more seats. More illegal immigrants equal more power. Indeed, the Center for Immigration Studies determined that in the 2000 election cycle, the presence of noncitizens (illegal immigrants, temporary visitors and green card holders) caused nine seats in the House to switch hands. California added six seats it would not have had otherwise. Texas, New York and Florida each gained a seat. Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin each lost a seat. Montana, Kentucky and Utah each failed to secure a seat they would otherwise have gained.
Our Founding Fathers explicitly warned against the perils of foreigners manipulating representation by overwhelming the country. Immigration scholar and author Daniel Horowitz points to Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story's prophetic admonition: ""If aliens might be admitted indiscriminately to enjoy all the rights of citizens at the will of a single state, the Union might itself be endangered by an influx of foreigners, hostile to its institutions, ignorant of its powers, and incapable of a due estimate of its privileges.""
Statesman Roger Sherman similarly emphasized the need to ""guard against an improper mode of naturalization"" by states adopting ""easier terms.""
Too late. Multiple illegal immigrant amnesties, coupled with massive legal immigration, failure to deport visa overstayers and the metastasis of sanctuary policies, have taken their toll. Moreover, our constitutionally mandated decennial count has become a full-employment program for ideologically driven liberal interest groups cashing in on the census-gathering process and reshaping the electoral landscape. During the last census under President Barack Obama, with $300 billion in federal funding at stake, social justice groups from Soros-funded ACORN to Soros-funded Voto Latino to the Soros-allied SEIU were enlisted to count heads and help noncitizens feel ""safe.""
The Census boondoggle has become a tax-subsidized national future Democratic voter outreach drive. Soros' operations, along with 77 other liberal foundations, have invested $30 million to make illegal immigrants count. The Open Society Institute's grantees and partners on coopting the Census for Democrat gains include the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Miami Workers Center, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Southwest Workers Union, New York Community Trust, New York Foundation, Center for American Progress, People for the American Way and the Funders Census Initiative. A recently leaked internal board document revealed that the Soros network has coordinated efforts for the past four years to ""influence appropriations for the Census Bureau"" and add new racial and ethnic categories.
The Census Bureau will need 500,000 temporary workers to conduct the count in what will already be a hyperpolarized election year. However the Supreme Court rules on the citizenship question, the Trump administration must ensure that Open Borders Inc. does not co-opt the enumerator corps. As SorosWorld well understands:
Power lies not just with who is being counted, but who's doing the counting.

LIMBAUGH: Many University Campuses Are Playgrounds For Insanity | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,David Limbaugh,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46481/limbaugh-many-university-campuses-are-playgrounds-david-limbaugh,"LIMBAUGH: Many University Campuses Are Playgrounds For Insanity Photo by China Photos/Getty Images April 27, 2019 views
If you think the left hasn't taken over university life in America, you are probably not paying close enough attention or in denial.
I'm not just talking about the liberalism of the professors and the core curriculum but about all of college life. There are glaring examples of leftist extremism everywhere you turn, and they're so loony that even sane liberal parents should be concerned.
In September, a Michigan State University student awoke from his nap to an apparently unbearable sight, according to The College Fix. His roommate was watching a video of conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. I can guess what some of you must be thinking as you read this: ""I sure am glad my kids were never exposed to such provocations, such obnoxious, inconsiderate and uncaring roommates.""
You are probably also thinking, ""But if my kid had been the subject of such a triggering event, I hope he would have had the presence of mind to exercise self-help and extricate himself from the hostile environment.""
In this instance, the innocent victim didn't react violently. He calmly booted up his own computer and filed a complaint against his roommate with the administration's bias reporting system. Kind of makes you well up with vicarious pride, no?
""Ben Shapiro is known for his inflammatory speech that criticizes and attacks the African American community,"" wrote the student in his complaint. ""I thought hate had no place on MSU's campus yet MSU has roomed me with someone who supports hate speach"" (misspelling in the original quote).
As a parent you will also be gratified to learn that the university dutifully dispatched an investigator to dig into this urgent matter and to work for a ""room change if the claimant would like one.""
A few observations. Ben Shapiro communicates directly and refuses to bow to the gods of political correctness, but his speech is not inflammatory unless you define that as any utterance that leftist students disagree with and therefore unreasonably consider to be incendiary. Nor does Shapiro attack the African American community, and the false allegation that he does is far more inflammatory than anything he says in his podcasts or speeches.
That a major university would even dignify a complaint so frivolous on its face is deeply disturbing. In a sane campus situated in a sane world, a sane administration would have informed the offended student that universities are institutions of higher learning that promote freedom of academic inquiry. It would have told the student that he, not his innocent roommate, is the one who has the problem. He would have to learn that differing political viewpoints are not grounds for psychiatric alarm or switching roommates.
If, on the other hand, the Shapiro-friendly roommate had persistently accosted the offended snowflake in a ceaseless effort to proselytize him, that might be a different story. But in this case we are talking about a roommate minding his own business and watching a video on his own computer. As long as leftists all around us continue to portray mainstream conservative speech as hate speech and inherently racist, sexist, homophobic and all of the rest — and that's exactly what they do — then we'll see such faux controversies continue to proliferate. Our leftist culture is indoctrinating kids from the crib to the academy that conservative ideas are so heinous that merely harboring them in the presence of a liberal is a microaggression that demands redress. If I'm exaggerating, then please explain the aforementioned incident — and hundreds of others like it.
I'm sure you realize that if my word limit for this column were 70,000 words, I could fill it with similar examples. Let me leave you with a few more from The College Fix, lest you think I'm blowing conservative smoke. For more, check out the website.
Wake Forest University is hosting a series of ""listening sessions"" for faculty and staff of color (no white people allowed) to promote ""inclusivity"" in response to a student protest over ""white supremacy."" Don't bother to look up the definition of ""inclusivity."" Leftists have seized control of our dictionaries, too. LOL.
During a guest lecture at Boston University, a University of Washington professor who specializes in ""whiteness studies"" reportedly railed against colorblindness, saying that white people who see people as individuals rather than as members of their race are ""dangerous."" I hope I don't need to remind you that this is wholly out of phase with the teachings of the universally revered Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — not to mention just outright bizarre.
I shouldn't have to issue a disclaimer, but as a matter of self-protection I will: Nothing I'm saying here is to diminish actual displays of racism when they occur. They can and should be addressed. But it should be obvious that the political left has bastardized our language by redefining terms to demonize political opponents and suppress their speech.
Incalculable damage is being done by characterizing differing opinions as ""hate"" and ""racist"" when they are nothing of the sort. Leftists are causing immeasurable suspicion, distrust and divisiveness in teaching that conservatives and/or Trump supporters are bigoted. Such slanders are exacerbating the very conditions they purport to address, and people need to speak out against this destructive trend in our culture and on our campuses.

How Did North Korean Dictator Get Limos? Automaker Says It Doesn’t Know. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46490/how-did-north-korean-dictator-get-limos-automaker-ashe-schow,"How Did North Korean Dictator Get Limos? Automaker Says It Doesn’t Know. Yuri Smityuk\TASS via Getty Images April 27, 2019 views
North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un used luxury stretch limousines when President Donald Trump visited and in a separate meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The limos were made by German automaker Daimler, yet the company says it does not know how Kim acquired the vehicles, according to Fox News .
“We have absolutely no idea how those vehicles were delivered to North Korea,” Daimler spokeswoman Silke Mockert told the outlet in response to an Associated Press report on the vehicles. “For Daimler, the correct export of products in conformance with the law is a fundamental principle of responsible entrepreneurial activity.”
Kim also apparently used a Mercedes Maybach S600 Pullman Guard and a Mercedes Maybach S62 for both of his summits with Trump. At the summit, Kim reportedly discussed ending the U.S. ban on selling luxury goods to North Korea. As Fox News reported, Trump denied the request and other demands from Kim.
In another statement to Fox, Mockert said Daimler “has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and US embargoes.”
“To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process,” she continued. “Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility.”
The most recent use of the limousines was on Thursday, when Putin met with Kim in Russia, Fox News reported .
""We welcome your efforts to develop an inter-Korean dialogue and normalize North Korea's relations with the United States,"" Putin told Kim at the summit.
Earlier, Putin had said the visit from the North Korean leader would ""help better understand what should be done to settle the situation on the Korean Peninsula, what we can do together, what Russia can do to support the positive processes going on now.""
Two months before this meeting, Kim had his second summit with Trump, where discussions failed over U.S. sanctions on the reclusive country.
""It wasn't a good thing to be signing anything. We had some options, and at this time we decided not to do any of the options, and we'll see where that goes,” Trump said after the summit fell apart, as reported previously by The Daily Wire.
""Sometimes you have to walk, and this was just one of those times,"" Trump also said.
Trump added that Kim wanted all sanctions lifted in exchange for ending its nuclear program.
“[Kim] wants to de-nuke, but he wants to just do areas that are less important than the areas that we want. We know the country very well, believe it or not, we know every inch of that country,"" Trump said. ""You always have to be prepared to walk. I could have 100 percent signed something today — we actually had papers ready to be signed — but it just wasn't appropriate. I want to do it right: I'd much rather do it right than do it fast."""

Fifteen more people are dead in Sri Lanka after a series of a explosions and a firefight between police and suspected ISIS terrorists in the country's capital city of Colombo.
CBS news reports that Sri Lankan authorities were attempting to raid homes and warehouses suspected of harboring both the terrorists themselves and their cache of weapons and explosives, when family members of some of the terrorists who carried out the Easter Sunday attacks detonated their own bombs, killing themselves and destroying troves of evidence.
Some of the raids were successful, according to CBS.
""Special forces first raided a warehouse and discovered a huge cache of bomb-making equipment, including sticks of dynamite, detonator cable ball bearings and switches,"" the outlet reported. ""They also found an ISIS flag. Police believe the site is where the Easter Sunday bombers may have made a video pledging allegiance to ISIS.""
But a raid designed to arrest the remaining members of the terrorist enclave responsible for the Easter bombings went awry after several terror suspects engaged police officers in an exchange of gunfire. Once cornered, they detonated a series of explosive devices killing themselves and their families, including women and children.
""A second raid in eastern Sri Lanka turned into a shootout with suspected extremists, who detonated three bombs inside a house, according to authorities. Officials say fifteen people were killed including three women and six children, presumed to be family members of the extremists,"" CBS reports.
Sri Lanka is having a difficult time capturing the remaining members of a home-grown terror cell that murdered 300 people and injured 500 more in a series of blasts at churches, hotels, and an airport one week ago, in a coordinated attack meant to kill Christians celebrating the Easter holiday, possibly in retribution for a mass shooting at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand earlier in April.
In follow up interviews that took place this week , police admitted that the bombs detonated on Sunday were laced with shrapnel soaked in an acid that made the wounds victims received ""incurable."" The explosives, contained inside the suicide vests, were powerful enough to blow the roof off of one of the churches, and were of the type typically used to blow holes in large rocks during mining operations.
Dozens of members of the group are believed to be still at large, and authorities believe the fugitives have ""access to explosives"" as well as a connection to cell leadership, though the group's leader, a cleric named Mohamed Zahran, is believed to be one of the suicide bombers who detonated his vest inside the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo on Easter.
So far, police have arrested at least 48 people at checkpoints on roads leading out of Colombo, including two of their ""most wanted."" They have also shuttered the mosque associated with the National Towheed Jamaat, which police believe to be the terrorists' ""home base"" of operations.
The threat of ongoing violence is so great that Catholic leaders in Sri Lanka have taken the unprecedented step of canceling Sunday Masses across the country of 21 million, many of whom are Catholic converts. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told local media that he was informed by the Sri Lankan government that Catholic churches remain the top target of Islamic extremists, and that Catholics worshipping in the open are in grave danger until the terror cell is neutralized.
Sunday morning, instead, Sri Lankan Catholics celebrated Sunday services at home as the Cardinal performed a televised Mass from his home chapel, according to the Associated Press . The president of Sri Lanka attended the Mass in person, along with the leader of Sri Lanka's opposition party, in a show of unity against terrorism."

When That Didn’t Work, She Falsely Accused Him Of Rape. Photo by Anton Eine/EyeEm/GettyImages April 27, 2019 views
The following story of a false allegation of rape shows the harm that can be done to someone even when police and prosecutors do everything right.
The story was reported by Quillette, and features the saga of “Jared” and “Kate,” two pseudonyms used to protect their identities (the accused, to protect his name; the accuser, in the hopes she can receive treatment for her mental illness and be rehabilitated).
Jared and Kate had a turbulent relationship for three years and every time he tried to break up with her she would threaten to commit suicide or hurt herself in other ways. When Jared finally did break up with Kate, she proceeded to send him emails about her feelings after the breakup.
In one email, Kate begged Jared to remain friends “with benefits.” She sent that email on the same day she and her new boyfriend announced on Facebook they were official. Kate wrote to Jared, “i didn’t have any true feelings for him” and “i always made it clear to him that my feelings for you had not faded and probably wouldn’t,” Quillette reported.
Kate also sent a 45-minute video in which she told Jared, “you don’t have to be scared to turn the corner and face me anymore.” In another email, Kate told Jared, “my hands are shaking. please don’t replace me. with anyone…i am scared that this has had no big effect on you. that you are fine, not thinking about me, and getting a good nights sleep. i can’t go a second without thinking about you.”
Jared didn’t respond to her torrent of messages. After awhile of getting no responses, Kate went to the police and accused Jared of abuse.
Police investigated Kate’s claims and closed the case. As Quillette reported, “Jared’s lawyers were able to debunk the assault accusations using information that Kate herself had provided in a lengthy video message and emails.”
But even though the case was closed, the accusation itself was enough to damage Jared’s career as an up-and-coming musician. Venues cancelled his band’s gigs after people complained online about hosting a “rapist.” The band stood by Jared and were attacked themselves. They faced accusations of sexism and misogyny, according to Quillette.
Kate claimed the case was not closed and repeatedly called police claiming to have new evidence, but never provided such evidence.
“The police reportedly became annoyed, after officers realized that they were being used as part of a character-assassination campaign,” Quillette reported.
As Quillette’s Diana Davidson wrote, “It’s rare for police to take any action against a woman who claims that she was sexually assaulted, even when there is evidence that she is lying.” Yet in this case, police charged Kate with stalking.
She spent a night in jail and was to appear in court, but before she entered the courtroom, she began “shaking and yelling that she couldn’t go through with the process.” She fought the guards trying to bring her into the room. Through it all, her new boyfriend remained supportive in the courtroom.
Jared learned that Kate wanted a plea deal. He wanted her to apologize on every social media platform she defamed him on and admit to her lies. He received an apology from her addressed only to him. Jared also compiled a list of financial damages due to Kate’s actions, but the amount was “deemed too large for a restitution order,” Quillette reported.
Jared was harassed, stalked, and falsely accused of rape, and his accuser was allowed into a diversion program that included mandatory therapy and an apology to Jared. She was prohibited from posting on social media, and when she was given that privilege back, she immediately posted a statement implying everything she had said was the truth.
Jared, on the other hand, was smeared and had his livelihood threatened. He is now performing again and going to school.
As Quillette reported, this type of post-breakup behavior has happened “in many relationships since time immemorial” (this author can attest to being on the receiving end of such behavior) and has always been difficult for police to handle.
As Davidson wrote, “authorities cannot let the politics of #MeToo, or any other political movement, interfere with their mandate.”"
SAD: White House Correspondents Dinner Replaces Comedy With 'Dark Sermons' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46495/sad-white-house-correspondents-dinner-replaces-emily-zanotti,"April 28, 2019 views
Speakers at Saturday night's White House Correspondents' Association dinner struck a somber tone amid signs that the once ultra-trendy, star-studded ""nerd prom"" just isn't the event it once was.
President Donald Trump announced several weeks ago that he would not appear at the annual event — which technically raises money for journalism scholarships and awards achievements in covering White House-specific events — for the third year in a row. For the first time, however, the president said all senior members of the White House staff will ""boycott"" the event.
White House officials, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, instead appeared alongside the president at a rally Saturday night.
That decision came after Huckabee Sanders endured cruel taunts at the hands of last year's featured speaker, comedian Michelle Wolf. Fearing no Trump administration associate could show up at the WHCA dinner without being personally attacked, despite a longstanding tradition of good-natured ribbing between the press and the president through dueling speeches, the White House simply stopped RSVPing to the event.
The White House Correspondents' Association responded by making swift changes to the event's lineup, substituting historian Ron Chernow for the expected comedy act, but it did not tempt the White House back to the dinner.
Last night's event, instead, then took on a funerary tone. President of the White House Correspondents' Association, Olivier Knox, first delivered what Grabien News termed a ""dark sermon "" on the state of the First Amendment and the all-encompassing fear journalists who cover the president are now feeling.
“I don’t want to dwell on the president,” Knox said. “This is not his dinner. It’s ours, and it should stay ours. But I do want to say this. In nearly 23 years as a reporter, I’ve been physically assaulted by Republicans and Democrats, spat on, shoved, had crap thrown at me. I’ve been told I will never work in Washington again by both major parties.”
“And yet I still separate my career to before February 2017 and what came after,” he continued. “And February 2017 is when the president called us the enemy of the people. A few days later my son asked me, ‘Is Donald Trump going to put you in prison?' At the end of a family trip to Mexico he mused if the president tried to keep me out of the country, at least Uncle Josh is a good lawyer and will get you home.”
It is worth noting that the White House has not, in fact, locked up any reporters, nor prosecuted even President Trump's harshest critics. Reporters who appear openly hostile to the president and the White House, like CNN's Jim Acosta, have, at worst, suffered a temporary revocation of credentials — and even that was a decision swiftly reversed.
Historian Ron Chernow, perhaps best known for his biography of Alexander Hamilton which inspired the hit musical, also delivered a dark and ominous speech, comparing Trump's relationship with the press to that of past presidents.
“George Washington felt maligned and misunderstood by the press, but he never generalized that into a vendetta against the institution,"" Chernow told the audience.
Chernow then cautioned the audience to continue to report on the White House's factual errors, lest the White House be allowed to whip the people into a frenzy for political gain — as though the press, which just spent the last 22 months pursuing an ultimately non-existent Trump-Russia election conspiracy, was blameless.
""H.L. Mencken once warned of a political system that would 'keep the populace alarmed by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.' We simply cannot allow the press to become an imaginary hobgoblin exploited for political gain.""
President Donald Trump spent Saturday evening at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin."
Activist Tweets Following The Synagogue Shooting Mislead By Leaving Out Vital Context | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46500/activist-tweets-following-synagogue-shooting-frank-camp,"Activist Tweets Following The Synagogue Shooting Mislead By Leaving Out Vital Context Photo by George Frey/Getty Images April 28, 2019 views
Following Saturday’s horrific shooting at Chabad of Poway synagogue in San Diego, California, ""AR-15"" began trending on Twitter, with several commentators noting that from Aurora to Orlando, the semi-automatic rifle has been the weapon of choice for mass shooters: Pittsburgh: AR-15 Poway: AR-15 There’s a clear trend of shooters using these weapons of war to attack public spaces and yet the GOP turns a blind eye. — Adam Best (@adamcbest) April 27, 2019 Poway: AR-15 — Michael Skolnik (@MichaelSkolnik) April 27, 2019
These tweets leave out critical information.
Mother Jones has a running data set of every mass shooting from 1982 - 2019 (not including Saturday’s shooting). The spreadsheet not only provides dates, locations, summaries, injuries, and fatalities, but also weapons used.
[Note: Some of the data points overlap. As such, they do not add up to a perfect 100%]
Here are some relevant facts: 80% of the 110 mass and spree shootings since 1982 in which there were three or more victims were perpetrated with at least one handgun (among other firearms). 35.5% of the 110 mass and spree shootings since 1982 in which there were three or more victims were perpetrated with a mix of rifles, handguns, and other firearms. 49% of the 110 mass and spree shootings since 1982 in which there were three or more victims were perpetrated with only handguns (one or more). 10% of the 110 mass and spree shootings since 1982 in which there were three or more victims were perpetrated with a mix of shotguns and handguns. 10.9% of the 110 mass and spree shootings since 1982 in which there were three or more victims were perpetrated with only rifles. Of the 888 deaths in mass or spree shootings from 1982 - 2019, 373 (42%) happened in shootings in which handguns were the only firearms used. Of the 888 deaths in mass or spree shootings from 1982 - 2019, 148 (16.6%) happened in shootings in which rifles were the only firearms used.
The above are critical statistics if one is intent on ending gun violence. The mainstream media typically focuses on the firearms used in mass or spree shootings only when those firearm are semi-automatic rifles. However, over the last 36 years, almost one -half of all mass shooters used handguns exclusively, while just one-tenth used rifles exclusively, according to the data collected by Mother Jones.
Moreover, as The Daily Wire previously reported regarding general gun violence:
According to Uniform Crime Reporting data from the FBI, between 2010 and 2014, there were approximately 43,002 murders in the United States in which firearms were the weapon of choice. 70% (30,114) of the firearms used were handguns, while 3.6% (1,530) were rifles.
Even if one takes the 21.5% (9,228) of gun deaths that were committed using unclassified firearms, assumes that half of them were rifles (a very generous assumption given the statistics), and adds that to the 3.6% of gun deaths in which rifles were identified as the weapon used, that still amounts to just over a quarter (25.1%) of total firearm murders in the United States.
For context, 5.3 times as many people (8,109) are murdered in the United States with ""knives or cutting instruments"" than with rifles, and 2.3 times as many people (3,574) are murdered in the United States with ""hands, fists, [and] feet"" than with rifles, according to FBI data.
Despite the above information, politicians and activists continue to push for the banning of semi-automatic rifles, specifically the AR-15, while avoiding any talk of banning handguns. This position can only come from one of two places — ignorance or malice.
Typically, one should not attribute to malice what one can attribute to ignorance. However, given the wealth of information regarding mass and spree shootings available to the public, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that our elected officials are using semi-automatic rifles as a kind of prop.
By repeatedly speaking about semi-automatic rifles as if they are the singular weapon causing mass destruction, and by condemning politicians in the Republican Party who don’t sign on to legislation that would ban these weapons, progressive Democrats stoke fear and resentment while doing nothing to actually decrease gun violence in the United States."

Presidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right – God doesn’t have a political party. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn’t change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever.
Mayor Buttigieg says he’s a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.
The core of the Christian faith is believing and following Jesus Christ, who God sent to be the Savior of the world – to save us from sin, to save us from hell, to save us from eternal damnation.
As of publication, Graham’s comments have been ""liked"" more than 61,000 times, and retweeted approximately 13,800 times.
However, Graham’s tweets have also garnered nearly 36,000 comments, many of which are critical, not only of his alleged hypocrisy in supporting the president, but of his claim that homosexual behavior is sinful according to the Bible: This is why people are leaving the faith. You preach your own views, and don't consider what Jesus would do. Jesus welcomes all who believe in him and it is for God alone to judge how we lived this life. Safe to say he'll have some words for your hypocritical ass. #FakeChristian — Rapunsal Grant (@rapgrant9700) April 24, 2019 Congratulations. — andy lassner (@andylassner) April 25, 2019 Read the Jefferson Bible. With scissors and paste he took only the words of Jesus-.ignoring the rest. Jesus did not have a word of condemnation for gay people. Surely you can find better things to do than hating on us, while pandering to Trump. — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) April 25, 2019 Jesus was love. The New Testament does not say homosexuality is a sin. A Christian is a follower of Jesus Christ. Who are you to judge another human. #Hypocrite — I. Marlene King (@imarleneking) April 26, 2019
For the purposes of clarity, this piece will not focus on Graham’s alleged hypocrisy in supporting President Trump. However, National Review’s David French has written just such an article, which one can read here .
There are three direct references to homosexuality in the New Testament.
Romans 1:26-27 reads: ""For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.""
1 Corinthians 6:9-10 reads: ""Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.""
1 Timothy 1:8-11 reads: ""Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.""
There are prominent biblical scholars who argue that the condemnation of homosexual acts in scripture (specifically in the New Testament) are woefully misinterpreted. However, the understating among many other scholars is that the New Testament verses in which homosexual acts are condemned have been interpreted successfully.
In ""The Bible and Homosexual Practice,"" scholar Robert A. J. Gagnon spends 450 pages building the case that the Bible defines ""same-sex intercourse as sin."" The book is a painstakingly researched and exhaustive analysis of every argument one could present regarding scriptural acceptance of homosexual acts.
Gagnon writes in summation:
Arguments put forward by advocates of homosexuality to undermine the contemporary relevance of scripture are weak. Scripture does not reject same-sex intercourse because of some alleged ignorance of non-exploitative forms of homosexual behavior or genetic causation factors. It does not reject homosexual intercourse because some misperception that only idolaters in the strict sense could engage in such behavior or because of some superstition about defilement and purity. It does not reject homosexual practice, at least not primarily, out of some need to assert the rule of men over women. Rather, scripture rejects homosexual behavior because it is a violation of the gendered existence of male and female ordained by God at creation.
Due to western society’s growing acceptance of gay and lesbian attraction, the debate surrounding the Bible and its position on same-sex behavior and relationships will undoubtedly continue. Additionally, as western society moves further away from biblical precepts, it will begin to tolerate less and less those who espouse traditional biblical views, even when expressed with love and respect."
Report: Here's How Obama Convinced Biden Not To Run In 2016 | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46511/report-heres-how-obama-convinced-biden-not-run-james-barrett,"Report: Here's How Obama Convinced Biden Not To Run In 2016 J. Scott Applewhite/Pool/AP/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images April 29, 2019 views
On Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden finally made official what his camp had been teasing for months: He's running for president, for the third time. While former President Obama has made clear that he believes Biden is a good candidate, he refuses to give an official endorsement, something Biden claims he actually requested. ""The vice president actually asked the president not to endorse,"" Biden's spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield told the press last week. ""He wants to make his own case. He is running on an incredibly strong message of wanting to restore the soul of the nation.""
At the beginning of the 2016 election cycle, Biden likewise publicly pondered a presidential run, but after weeks of agonizing over the decision, the vice president chose to let Hillary Clinton have her ultimately very disappointing day. Amid the buzz about Biden's big announcement, and with Obama unwilling to fully throw his weight behind him, The New York Times revealed some more details about what went on behind the scenes in 2015, particularly Obama's efforts to convince Biden not to run.
""Barack Obama did not think Joseph R. Biden Jr. should run for president — he hardly needed to say it out loud for aides to understand that,"" Peter Baker wrote in a piece published by the Times Sunday. ""The trick that summer of 2015 was finding a way to nudge Mr. Biden to stay out of the race without looking as if he was nudging Mr. Biden to stay out of the race.""
Why did Obama want Biden to stay on the sidelines? He ""had long since concluded that Hillary Clinton had the best chance of winning in 2016."" Additionally, Obama felt that the tragic death of Biden's son was too great a grief for him to carry while running a grueling presidential campaign.
Obama's dilemma, Baker writes, was trying to convince Biden to stay out without the vice president feeling that his hand was being forced. He handled it by giving Biden strong hints about his desire for him not to run over a matter of weeks. ""Over the course of weekly lunches, he gently pressed Mr. Biden on his thinking,"" Baker writes. ""Eventually, the president arranged for his own strategist to deliver a daunting assessment of the odds against a race. Mr. Biden got the message.""
Baker notes that Biden eventually acknowledged that Obama ""was not encouraging"" about him running against Clinton, whom Obama had defeated in the primary back in 2008.
Baker goes on to provide a summary of how Obama and Biden's relationship developed over the years, including the tension caused by Biden's infamous, condescending and racially charged comment about Obama during the 2008 election cycle: ""I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.""
This is Biden's third run for the presidency. His first two attempts, first in 1988 then in 2008, ended in rather embarrassing fashion — the first derailed by a plagiarism scandal and the second by a failure to get even close to competing with Clinton and Obama in 2008 primaries. When asked by Obama to be his running mate, Biden was reportedly hesitant, but eventually decided to accept."

Members of TPUSA have faced increasingly hostile conditions on leftist campuses across the country in recent months as the political Left continues to become more extreme. In February, The Daily Wire reported:
Police at the University of California Berkeley were called to a student plaza on Tuesday after reports that a representative of the conservative Leadership Institute was physically assaulted by a man on the campus. Part of the assault was captured on cellphone video that has since been shared online by Turning Point USA, the conservative group the representative was reportedly helping train.
The Daily Californian was the first outlet to report the incident, which the student-run paper says took place on the Upper Sproul Plaza.
Citing a campus police alert that went out Wednesday, the paper reports that the alleged victim, a male Leadership Institute representative, ""had been tabling for the conservative group Turning Point USA on Tuesday afternoon about 3:29 p.m. when two males approached the table.""
The victim told police that he and the two men became embroiled in a verbal altercation, at which point he began filming the escalating exchange with his phone. One of the two alleged attackers reportedly slapped the phone out of the activist's hand and then overturned the table the group was using to recruit.

In March, ""Two Tulane University sophomores and a student visiting from another school [were] accused of setting the door to another student’s dorm on fire early Saturday (March 23), according to Mike Strecker, a spokesman for the school,"" Fox 8 reported.
""The incident was caught on security cameras, according to Strecker, and the students were identified as 21-year-old Robert Money and 20-year-old David Shelton,"" Fox 8 added. ""Strecker said the third person was identified as Naimi Okami, a 20-year-old Brown University student. All three were arrested late Saturday and booked into the Orleans Justice Center jail -- each with one count of arson, online court records show.""
Strecker confirmed Lofton was the president of Tulane’s chapter of Turning Point USA.
Many prominent conservatives, including Donald Trump Jr., weighed in on the issue, with Trump Jr. tweeting: ""Wonder if the media will report this horrible crime against a campus conservative?""

'Game Of Thrones' Fans Ignite Internet Over Terrible Lighting In Epic Battle Of Winterfell | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46510/game-thrones-fans-ignite-internet-over-terrible-joseph-curl,"'Game Of Thrones' Fans Ignite Internet Over Terrible Lighting In Epic Battle Of Winterfell picture alliance / Contributor / Getty Images April 29, 2019 views
The cost per episode for the huge HBO hit ""Game of Thrones"" is $10 million in Season 6. The show has spent well over $100 million for the whole series, and much of the narrative was building up to Sunday night's epic Battle of Winterfell.
The episode — titled ""The Long Night"" and the third out of six in the show's eighth and final season — featured the biggest battle ever, endlessly hyped by the network. But viewers had one major complaint — you couldn't see what the @#$%*& was going on!
The Long Night indeed.
""So all those millions of dollars in production value must have went to the dragon scenes because damn are the battle scenes dark as hell on #GameOfThrones,"" a fan wrote.

“My laptop screen ain’t cut out for this ‘artistic choice’ in lighting, @HBO ” another wrote. My laptop screen ain’t cut out for this “artistic choice” in lighting, @HBO — Bryan Doherty (@bryansdoherty) April 29, 2019 Thanks to the lighting of this episode I thought I watched Jamie die 6 times, Pod died 7 times, and Briane died 10 times. #gameofthrones pic.twitter.com/FK9f4RvVQA — Kat Deuxjoliediva (@Kat_deuxj_diva) April 29, 2019
Still, the episode was heavily praised, with The New York Times writing: ""Sunday’s final clash was a masterpiece of tension and release, goose bumps and heartbreak, grandiosity and intimacy. It deftly mixed genres (horror, action, melodrama), shots and planes of action as it shifted from the chaos of the fighting in and around Winterfell, to the claustrophobic terror of the crypts, to the dragon dogfighting in the winter sky.""
But lighting throughout the series has sometimes drawn attention. Insider wrote a piece last week headlined: ""Why 'Game of Thrones' has become so dark you can barely see the characters sometimes.""
Though this darker palette is a trend in television outside of ""Game of Thrones,"" one of the HBO's hired directors of photography says the lack of extra lighting is intentional.
""I think we're all very much on the same page where we're trying to be as naturalistic as possible,"" Robert McLachlan, a cinematographer, told INSIDER in 2017.
He added that the show's makers wanted ""to make these sets and locations feel as if they're absolutely not lit by us, but only by Mother Nature or some candles.""

After the episode aired, Vanity Fair wrote a piece headlined: ""Was That Game of Thrones Battle Literally Too Dark?""
This episode of Game of Thrones was called “The Long Night,” which is primarily an allusion to the fabled battle of old that rocked Westeros and may play a part in the prequel series currently in the works at HBO. But it’s also a rather apt name for an episode of television that had many at home squinting and scooting closer to see if one of their favorites had just died in the dimly lit clash between the army of the living and the army of the dead. (We have a full accounting here.) The episode’s director of photography, Fabian Wagner, spoke with Vanity Fair’s “Still Watching” podcast about some of the challenges of shooting this nocturnal skirmish.
First, it’s worth noting that episode director Miguel Sapochnik has said that he studied the long nighttime fight at the center of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, called the Battle of Helm’s Deep, in order to figure out how to create a super-sized battle episode that wouldn’t tire audiences out. You can see a lot of that famous cinematic skirmish in the Battle for Winterfell, but one thing you won’t see is Oscar-winning cinematographer Andrew Lesnie’s approach to lighting.
Wagner in his interview with Vanity Fair stressed that despite its zombies and dragons, Game of Thrones is a very naturalistically and “classically” shot show. Over the years, the cinematographers have relied on sunlight, moonlight, candlelight, and fire light. Lesnie, on the other hand, had no such compunction. Lord of the Ringsstar Sean Astin once asked Lesnie “where is the light coming from?” when they were shooting in what should have been a darkened tower. Lesnie replied, “Same place as the music.” Which is why Helm’s Deep is lit up like Fenway Park, making every grim king, glam archer, and shield-surfing elf easy to pick out in a crowd.

Anti-Semitic New York Times Runs ANOTHER Cartoon Attacking Netanyahu | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46523/anti-semitic-new-york-times-runs-another-cartoon-hank-berrien,"April 29, 2019 views
The New York Times drips with venomous anti-Semitism, as already noted after the uproar following their monstrous Nazi-like cartoon last Thursday that depicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog on a leash held by a blind President Donald Trump, who was wearing a yarmulke. That incident prompted the Times at first to issue a statement but no apology on Saturday morning, and only after the terrorist shooting at the Poway synagogue in California later on Saturday did the Times issue another statement with an apology on Sunday.
But what almost went unnoticed while the Times was stubbornly refusing to apologize was another anti-Semitic cartoon the Times ran in their weekend edition depicting a sour-faced Netanyahu in sunglasses taking a selfie while holding what looks like a stone tablet with a Star of David on it.

The Times initially reacted to the furor over the Nazi-like cartoon by releasing this statement on Saturday:
A political cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times on Thursday included anti-Semitic tropes, depicting the prime minister of Israel as a guide dog with a Star of David collar leading the president of the United States, shown wearing a skullcap. The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it.

Among the reams of criticism of the Times for its refusal to apologize was this response from the American Jewish Committee: ""Apology not accepted. How many @nytimes editors looked at a cartoon that would not have looked out of place on a white supremacist website and thought it met the paper’s editorial standards? What does this say about your processes or your decision makers? How are you fixing it?"" Apology not accepted.

After the terrorist shooting at the Poway synagogue on Saturday, in which a 60-year-old woman was murdered, the rabbi at the synagogue had two fingers blown off, and an eight-year-old girl and her uncle were shot and wounded, the Times decided it would finally apologize, writing on Sunday:
We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday in the print edition of The New York Times that circulates outside of the United States, and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again. Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it’s all the more unacceptable. The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training. We anticipate significant changes.
As The Daily Wire reported, Bret Stephens of the Times had ripped the paper for the initial cartoon, writing on Sunday:
The Times wasn’t explaining anti-Semitism. It was purveying it. It did so in the form of a cartoon...in which a guide dog with a prideful countenance and the face of Benjamin Netanyahu leads a blind, fat Donald Trump wearing dark glasses and a black yarmulke. Lest there be any doubt as to the identity of the dog-man, it wears a collar from which hangs a Star of David … Here was an image that, in another age, might have been published in the pages of Der Stürmer. The Jew in the form of a dog. The small but wily Jew leading the dumb and trusting American. The hated Trump being Judaized with a skullcap. The nominal servant acting as the true master. The cartoon checked so many anti-Semitic boxes that the only thing missing was a dollar sign… The image also had an obvious political message: Namely, that in the current administration, the United States follows wherever Israel wants to go.
Yet in the midst of this, the Times ran a second anti-Semitic cartoon, leaving their apology looking empty."
Teen Who Refused Cancer Treatments While Pregnant To Save Baby Passes Away | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46507/teen-who-refused-cancer-treatments-while-pregnant-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Gun Control Teen Who Refused Cancer Treatments While Pregnant To Save Baby Passes Away ""She faced the greatest fear of all, death, and smiled back with a grin only God can instill."" Getty Images April 29, 2019 views
A teen mother who refused cancer treatments while pregnant to protect her unborn daughter tragically passed away last week.
When Dana Scatton was 17 and pregnant, she found out she had an inoperable brain tumor. Instead of immediately undergoing radiation treatment to potentially prolong her life, she delayed treatment to protect her unborn baby, whom she gave birth to in January — just days before Scatton turned 18.
A Facebook page run by Scatton’s family shared the sad news last Monday.
""This morning shortly before 4am, Dana left us to be with the lord,"" the family announced. ""We may never have the right things to say to truly honor the amazing, smart, loving, caring, passionate, incredibly beautiful and free spirited mother, daughter, niece, sister, cousin, friend and independent woman Dana was every day.""
Scatton, a Christian and one of nine children herself, ""inspired us all to be better than who we are and to keep God in our focus at every moment,"" the post continues. ""She faced the greatest fear of all, death, and smiled back with a grin only God can instill. She fought harder than the toughest warriors known to man and did it with grace and valor.""
""We don’t know how to process all of this but we want to thank everyone for all their prayers for Dana and our family,"" writes the Scatton family.
The post closes with scripture Scatton lived her life by after she was diagnosed with the inoperable brain tumor:
Dana started this chapter of her life with a quote and we find it fitting to leave today’s post with it:
“So do not fear, for I am your God;
Do not be dismayed, for I am with you,
I will strengthen you and help you;
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”
Isiah 41:10
According to Live Action, Scatton was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, when she was seven months pregnant. At just age 17, she was given three to nine months to live, the outlet noted, adding that ""90 percent of those diagnosed with DIPG die within 18 months.""
""Immediate treatment may have helped her to live longer than doctors expected, but radiation could have harmed her preborn daughter. Therefore, she chose to wait as long as she could before beginning treatment,"" Live Action reported.
Scatton’s daughter, named Aries, was born at 33 weeks via an emergency cesarean section.
In a social media post published Wednesday, the family thanked supporters for their prayers and messages.
""Dana was an amazing woman who left a lasting impression on everyone she met and knew,"" the post notes. ""She inspired so many and continues to do so even after she’s gone on to heaven. We thank God every day for the time we had with her. We wish nothing more than to have more time with her but we know she’s not suffering any more. She’s happy. Right where she wants to be. Right next to God."""
Brie Larson: 'We Gotta Move Faster' To Have More LGBT Superheroes | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46533/brie-larson-we-gotta-move-faster-have-more-lgbt-hank-berrien,"April 29, 2019 views
Speaking in an interview with Variety , actress Brie Larson, aka “Captain Marvel,” expressed her dissatisfaction with the Marvel Comic Universe for its paucity of LGBT superheroes, saying, “We gotta move faster.”
Larson was interviewed by Variety’s Marc Malkin for the first episode of Variety and iHeartMedia’s new film podcast, “The Big Ticket,” when Malkin stated that when he was growing up, he never thought he’d see a LGBTQ superhero. Larson responded, “That breaks my heart to hear that, because there’s no reason. I don’t understand how you could think that a certain type of person isn’t allowed to be a superhero. So to me it’s like, we gotta move faster. But I’m always wanting to move faster with this stuff.”
Larson works assiduously as a social justice warrior; as The Daily Wire has reported, when Larson was touring to promote Captain Marvel, “She insulted sound guys putting microphones on women; she decried white men asking questions during the media tour.”
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter (THR) in February, Larson spoke of her daily gym routine in which she reportedly dead-lifted 225 pounds. THR wrote:
There were days when the intensity of the training reduced her to tears and days when she got irritated by men at Walsh's West Hollywood gym who doubted her strength. “This guy watched me lift something really heavy, and he went, 'Wow, I can't even lift that!' As if he were the epitome of health,"" Larson says. ""I said, 'Yeah, I guess you're going to have to rethink your gender norms.'""
After Captain Marvel was released, according to Out , some fans expressed their wish that the Marvel character Valkyrie and Captain Marvel would disclose a gay relationship with each other. Out wrote:
In the weeks since Captain Marvel was released, fans have latched onto Valkyrie — who survived Thanos’ snap and will return in Avengers: Endgame — and Carol Danvers as their new favorite queer Marvel ship. Thompson and Brie Larson have both enthusiastically supported the response, even sharing fan art on Twitter. — Brie Larson (@brielarson) March 18, 2019
Actress Tessa Thompson, who plays Valkyrie, told the Los Angeles Times :
It didn't even occur to me, legitimately, that it was necessarily a romantic thing. I don't even know what happens in the canon in terms of those characters or if they ever intersect, but I just love the idea of more women Marvel characters getting to intersect. I just think it's so cool and it's time and why not? There's so many compelling female characters inside of the MCU. And just selfishly, when I get to see those women in passing, they're all such cool women. So the idea of getting to spend time with them and hang out is so fun. I'm just excited that this new phase promises to have women and queer folks.
Thompson told Rolling Stone that one scene cut from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" depicted a woman exiting Valkyrie’s bedroom, adding, “It wasn’t Marvel or Disney or anyone extracting that because it was an issue. It just was like, that particular moment didn’t make sense in the context of the scene. And there were other beautiful things where you get a sense of her backstory.” Thompson said of her part that she ”played her as a woman that’s queer.” "
Bus Driver Who Raped 14-Year-Old Girl Escapes Jail Time | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46509/bus-driver-who-raped-14-year-old-girl-escapes-jail-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Bus Driver Who Raped 14-Year-Old Girl Escapes Jail Time NYS police department April 29, 2019 views
Last Thursday, a 26-year-old New York State man who admitted to raping a 14-year-old girl he met while driving her school bus escaped jail time time during his sentencing hearing.
Shane Piche, who pleaded guilty to third-degree rape in February, was sentenced to 10 years' probation by Judge James P. McClusky and will now have to register as a Level 1 sex offender, reported The Watertown Daily Times. ""A Level 1 sex offender is considered to be at low risk of committing the crime again and is not included in online sex offender databases,"" noted the outlet.
According to WWNYTV 7 News, the victim’s mother wrote in an impact statement: ""I wish Shane Piche would have received time in jail for the harm he caused to my child. He took something from my daughter she will never get back and has caused her to struggle with depression and anxiety.""
The news station reported in February that the victim’s mother also said, ""Piche bought her daughter gifts and invited her and other minors to his home where he gave them alcohol and then allegedly raped the young teenager.""
In New York state, sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of 17 by someone over the age of 21 is considered a Class E felony, according to NYSenate.gov , and is punishable by up to four years behind bars.
Eric Swartz, Piche’s defense attorney, reacted to the sentencing by arguing that his client has himself suffered ""pain"" by the underlying rape incident.
""He'll be a felon for the rest of his life. He's on the sex offender registry for a long time,"" Swartz told WWNYTV 7 News. ""Maybe not the rest of his life because of the level, but this isn't something that didn't cause him pain and this isn't something that didn't have consequences.""
As noted by The Waterloo Daily Times, Piche was also hit with three ""no contact"" orders and will have to pay $375 in court fees and surcharges. He will also have to pay $1,000 for a special sex offender registration fee.
Prosecutors sought to have Piche register as a Level 2 offender — a high risk offender— but Judge McClusky knocked it down to a Level 1 because the defendant had no prior incidents on his rap sheet.
Piche was first arrested in September of 2018; the rape took place when he was 25 years old. He was initially charged with ""second-degree rape, first-degree unlawfully dealing with a child and endangering the welfare of a child,"" the station reported .
The defendant lost his job driving buses for the school district soon after the charges were filed.
""We will continue to work with all of our contractors to ensure that non-district employees that work with our students are held to the same high standards as our own employees,"" said city school Superintendent Patti LaBarr in a statement, following the incident.
When Piche was offered a chance to speak at the sentencing, he declined the opportunity to do so."

President Trump took a moment on Sunday to help inflame resentment among Bernie Sanders supporters, who are still livid over how their candidate of choice was treated by the Democratic National Committee back in 2016.
""The Democratic National Committee, sometimes referred to as the DNC, is again working its magic in its quest to destroy Crazy Bernie Sanders for the more traditional, but not very bright, Sleepy Joe Biden,"" Trump tweeted Sunday. ""Here we go again Bernie, but this time please show a little more anger and indignation when you get screwed!""

Here we go again Bernie, but this time please show a little more anger and indignation when you get screwed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2019
Trump is no fan of Sanders, but he has repeatedly taken his side when it comes to how the DNC handled the nomination process in 2016, condemning it alongside Sanders fans for ""rigging"" the process and ""disenfranchising"" his supporters.
""Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats — both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, & run as an Independent,"" Trump tweeted in May 2016, during the height of the controversy. After the democratic socialist senator got snubbed, Trump repeatedly urged Sanders supporters to join him — if nothing else, to teach the party a lesson.
It isn't just Trump who agrees with Sanders that the DNC ""rigged"" the primary, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has also publicly criticized the committee for how it handled 2016, telling CNN in 2017 that, ""yes,"" Sanders got a raw deal through the DNC's superdelegates process.
Trump followed up his Democrats-trolling tweet on Monday with some more posts aimed at ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden. First, Trump called out the media for ""pushing"" Biden ""hard,"" adding that he can thank Biden and Obama for his presidency.
""The Media (Fake News) is pushing Sleepy Joe hard. Funny, I’m only here because of Biden & Obama. They didn’t do the job and now you have Trump, who is getting it done — big time!"" Trump wrote.
Trump then pointed out that Biden is rallying in a state where Trump's policies are helping to create the ""best economic years in its history.""
""Sleepy Joe Biden is having his first rally in the Great State of Pennsylvania,"" he said in another tweet. ""He obviously doesn’t know that Pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history, with lowest unemployment EVER, a now thriving Steel Industry (that was dead) & great future!""

In response to Pittsburgh unions hosting Biden's first official campaign rally Monday, Trump tweeted, ""I’ll never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership, those people who rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues, medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune. But the members love Trump. They look at our record economy, tax & reg cuts, military etc. WIN!""
""The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me. Some things never change!"" Trump added in a follow-up tweet.

Biden officially announced his candidacy on Thursday in a racially charged video focused on the actions of white supremacists at the rally in Charlottesville that turned deadly. In the video, Biden accused Trump of having ""assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it"" in his response to the rally. Polls have consistently shown that Biden is the Democratic frontrunner."

The hijab and burkini have officially made their debut in the pages of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit.
In a series of social media posts Monday, the magazine unveiled some of its new swimsuit models, including 21-year-old Somali-American model and activist Halima Aden, whom the publication is touting for ""making history"" by being the first to ever wear the Islamic garb for SI Swimsuit.
The magazine posted a photograph of Halima on Monday wearing an electric blue burkini, which fully covers her arms and legs, as well as a multi-colored hijab covering her hair — garb designed to conceal women's bodies in alignment with Islamic moral codes.
""Halima Aden makes history as the first model to wear a hijab and burkini for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit,"" the publication tweeted Monday.

The magazine then retweeted a post by model Hunter McGrady touting the debut of Islam-inspired full-body coverings. ""Once again, so proud to be a part of this incredible issue,"" wrote McGrady. Once again, so proud to be a part of this incredible issue. @SI_Swimsuit is leading the way https://t.co/u0pqJqr5hB — Hunter McGrady (@HunterMcGrady) April 29, 2019
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit also posted a video of Aden discussing her opportunity to wear Muslim garb for the magazine. ""I never really felt represented because I never could flip through a magazine and see a girl who was wearing a hijab,"" she said in a quote highlighted by the publication. “I never really felt represented because I never could flip through a magazine and see a girl who was wearing a hijab.” #ShatteringPerceptions pic.twitter.com/EtNfpszcmy — Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@SI_Swimsuit) April 29, 2019
In a press release, SI Swimsuit editor MJ Day emphasized that by including Aden in this year's publication, the magazine is attempting to present an expanded ""range and scope of the type of beauty that exists"" and further affirm women's individuality and self-worth.
""Having Halima as a part of SI Swimsuit is yet another example of the range and scope of the type of beauty that exists,"" said Day, HuffPost reports. ""Her participation and inclusion further highlights the brand’s commitment and belief in supporting women to own who they are and what makes them unique and ultimately reaffirms what our messaging has been, that YOU are worthy.""
""This feature is proving that a fully covered hijab wearing model can confidently stand alongside a beautiful woman in a revealing bikini and together they can celebrate one another, cheer each other on, and champion each other’s successes,"" said Aden in a statement. ""Young Muslim women need to know that there is a modest swimsuit option available to them so they can join the swim team, participate in swim class at school and go with their friends to the beach. Muslim girls should feel confident taking that step and doing so comfortably while wearing a burkini.""
Aden's photoshoot was conducted in Kenya, where, as Page Six highlights, ""she was born into a refugee camp and lived until she was seven years old."" The magazine features Aden in two different burkinis designed by No Ka’Oi and Cynthia Rowley, the outlet reports.
While the magazine is promoting the modesty-focused attire of Aden, it also continues to promote its more ""traditional"" swimsuits, like that sported by McGrady. ""Hunter McGrady's bride squad knows how to throw a bachelorette weekend!"" SI Swimsuit tweeted in a post retweeted by McGrady.

Trump Hits Back Against ‘Dues Crazy’ Union Leaders. “I’ll never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership” NICHOLAS KAMM / Contributor / Getty Images April 29, 2019 views
On Monday, former Vice President Joe Biden accepted a major endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) for the 2020 election, prompting President Donald Trump to publicly blast the union leaders for ""sucking"" dues from their members without endorsing the candidate of their choice.
""On behalf of the International Association of Fire Fighters, I'm proud to announce that we stand with Joe Biden and endorse his candidacy for President of the United States,"" IAFF general president Harold Schaitberger said in a video, according to Fox News .
Schaitberger went on to glowingly compare Biden to the firefighters themselves because Biden is a ""problem solver.""
""Joe's a lot like our firefighters,"" continued Schaitberger. ""He's a problem solver who cares deeply about America and committed to making our country better. He's one of the staunchest advocates for working families. He's a problem solver who cares deeply about America and committed to making our country better. He's one of the staunchest advocates for working families.""
The IAFF issued no endorsement of Hillary Clinton or President Trump during the 2016 presidential election.
President Trump later accused the IAFF of ripping off their membership by such an endorsement by confidently asserting that many firefighters actually support him.
""I’ll never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership, those people who rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues, medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune,"" Trump tweeted. ""But the members love Trump. They look at our record economy, tax & reg cuts, military etc. WIN!""
""The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me. Some things never change!"" Trump continued.

Former Vice President Joe Biden gladly accepted the IAFF endorsement, promising to ""strengthen"" unions as builders of the middle class.
""I couldn't be more proud to have the International Association of Fire Fighters on my team,"" Biden tweeted in response. ""Unions built the middle class in this country—and as President, I'll fight to strengthen them and grow the backbone of this country.""
The former vice president then criticized President Trump for ""badmouthing unions,"" even though he only criticized union leadership for being political pawns that ignore the wishes of subordinates.
""I'm sick of this President badmouthing unions. Labor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work,"" Biden tweeted.
Later, President Trump tweeted that he only got elected because Biden and Obama were so bad for the country. ""The Media (Fake News) is pushing Sleepy Joe hard,"" he said. ""Funny, I’m only here because of Biden & Obama. They didn’t do the job and now you have Trump, who is getting it done - big time!""
""Sleepy Joe Biden is having his first rally in the Great State of Pennsylvania,"" he continued. ""He obviously doesn’t know that Pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history, with lowest unemployment EVER, a now thriving Steel Industry (that was dead) & great future!"""
WALSH: President Trump Is Right — Robert E. Lee Was A Great General | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46532/walsh-president-trump-right-robert-e-lee-was-great-matt-walsh,"April 29, 2019 views
President Trump sent certain segments of population into outraged spasms on Friday when he described Robert E. Lee as a ""great general."" Trying to lend context to his infamous ""very fine people"" remark about the 2017 Charlottesville protests, Trump said this:
I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee, a great general. Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals. I have spoken to many generals here, right at the White House, and many people thought — of the generals, they think that he was maybe their favorite general.
Trump is, of course, completely correct. Robert E. Lee has always been regarded as a military genius, and for good reason. This is not controversial to anyone with a sixth grade education in American history. But surveys show that many Americans don't even know when the Civil War took place, and a sizable number think Lincoln led the Allied Forces rather than the Union Army, so it's no surprise that basic statements of historical fact have become contentious in our age of aggressive stupidity.
I found myself in the crossfire of the controversy when I posted on Twitter in support of Trump's statement and provided my personal list of the best Civil War generals. I give Lee the top spot, followed by Jackson, Grant, Sherman, and then Nathan Bedford Forrest. You could certainly make an argument for Longstreet, Sheridan, Thomas, or Cleburne in any one of those spots. But you cannot make an argument for a list of top Civil War generals that completely excludes all Confederates. There aren't five Union generals better than Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson. There isn't even one, in my view. In his Valley Campaign, Jackson marched his brigade of shoeless farm boys 600 miles through the mountains over the course of a month and a half, winning five pivotal battles against a combined force that outnumbered his 2:1. Grant never did anything quite like that, though he was impressive in his own right — and the victor, after all.
But I was informed by hundreds of people that I am a racist, just like Trump, for daring to give the Rebels any credit at all. We have reached a point where we cannot acknowledge any of the achievements of morally flawed historical figures. We must pretend they never existed. Driving this point home, a number of people insisted that ranking Confederates as great generals is like ranking Nazis as great generals. That's ridiculous, because of course some Nazi generals were great generals. Erwin Rommel was a great general, as anyone who has studied WW2 knows. The fact that he was fighting on the side of abject evil does not erase his military genius.
If we cannot acknowledge the greatness of morally compromised military commanders, then we cannot acknowledge the greatness of any military commander. Not a single one of them would pass muster by the standards of today's anachronizing blowhards. Napoleon, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great — all must be removed from the history books. Even the Union commanders in the Civil War get thrown out with this bath water. Grant was an anti-Semite who tried to evict all the Jews from his military district. Sherman was a war criminal. Lincoln was a racist who publicly professed his bigotry during a debate with Stephen Douglas:
I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races - that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.
If we are not willing to see things in their historical context, and to accept that people in the past weren't as racially enlightened as we are today, then we will be left with no heroes, no great men at all. But if we are willing to forgive Lincoln his virulent racism, and Grant his predilection for ethnic cleansing, then we must extend a similar generosity to men like Robert E. Lee.
Nothing will make slavery anything less than a moral abomination. And it is true that slavery was a very significant motivating factor behind secession, as Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina all made abundantly clear in their Declaration of Causes of Seceding States. But it is equally true that many men who did the fighting on both sides did not perceive themselves to be fighting over slavery. There's a reason Lincoln waited two years to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. He said early on that if he could keep the country together by keeping slavery, he would do it. To him, and to the Union soldiers on the ground, it was a fight to preserve the Union. The sad fact of the matter is that most Northerners were racist themselves and would not have charged into gunfire for the sake of liberating the slaves, no matter how distasteful they found the institution.
For their part, many southern soldiers thought they were fighting a war of defense against hostile invaders. There's a reason Jefferson Davis did not send his army to capture Washington, even though perhaps they could have done so after the stunning Confederate victory at Bull Run to start the war. This is the reality Robert E. Lee confronted. He was offered command of Union forces but declined because, as a loyal Virginian, he could not march against his home state. He saw it as a choice between defending his home or the Union. He chose his home.
Perhaps you would have chosen differently. Perhaps you would have taken up arms against your own family. Perhaps you would have been more enlightened than almost everyone else and seen the struggle in the same light that spectators in the future would see it. I congratulate this hypothetical version of yourself, in that case. It's true that Robert E. Lee lacked this sort of enlightenment. It's also true that when he was faced with a difficult dilemma, he made the choice he thought was right, and then proceeded to win battle after battle against a foe with superior numbers, superior weaponry, and superior resources. That's why he's a great general. Recommended For You"
DISGUSTING: CA Professor Tells Students That Fetuses Are Human Parasites | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46545/disgusting-ca-professor-tells-students-fetuses-are-hank-berrien,"April 29, 2019 views
In a class taught at the University of San Diego, a professor used a slide that referred to the human fetus as a ""legitimate parasite"" that ""invades"" its mother and ""manipulates"" her immunity.
As Fox News reported, the lecture, reportedly part of the UC San Diego School of Medicine course, Evolution of Human Disease, ""explores the major epidemiological transitions from ape-like ancestors to foraging tribes, farmers and pastoralists, to the global metropolitan primate we now are. We focus on how diseases have shaped humans and how humans have shaped disease over time.""
The screenshot of the slide was sent to Dylan Griswold, a medical student at Stanford University, who tweeted it out: No joke, a friend just sent me this slide from her upper-level biology course. I'm speechless. Create your own caption. pic.twitter.com/4sS6AvdRV1 — Dylan Griswold (@DylanPGriswold) April 25, 2019
The professor who allegedly showed the slide reportedly emailed the class an explanation: ""Most of you probably realize that my point was to show that mammals are especially prone to invasive cancers because mammals evolved invasive placentation. My point was not to indoctrinate you with the notion that fetuses are cancers, as insinuated in the article."" Here is the explanation of the slide, provided by the presenting professor, who emailed this to his class. Granting for the sake of argument that this was his intention, the framing of content on the slide nonetheless dehumanizes prenatal human life. I invite your comments. pic.twitter.com/6Q8adPiMxT — Dylan Griswold (@DylanPGriswold) April 27, 2019
Griswold pointed out the difference between a parasite and a fetus in a series of tweets , explaining:
“A baby in the womb is a parasite by definition."" False: A baby in the womb is homospecific. The baby is the same species as the mother, whose body is specifically geared to gestate a baby of her own species while it lives inside her. The same cannot be said of a tapeworm. A parasite is an invading organism — coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A fetus is formed from a fertilized egg —the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized. The host-parasite relationship is one of conflict, while the mother-baby relationship is intrinsically cooperative.
Consider the immunology of the two. Host and parasite are locked in an arms race: the parasite evolves ever more complex techniques of avoidance, while the host evolves ever more complex techniques of detection and attack. Meanwhile, mother and baby cooperate to prevent immunological conflict. The site of this cooperation is the placenta. The fetus cannot be viewed as a tumor robbing the mother of nutrients. Ironically, if the mother’s health is compromised, the placenta restricts nutrient flow to the fetus to ensure the mother’s long-term health, with the prospects that the fetus can still grow and develop. Instead of being passive tissue that absorbs available nutrients from the mother, the placenta dynamically distributes nutrients between mother and fetus, optimally ensuring the health of both mother and developing baby.
Lila Rose, founder of the pro-life group Live action, tweeted, “Amid scrutiny, @UCSanDiego professor says he didn’t intend to say that “fetuses are cancers.” How about backtracking the term “parasite”? These are medically inaccurate & offensive terms, ones that abortion advocates have used for dozens of years to dehumanize children.” Amid scrutiny, @UCSanDiego professor says he didn’t intend to say that “fetuses are cancers.” How about backtracking the term “parasite”?

Vet Who Converted To Islam Charged With Plotting L.A.

Terror Attacks Getty Images April 29, 2019 views
Federal law enforcement officials announced on Monday that a U.S. Army vet who recently converted to Islam was arrested late last week in California for allegedly planning terror attacks in Los Angeles.
The suspect was arrested on Friday ""after he received what he thought was a bomb, but was actually an inert device supplied to him by an undercover law enforcement officer, federal officials said,"" CBS Los Angeles reported.
The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that, according to a federal affidavit, the suspect considered ""various attacks — including targeting Jews, churches, and police officers"" and ultimately ""decided to detonate an IED at a rally scheduled to take place in Long Beach this past weekend. As part of the plot, [the suspect] asked his confederate — who actually was cooperating with the FBI as part of the investigation — to find a bomb-maker, and [the suspect] last week purchased several hundred nails to be used as shrapnel inside the IED.""
The Washington Times noted that the suspect posted an ""online video professing his Muslim faith on March 2 and the next day said in a post that 'America needs another vegas event,' referring to the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, that would give 'them a taste of the terror they gladly spread all over the world.'""
Investigators say that they believe the suspect was ""a recent convert to Islam who...was seeking revenge for the March massacres at two New Zealand mosques that killed 50 people,"" The Washington Post reported.
""The individual charged in this case wanted to carry out a mass casualty attack with explosive devices, and he moved very quickly from talking about violence to mobilizing to commit such an attack,"" said Assistant Director Michael McGarrity of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division. ""This case should remind the public of the need to be vigilant and notify law enforcement if you see suspicious behavior.""
The Department of Justice noted that the suspect expressed ""his desire to commit a terrorist act, at points contemplating a drive-by shooting with a modified AK-47-style rifle he owned, and at other points considering the use of an IED,"" adding that he ""allegedly expressed support for ISIS and said 'if ISIS came here, he would swear allegiance to ISIS.'""
The suspect reportedly referenced ""the Boston Marathon bombing and asked the [informant] to find a person to construct an IED that he said could cause 50 casualties.""
EDITOR'S NOTE: The name of the suspect has been withheld from this article. Recent studies suggest that ""media coverage of mass shootings can have a significant impact on the psyches of potential mass shooters — that such potential mass shooters have a cognitive craving for attention, which they know they will receive for committing atrocities."" For this reason, The Daily Wire no longer publishes names and images of mass shooters as it has become increasingly clear in recent years that ""the value of public knowledge regarding specific names and photographs of mass shooters is significantly outweighed by the possibility of encouraging more mass shootings.""

Actor Isaiah Washington To Join #WalkAway Town Hall In Los Angeles | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46553/actor-isaiah-washington-join-walkaway-town-hall-frank-camp,"Actor Isaiah Washington To Join #WalkAway Town Hall In Los Angeles Photo by Isaiah Trickey/FilmMagic via Getty Images April 30, 2019 views
On May 1, actor Isaiah Washington will join Brandon Straka at #WalkAway’s very first Los Angeles town hall. In March and April, Straka hosted two separate town hall events in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The Daily Wire covered both events, which you can read about here and here .
Washington will sit on a panel alongside Joy Villa, Jesse Lee Peterson, Angela King, and Major Williams at the event, which will be focused on the African American community and minorities more broadly.
As The Daily Wire previously reported :
For anyone unfamiliar with the campaign, #WalkAway was started by openly gay New York-based hairstylist Brandon Straka in May of 2018. After a lifetime of voting for Democratic politicians, including Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, 42-year-old Straka began to feel increasingly uneasy about his political affiliation. This unease led to intensive research over the course of several months, after which Straka walked away from the Democratic Party.
On May 26, 2018, Straka released a video on social media detailing his #WalkAway experience, and asked others to join him. Over the course of the last eleven months, the campaign has grown, with thousands of videos and written testimonials popping up across YouTube and other social media platforms, says Straka.
On Tuesday, I spoke with Washington about his own experience walking away from toxic ideas and politics. Washington first talked about his ""walk away"" moment, which was inspired, at least in part, by a friend:
A colleague of mine who was very instrumental in my work in Sierra Leone, whose judgement I trust, she was a staunch Democrat in her family. She’s a first-generation immigrant herself and a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party, as was I as of three years ago. She actually sent me the hashtag. I'm now with the Green Party and the Green Party was officially my protest vote because at the time, I guess, as old as I am, I just grew tired of the nastiness that was happening with the last election, and that we just couldn't get past that to actually start talking about policy, and what we are going to do for America. I walked away knowing full well that Jill Stein wasn't going to win, but I made my point, you know?
Going further, Washington noted that part of the reason he supports the #WalkAway movement is because it has allowed people to step out from under the shadow of their biases, and speak with one another:
I joined #WalkAway to support those who are just doing everything they can to stand on their own and say, ""I don't think this way."" I'm not trying to play that political game.
Yeah, I may have biases, I may not understand, but I'm willing to have a dialogue.
I'm not saying I'm leaving the Green Party and walking away to the Republican Party, but you know what? Just like Brandon and I, and everyone else, I'm willing to have a town hall and I'm willing to have a dialogue that is not filled with nonsense that I think all of us are tired of, and even more tired of being used and exploited to pit our differences against one another.
Although Washington touched on numerous topics during our interview, something that really stood out was his willingness to appreciate President Trump’s role in the ""First Step Act,"" as well as his mentioning a moment when the president took the time to recognize the formerly incarcerated:
I have to remain authentic and salute Trump for what I saw in the East Room that day, when he stepped away from the TelePrompTer and didn’t use the formerly incarcerated people that were lined up behind him as mere effigies, as mere statues of humanity, voiceless.
I was blown away, I think, at the moment he decided to look over his shoulder, break rank, break from the TelePrompTer, and allow these human beings to have and share his platform after everything I thought I knew about this man. It was at that point that I felt okay to give him a thumbs up because there was something that I personally saw, it was something that I personally felt, and there was something that I could compare personally to the first conversation I had with Senator Barack Obama and the promises and the assurances that he made to me about bridging the gap in Africa, which is exactly what I did based on his recommendation.
Speaking again of the upcoming #WalkAway town hall, Washington told me what he hopes to accomplish on Wednesday, and what the movement is trying to achieve:
We all came here on different boats, but we're all in the same boat now.
We haven't heard that for a long time, but it is true, so we’ve got to figure this thing out and we got to figure it out quickly. We’ve got a lot of people that are still wounded. People need clarity, and amplification, and hopefully on May 1st, here in LA, sitting next to all the other panelists, I can help try to shine some light on why people walk away, which is not only important politically, but important emotionally.
That’s what #WalkAway, I'm hoping, is attempting to do. If you're interested in the facts, and you're interested in the truth, and you're interested in making up your own mind on how you want to move forward, and demand that now is the time for politicians to be made accountable.
Looking forward, Washington also talked about the 2020 election:
I think this election is probably, you know, the most crucial. People are tired of negative narratives and tired of being pitted against one another and tired of being used for their differences. For the most part, we just want to be left alone.

Compilation Video Highlights Bumbling Joe Biden's Rough First Day On The Stump | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46559/compilation-video-highlights-bumbling-joe-bidens-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Compilation Video Highlights Bumbling Joe Biden's Rough First Day On The Stump Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images April 30, 2019 views
On Monday, former Vice President Joe Biden hit the stump for the first time since officially declaring his 2020 candidacy — and things didn't go so smoothly. While attempting to present just a 27-minute speech to a crowd of supporters gathered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the candidate jumbled and slurred his words at least 12 times, a compilation video put together by Grabien Media highlights .
“I want to thank Rich Fritzgerald, the county executive for — the baladanny — the Alleghengy County executive for being here,” Biden opened the apparently difficult speech, the media outlet noted . The former VP later stumbled, “The country wasn’t built by Wall St. bankers, CEOs, and hudge — heh — and hedge fund managers.”
“Union workers, the UAW took extredable — cuts in their pensions and their future and the less to get GM working,” Biden sputtered.
The Democrat also slurred or fumbled the following words: “incredible,” “conquer,” “dignity,” “successful,” and “hospital,” among others.
At 76 years old, Biden has four years on President Donald Trump, and is one year shy of 77-year-old socialist Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), another declared Democrat candidate.
President Donald Trump, to much criticism, has sought to brand the Democrat as “Sleepy Joe” — instead of the low-hanging fruit nickname of “Creepy Joe.” But after the Pittsburgh fumbles, Trump's branding of Biden is making more sense.
The president has also made it a point to underscore his own stamina in reaction to Biden’s “old” age.
When Trump was asked on Friday, “how old is too old to be president,” he responded, “Well, I think that — I just feel like a young man. I'm so young. I can't believe it. I'm the youngest person. I am a young, vibrant man.”
“I look at Joe — I don't know about him. I don't know,” Trump continued.
“I would never say anyone is too old, but I know they're all making me look very young, both in terms of age and I think in terms of energy. I think you people know that better than anybody,” the president added.
Kicking off his campaign on Thursday, Biden released a pre-recorded video which focused on President Trump allegedly defending white supremacists following the violent Charlottesville protest à la his ""very fine people on both sides"" comment.
""He said there were, quote, 'Some very fine people on both sides,'"" said Biden in the announcement video. ""'Very fine people on both sides'? With those words the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it, and in that moment I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any other I’d seen in my lifetime.”
However, as noted by The Washington Examiner, Trump’s ""both sides"" comment was taken out of context. ""Trump made clear several times during the conference that he was referring specifically to those who had showed up to demonstrate against the statue’s removal and that he otherwise condemned the white supremacists,"" the outlet pointed out.
Trump has yet to hit back over the charge, though he has repeatedly denied the claim that he ever backed white nationalists in the past.

Finally Facing Facts: Number Of Democrats Who See 'Crisis' At Southern Border Soars | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46562/finally-facing-facts-number-democrats-who-see-joseph-curl,"April 30, 2019 views
Ever since Donald Trump began pushing for a wall at the southern U.S. border, Democrat leaders in the House and Senate have declared that there is no crisis there, and therefore no need for such a barrier.
Many of the Democratic candidates running for president have said so, too. ""This emergency at the border is fake,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said President Trump ""created a fiction about a crisis at the border.""
But that's not what a growing number of Democrats across the country think, at least not anymore.
A new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds nearly a quarter of Democrats (24%) say there is a ""crisis"" at the U.S.-Mexico border. That number has soared 17 percentage points since the last poll in January.
Independents, too, are rethinking the situation. Now, nearly a third (30%) think there's a crisis, up 9 points since the last poll. Overall, 35% of Americans think there's a ""crisis,"" up 11 points since January.
""The shifting views have altered the political calculus for Democrats, including the 20 candidates already in the race for the party’s presidential nomination, who have sought to challenge Trump’s hard-line rhetoric on immigration,"" the Post writes. ""Having once accused the president of falsely fanning public fears over a nonexistent crisis, Democrats have shifted to emphasizing the humanitarian challenges at the border, while still accusing Trump of demonizing immigrants and pursuing policies that have exacerbated the problems.""
Huh. So there really is a crisis at the border, despite what Democrats and the mainstream media have been saying for months.
Trump has been pushing the border barrier since he entered the 2016 race, and he's ramping up to do so again throughout the 2020 election. Earlier this month, Donald J. Trump For President, Inc., released a video, just before Trump boarded a plane to fly to the U.S.-Mexico border to view construction of a portion of a new barrier there.
""The video features 2020 Democrats flippantly dismissing the situation, as well as prominent Obama era experts and media figures admitting that there is indeed a crisis,"" the campaign explained. ""The video closes with a call for Democrats in Congress to work with President Trump to address the problem.""
""Democrats refuse to admit there is a crisis along our southern border and are even actively campaigning on an open borders platform,"" Trump campaign National Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in an email. ""President Trump has been an unmistakable leader on the issue of illegal immigration since before he took office and will not rest until our border is secured.""
The problem at the border has only been getting worse. Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch told a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing this month that border agents have captured people trying to enter the U.S. illegally from more than 50 different countries, including Turkey, China, Bangladesh, Egypt and Romania. Customs and Border Protection agents apprehended more than 76,000 illegal aliens crossing the U.S. border in February alone, and estimates say that number will top 100,000 in March.
Trump on Monday called for an overhaul of the asylum system, proposing a new fee to process applicants and raising ""the capacity to rapidly adjudicate applicants' claims while also barring them from working in the U.S. in the meantime,"" Fox News reported.
In a presidential memorandum, Trump specifically told Attorney General William Barr and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan that the move was necessary to address a ""crisis"" at the border. In an article published earlier this month, The New York Times acknowledged that the humanitarian crisis of illegal immigration has hit a ""breaking point.""
Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months, with border agents making more than 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high. Immigration courts that process asylum claims currently have a backlog of more than 800,000 cases, and asylum applicants are increasingly staying in the U.S. even after their claims for asylum have been denied.
“That emergency continues to grow increasingly severe,” Trump's memo read. “The extensive resources required to process and care for these individuals pulls U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel away from securing our Nation’s borders.” "

CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Paul Begala told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday night that he wants to beat President Donald Trump in 2020 so badly that he would vote for a Democrat who shot his dog if that Democrat could beat Trump.
""I am a lifelong Democrat, and I have no candidate yet in this field,"" Begala said. ""First time in my life, I’ve not had a candidate that I’ve preferred in the primaries. I’m going to watch and see how they develop.""
""This is what I’m looking for: I’m a JFK Democrat,"" Begala continued. ""I will pay any price, bear any burden, support any friend, oppose any foe to ensure the defeat of Donald J. Trump. You could be for Medicare-For-All or not, you could shoot my dog and if I think you can beat Trump, I'm going to be for you.""
""Well, that’s very mainstream of you,"" Cuomo responded. ""So Ana, look, we all know how you feel about this president. However, you represent a strain of compassionate conservatives that Joe Biden is hoping will listen to his message. Does he have a chance of that?""
CNN contributor and self-styled ""anti-Trump Republican"" Ana Navarro chimed in, saying: ""I think people like me, disenfranchised Republicans, people who do not want to vote for Trump, in my case, who will not vote for Trump, want to have somebody that they can vote for enthusiastically and without feeling like they are betraying our ideology, our principles and our convictions. Joe Biden for me is such a person. Look, I’m biased. I’ve known him for 20 years. I knew him as a senator. I knew him as the vice president, as a candidate the first time, I knew him as a regular citizen and now as a candidate.""
""There are some people in the Democratic field who are, I think, rather scary to right-leaning independents, centrists, and disenfranchised Republicans, anti-Trump Republicans, like me,"" Navarro continued. ""You start talking about 70% tax rates? That scares us. Look, the idea of a Joe Biden, who has the experience, who is calling on better angels, who is talking about unity — but I, like Paul, there’s no way I will vote for Trump, even if he shoots Paul’s dog, because he better not shoot mine.""
""Enough with the shooting of the dogs!"" Cuomo said to the two contributors. ""It’s the only thing all Americans care about.""

Limbaugh: Here's A Bunch Of Evidence That Democrats Are Realizing They've Got Major Problems For 2020 | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46556/limbaugh-heres-bunch-evidence-democrats-are-james-barrett,"Limbaugh: Here's A Bunch Of Evidence That Democrats Are Realizing They've Got Major Problems For 2020 Photo by George Gojkovich/Getty Images April 30, 2019 views
On his talk radio program Monday, the ""Big Voice on the Right"" provided his sizeable audience with evidence that the Democrat Party is beginning to ""wake up"" to an alarming reality: ""That the Mueller report was a bomb, the Mueller report was a dud, and that they are not prepared to deal with Trump on any issue of substance.""
""Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well. What do you know, the Drive-By Media, the Democrat Party are starting to wake up,"" said a charged-up Rush Limbaugh to begin the segment. ""I don’t think they can become fully woke, but they’re starting to wake up to reality.""
""They put every weapon they have in that Mueller report, in Trump-Russia collusion, and they are slowly awakening to the fact that it has bombed out on them,"" said Limbaugh. The evidence is in the headlines and even at the unwatched White House Correspondents' Dinner Saturday, he added. Rush then did one of the things he most enjoys: ran through a series of stories that revealed bad developments for Democrats.
The first headline comes from The Atlantic: "" The Clintons Are Nervous About 2020 ,"" which starts off with this ominous passage: ""Like pretty much every other Democrat in America, Bill and Hillary are nervous that their party’s primary field is too large, that it’s going to be dominated by the wrong kind of debate, that the candidates will succumb to their worst instincts, and that President Donald Trump will out-bully them anyway.""
The next Democrat-troubling headline comes from The Nation: "" The Mueller Report Indicts the Trump-Russia Conspiracy Theory ,"" which, Limbaugh explained, argues that ""the Mueller report doesn’t just dispel the conspiracy theories that have engulfed political and media circles for two years, it puts to rest the most popular recent one, that attorney general William Barr engaged in a cover-up.""
Then this report from The Chicago Tribune: "" Remember the #NeverTrump Movement? It Collapsed. "" And from The Wall Street Journal's poll of big-time money managers: "" Trump Will Win in 2020 ."" Rush pointed out that these money managers believe Joe Biden will win the Democratic nomination. Another troubling headline for the Dems comes from Politico: "" Democrats Sweat Trump’s Economy ,"" which Limbaugh summarized as the Democrats admitting that they don't have any real economic plan.
Limbaugh spent some time addressing this Dem feminist crisis story from NBC News: "" Can a woman beat Trump? Some Democrats wonder if it’s worth the risk. "" ""Holy smokes! What a headline,"" Limbaugh exclaimed. ""Is it worth the risk to nominate a woman just to nominate a woman? This sounds like what they did with Mondull in 1984. ... 'Can a woman beat Trump? Some Democrats wonder if it’s worth the risk.' Meaning, do we nominate a woman just to say we nominated a woman? Do we nominate a woman just to say that? What if we go down to defeat? Is it worth it?""
Another headline Limbaugh highlighted was from The Guardian: "" Time to impeach? Headache for Democrats over how to take on Trump ,"" which prompted the host to remark: ""Wait a minute! See what I mean? Two years ago it was a slam dunk, Trump was gone, Mueller was gonna get the goods, Trump-Russia collusion. Even Pencil Neck [Adam Schiff], Pencil Neck went on Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night, and Bill Maher called him a Trump stalker.""
And then there's this very problematic story from PJ Media: "" Trump winning the 2020 money game for now ,"" which shows that ""Trump's campaign and the RNC raised a combined $76.1 million in the first three months of 2019,"" which gives them ""over $80 million in combined cash on hand — 21 times the amount Barack Obama and the DNC had raised at this time in 2011.""

FBI Investigating Antifa For Plotting To ‘Stage An Armed Rebellion’ With Guns Purchased From Mexican Cartel | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46567/fbi-investigating-antifa-plotting-stage-armed-ashe-schow,"FBI Investigating Antifa For Plotting To ‘Stage An Armed Rebellion’ With Guns Purchased From Mexican Cartel Photo by Amy Osborne/AFP/Getty Images April 30, 2019 views
The FBI has been collecting information on Americans who have been helping the migrant caravans heading to the US-Mexico border, and is now investigating an alleged plot by “anti-fascist activists” to purchase weapons from a Mexican drug cartel.
The San Diego Union-Tribune received the unclassified FBI report from a source wishing to remain anonymous. The paper confirmed the investigation is ongoing with two additional law enforcement sources.
The investigation stems from a December 2018 scheme by the cartel to sell the weapons to activists. The man at the center of the investigation is Ivan Riebeling, described in the report as a “Mexico-based cartel associate known as Cobra Commander.” The report claimed the activists sought to “stage an armed rebellion at the border,” the paper reported.
These activists “planned to disrupt U.S. law enforcement and military security operations at the US/Mexican border,” according to the report.
The report, according to the Union-Tribune, stated that it was “an information report, not finally evaluated intelligence” and instructed agencies that received it “not to take action based on this raw reporting without prior coordination with the FBI.” The report had been sent to numerous government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), CIA, NSA, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Riebeling told the Union-Tribune that the report was “absurd.”
“It doesn’t make any sense that someone from the United States would purchase guns in Mexico. And the Hondurans certainly didn’t bring money to buy guns. It doesn’t make any sense; in fact it’s extremely absurd to say the Hondurans wanted to attack the United States at the border,” he said.
“I am not cartel. I don’t sell drugs. I don’t sell arms,” he added. “I’m a revolutionary. A man who believes in his ideals, and I’m going to defend Mexico.”
Another man named in the report said he had never met Riebeling and would not have associated with such a person.
“We were warned to look out for [Riebeling],” the man said. “We took the precaution to find out who he was and where he was, but we never had any contact with him. And we never saw him around the migrant caravan.”
Both men appear in a database of people monitored by ICE, CBP, and DHS that was reported on by NBC San Diego in March. The Union-Tribune reported that Reibeling is described as an “instigator” in the database and the other man’s name and picture were on file.
The report dropped just hours before CNN host Chris Cuomo called the anti-fascist group “a good cause,” as The Daily Wire’s Ryan Saavedra previously reported .
Cuomo made the comments as two contributors pointed out the group is just the opposite.
“Chris, Antifa is not a good cause,” said CNN’s Steve Cortes. ""Antifa does not have good aims, Antifa wants power, wants political power, taken through force. That's what Antifa is all about.""
The Daily Caller also reminded readers that former Vice President Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign in part by praising Antifa, referring to those who showed up in Charlottesville, VA, and engaged in a violent confrontation with white supremacists as “a courageous group of Americans.” "

Four women’s powerlifting world records were shattered on Sunday by Mary Gregory, a biological male who identifies as female. The transgender athlete set Masters powerlifting world records in women's squat, bench press, and deadlift, and scored a Masters world total record.
""What a day, 9 for 9! Masters world squat record, open world bench record, masters world dl record, and masters world total record!"" Gregory posted to Instagram.
""A huge thank you to [RAW Powerlifting Federation], from the bottom of my heart! As a transgender lifter I was unsure what to expect going into this meet and everyone - all the spotters, loaders, referees, staff, meet director, all made me welcome and treated me as just another female lifter- thank you!"" the athlete continued. ""And thanks to all the fans in the audience who cheered me on and congratulated me!""
""#TransgenderWomen,"" ""#ShareThePlatform,"" ""#TransRightsAreHumanRights,"" ""LGBTQ,"" and ""MoreFemaleStrength"" were some of the hashtags included in Gregory’s post. A post shared by Mary Gregory (@75marylifts) on Apr 27, 2019 at 2:09pm PDT
This is not the first time that biologically female athletes have been supplanted by biological males. For example, Connecticut high schooler Selina Soule appeared on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" in February to speak out about trans athletes in women’s sports after two biologically male transgender sprinters beat the field, effectively bumping Soule from an opportunity to compete in front of college coaches.
“I am very happy for these athletes and I fully support them for being true to themselves and having the courage to do what they believe in,"" the high schooler told host Laura Ingraham. ""But, in athletics, it's an entirely different situation. It's scientifically proven that males are built to be physically stronger than females. It's unfair to put someone who is biologically a male, who has not undergone anything in terms of hormone therapy, against cis-gender girls.""
Tennis legend Martina Navratilova, an openly gay LGBT advocate, has also spoken out against the unfair nature of biologically male athletes competing against women.
""Letting men compete as women simply if they change their name and take hormones is unfair — no matter how those athletes may throw their weight around,"" Navratilova wrote in an op-ed for The Times of London.
""It’s insane and it’s cheating,"" she added. ""I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair.""
After predictable backlash hit Navratilova, Olympic medalist Sharron Davies came forward to highlight her concerns with the trans movement in girls and women’s sports, too.
""I have nothing against anyone who wishes [to] be transgender. However I believe there is a fundamental difference between the binary sex u r born with & the gender u may identify as. To protect women’s sport those with a male sex advantage should not be able [to] compete in women’s sport,"" Davies posted in a tweet last month.

As highlighted by PJ Media on Monday, Davies also weighed-in on Gregory’s record-setting powerlifting performance. ""This is a trans woman a male body with male physiology setting a world record & winning a woman’s event in America in powerlifting.

Beneath Trump Jr.’s post, Omar ""Crispy"" Avila, a retired Army sergeant, Purple Heart recipient, Combat Infantry Badge Recipient, and Paralympic record holder, added, “Can’t stop, won’t stop. # make instagram great again. Thank you.”
On Instagram, Avila posted, “I honestly don’t know why this picture was taken down by Instagram … Not sure what guidelines it violates. But here we go again … thank you @donaldtrumpjr for always taking time out your busy schedule to say hello #maga#trump2020#trump.”
While serving in Iraq in 2007, Avila was in Iraq when his vehicle was struck with a 200 lb. IED resulting in burns over 75% of his body and his right leg had to be amputated below the knee. Avila later became the world record-holder for the bench and deadlift in the Paralympics category.
Avila recalled that while he was in Iraq he learned not to trust anyone, saying, “there was a time when we were there and these Iraqis were putting bombs and were sending them. For the most part, we did try to win the hearts and minds of people; we came in with food … giving the kids school supplies, everything that we could help out like we always try to do, but we started hearing around our sector that these kids were coming up to the American troops and acting like they were going to get something from us and then all of a sudden they were blowing up. What would happen is that the insurgents were putting bombs on these kids, make them walk out there and then they would detonate them from a house.”
Speaking of his work with children who have been burned, Avila said, “I found my calling, I need to share my message with everybody that’s been burned, and especially kids because my incident happened when I was 21 years old. I lived the American dream, I guess you could say, because I played sports, I had great things I wanted to do and accomplish; I was injured as an adult so I was okay with it and I was able to cope with it but these kids have to grow up that way and I hate to say it but we have some kids out there that are just mean, they’re bullies, and they’re going to take it out on them just because they’re different, so I kind of want to be there for them as a mentor, as somebody they can call when they really don’t want to open up to their parents.” "
‘I Wish We Had Trump’: Britons Angry Over Lack Of Brexit Plan | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46593/i-wish-we-had-trump-britons-angry-over-lack-brexit-ashe-schow,"April 30, 2019 views
In 2016, voters in the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Now, nearly three years later, citizens are still waiting for a plan from their government.
The break was formally set to happen on March 29, but now, a month later, there is still no deal, and lawmakers are discussing a second referendum.
Robert Perry told the Los Angeles Times’ special correspondent in London that he would lose votes in the Conservative Party if they can’t deliver on Brexit, and wishes U.S. President Donald Trump was leading Great Britain.
“The country has been shafted,” Perry said. “If we had Trump, he would have said: ‘Take it or leave it.’ I wish we had Trump right now.”
Perry further told the outlet that he thinks Brexit will just keep getting delayed and said those who voted to remain have been “bullying” those who voted to leave the EU who think Brexiters are dumb.
Seventy-six-year-old Tony Gilligan told the Times that he voted for “Brexit,” but the way the vote has been handled “have made this look like a John Cleese comedy show.”
“We have always run ourselves. We dictate, we don’t get dictated to,” Gilligan told the Times. “It’s made us a laughingstock when we were ‘Great Britain.’”
Gilligan told the outlet that he blames “the idiots in Parliament that are arguing over everything instead of running our country like they’re supposed to be.” Still angry, he added: “I can’t believe that a bunch of so-called adults who are supposedly running Great Britain have made this look like a John Cleese comedy show.”
Further, Gilligan said he thinks Britain should have left the European Union on March 29 even without a deal, and called the notion of a second referendum “a slap in the face for the people — they have already voted.”
He asked when the referendums would stop, “best of three? Five?”
A Hornchurch elected official told the Times street protests may be coming.
“We need to turn on the establishment and in the short term, have some sort of civil disobedience,” said Councilman Graham Williamson.
Williamson also said he wanted to see a new form of government in the country, using Switzerland as a model.
“I think we need proportional representation, the Swiss model of government or some form of it,” he told the Times.
Joann Peake, 78, told the Times she is “embarrassed on behalf of our country.” The local bartender said the lack of a Brexit deal makes Britons “look like idiots.”
“We are allowing another country to tell us how to conduct our life when this isn’t what it should all be about. People went to war twice so we could have freedom of speech,” she said.
Another common thread among those interviewed by the Times is disagreement with current immigration policy. Peake said migrants using Britain’s welfare and healthcare systems has been “impacting on our life.” She said “the National Health Service is in dire straits because there are too many people, and too many of them not paying into the system.” "
"Police Detained A Parrot For Warning Its Owner About A Drug Raid. Yes, A Parrot. | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46587/police-detained-parrot-warning-its-owner-about-ashe-schow,"Police Detained A Parrot For Warning Its Owner About A Drug Raid. Yes, A Parrot. Education Images/UIG via Getty Images April 30, 2019 views
A parrot was detained by police in Brazil after the feathered fiend warned its drug-dealing owners that police were approaching.
The parrot started yelling as the police approached its home Monday afternoon, The Guardian reported . The bird shouted “Mama, police!” authorities said.
“He must have been trained for this,” one officer who was part of the raid told Brazilian media outlets. “As soon as the police got close he started shouting.”
Since being detained, the bird, whose name has not been released according to The Guardian, has kept its beak shut. One Brazilian journalist described the animal as a “super obedient” bird.
“So far it hasn’t made a sound … completely silent,” said the reporter, who appears to have attempted to interview the winged whistleblower.
A veterinarian in the area, Alexandre Clark, told one Brazilian media outlet that ““Lots of police officers have come by and he’s said nothing,” referring to the parrot.
Brazilian media outlet Meio Norte (Media North) posted footage of the bird refusing to answer questions. In the video, the bird sits atop police documents in what looks like an interview room, ignoring questions.
WATCH:
The Washington Post reported that the accused human’s defense attorney, Salma Barros, doubted the police’s claims of the talking bird because the animal had been so quiet in police custody.
Local media reported that the bird has been entered into a diversion program at a local zoo, where he will spend three months being taught to fly (and probably taught the error of his ways). The tight-beaked criminal will then be released.
Along with the bird, the police raid resulted in the arrests of an adult man and teenage girl, according to local Brazilian media , as well as the seizure of bags of crack cocaine, so even though the parrot tried to warn his family of the impending raid, they were still caught.
The Guardian also reported that other animals have been detained for their involvement in the country’s drug trade.
“In 2008, police seized two small alligators during a raid on a favela in western Rio de Janeiro, claiming local gangsters had fed their enemies to the animals. However, the father of one of the accused gangsters rejected those accusations, alleging his son’s gang had once tried to do so – but the alligator had refused to eat the corpse,” The Guardian reported.
This isn’t even the first parrot to aid his family in their drug dealings. The Post reported that in 2010, a Colombian parrot, who is not being named by The Daily Wire, yelled “Run! Run!” to his owners as police approached their home. The avian offender was alleged to have been guarding the family’s weapons and marijuana stash.

Beto O'Rourke: There Are Now Only TEN Years To Address Climate Change | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46592/beto-orourke-there-are-now-only-ten-years-address-emily-zanotti,"April 30, 2019 views
Former Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke will take your prediction that humanity has a mere dozen years to address ""climate change"" or face potentially catastrophic consequences, and up the ante. In an interview Monday night, O'Rourke claimed that civilization has only ten years left before rising seas and choked air threaten the very fabric of human civilization.
""We have one last chance to unleash the ingenuity and political will of hundreds of millions of Americans to meet this moment before it's too late."" O'Rourke told MSNBC host Chris Hayes. ""The actions we're announcing today will help us get there.""
The interview was part of a rollout for O'Rourke's environmental plan, which would see the United States spend around $1.5 trillion over the course of the next 10 — beginning with Beto's hypothetical inauguration in 2021, hence the ""ten years."" He's not counting the next two years of Trump's presidency.
The plan, which, like the Green New Deal, focuses on energy innovation and massive changes in American industry and infrastructure, would represent the ""largest investment in fighting climate change in history,"" according to CBS News .
The plan is more focused than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY). It avoids pushing for an almost entirely socialistic economic regime, and limits government takeover of industry to the oil and gas sector. It would also reform the crop insurance program for middle American farmers to promote a ""greener"" agricultural industry, and force the United States to re-enter the Paris Climate Accords, reversing one of the first Trump administration decisions.
But O'Rourke's plan has its flaws, not least of which is the $1.5 trillion price tag, which O'Rourke says will be covered by raising taxes on the rich — a fairly common, if unreliable source of income for progressive programs.
The Paris Climate Accords, of course, have no execution guidelines, and there is no clause that forces accountability on any signatory nation, rendering the U.N. agreement fairly useless and inconsequential. Now that may not impact the United States directly, if the United States commits to its own carbon emissions reduction goal, as it already has, even under that dastardly polluter, President Donald Trump, but it does, ultimately, cut down on the effectiveness of the $1.5 trillion dollar investment.
O'Rourke's plan, like the Green New Deal, calls for ""net zero"" carbon emissions by 2050. But even the GND's vast investment and mind-boggling alterations to the American economic system would reduce global warming by a mere fraction of a tenth of a degree, because the United States is one of only several nations responsible for high carbon emissions. China, India, and developing nations in southeast Asia and Africa account for most of the carbon pollution, and while those nations are signatories to the Paris Accords, they've shown no interest in complying with the agreement's guidelines (and the accords have no accountability clause that might trigger a punishment).
At least O'Rourke is gung-ho about his policy.
""We cannot afford to alienate a significant part of this country and we cannot do this by half measure or by only half of us. It can't be Democrats versus Republicans, big cities versus small towns, we all have a shared interest in a cleaner future for this country. So I'm going to work with, listen to everyone anytime, anywhere to make sure that we advance this agenda and get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,"" he said.
He added that he is ""optimistic"" even that the oil and gas industry will tag along on the initiative. "
James Woods Is In 'Twitter Jail.'

Here's The Tweet That Got Him Suspended. Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for WGAw April 30, 2019 views
Outspoken conservative and award-winning actor James Woods has been locked out of his massive Twitter account — which has accumulated over 2 million followers — for over a week now, the actor's girlfriend Sarah Miller has confirmed.
On April 20, Miller posted a screenshot of the email Woods received from the tech platform.
""Of course Twitter doesn’t inform his followers,"" she captioned the photo. The email claims Woods was locked out of his account for ""violating"" Twitter rules ""against abusive behavior."" The tweet supposedly in violation read as follows: ""If you try to kill the King, you better not miss. #HangThemAll."" Of course Twitter doesn’t inform his followers. @RealJamesWoods has received the following email: pic.twitter.com/2nnnVBVktQ — Sara Miller (@Millerita) April 20, 2019
Woods’ quote was apparently made in reaction to the Mueller report findings exonerating President Donald Trump and his 2016 campaign of collusion with the Russian government.
This is not the first time Woods has been suspended from the platform. It was reported in September that the ""Casino"" actor was suspended for making a crack about a fake meme, which he acknowledged was likely fake.
""Pretty scary that there is a distinct possibility this could be real. Not likely, but in this day and age of absolute liberal insanity, it is at least possible …"" Woods captioned a meme falsely suggesting top Democrat organizations encouraged men to skip voting in the midterms ""to make a woman’s vote worth more.""

With his permission I asked him if I could share with you all as I know how much you all adore him. #FreeJamesWoods @RealJamesWoods @Twitter pic.twitter.com/WxtpDESWKq — Kaya Jones (@KayaJones) September 23, 2018
""The irony is, Twitter accused me of affecting the political process, when in fact, their banning of me is the truly egregious interference,"" Woods told the Associated Press at the time of the suspension.
""Because now, having your voice smothered is much more disturbing than having your vocal cords slit. If you want to kill my free speech, man up and slit my throat with a knife, don’t smother me with a pillow,"" he continued.
""I wish this were about an unknown Twitter user so that I could be even more passionate about it,"" the actor added. ""This is not about a celebrity being muzzled. This is about an American being silenced — one tweet at a time.""
Two years ago, Woods temporarily quit the platform over their censorship.
""Since [Twitter] is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll,"" the actor posted in a short-lived farewell tweet, noted by The Daily Beast.
Twitter’s bias against conservative or contrarian speech has been well-documented. For example, CEO Jack Dorsey and Twitter’s global lead for legal, policy, and trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde, were pressed on their ideologically driven speech policies pertaining to transgenderism during a March appearance on ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast. Radical feminist Meghan Murphy was notably banned from the platform for refusing to use female pronouns when arguing with a transgender woman, who is biologically male. Moreover, Twitter briefly suspended the official Twitter account for the pro-life ""Unplanned"" movie without cause last month. The account was restored only after fierce backlash. "

MSNBC reporter Kerry Sanders accidentally made a strong case for the Second Amendment on Tuesday during a segment on the far-left network about the chaos in Venezuela.
The segment came after opposition leader Juan Guaido called on Venezuelan citizens and members of the armed forces to join a movement to overthrow brutal socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro.
Sanders noted that Maduro still maintained control of the military through the whole ordeal, adding: ""You have to understand, in Venezuela gun ownership is not something that's open to everybody. So if the military have the guns, they have the power and as long as Nicolás Maduro controls the military, he controls the country.""
Sanders comments came after an armored Venezuelan military vehicle plowed into a crowd of protesters earlier in the day in a video clip that went viral and was seen around the world.

""Under the direction of then-President Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan National Assembly in 2012 enacted the “Control of Arms, Munitions and Disarmament Law,” with the explicit aim to 'disarm all citizens,'"" Fox News reported. ""The law took effect in 2013, with only minimal pushback from some pro-democracy opposition figures, banned the legal commercial sale of guns and munitions to all - except government entities.""
""Guns would have served as a vital pillar to remaining a free people, or at least able to put up a fight,"" Venezuelan teacher Javier Vanegas told Fox News. ""The government security forces, at the beginning of this debacle, knew they had no real opposition to their force. Once things were this bad, it was a clear declaration of war against an unarmed population.""
Fox News noted that when only 37 firearms were voluntarily turned in, Venezuela's socialist government went around and forcefully confiscated thousands of firearms from its citizens.
In addition to police and military forces having firearms, Maduro has also indicated that he plans on arming the nation's large civil militia which was founded by former President Hugo Chavez in 2008.
Maduro said in December that ""the country’s civil militia had grown to 1.6 million members - more than tripling in size from the beginning of the year - and that its mission was to defend the country against external aggression,"" Reuters reported.
""We will arm the Bolivarian militia to the teeth,"" Maduro said. ""An invading imperialist force may enter a part of our fatherland, but the imperialists should know that they will not leave here alive.""
Gunshots could be heard as the chaos commenced on Tuesday morning after Guaido called on Venezuelans to help him remove Maduro from power.

Welsh Man: My Father Died Because British Health System Couldn't Treat Him On A Sunday | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46594/welsh-man-my-father-died-because-british-health-hank-berrien,"April 30, 2019 views
According to a Welsh man, his 55-year-old father may have died because the British national health system failed to treat him when he suffered a stroke on a Sunday.
Colin Rogers, 55, suffered a basilar artery occlusion on April 14, which he could have survived if he had undergone a thrombectomy, which removes a blood clot from the brain.
Instead, Rogers was taken to Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff could have performed the procedure, but enough specialists staff were reportedly not available. Rogers died on April 18.
His son Callum, 26, stated, “Although we don’t know what the outcome would have been, this potentially could have saved his life. My dad was denied the chance of survival as Wales does not have access to this treatment and doesn’t have any units. We were also told [by a stroke consultant] that if he fell ill on a weekday they would have had a chance to transfer him to a specialist unit in England. Because this was a Sunday it was impossible. To find this out is just gut-wrenching.”
Colin Rogers’ family issued a statement saying, “Up to 500 people a year in Wales may die or be left profoundly disabled because of a lack of availability of endovascular thrombectomy. This has to be done within 24 hours or it is too late. Colin is not the only person to have died because of this postcode lottery and this is not a new problem. We want to change this. We want to raise awareness and campaign for equal access for patients such as Colin, who will die or live a profoundly disabled life without treatment. We want to make a difference so that people are not failed by the system as Colin was.”
A spokeswoman from the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC) stated:
Whilst we do not comment on individual cases the general position in Wales is that WHSSC took on the commissioning of mechanical thrombectomy from April 2019. Prior to this individual health boards commissioned the service directly from providers. In south Wales, WHSSC accesses treatment from provider hospitals in Cardiff and Bristol on a case-by-case basis dependent on the capacity available at the hospitals when required. The capacity depends on the availability of specialist staff able to carry out the procedure which has varied over time.
The University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, has recently recruited a second consultant who is due to start in autumn 2019, allowing the service to be developed further. Treatment for patients from mid Wales and north Wales is usually commissioned from hospitals in the Midlands or Liverpool, again dependent on the availability of specialist staff. To the extent that specialist staff are available, this is a seven day a week service.
A basilar artery occlusion (BAO) starts with variable and stuttering symptoms which can cause a delay in diagnosis; the attack has high morbidity and mortality. BAOs represent 1% to 4% of all ischemic strokes.
A fundraising page has been created to push for 24-7 access for clot-removal treatment. "
Report: Smugglers And Cartels Profited Up To $2.3 Billion From Central American Migrants In 2017 | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46609/report-smugglers-and-cartels-profited-23-billion-josh-hammer,"April 30, 2019 views
In March, an eye-opening New York Times report elaborated on the humanitarian catastrophe involving migrants subjected to sexual violence and gang rape by cartels and traffickers at our beleaguered southern border. The Times reported:
On America’s southern border, migrant women and girls are the victims of sexual assaults that most often go unreported, uninvestigated and unprosecuted. Even as women around the world are speaking out against sexual misconduct, migrant women on the border live in the shadows of the #MeToo movement.
The stories are many, and yet all too similar. Undocumented women making their way into American border towns have been beaten for disobeying smugglers, impregnated by strangers, coerced into prostitution, shackled to beds and trees and — in at least a handful of cases — bound with duct tape, rope or handcuffs.
The New York Times found dozens of documented cases through interviews with law enforcement officials, prosecutors, federal judges and immigrant advocates around the country, and a review of police reports and court records in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. The review showed more than 100 documented reports of sexual assault of undocumented women along the border in the past two decades, a number that most likely only skims the surface, law enforcement officials and advocates say.
As Rachel Bovard argued shortly thereafter at American Greatness, the Times' report highlighted a ""serious and endemic crisis of assault."" Tragically, as Bovard persuasively pointed out, ""as long as our asylum laws encourage illegal immigration through ease of entry and catch and release; as long as migrants believe that putting their lives in the hands of a coyote is worth it; as long as illegal immigrants know it is more advantageous to show up with a child than to come alone, this epidemic of sexual assault will not only sustain itself, it will grow.""
But not enough attention is paid to the remarkably profitable nature of human smuggling and trafficking for the transnational cartel enterprises.
Helping to shine a light on this aspect of our border crisis is a recent report from the non-partisan RAND Corporation entitled, ""Human Smuggling from Central America to the United States."" In the report, RAND researchers find that drug trafficking-centric transnational cartels ""control primary smuggling corridors into the United States"" and estimate that the total ""revenues to all types of smugglers, not just [transnational cartels], from smuggling migrants from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, combined, ranged from about $200 million to about $2.3 billion in 2017.""
In other words, cartels and trafficking rings earned as much as $2.3 billion from human smuggling just in the year 2017. This is a humanitarian nightmare, and we ignore it at our peril.
One possible solution, offered from the same RAND report, is for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ""consider expanding existing efforts to investigate payments to human smugglers, especially in the United States, and working more closely with formal and informal banking services to identify suspicious payments."" Another legislative option, which at least some in Congress appear to be considering, is to tighten our porous asylum regime. Another solution is for either Congress or the DHS itself to vitiate the much-ballyhooed and misbegotten Flores consent decree that hamstrings the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts at our southern border.

Dershowitz: Here's Why I'm Joining A Protest Of The New York Times | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46599/dershowitz-heres-why-im-joining-protest-new-york-james-barrett,"April 30, 2019 views
Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz does not support boycotting The New York Times, but he has joined a protest of the ""newspaper of record.""
In an op-ed published by the Gatestone Institute on Monday, Dershowitz forcefully condemns the Times for its repeated promotion of anti-Semitism and its increasingly biased reporting on Israel.
""Imagine if the New York Times cartoon that depicted Israel's Prime Minister as a dog had, instead, depicted the leader of another ethnic or gender group in a similar manner?"" Dershowitz begins in reference to the Times' recent publication of an image of a blind President Trump, wearing a yamulke, being led by a dog with the face of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""If you think that is hard to imagine, you are absolutely right. It would be inconceivable for a Times editor to have allowed the portrayal of a Muslim leader as a dog; or the leader of any other ethnic or gender group in so dehumanizing a manner."" Another disgusting display of vile antisemitic trope celebrated in the @nytimesworld . The @nytimes is signaling to the world that antisemitism is real, here, and welcome. pic.twitter.com/crv9vvVUAw — Adam Milstein (@AdamMilstein) April 26, 2019
Blasting the image as ""a caricature right out of the Nazi playbook,"" Dershowitz underscores that this isn't a ""one off"" for the Times: When it comes to Jews and Israel, the New York Times has been and continues to be ""on the wrong side of history,"" he asserts, and recently, the paper's bias against Israel and Jews has only become more consistent and egregious.
""In recent years, it has become more and more difficult to distinguish between the reporting of the New York Times and their editorializing,"" he writes. ""Sometimes its editors hide behind the euphemism 'news analysis,' when allowing personal opinions to be published on the front page. More recently, they haven't even bothered to offer any cover. The reporting itself, as repeatedly demonstrated by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), has been filled with anti-Israel errors.""
The esteemed law professor stresses that he is ""a strong believer in freedom of speech"" and adamantly defends the Times' right to continue its biased treatment of Israel and reckless conflation of ""reporting and editorializing."" However, he also has a right to free speech, and he plans to use it to call out the paper. On Monday, he joined a protest in front of the paper's office ""to express my freedom of speech against how the New York Times has chosen to exercise its.""
""There is no inconsistency in defending the right to express bigotry and at the same time protesting that bigotry,"" he writes.
""The publishers of the New York Times owe its readers a responsibility to probe deeply into this bias and to assume responsibility for making the Times earn its title as the newspaper of record,"" says Dershowitz. Dershowitz ends by ironically noting ""some good news"" that comes out of the Times open hostility to Israel and Jews: It’s exposed the lie of the anti-Semitic trope that ""the Jews control the media.""

Joy Behar Claims Trump 'Culprit' Behind Synagogue Attack. Perpetrator Hated Trump. ~ Full Magazine,www.dailywire.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46611/joy-behar-claims-trump-culprit-behind-synagogue-ryan-saavedra,"Ryan Saavedra 42 mins ago 2 minutes read

ABC’s “The View” co-host Joy Behar falsely claimed on Monday that President Donald Trump was “the culprit” behind the tragic attack on a California synagogue over the weekend.
The attack on the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California happened Saturday and resulted in one person losing their life and three others being shot.
Behar, a leftist, sought to immediately politicize the attack when the show ran again on Monday by falsely claiming that Trump was “the culprit” behind it and that he needed to take responsibility for it.
“He’s provocative. He gives dog whistles constantly to these people,” Behar said. “Take responsibility for your actions, Mr. President. You are the culprit.”
Behar conveniently did not tell viewers what the alleged terrorist wrote about Trump in his alleged manifesto, where the terrorist answered his own questions so people could know his views. In one section, the terrorist wrote about Trump:
Are you a Trump supporter?
You mean that Zionist, Jew-loving, anti-White, traitorous c**ksucker? Don’t make me laugh.
The terrorist hated Trump because of Trump’s love for Israel and the Jewish community.

On Sunday, Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein revealed that Trump called him and personally comforted him following the tragic terror attack that happened at his synagogue.
“I received a personal phone call from our president, Donald Trump,” Goldstein told reporters. “I was amazed to answer the phone and say the secretary of the White House was calling. And he spent close to 10, 15 minutes with me on the phone.”
“It’s the first time that I have ever spoken to a President of the United States of America,” Goldstein continued. “He shared with me condolences on behalf of the United States of America. And We spoke about the moment of silence. And he spoke about his love of peace and Judaism and Israel and he was just so comforting that I’m really grateful to our president for taking the time and making that effort to share with us his comfort and consolation.”
Following the shooting, Trump tweeted: “Thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the shooting at the Synagogue in Poway, California. God bless you all. Suspect apprehended. Law enforcement did outstanding job. Thank you!” Thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the shooting at the Synagogue in Poway, California. God bless you all. Suspect apprehended.

EDITOR’S NOTE: The name of the suspect has been withheld from this article. Recent studies suggest that “media coverage of mass shootings can have a significant impact on the psyches of potential mass shooters — that such potential mass shooters have a cognitive craving for attention, which they know they will receive for committing atrocities.” For this reason, The Daily Wire no longer publishes names and images of mass shooters as it has become increasingly clear in recent years that “the value of public knowledge regarding specific names and photographs of mass shooters is significantly outweighed by the possibility of encouraging more mass shootings.” "

Socialists Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were completely silent on Tuesday about the situation unfolding in Venezuela as the socialist nation reportedly fired on and ran over protesters.
""Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó took to the streets on Tuesday, calling on citizens and the military to back him up in the 'final phase' of the interim president’s plan to end the regime of socialist President Nicolás Maduro,"" Fox News reported.

Ocasio-Cortez tweeted nothing about Venezuela from her official congressional Twitter account or from her personal Twitter account.
Sanders, who was also silent about the events in Venezuela, was busy doubling down on his belief that terrorists who have murdered American citizens should have the right to vote in U.S. elections while incarcerated.
""If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must firmly establish that the right to vote is an inalienable and universal principle that applies to all American citizens 18 years and older,"" Sanders tweeted from his personal account.

""Our present-day crisis of mass incarceration has become a tool of voter suppression.

"CURL: Obama, Not Trump, The True Menace To The Media | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46617/curl-obama-not-trump-true-menace-media-joseph-curl,"May 1, 2019 views
The White House press corps on Saturday held its annual celebration of itself, cramming 2,500 nattering narcissists into a Washington, D.C., hotel ballroom to eat overcooked filet mignon and fret about the fate of the First Amendment.
Olivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, which throws the increasingly debauched party, was in high dudgeon over the state of America’s media under the horror that is President Trump.
“I don’t want to dwell on the president,” Knox said in a speech, to much applause from the audience of fakes and phonies, charlatans and mountebanks. “This is not his dinner. It’s ours.”
Then Knox (whom this writer has known for more than a decade as a solid journalist and a great father) got personal.
“In nearly 23 years as a reporter, I’ve been physically assaulted by Republicans and Democrats, spat on, shoved, had crap thrown at me. And there was a brief moment in Afghanistan when I thought a soldier not quite old enough to shave would shoot me dead for the crime of taking a picture inside the presidential palace,” he said.
“And yet I still separate my career to before February 2017 and what came after,” he said. “February is when the president called us the ‘enemy of the people.’”
That is, of course, false. Trump calls the “fake news media” the “true enemy of the people” — as he did in an October 2018 tweet — because of their “inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news.” But that’s beside the point. Knox, who has covered the White House for years, was asserting that Trump is worse than his predecessors.
That, too, is false — demonstrably false. Yes, Trump is harsh — even immature — about the press and its coverage of him. He has thin skin and he’s never grown out of the name-calling phase of his snot-nosed youth. Trump’s a talker — often a whiner — but he’s never really done anything to the media, which are flourishing despite his supposed efforts to thwart them.
But President Obama — celebrated as The Chosen One and beloved by the media — stomped on the freedom of the press like no other president since Tricky Dick.
Obama, who pledged “the most transparent administration in history,” was deemed “the least transparent and the most antagonistic toward the media since the Nixon administration” by The San Diego Union-Tribune, which summed up his efforts to control the media in a single paragraph.
Some specifics? Obama’s administration prosecuted three times as many cases targeting whistle-blowers and leakers than all previous administrations combined. It said there was probable cause that a Fox News reporter was a ""co-conspirator"" in a plot against the U.S. government because of his attempts to gather information about North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. It secretly scoured the phone records of nearly 100 Associated Press reporters and editors for two months, which an editorial in The New York Times characterized as ""a fishing expedition for sources and an effort to frighten off whistle-blowers."" And in 2014, according to AP, the Obama administration broke its own record for censoring government files or refusing to provide files sought under the Freedom of Information Act.
Since 1945, the government has used the Espionage Act of 1917 just 11 times to prosecute journalists and their government sources. Seven of those occurred while Obama was president.
By the time Obama was leaving office, his administration had set a new record for rejecting Freedom of Information Act requests from journalists trying to gather information, censoring materials or flat-out denying applications for access in 596,095 cases — or 77 percent of the time, according to a review conducted by The Associated Press. The irony of the situation was perfectly captured in a Vice News headline: ""It Took a FOIA Lawsuit to Uncover How the Obama Administration Killed FOIA Reform.""
Having covered the White House for a dozen years — the end of Bill Clinton’s terms, the entire George W. Bush presidency, and the first two years of Obama — each administration has sought to limit access to journalists more than the last, and they’ve succeeded each and every time. It’s just the nature of the game — a high-stakes game, but a game nonetheless.
Trump is no different. But where he talks the big talk and loves to mix it up publicly with reporters — like CNN’s insufferable Jim Acosta — Obama quietly worked to throttle the press corps. Leonard Downie Jr., the former executive editor of The Washington Post, said in 2013 that ""the administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration.""
And that paper knows a thing or two about Tricky Dick.

"Washington Post: Mueller Complained To Barr About His Report Summary, But Then Made Crucial Admission | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46610/washington-post-mueller-complained-barr-about-his-james-barrett,"April 30, 2019 views
In a previously unreported letter obtained by The Washington Post , Robert Mueller complained to Attorney General William Barr about his summary of the special counsel's over 400-page final report because ""it did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions."" But in a follow-up call between Barr and Mueller, the special counsel admitted that Barr's summary was not ""inaccurate,"" the Post reports; rather, Mueller just felt ""that the media coverage of the letter was misinterpreting the investigation.""
In a report published Tuesday, the Post revealed the contents of a previously unreported letter from Mueller to Barr sent on March 27, three days after Barr's summary announcing that Mueller found no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians and came to no conclusions about obstruction of justice either way (Barr's full summary below).
""The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller wrote in a March 27 letter that the Post reports ""shocked"" Justice Department officials. ""There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.""
""The letter made a key request: that Barr release the 448-page report’s introductions and executive summaries, and made some initial suggested redactions for doing so, according to Justice Department officials,"" the Post reports.
Mueller said in the letter that the redaction process, which ended up taking a few weeks, ""need not delay release of the enclosed materials."" Mueller pressed for release of the materials immediately to ""alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen"" and ""answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation.""
Justice Department officials told the Post that they were surprised by Mueller's tone in the letter because until that moment, ""they believed Mueller was in agreement with them on the process of reviewing the report and redacting certain types of information, a process that took several weeks."" As Barr testified later, Mueller had declined his offer to review the summary before he sent it to Congress.
But law enforcement officials also told the Post that Barr and Mueller spoke on the phone for around 15 minutes a day after Barr received the letter. While Mueller expressed concern in the call that the media was misreporting about his obstruction of justice findings, when pressed, he admitted that the letter accurately portrayed his findings.
""After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller’s letter, he called him to discuss it,"" a Justice Department spokeswoman told the Post Tuesday. ""In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel’s obstruction analysis. They then discussed whether additional context from the report would be helpful and could be quickly released. However, the Attorney General ultimately determined that it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion. The Attorney General and the Special Counsel agreed to get the full report out with necessary redactions as expeditiously as possible.""
The Post also notes that some Justice Department officials expressed frustration with Mueller for failing to provide his complete recommended redactions along with the final report to expedite the process. ( Read the full Post report here .)
Below is the complete text of Barr's summary of the Mueller report:
Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler , Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:
As a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared.
The Special Counsel’s Report
On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. 600.8(c). This report is entitled “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.” Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.
The report explains that the Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations. In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other professional staff. The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses.
The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed. During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action. The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public. Below, I summarize the principal conclusions laid out in the Special Counsel’s report.
Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The Special Counsel’s report is divided into two parts. The first describes the results of the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts. The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel’s investigation was whether any Americans — including individuals associated with the Trump campaign — joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime. The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
(Footnote 1: In assessing potential conspiracy charges, the Special Counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign “coordinated” with Russian election interference activities. The Special Counsel defined “coordination” as an “agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.”)
The Special Counsel’s investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election. As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities.
The second element involved the Russian government’s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election. The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for the purposes of influencing the election. But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.
Obstruction of Justice. The report’s second part addresses a number of actions by the President — most of which have been the subject of public reporting — that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns. After making a “thorough factual investigation” into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards regarding prosecution and conviction but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as “difficult issues” of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The Special Counsel’s report states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
The Special Counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime. Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel’s office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel’s obstruction investigation. After reviewing the Special Counsel’s final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.
(Footnote 2: See A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C, 222 (2000).)
In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,” and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President’s intent with respect to obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President’s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department’s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense.
Status of the Department’s Review
The relevant regulations contemplate that the Special Counsel’s report will be a “confidential report” to the Attorney General. See Office of Special Counsel, 64 Fed. Reg. 27,038, 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999). As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter. For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel’s report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.
Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(e), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to “matter[s] occurring before [a] grand jury.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution. Id. Disclosure of 6(e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 401(3). This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function.
Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6(e) material that by law cannot be made public. I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6(e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible. Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices. As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.
***
As I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that “the Attorney General may determine that public release of” notifications to your respective Committees “would be in the public interest.” 28 C.F.R. 600.9(c). I have so determined, and I will disclose the letter to the public after delivering it to you.
Sincerely, "
Adam Schiff Predictably Wants Barr Fired After Misreading Washington Post Story | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46639/adam-schiff-predictably-wants-barr-fired-after-ashe-schow,"Adam Schiff Predictably Wants Barr Fired After Misreading Washington Post Story Mario Tama/Getty Images May 1, 2019 views
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), never one to miss an opportunity to stoke hatred against the Trump administration, is calling for Attorney General William Barr to resign for allegedly lying to Congress.
Schiff’s call came shortly after The Washington Post published an article detailing a letter sent from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to Barr just days after the attorney general released a summary of the investigation into President Donald Trump’s alleged Russian collusion and obstruction of justice.
Mueller said in his previously undisclosed March 27 letter to Barr that the attorney general’s summary “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the special counsel’s investigation. This was enough to send Democrats like Schiff and their media allies into a frenzy.
“I think his statement is deliberately false and misleading, and yes, most people would consider that to be a lie,” Schiff told CBS Wednesday morning, referring to Barr’s previous testimony before congress. “Look, there’s no sugar coating this, I think he should step down. It’s hard, I think, for the country to have confidence in the top law enforcement official in the country if he’s asked a direct question as he was and he gives a directly false answer, so this is serious business.”
During Barr’s previous testimony before the House appropriation subcommittee shortly after he released his summary of Mueller’s report, the attorney general was asked if the special counsel found his summary lacking. Barr responded that he didn’t know what Mueller thought of his summary. This testimony came after Mueller sent Barr the letter about context, which is why Democrats are pouncing now.
But if these Democrats, including Schiff, read the full Post article, they would see that Mueller did not intend his letter to be criticism of Barr, but of the media’s misreporting of it. A Justice Department spokeswoman told the Post that Mueller and Barr had a 15-minute, “cordial and professional conversation” after Barr received the letter. During that call, the spokeswoman said, “the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading.”
“But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel’s obstruction analysis,” she added. “They then discussed whether additional context from the report would be helpful and could be quickly released. However, the Attorney General ultimately determined that it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion. The Attorney General and the Special Counsel agreed to get the full report out with necessary redactions as expeditiously as possible.""
This, of course, was lost on Schiff, who for years has been claiming that he has “evidence” that Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia — evidence that apparently Mueller missed in his two-year, $25 million-plus investigation with all the tools of the federal government at his fingertips.
Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro summed up Democrat outrage:
Here’s the reality. Democrats are angry at Mueller for not recommending obstruction charges, but they want to sell their votive candles on eBay, so they won’t hit Mueller. Instead, they’ll misdirect to Barr, then claim a cover-up that hasn’t happened. And Mueller would prefer that Barr be hit for declining to prosecute over Mueller himself being hit for – wait for it – declining to prosecute, which is effectively what Mueller did."
WATCH: Bill Barr Shuts Down Dianne Feinstein On Obstruction Claims | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46638/watch-bill-barr-shuts-down-dianne-feinstein-ryan-saavedra,"May 1, 2019 views
Attorney General William Barr shut down Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Wednesday during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation after Feinstein tried to suggest that President Donald Trump committed an obstruction of justice offense.
""Mr. Attorney General, the special counsel's report describes how the president directed White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Mueller and later told McGahn to write a letter 'for our records' stating that the president had not ordered him to fire Mueller,"" Feinstein began. ""The report also recounts how the president made repeated efforts to get McGahn to change his story. Knowing that McGahn believed that the president's version of events was false, the special counsel found 'substantial evidence' that the president tried to change McGahn's account in order to prevent further scrutiny of the president towards the investigation.""
""Special counsel also found that McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate, given the position he held in the White House,"" Feinstein continued. ""Here's the question: Does existing law prohibit efforts to get a witness to lie to say something the witness believes is false?""
""Yes, lie to the government, yes,"" Barr responded.
""And what law is that?
""Obstruction statutes,"" Barr responded.
Feinstein then said that what Trump did ""in effect constitute[d] obstruction,"" adding that she was ""specifically"" noting that ""the special counsel in his report found substantial evidence that the president tried to change McGahn's account in order to prevent and this is a quote further scrutiny of the president toward the investigation.""
""We felt that ... the government would not be able to establish obstruction, if you go back and you if you look at the episode where the president gave McGann an instruction, McGahn's version of that is quite clear and each time he gave it which is that the instruction said go to Rosenstein, raise the issue of conflict of interest, and Mueller has to go because of this conflict of interest,"" Barr responded. ""So there's no question that whatever instruction was giving McGahn had to do with Mueller's conflict of interest.""
""Now, the president later said that what he meant was that the conflict of interest should be raised with Rosenstein, but the decision should be left with Rosenstein,"" Barr continued. ""On the other end of the spectrum, it appears that McGahn felt it was more directive and that the president was essentially saying push Rosenstein to invoke a conflict of interest to push Mueller out. Wherever it fell on that spectrum of interest, The New York Times' story was very different. The New York Times' story said flat-out that the president directed the firing of Muller, he told McGahn to 'fire Mueller.'""
Barr then explained the critical difference between firing the special counsel and having the special counsel replaced due to conflicts of interest.
""Now there's something very different between firing a special counsel outright, which suggests ending the investigation, and having a special counsel removed for conflict, which suggests that you're going to have another special counsel,"" Barr said. ""So the fact is, that even under McGahn's, and then as the report says and recognizes there is evidence the president truly felt that The Times' article was inaccurate and he wanted McGahn to correct it. So, we believe that it would be impossible for the government to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the president understood that he was instructing McGahn and to say something false because it wasn't necessarily false."""
"Media, Democrats Suggest Impeaching Barr Over Whiny Mueller Letter. Here's Why That's Absurd. | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ben Shapiro,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46637/media-democrats-suggest-impeaching-barr-over-whiny-ben-shapiro,"Media, Democrats Suggest Impeaching Barr Over Whiny Mueller Letter. Here's Why That's Absurd. Alex Wong/Getty Images May 1, 2019 views
On Tuesday evening, the day before Attorney General William Barr was set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, The Washington Postobtained a “leaked” letter from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to Barr, written just days after Barr first released a letter summarizing the conclusions of Mueller’s findings. According to the Post ’s headline, “Mueller complained to Barr about memo on key findings.” But that wasn’t actually what Mueller was complaining about.
It turns out that Mueller was complaining, not about the inaccuracy of Barr’s summary of his conclusions, but that Barr hadn’t captured the “context, nature, and substance” of Mueller’s work. According to Mueller’s letter, “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations … Release at this time [of Mueller’s own summary] would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation. It would also accord with the standard for public release of notifications to Congress cited in your letter.”
So, what exactly did Barr do wrong? He didn’t lie. His letter was an accurate summation of the bottom line of the Mueller report. According to the Post report, “When Barr pressed Mueller on whether he thought Barr’s memo to Congress was inaccurate, Mueller said he did not but felt that the media coverage of it was misinterpreting the investigation, officials said.” In other words, Mueller didn’t like the media coverage, which probably seemed too kind to Trump in Mueller’s view.
Mueller’s team uncovered very little new damning material with regard to collusion, and in fact refused to issue any finding at all with regard to obstruction of justice. Barr probably didn’t release Mueller’s summary because Mueller’s summary likely didn’t contain a bottom line with regard to obstruction . Which means that the American public would have been left bewildered as to whether Trump was in fact guilty of prosecutable obstruction of justice.
That confusion was Mueller’s fault . (NOTE: This is coming from someone who has defended Mueller's integrity for years, called on Trump consistently to stop attacking Mueller, and stated that if Trump fired Mueller, impeachment ought to be on the table.) Mueller had the full capacity to recommend prosecution on obstruction of justice. He had full authority to state that in his view, Trump had obstructed justice. But he didn’t. His 448 page report is a listing of ugly details about Trump’s internal administration behavior, but does not recommend obstruction charges — and indeed, doesn’t substantiate activity that could sustain a prosecution. Mueller knew that.
So what Mueller actually wanted is what he eventually got with the release of the full report: he wanted the media and Democrats to hone in on a political case for impeachment, rather than the criminal bottom line. And he didn’t like that Barr did what the Attorney General is supposed to do: avoid smearing unprosecutable people for unspecified crimes. Barr instead issued a statement explaining that no prosecution would take place.
Yet the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) say that Barr has lied, though they can’t specify the lie, and Mueller himself apparently says Barr didn’t lie; they say Barr played defense for Trump, even though he released the full report, which is damning for Trump’s character; they say Barr should be impeached for simply announcing the criminal results of the investigation rather than releasing Mueller’s synopsis of all the Very Bad Things™ Trump did after the firing of former FBI director James Comey. Instead, Barr opted to do his job, then let Mueller have his full say in a report somewhat longer than an average Leo Tolstoy novel. For this, Barr is being pilloried.
Here’s the reality. Democrats are angry at Mueller for not recommending obstruction charges, but they want to sell their votive candles on eBay, so they won’t hit Mueller. Instead, they’ll misdirect to Barr, then claim a cover-up that hasn’t happened. And Mueller would prefer that Barr be hit for declining to prosecute over Mueller himself being hit for — wait for it — declining to prosecute, which is effectively what Mueller did.
The media will oblige, as they always do.
This isn’t a controversy. It’s a nonsensical hit job against Barr, an attempt to lash out in frustration that Mueller didn’t provide the deus ex machina necessary to oust Trump from office."
New Kirsten Gillibrand Plan: Give Every Voter 600 'Democracy Dollars' To Give To Federal Candidates | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46626/new-kirsten-gillibrand-plan-give-every-voter-600-ashe-schow,"May 1, 2019 views
In a move that exactly no one asked for, struggling presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has come up with a new plan she thinks will clean up politics.
Gillibrand told NBC News that her first major campaign plan would be called the “Clean Elections Plan” and would give every voter $600 – she called it “Democracy Dollars” – to donate to the federal candidates of their choice. She told the media outlet her plan would help get big money out of politics.
""If you want to accomplish anything that the American people want us to accomplish — whether it's healthcare as a right, better public schools, better economy — you have to take on the greed and corruption that determine everything in Washington,"" Gillibrand told NBC.
Gillibrand’s reason for her plan appears to be a take on Sen. Bernie Sanders’ discussion of the influence of money in politics. Sanders’ campaign is raising the majority of its funds from individual donors giving less than $200.
Gillibrand broke down how her “Democracy Dollars” would work. According to NBC:
Under Gillibrand's plan, every eligible voter could register for vouchers to donate up to $100 in a primary election and $100 in a general election each cycle, either all at once or in $10 increments to one or more candidates over time. Each participant would get a separate $200 pool for House, Senate and presidential contests for a total maximum donation of $600 for those federal offices.
The plan would also restrict voters from spending this money out of their state. They could, however, spend it on House candidates outside of their district but within their home state.
Further, the only way a candidate could receive the “Democracy Dollars” would be to voluntarily give up donations from individuals larger than $200. The current maximum, NBC reported, is $2,800 per individual per primary cycle and $2,800 per individual per general election.
It seems rather hard to believe a candidate would volunteer to give up bigger donations, but Gillibrand insisted to NBC that they would “because the potential of how much you could raise in this system is exponentially higher.""
She claimed it would result in candidates reaching out to more local voters to earn their vote.
""They would campaign in all communities,"" she told NBC. ""They would be going to low-income communities, they would be going to rural communities, they would be asking people to support them not only with a vote, but with (financial) support for their campaign.""
As NBC noted, just 0.5% of Americans donate more than $200 to campaigns. Gillibrand said her plan would “change who has a seat at the table and who gets elected in this country within one election cycle.”
Her plan was quickly mocked on Twitter.
Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) tweeted: “Making someone pay taxes, then giving them a $600 check back to pay for your failing campaign isn’t ‘democracy.’” Making someone pay taxes, then giving them a $600 check back to pay for your failing campaign isn’t “democracy.” https://t.co/9GczHf8J7I — Rep.

There are many issues campaigns want to focus on, using taxpayer dollars to voters to give back to politicians is not one of them. People would rather just have the $600 to spend on what they want, but then Gillibrand would just be copying fellow candidate Andrew Yang’s $1000-a-month plan."
Julia Roberts Calls For Gender-Neutral School Bathrooms | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46627/julia-roberts-calls-gender-neutral-school-paul-bois,"Julia Roberts Calls For Gender-Neutral School Bathrooms ""I wish they all said this"" Gregg DeGuire / Stringer / Getty Images May 1, 2019 views
It appears that Julia Roberts wants schools to have gender-neutral bathrooms. It is unclear if those bathrooms should be private or public to the point of biological males urinating alongside biological females.
In an Instagram post on Tuesday, the ""Pretty Woman"" star shared a photo of herself posing in front of a ""gender-neutral"" bathroom — not a unisex bathroom, mind you; the kind that includes both the male and female symbol alongside a half male/half female symbol.
""I wish they all said this,"" Roberts said in her post before asking people to check her Instagram story. Actress Rita Wilson, wife of Tom Hanks, expressed her approval. A post shared by Julia Roberts (@juliaroberts) on Apr 30, 2019 at 10:43am PDT
In her Instagram story video, Roberts invited her followers to donate to the organization, GLSEN, which, according to HuffPost , is ""a national education organization that works to help LGBTQ children in K-12 schools.""
""Hi everybody, I wanted to talk to you about an organization I feel really strongly about. It’s called GLSEN,"" Roberts said in the story video. ""GLSEN makes schools safe for every student no matter your sexual orientation or gender identity, I’ve donated, I’m asking you to. Click that donation button, every dollar helps.""
GLSEN claims it simply promotes anti-bullying of LGBTQ students, but it often goes into propaganda — specifically on the subjects of gender pronouns and gender-neutral bathrooms. In a post explaining their position , GLSEN described traditional bathrooms as being harmful to transgender students in schools.
These bathrooms in schools also pose difficulty to transgender and gender nonconforming students. GLSEN research shows that nearly two thirds of transgender students avoid school bathrooms because of feeling unsafe or uncomfortable. They risk verbal and physical harassment, no matter which of the two, sex-segregated bathrooms they enter.
Also, over half of transgender students report that they were required to use the bathroom of their legal sex rather than the one that they feel most comfortable using. The U.S. Department of Justice has deemed this requirement illegal under Title IX.
Feeling unsafe, uncomfortable, and at risk of illegal disciplinary action, these students might “hold it” or restrict intake of fluids, risking pain and dehydration. Some of these students even leave school altogether. These outcomes are not positive in any way, for any one.
The solution here is not a new or radical concept: all schools should have private, gender-neutral bathrooms for any students to use, in the same, normal way that homes have bathrooms for guests to use and many restaurants have bathrooms that are not labeled for the sexes. This is not to suggest, however, that there be a separate bathroom for transgender students, like presidential candidate Ben Carson recently proposed , because separate is never equal .
Julia Roberts has promoted GLSEN before. According to PEOPLE , while presenting the Visionary Award at the 2016 GLSEN Respect Awards, Roberts had fans donate $49 to GLSEN in honor of her 49th birthday,
""It is my pleasure every year to support GLSEN ,"" she said. ""I love this night. I told the kids backstage ... that this is like my third favorite night of the year — and one and two, but don’t tell anyone.""
""But one of the three nights might be my birthday, which is next Friday,"" Roberts continued. ""If you wake up next Friday and think, 'What should I get Julia for her birthday?,' then donate to GLSEN . I’m going to be 49, so a $49 donation would be great. Thank you."" "
CNN's Chris Cuomo: Antifa Is 'A Good Cause' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46554/cnns-chris-cuomo-antifa-good-cause-ryan-saavedra,"— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 30, 2019
This is not the first time that Cuomo has defended the violent far-left group; he also did so in August 2018.
""Two wrongs and what is right,"" said last year. ""It's been one year since Heather Heyer was killed for standing up to hate, and our thoughts still go to her family."" ""Peppered in the crowd were members of Antifa, or anti-fascists,"" Cuomo continued. ""They covered their faces, confronted police and berated journalists and that was wrong. Now, you've been hearing it. There's a lot of what-aboutism and spin going on. And it's kind of sickening to me. So, let's all agree on some common understandings. A protester uses their voice, song, slang, slurs, there's a huge range, but it is talk."" ""But I argue to you tonight, all punches are not equal morally. In the eyes of the law, yes,"" Cuomo said. ""But in the eyes of good and evil, here's the argument: if you're a punk that comes to start trouble in a mask and hurt people, you're not about any virtuous cause. You're just somebody who's going to be held to the standard of doing something wrong."" ""But when someone comes to call out bigots and it gets hot, even physical, are they equally wrong as the bigot they are fighting? I argue, no. Fighting against hate matters,"" Cuomo continued. ""Now, how you fight matters too. There's no question about that. But drawing a moral equivalency between those espousing hate and those fighting it because they both resort to violence emboldens hate, legitimizes hateful belief and elevates what should be stamped out."" ""But fighting hate is right. And in a clash between hate and those who oppose it, those who oppose it are on the side of right. Think about: civil rights activist, were they the same morally as the bigots, as the racist with whom they exchanged blows,"" Cuomo stated. ""Are people who go to war against an evil regime on the same moral ground as those they seek to stop from oppressing the weak?"" ""That's why people who show up to fight against bigots are not to be judged the same as the bigots, even if they do resort to the same petty violence. The law will take care of that,"" Cuomo concluded. ""How you disagree matters. We should be our best. But I am arguing that Trump was wrong to create a moral equivalency between bigots and those who oppose them, making them equal wrongs."" "
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: U.S. Navy To Military Pilots: Report Sightings Of Possible UFOs | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46646/close-encounters-us-navy-military-pilots-report-hank-berrien,"CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: U.S. Navy To Military Pilots: Report Sightings Of Possible UFOs Photo by Elizaveta Becker/ullstein bild via Getty Images May 1, 2019 views
According to a U.S. Navy spokesman, military pilots who encounter unidentified aircraft are now being encouraged to report the incidents to military authorities. Joseph Gradisher, a spokesperson for Vice Admiral Matthew Kohler, the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, told NBC News MACH , “There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years,” adding that Navy and the Air Force ""take these reports very seriously and investigate each and every report.”
The Navy issued a statement to Politico , asserting, “There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years. For safety and security concerns, the Navy and the [U.S. Air Force] takes these reports very seriously and investigates each and every report. As part of this effort, the Navy is updating and formalizing the process by which reports of any such suspected incursions can be made to the cognizant authorities. A new message to the fleet that will detail the steps for reporting is in draft.""
Chris Mellon, a former Pentagon intelligence official and ex-staffer on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Politico that the new attitude would constitute a “sea change,” adding, “Right now, we have situation in which UFOs and UAPs are treated as anomalies to be ignored rather than anomalies to be explored. We have systems that exclude that information and dump it … in a lot of cases [military personnel] don’t know what to do with that information — like satellite data or a radar that sees something going Mach 3. They will dump [the data] because that is not a traditional aircraft or missile.”
Luis Elizondo, the former chief of the Advanced Aviation Identification Program, which existed from 2007-2012, pointed out, “If you are in a busy airport and see something you are supposed to say something. With our own military members it is kind of the opposite: 'If you do see something, don't say something.'”
Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, explained that there have been practical reasons for reporting unidentified aircraft, saying, “The government has been interested in this since the 1940s, and always for the same reason: they want to know if these are enemy aircraft. That’s still the case here. There’s always going to be a group of people that leaps to the more interesting conclusion. But 90 percent of these sightings turn out to be a laundry list of things like birds, balloons or other aircraft.”
Recent incidents may have provoked the Navy’s change in attitude; in November 2018 a female pilot reported seeing bright lights near her as she flew from Montreal to London. When she inquired whether there were military exercises in the area, air traffic control said there were not. NBC News reported she stated, ""It came up on our left hand side and rapidly veered north,"" adding that it was moving ""so fast."" A second pilot, flying a Virgin Airlines flight, also reported seeing the object, saying, ""Two bright lights over at 11 o'clock seemed to bank over to the right and then fly away.”
The incident prompted an investigation by the Irish Aviation Authority."
2020 May Not Be The Year Democrats Take Back The Senate | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46651/2020-may-not-be-year-democrats-take-back-senate-ashe-schow,"2020 May Not Be The Year Democrats Take Back The Senate Hill Street Studios May 1, 2019 views
Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate in 2014 and haven’t given up control, even when Democrats won back the House of Representatives in 2018.
This hasn’t stopped the party from setting their sights on regaining control in 2020, but as CNN’s Chris Cillizza wrote (credit when someone does something right), two recent developments have made 2020 look like a more difficult prospect.
For starters, failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D) said she would not seek a U.S. Senate seat next year. As Cillizza notes, “Abrams was Democrats' clear first choice to take on [Republican Sen. David] Perdue, a freshman senator sitting in an increasingly competitive state.” The other potential Democrats who could step up to the challenge would not “bring her name ID, fundraising capability and star power,” Cillizza observed.
Georgia, until the early 2000s, had mostly Democratic senators. On presidential election years, however, the state is more reliably red. Georgia has not voted for a Democrat for president since Bill Clinton in 1992. Democrats already were at a disadvantage with a senate vote during a presidential year, but without someone on the ticket with name recognition like Abrams, their chances are even slimmer. Of course, Perdue could always do or say something monumentally stupid, but Democrats can’t bank on that.
The other disappointment for Democrats came from Iowa. State Rep. Cindy Axne followed the Democrat governor’s lead and declined to enter the senate race against incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst (R).
As Cillizza reported, Senate Democrats tried to recruit Axne to run after Gov. Tom Vilsack declined. “With Axne out, it's unclear who Democrats will turn to as they seek to upend Ernst,” he wrote.
The CNN editor mentioned Alabama, Arizona, and Colorado as other battleground states for Democrats. So long as Roy Moore (R) doesn’t get the nomination again in Alabama, Sen. Doug Jones (D) will have difficulty holding onto his seat. Sen. Cory Gardner may struggle in Colorado, but he was able to win in 2014 despite a Democrat incumbent and constant claims of sexism. Still, that wasn’t a presidential election, and the Centennial State hasn’t voted for a Republican for president since George W. Bush in 2004.
As for Arizona, it might be a toss-up. The state is considered reliably red, but Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, won last year and hasn’t legislated that differently than the Republican senators before her in the state.
Democrats need to win a net three seats to regain control in 2020 if President Donald Trump loses re-election. They will need a net four seats if Trump wins, Cillizza reported.
After Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and Iowa, Democrats would need to make a run for Kansas, Kentucky (good luck taking out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) and North Carolina to have a chance to regain control. As Cillizza reported, these pickups are “more remote – but not impossible.”
It all depends on the presidential election, really. Who’s at the top of the ticket will end up deciding the makeup of the senate. Republicans couldn’t take back the senate during President Barack Obama’s elections, but were able to during an off-year."
WESTROP: Research Has Uncovered $41 Million Of Taxpayer-Subsidized Islamism | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Sam Westrop,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46647/westrop-research-has-uncovered-41-million-taxpayer-sam-westrop,"WESTROP: Research Has Uncovered $41 Million Of Taxpayer-Subsidized Islamism Oleg Golovnev / EyeEm via Getty Images May 1, 2019 views
Research by the Middle East Forum has found that since 2007, federal government agencies have handed over $47 million to 61 Islamic institutions in the forms of 411 various grants and contracts.
On the face of it, this need not be of any particular concern. The government has long relied on contractors and charities from all faiths to implement its programs. Alarmingly, however, radical Islamic movements completely control 36% of the Muslim institutions that received government monies, taking 42% of the total funding. A further 36% of the grantees, which received 44% of the funds, operate under varying degrees of radical influence. A mere 14% of identified government funds given to Muslim organizations were directed toward institutions free of Islamist influence.
In total, if the government’s own data is accurate, at least $41 million was given to institutions either controlled or under the partial influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-e-Islami (a violent South Asian Islamist movement), Salafis, Deobandis (a hardline South Asian Sunni sect from which the Taliban was created) and the Iranian regime, among others.
Some of the largest amounts involve grants to aid charities. Long favored by Islamist movements as a means to spread ideology through welfare, charities also provide extremists with plentiful funding and the occasional accompanying credibility of government partnership.
The Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), for instance, received over $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster relief work in 2016 and 2018. ICNA is the U.S. representative body of Jamaat-e-Islami, which was recently banned by the Indian government in the Kashmir region because of its involvement with ""extremism and militancy in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere.""
ICNA and its subsidiaries openly partner with official Jamaat-e-Islami organizations in Pakistan, such as Al Khidmat Foundation, a funder of the designated terrorist organization Hamas. The Investigative Project on Terrorism has noted that Al Khidmat’s President, Naeem ur-Rehman, is closely involved with the designated Kashmiri jihadist group Hizbul Mujahideen.
In addition, ICNA runs an international aid branch, Helping Hand for Relief and Development, which has openly partnered in Pakistan with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a designated terrorist organization responsible for the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks.
Another Jamaat-e-Islami charity, Muslim Aid, received over $1.5 million from the American taxpayer in 2013 for a ""Food for Peace"" program. Muslim Aid is based in Britain, but operates a fundraising office in America.
In 2010, three years before the U.S. government handed over taxpayers’ money to the charity, Muslim Aid admitted to funding organizations controlled by the terrorist organization Hamas, including a grant of over $18,000 to the al-Ihsan Charitable Society — which is designated by the U.S. government as a sponsor of terrorism. In 2013, the same year as the U.S. government grant, a war crimes tribunal sentenced to death in absentia the founder of Muslim Aid, Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, for his part in the mass murder of teachers and intellectuals by Jamaat-e-Islami killing squads during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War.
Other Islamist strains, meanwhile, also found generous taxpayer backing. For example, $115,000 of taxpayers’ money was handed to a Bin Laden-linked Sudanese charity, the Islamic Relief Agency, a decade after the U.S. Treasury designated it as a terrorist-financing organization. Lawmakers are now investigating the decision to award the grant.
Three organizations named by the United Arab Emirates as terrorist groups were approved for U.S. government funding. Islamic Relief, a global charitable franchise established by supporters and officials of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, received over $1.6 million, despite its extensively documented links to Hamas and other designated terrorist organizations.
These enormous sums to aid charities somewhat inflate the total figures. But the hundreds of remaining grants are not insignificant. Branches of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Muslim American Society (MAS) collectively received over $310,000 from the taxpayer. Officials of both organizations (as well as CAIR itself) were named by federal prosecutors as unindicted coconspirators during the 2008 Holy Land Foundation terror financing trial.
Funds for CAIR and MAS were provided under a diverse range of government initiatives: Counter-terrorism security measures, disaster relief, chaplaincy programs, and school lunch vouchers. In fact, if large grants to aid charities are disregarded, chaplaincy contracts and schooling subsidies make up a significant proportion of government funding.
The Islamic Institute of Knowledge (IIOK), for example, is a Shiite institution in Dearborn, Michigan, which has received over $851,000 under the National School Lunch Program. IIOK does not hide its ideological links. It was established by Abdel Latif Berry, a disciple of Lebanon’s late Ayatollah Fadlallah, who served as a ""spiritual advisor"" to the designated terrorist group Hezbollah. In 2009, IIOK held a commemoration for Ayatollah Khomeini — the architect of the Iranian Revolution and its theocratic regime — at which Latif Berry spoke and praised Khomeini effusively.
Other lunch money recipients include over $38,000 to the Tarbiyah Islamic School of Delaware. In 2015 the Muslim journalist Asra Nomani revealed that the school was established by radical adherents of the hardline Deobandi sect. And another $31,000 was given to the Islamic Center of Passaic County, whose imam, Mohammad Qatanani, is accused by his mosque’s same governmental patrons of involvement with the terror group Hamas.
In other instances, the federal government has simply been in business with extremists. Between 2008 and 2010, the General Services Administration paid Dar Al Hijrah, a prominent mosque in Virginia, over half a million dollars for the lease of office buildings. A number of government agencies, however, have long considered Dar Al Hijrah a key terror hub. Its current imam, Shaker Elsayed, is an avowed supporter of Hamas.
The list goes on. In some instances, the data (which was gleaned from the government’s USASpending website) counts totals for some programs far below the amounts cited in a number of media reports, and so it is possible that the government’s data is incomplete, and that the real amounts are even larger. In addition, the figures do not include direct grants to Islamist institutions from state governments, a common occurrence in some parts of the country.
There are a number of possible, worrying conclusions to be drawn from these collated figures. First, it seems clear that government officials do not consider the ideological agendas of organizations to which they hand out taxpayers’ money, or the effect that such subsidies may have on ideologically fragmented Muslim communities. Second, as the generous grants to Islamic Relief and the ICNA network show, established funding or partnership with terrorist and extremist organizations has not precluded Islamist organizations from government patronage.
Third, funding to Islamist organizations has not been reduced under the Trump administration. In fact, it has increased: In 2018, 40 grants and contracts worth over $13 million were distributed to organizations controlled or influenced by radical movements; two years earlier, under Obama, only 35 grants worth a mere $3.6 million were handed out to radical-linked institutions.
Distressingly, one could be forgiven for glancing at these figures and concluding that Islamists control far too high a proportion of high-profile American Muslim institutions. Or, these figures could show that Islamists have become the preferred partner of government simply because Islamists are better organized, more savvy about the processes for acquiring government funding, and — in their perpetual efforts to acquire legitimacy — simply more motivated.
A bill currently before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, H. Res 160 , seeks to end government funding to American proxies for the Jamaat-e-Islami Islamist network — including the Islamic Circle of North America and its subsidiary organizations. That is a welcome step, but there are many more Islamist strains to be tackled, and many more grants and contracts to be canceled.
In the fight against extremism and terror, the government could strike an immediate, enormous blow by urgently reviewing all this funding — curtailing taxpayers' subsidization of international Islamist movements and identifying other moderate Muslim organizations with which to partner instead.

Hirono, who is known for making absurd statements, was one of the key Democratic lawmakers who turned the Supreme Court confirmation proceedings for Brett Kavanaugh into a circus.
During a September 2018 interview on CNN, anchor Jake Tapper asked Hirono: ""Doesn’t Kavanaugh have the same presumption of innocence as anyone else in America?""
Hirono responded by saying she doubted Kavanaugh was credible due to his conservative leanings.
""I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases,"" Hirono responded. ""When I say that he is very outcome driven, he has an ideological agenda, very outcome driven, and I could sit here and talk to you about some of the cases that exemplifies his ability to be fair."""
FLEISHER: The Clash Of American Liberal Jewry And Israeli Nationalism | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Yishai Fleisher,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46595/fleisher-clash-american-liberal-jewry-and-israeli-yishai-fleisher,"May 5, 2019 , 7:00 am
The recent landslide election of Benjamin Netanyahu and the ascendancy of the Israeli Right has deepened the rift between Israeli and American Jews — the latter of whom disproportionately identify with the political Left.
Days after the Israeli election, nine leading American liberal Jewish groups sent a letter to the American president they hate so much and worked so hard to prevent his becoming a president. In it, they urged Trump to preserve the “two-state solution” in the face of a pledge by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the so-called “West Bank” territory, also known as Judea and Samaria.
Four ostensibly pro-Israel Jewish Democrats — Reps. Eliot Engel and Nita Lowey of New York, Ted Deutch of Florida, and Brad Schneider of Illinois — released a similar letter warning Israel not to annex parts of Judea and Samaria because, yet again, such a move would endanger the two-state solution.
And in an article days after Netanyahu’s election, Daniel Sokatch, the CEO of the ultra-liberal umbrella group New Israel Fund, wrote:
A move to annex the occupied territories would corrode Israel’s international standing, rupture its relationship with the American Jewish community and likely extinguish any remaining chance for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.
We have reached a point where American Jews are calling upon the American president to override the will of the Israeli people on matters of Israeli national security.
The Chutzpah of the American Jewish Liberal Leadership
Such is the clamor of American liberal Jewish leadership to preserve the failed two-state solution — which calls on Israel to cut 20 percent of its New Jersey-sized landmass and give over the most storied stretches of the Promised Land to the corrupt crooks of the PLO and the terrorist group Hamas.
Yet the last Israeli election proved, and many polls reflect, that Israelis — as opposed to the American Jewish liberal leadership — are done with the two-state solution. In the aftermath of the 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the immediate takeover by jihadist group Hamas which led to three full-out wars and innumerable rockets being fired on Israel, most Israelis came to the conclusion that the “land for peace” policy is a failure. Israelis have now voiced that opinion democratically.
Much to the frustration of the American liberal Jewish establishment, the Israeli sovereignty movement, to which Netanyahu alluded and which calls for Israel to control the ancestral Jewish homeland of Judea and Samaria, is gaining momentum. And in Washington, the Trump Administration is the first presidential administration not to be reflexively pro-two-state solution. Indeed, rumors from the Beltway whisper that the Trump Administration’s much-ballyhooed “Deal of the Century” does not call for Palestinian statehood at all.
Red State Jews and Blue State Jews
Being an Israeli Jew with conservative nationalistic leanings, I am often asked, especially when visiting the American heartland, why is it that American Jews are predominantly liberal? American gentiles are downright mystified as to why any Jewish person would be against what they perceive to be a natural link between conservatism and Judeo-Christian biblical values — values which, one would think, would be commonly held by Jews. Many gentiles also want to know why liberal Jews are anti-Trump and pro-Palestinian — a staunchly pro-Israel president and a pseudo-entity that many Americans perceive to be the enemy of the Jewish state.
In his 2018 New York Times article entitled, “How America’s Jews Learned to Be Liberal,” Steven Weisman quotes an American Jewish Committee poll which found that “Israelis approve of President Trump’s handling of United States-Israeli relations by 77 percent… But only 34 percent of American Jews feel the same way.”
Weisman concludes: “ Israelis are red-state Jews. American Jews are blue-state — politically liberal in their outlook. “
To be sure, there are many American Jews on the political Right who agree with Israeli nationalist policies, and there are Israelis on the political Left who are much closer to the American Jewish liberal consensus. However, the broad trends of American Jewish liberalism and Israeli Jewish nationalism are apparent.
Why do American Jews Tend to be Liberal?
Throughout the centuries, from Ukraine to England, and from Yemen to Syria, Jews lived in countries prone to anti-Semitic violence. Jews were often victims of intolerance, xenophobia, and exclusion. Yet they were able to thrive in these places by succeeding financially, excelling educationally, and by gaining social status.
In an effort to mitigate the dangers of the host country, Jews also employed a sophisticated defense mechanism — the teachings of liberalism. At the university, in the courts, in the banks, and in their dealings with local authority, Jews sent out a message of tolerance, diversity, and inclusion in hope that the host society would internalize those values and that the Jews would benefit and be spared. This strategy worked until catastrophes such as the English Edict of Expulsion of 1290, the Spanish Expulsion of 1492, and the rise of Nazism in Germany came along.
Anti-Trumpism as Self-Preservation
Today’s American Jews may not feel themselves to be living in a hostile country — and America is indeed a great country that has allowed Jews to thrive and live in peace. Still, the U.S. is a majority-gentile host country and not a Jewish state. Even with a high rate of public success and participation, Jews living in America feel a 2,000-year-old subconscious impulse to broadcast the values of tolerance and multiculturalism in an effort to mitigate any potential ferocity on the part of the ruling host.
The anti-Trump fervor that has seized American Jewry can be readily understood in this light. The American Jewish Left sees in Trump a personification of ultra-nationalism which, their collective memory tells them, leads directly to violent anti-Semitism. While President Trump seems to be completely pro-Jewish, American liberal Jews manage to paint him in anti-Semitic colors, seeing him as the source of white nationalism and the dangerous “alt-Right.”
“Bring him down before he brings us down! Stop the growth of nationalism before it becomes full blown Nazism! Defang the potentially violent ruler using the messaging of liberalism while you still can!” These are instinctive and classical reactions of liberal diaspora Jewry.
Why Israelis Tend to be Nationalistic
In contrast, the modus operandi of Israeli Jews is not like that of the Diaspora Jews at all. The Jewish state is just that: An ethnic-national Jewish state in the ancient Land of Israel. The collective unconscious of Israelis tells them that they live in their own land, speak their ancient language, are rightful sovereigns, and are in the process of rebuilding the Third Commonwealth.
The message that is conveyed to the elected officials from the average Israeli citizen is not of liberalism at all, but is rather: “Rule in strength! Defeat the enemy! Defend our family nation-state and do not be overly-liberal to our foes! Never again!”
In this light, Israeli support of the current American president makes sense: Trump is understood to be a determined, defense-minded fellow sovereign, a strong ruler, and an ally.
Many American Jews are dumbfounded at the nearly ubiquitous Israeli approval of a man they detest so much. But from across the pond, and in the tough Middle East reality, things look quite different. Trump’s nationalism and certitude might threaten American liberal Jews, but these characteristics play well in Israel where those very characteristics are needed and admired.
Immigration Policy and the Wall
Another example of the difference in outlook between American and Israeli Jews can be seen in immigration policy. American liberal Jews perceive themselves to be an ethnic-religious minority in America and descendants of recent immigrants. They tend to identify with potential incomers — and therefore call for a liberal immigration policy. Unsurprisingly then, Trump’s tough stance on Muslim and Mexican immigration is perceived as a direct attack on American liberal Jews and their values.
The Israeli Jew, however, sees it quite differently. For many Israelis, African or Arab migration to Israel is seen as a threat — a concerted effort to chip away at the Jewish state from the inside and endanger Israel’s stability. In Israel, Trump’s wall policy is understood to be a normal course of action for a sovereign nation surrounded by hostile countries. Indeed, Israel itself has put up defensive walls!
Clearly, the contrast in the reality of Israeli Jews and American Jews leads to policy prescriptions that are drastically different. The very modes of thinking about these problems are oceans apart.
For Some, Nationalism Looks Like Fascism
So if Israeli Jews are red-state Jews and American Jews are blue-state Jews, it is not surprising that they often collide with one another.
American liberal Jews tend to see the “Palestinians” as a downtrodden minority, but Israelis, in large measure, see them as part of hostile Arab Middle East majority. Similarly, the “West Bank” which the American liberal establishment continues to see as “occupied” is seen by a majority of Israelis as an integral part of our ancestral homeland. The same goes for the behavior of the Israeli army, which American liberals often see as being too forceful, while Israelis, whose children serve on the front lines, often see as being too restrained.
In turn, many Israelis discount American liberal Jewry’s policy prescriptions. Without verbalizing it, Israelis wonder whether American Jews, whose approach to statecraft is one of a powerful and vocal minority in a host country, can give useful advice to Israeli Jews who drive tanks and fly jets in defense of their own threatened yet sovereign Jewish state.
Israel’s Security is NOT a Jewish Issue
Recently, I was in Washington and sat with a Christian red-state congressman. We talked about Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria and the position of the “settlers” — Jews proudly living in the ancestral homeland and blocking a jihadist takeover — who clearly favor Israeli control of the areas in which they live. Suddenly, the congressman asked me: “OK, but what will my colleagues, the Democratic Jewish congressmen, say about this?”
I replied: “Congressman, do you ask these Democratic Jewish congressmen how to vote on issues of abortion? Of course not. So why would you ask them about Judea and Samaria? What should be done with these territories is an Israeli issue — not a Jewish issue. The American liberal congressmen don’t serve the Israeli constituency, they haven’t served in the Israeli army, and they don’t bear the burden of dealing with jihadism. They don’t own this issue.”
Indeed, when it comes to policy issues in the Jewish world, there should be a distinction between general Jewish issues and local ones. General Jewish issues might be the question of conversion, or even of religious control at the Western Wall. However, the issues of Israel foreign policy, Israel security, dealing with Palestinians, decisions on Judea and Samaria, Knesset election — these are not general Jewish issues, but rather are Israeli issues. The loud parading and weighing-in of the collective American liberal Jewish voice on strictly Israeli issues is illogical, patronizing, and shameful.
Loving Israel to Death
American Jews and Israeli Jews are two related communities living across the ocean who share DNA, familiarity, goodwill, a love of the Torah, and a love of the homeland. However, we live very different lives and have consequently developed a very different mindset.
Rather than fighting about it, the way forward is to adopt a posture of mutual respect and support where possible — but also allow for some daylight between one another when dealing with respective regional policy issues. It’s great to pipe up because it shows love and care, but on the other hand, since the American Jewish and Israeli realities and perspectives are so different, it is also good to know when to butt out.
Those American Jews who publicly defend Israel’s choices give voice to the Israeli policies in the halls of American power — and that is an important task. Yet those American liberal Jewish voices who have become detractors from Israeli policy should have less sway. They endanger the U.S.-Israel alliance and, frankly, endanger Israel’s security. They advocate for bad policy, like the misbegotten “two-state solution,” for a region they do not understand and in circumstances they do not share. They go against the will of the Israeli people and give Jewish cover to anti-Israel forces. Their mindset and behavior are that of a minority ethnic group living in a host country, and not like that of Israel — a sovereign state, an American ally, and a burgeoning regional power dealing with the harsh everyday reality of the Middle East.

BREAKING: Covington Catholic Student Nick Sandmann Files Major Lawsuit Against NBC and MSNBC | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46662/breaking-covington-catholic-student-nick-sandmann-hank-berrien,"Covington Catholic Student Nick Sandmann Files Major Lawsuit Against NBC and MSNBC Screenshot: Fox News Video May 1, 2019 views
On Wednesday, attorneys for Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student who was targeted by the media after his encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips at the Lincoln Memorial on January 18, announced they are filing a $275 million lawsuit against NBCUniversal, alleging “NBCUniversal created a false narrative by portraying the ‘confrontation’ as a ‘hate crime’ committed by Nicholas.""
According to The Washington Times , the suit states that NBCUniversal was motivated by its “anti-Trump agenda,” adding that Sandmann was “an easy target for NBCUniversal to advance its anti-Trump agenda because he was a 16-year-old white, Catholic student who had attended the Right to Life March that day and was wearing a MAGA cap at the time of the incident which he had purchased earlier in the day as a souvenir.” The suit also states that NBCUniversal, by means of NBC and MSNBC, “unleashed its vast corporate wealth, influence, and power against Nicholas to falsely attack him despite the fact that at the time, he was a 16-year-old high school student.”
The lawsuit asserts, “Headlines run online by NBCUniversal outlets about the incident included, 'Nathan Phillips, Native American man harassed by high schoolers, tells his story,' and 'Video of teens taunting man at Indigenous Peoples March sparks outrage.'”
Sandmann’s attorneys have already filed a $250 million suit against the Washington Post and another suit against CNN for $275 million. As The Daily Wire reported in mid-February, Sandmann's lawyers warned when they sued The Washington Post that more suits would be forthcoming. They said in a statement :
Today, Lin Wood and Todd McMurtry filed their first lawsuit on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann against The Washington Post. The lawsuit filed is included below. The suit seeks $250 million in both compensatory and punitive damages. Lin and Todd will continue to bring wrongdoers before the court to seek damages in compensation for the harm so many have done to the Sandmann family. This is only the beginning.
The lawsuit against the Post stated: ""In targeting and bullying Nicholas by falsely accusing him of instigating the January 18 incident, the Post conveyed that Nicholas engaged in acts of racism by “swarming” Phillips, “blocking” his exit away from the students, and otherwise engaging in racist misconduct. The Post ignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump (‘the President’) by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters of the President.""
The Daily Wire reported in mid-March that Sandmann’s attorneys announced they were suing CNN, with one saying, “Well, what CNN’s tagline is facts first. And what we believe their reporting was in this circumstance was lies first; cover up second, and facts not yet determined by that organization. So the difference between this lawsuit and the other lawsuit that we have filed is that CNN is a very significant media organization with a much broader reach than say The Washington Post. It has a Twitter followers of 41 million people. It published four videos. Nine online articles that were tweeted out. So that’s millions and millions and millions of repetitions of the lies and falsehoods that CNN spread."" "
"Teacher Fired After Kicking 5-Year-Old Girl, May Face Legal Action | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46654/teacher-fired-after-kicking-5-year-old-girl-may-hank-berrien,"Teacher Fired After Kicking 5-Year-Old Girl, May Face Legal Action Photo by Johner Images/GettyImages May 1, 2019 views
On February 21, a teacher at an elementary school in Kansas first yanked a five-year-old girl out of a bookshelf, waited until a staff member turned away, then kicked the little girl in the back. After the school was notified of the incident, the teacher was immediately placed on leave; she was fired from the school on March 25. She now may be facing legal action, reports The New York Daily News . After the teacher was placed on leave, spokesman David Smith told the Kansas City Star, “There was no question that we were going to do everything we could immediately to terminate that teacher and to look after that child. No child should have to experience that. It’s a horrible situation. We feel terrible about it and that person no longer works for us.”
The teacher, Crystal Smith, was in her first year of teaching. As KCTV 5 reported, when the child’s mother picked her up from Bluejacket Flint Elementary school in Shawnee, Kansas, on April 21, her daughter told her, ""I don’t like my teacher. She’s really mean. She hit me on my arm."" Seeing a red mark on her arm, the mother unsuccessfully attempted to contact the school principal, then returned to the school where she discovered her daughter had informed another teacher of the incident but nothing eventuated from that.
A recording the mother made of herself with her daughter’s teachers and school district staff shows the daughter’s IEP teacher admitting, “[The 5-year-old] did mention to me, ‘My teacher, like hit me’. I asked her what happened and she said she touched her on her arm but I wasn’t there so I’m not sure what happened.” Smith is heard saying:
So, I’m not surprised she has some marks on her. She was crawling in the bookshelf. She has a red spot on her arm. And I’m not surprised because she shoved herself into that bookshelf…I mean, she kicked me a couple of times. She was reaching over into the bookshelf pulling books out and there were those metal, metal book divider things … I said don’t we can’t do that. So I put myself kind of standing around her so that if she does throw something she wouldn’t break something …
The mother smelled a rat, and discovered video existed of the incident. Waiting for a week for the school to show it to her, the mother was shocked when she viewed it, recalling to KCTV, “When I saw the video it was heartbreaking, because everything she said, she sat at the same table as me and just lied about everything ... she lied to me. She lied to everyone else. She was almost really convincing.”
KCTV stated, “The video shows the little girl refusing to get in line with the rest of her class. She crawls up into a bookshelf while the rest of her class leaves the library. That’s when her teacher finds her in the bookshelf, grabs her by the arm, drags her out on the ground, and when no one is looking, kicks her in the back.”
The mother commented, “I can’t really even put it into words. I hurt for my child, and I was just angry that someone could do that … I said, ‘OK, had my child not said anything to me, you were just going to go behind closed doors and speak to everyone else, and if something came up then you’d let me know?’ But had she not said anything to me it all. I may not have ever known.""
The Shawnee Mission School District issued a statement:
The Shawnee Mission School District was deeply distressed by the actions shown in the video. We take our responsibility to keep our children safe extremely seriously, and as parents and educators, we are heartbroken whenever a child is not treated with love and respect. As soon as we discovered what happened, we acted to remove the teacher from contact with students, and proceeded immediately to terminate that teacher."
READ IT: Robert Mueller's Letter To Attorney General Bill Barr | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46645/read-it-robert-muellers-letter-attorney-general-ryan-saavedra,"May 1, 2019 views
On Tuesday, Democratic politicians and journalists rushed to claim that Attorney General Bill Barr covered up crimes committed by President Donald Trump. This transpired after The Washington Post reported on a letter that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had sent Barr in March that complained about the media's coverage of his report on Russia as a result of Barr's letter to Congress.
As documented by The New York Times, here is the letter — dated March 27 and made available Wednesday by both Congress and the Department of Justice — that Mueller sent to Barr:
I previously sent you a letter dated March 25, 2019, that enclosed the introduction and executive summary for each volume of the Special Counsel’s report marked with redactions to remove any information that potentially could be protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure that concerned declination decisions; or that related to a charged case. We also had marked an additional two sentences for review and have now confirmed that these sentences can be released publicly.
Accordingly, the enclosed documents are in a form that can be released to the public consistent with legal requirements and Department policies. I am requesting that you provide these materials to Congress and authorize their public release at this time.
As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and reiterated to the Department early in the afternoon of March 24, the introductions and executive summaries of our two-volume report accurately summarize this Office’s work and conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is new public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations. See Department of Justice, Press Release (May 17, 2017).
While we understand that the Department is reviewing the full report to determine what is appropriate for public release — a process that our Office is working with you to complete — that process need not delay release of the enclosed materials. Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation. It would also accord with the standard for public release of notifications to Congress cited in your letter. See 28 C.F.R. 609(c) (“the Attorney General may determine that public release” of congressional notifications “would be in the public interest.”).
Sincerely yours,
Special Counsel
""[Mueller] was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report,"" Barr told the committee. ""He felt what was inaccurate was the press coverage and what they were interpreting the March 24th letter to say. He wanted to put out the full executive summaries that are incorporated in the report…and those summaries when he sent them actually required later more redaction because of the intelligence community.""

Leftists In Seattle Accuse Jews Of ‘Weaponizing’ Anti-Semitism To Target Blacks And Muslims | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46664/leftists-seattle-accuse-jews-weaponizing-anti-josh-hammer,"Leftists In Seattle Accuse Jews Of ‘Weaponizing’ Anti-Semitism To Target Blacks And Muslims Carl Larson / Contributor via Getty Images May 1, 2019 views
As Seattle-based KTTH 770 AM radio host and Daily Wire contributor Jason Rantz reports , left-wing activists in Seattle are planning a transparently anti-Semitic event that the chairwoman of the Washington State Democratic Party nonetheless deems "" important "":
The Thursday night panel discussion is titled ""Intersectional Dialogue on Weaponizing Charges of Antisemitism,"" and comes as Progressive activists defend Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s (D-MN) widely condemned anti-Semitic remarks.
It is an intersectional view that a Muslim woman of color, such as Omar, cannot be anti-Semitic because, after all, Jews are just rich, powerful, white people to them. It’s, indeed, an anti-Semitic argument.
The event description on Facebook says they will ask: ""How are charges of antisemitism being weaponized to specifically target powerful Black and Muslim leaders, force Jews and Jewish allies into false dichotomies, divert attention from the worldwide rise of white nationalism and state violence, and divide progressive movement-building?""
In other words, evil Jews like myself aren’t about fighting anti-Jew hatred — we’re the actual bigots purposefully using anti-Semitism as a cover to attack ""powerful Black and Muslim leaders."" The evil Jew at work, right?
Rantz also notes how the two Jews on the panel, Rabbi David Basior of the Kadima Reconstructionist Community and moderator Maya Berkowitz, are both open ""anti-Zionists"" who support the facially anti-Semitic ""Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions"" eliminationist campaign against the world's only Jewish state. This is a fairly frequent tactic used by anti-Semites to cover for their anti-Semitism; for example, every time the egregiously misnamed hate group ""Students for Justice in Palestine"" cohosts an on-campus event with the self-hating Jews of ""Jewish Voice for Peace,"" they engage in this. ""I cannot be anti-Semitic if I have a Jew on the panel,"" a benighted naif might say.
As Rantz notes, co-sponsors for the Jew-hating event include the American Muslim Empowerment Network, Seattle King County NAACP, Washington State’s ACLU, OneAmerica, and Womxn’s March Seattle.
As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro has explained , the theory of ""intersectionality"" — which serves as the over-arching theme for the Seattle Jew-hating event —is inherently anti-Semitic:
How has the Democratic Party morphed into the party of anti-Semitism? By embracing the philosophy of intersectionality on the one hand, and by embracing the myth that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are completely separable on the other. The former provides the emotional impetus for nodding at Jew-hatred; the latter provides the intellectual framework for doing so.
The philosophy of intersectionality has othered Jews from the intersectional coalition . Because intersectionality is built on the premise that the prevailing Western system of thought has victimized various groups, and that those groups must band together in order to destroy that system, those who have thrived under the West must be excised from the intersectional agglomeration – being, as they are, representatives of the fact that Western thought is not, in fact, rooted in evil. The Jews are simply too financially, educationally, and politically successful to be seen as anything other than members of the power structure.
As The Daily Wire has reported at great length, anti-Semitism in the United States is on the rise. But many leftists do not seem to be particularly bothered by the harrowing trend."
Barr Bombshell: Mueller Told Us He Was NOT Saying That Trump Would Be Charged If He Was Not President | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46641/barr-bombshell-mueller-told-us-he-was-not-saying-ryan-saavedra,"May 1, 2019 views
Attorney General William Barr revealed during a hearing on Wednesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had repeatedly told Barr that he was not indicating that he would have charged President Donald Trump if Trump were not a sitting president.
""Special counsel Mueller stated three times to us in that meeting in response to our questioning that he emphatically was not saying that but for the OLC [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion, he would have found obstruction,"" Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""He said that in the future, the facts of the case against a president might be such that a special counsel would recommend abandoning the OLC opinion, but this is not such a case.""
The point made by Barr was significant, as some Democratic politicians and journalists had tried to push the narrative that Mueller would have charged Trump but could not do so because Trump is a sitting president.

Barr also addressed the latest narrative pushed by the media and Democratic Party that Barr mischaracterized Mueller’s Russia report in his March letter to Congress.
""[Mueller] was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report,"" Barr told the committee. ""I told Bob that I was not interested in putting out summaries, and I wasn’t going to put out the report piecemeal. I wanted to get the whole report out. And I thought summaries by very definition, regardless of who prepared them, would be under-inclusive and we’d have sort of a series of different debates and public discord over each tranche of information that went out, and I wanted to get everything out at once.""

""The Deputy Attorney General and I, therefore, conducted a careful review of the report, looking at the facts found and the legal theories set forth by the Special Counsel,"" Barr continued . ""Although we disagreed with some of the Special Counsel’s legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we accepted the Special Counsel’s legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the Special Counsel in reaching our conclusion.""
""We concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,"" Barr added. ""The responsibility of the Department of Justice, when it comes to law enforcement, is to determine whether crimes have been committed and to prosecute those crimes under the principles of federal prosecution.""
""With the completion of the Special Counsel’s investigation and the resulting prosecutorial decisions, the Department’s work on this matter is at its end aside from completing the cases that have been referred to other offices,"" Barr concluded. ""From here on, the exercise of responding and reacting to the report is a matter for the American people and the political process. As I am sure you agree, it is vitally important for the Department of Justice to stand apart from the political process and not to become an adjunct of it.""

Parents And Staffers Vote To Keep Michael Jackson’s Name On Elementary School Auditorium | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Jeffrey Cawood,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46665/parents-and-staffers-vote-keep-michael-jacksons-jeffrey-cawood,"Parents And Staffers Vote To Keep Michael Jackson’s Name On Elementary School Auditorium ‘King of Pop’ attended Gardner Street Elementary School in Los Angeles as a 6th-grader.

A Los Angeles elementary school formerly attended by Michael Jackson will keep his name on its auditorium in tribute to the late global entertainment icon, district officials announced over the weekend.
The issue was put to a vote following the recent release of a controversial film accusing Jackson of molesting children decades ago. Parents of students attending Gardner Street Elementary School in Hollywood, along with staff members, decided that Jackson’s name shall remain on the facility. Balloting ended last Thursday. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) told The Daily Wire earlier this week that it expects to release the final vote tally but did not know when the information would be available.
“A majority of those who participated voted to maintain the current name as the Michael Jackson Auditorium,” LAUSD said in a statement. “School leaders, teachers and support staff will focus on preventing any further disruptions to the school and further impact to classroom instruction, student learning and safety.” Parents and staff at Gardner Street Elementary School in Hollywood have voted to keep Michael Jackson's name on the campus auditorium, in wake of the March broadcast of the documentary “Leaving Neverland."" https://t.co/oUG79vp8Ol — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) April 27, 2019
The Los Angeles Times reports : The vote took place in the wake of the March broadcast of the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which aired on HBO and portrays Jackson through the eyes of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who allege Jackson sexually abused them when they were children. Jackson was never charged with abusing either. The broadcast was deeply unsettling for many at Gardner, and a group of parents told Principal Karen Hollis that they wanted Jackson’s name taken down. There also were parents who felt otherwise, noting that Jackson was never convicted of wrongdoing and cannot defend himself. Jackson died in 2009 from an accidental drug overdose. A spokesman for Jackson’s estate, which represents the interests of Jackson’s children, had urged the school community to respect the right of Jackson – like anyone else – to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
Jackson was briefly enrolled at the school in 1969 when he was a sixth-grader after his family relocated to Southern California from Gary, Indiana. He did not return to public school after leaving Gardner. At the time, he was the youngest member of the Jackson 5 — a singing group comprised of Michael and four of his brothers. Their first hit, “I Want You Back,” was released in October 1969 and reached number one on the charts in January 1970.
According to The Times, the auditorium was named in Jackson’s honor in 1989, “a point at which Jackson’s public reputation was still essentially intact.” He was present when the school choir sang “We Are the World,” which was co-written by Jackson, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. After vote, Michael Jackson's name will remain on the auditorium at Gardner Street Elementary School https://t.co/pCX0z17Ybr
Since then, the pop star has been accused of sexually abusing children but has never been found guilty of those alleged crimes.
As previously reported by the L.A. Times: Some parents complained about the name on the auditorium in 1993 – just four years after the dedication – when word leaked that Jackson was under investigation for his conduct with a boy. Jackson settled out of court with his accuser and prosecutors filed no charges. In 2003, district officials ordered that Jackson’s name be covered with plywood – but not removed – after Jackson was arrested on charges of sexually abusing another boy. He was found not guilty following a criminal trial in 2005. In 2010, a year after Jackson’s death from an accidental drug overdose at age 50, school district officials ordered the covering removed – amid much celebration from Jackson fans.
Both of “Leaving Neverland’s” accusers defended Jackson against molestation claims when the pop star was alive but filed lawsuits against his estate asking for millions after his death. According to a lawyer representing Safechuck, now 41, and Robson, 36, those cases were dismissed but are currently under appeal. In March, a British journalist reportedly discovered a significant discrepancy in a key part of the film calling its credibility into question.
Robson said in an interview with the L.A. Times that he had attended Gardner elementary in the early 1990s while his alleged abuse was still taking place.
“I commend Gardner Street School for allowing the parents to decide whether or not Michael Jackson’s name should remain on the auditorium,” Robson told the Times before the votes had been tallied.

"Shapiro At 'National Review': The New York Times' Anti-Semitism Is Shocking, But Not Surprising | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ben Shapiro,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46605/shapiro-national-review-new-york-times-anti-ben-shapiro,"views
This week, the New York Times got itself into hot water for printing a blatantly Jew-hating cartoon in its international edition. The cartoon depicted Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an elongated dachshund, a Star of David hanging around his neck, leading a fat, blind, yarmulke-wearing Donald Trump through the streets. The implication: The nefarious, animalistic Jew is in control of the Jew-perverted president of the United States.
The image is nothing new. In 1940, the Lustige Blatter , a weekly German humor magazine, printed an image of a tall, ugly, bearded Hasidic Jew taking a tiny Winston Churchill by the hand and leading him across the surface of the globe.
So, what would tempt the New York Times to print an illustration directly from the mind of Julius Streicher? The fact is that the Times , like many of today’s mainstream media outlets, has been completely and utterly willing to cover for and, indeed, engage in anti-Semitism, so long as it is disguised as anti-Zionism. Undoubtedly, the editors at the Times believed that the cartoon was merely a criticism of Israel, not a criticism of Jews. That excuse found its logical apotheosis in a 2014 German regional-court ruling that characterized a firebombing of a synagogue as merely a protest against Israel, rather than act of anti-Semitism.

Former CIA Officer Pleads Guilty To Conspiring To Spy For China | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Kassy Dillon,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46673/former-cia-officer-pleads-guilty-conspiring-spy-kassy-dillon,"Former CIA Officer Pleads Guilty To Conspiring To Spy For China ""I conspired to gather and send secret information to the People's Republic of China."" ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images May 2, 2019 views On Wednesday, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer admitted to conspiring to spy for the Chinese government in federal court. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 54, was an officer in the CIA from 1994 to 2007, reports The New York Times . Lee is a naturalized American citizen and U.S. Army veteran who grew up in Hawaii but later moved to Hong Kong after leaving the CIA.​ Between 2010 and 2012, the CIA’s informant network in China collapsed, which some speculate may have been a result of Lee providing names to the Chinese. According to BBC , 20 informants were killed or jailed during that time. The FBI reportedly found Lee's notebooks that had the names of CIA assets, operational meeting locations, phone numbers, and information about covert facilities.​ While in Hong Kong, Lee started a cigarette import business with a man that had ties to Hong Kong intelligence. Lee later met with Chinese intelligence and reported the meeting to the CIA without mentioning he had been offered $100,000 to disclose sensitive information. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were deposited into Lee’s bank between 2010 and 2013, according to the BBC. Lee moved back to the U.S. in 2012 after the CIA made him a fake offer to return to the CIA, The Washington Post reports. During that same year, Lee failed to disclose all the details of his meetings with Chinese intelligence while being interviewed by the CIA.​ Lee’s formal charge is conspiracy to deliver national defense information to aid a foreign government. According to John Brown, the FBI’s assistant director for counterintelligence, Lee put the country's national security at risk.​ ""By knowingly aiding a foreign government, Mr. Lee put our country’s national security at serious risk and also threatened the safety and personal security of innocent people, namely his former intelligence colleagues,"" Brown said. ""I conspired to gather and send secret information to the PRC (People's Republic of China),"" Lee said when asked by Judge T.S. Ellis to describe his actions, reports NPR .​ In exchange for the guilty plea, prosecutors dropped two charges related to retaining classified information. Lee’s lawyer, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., maintains that although Lee pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide information, ""There is no allegation that Mr. Lee delivered any information to the Chinese."" McMahon also stressed that ""there was never any claim that Mr. Lee was responsible for getting anyone killed."" Lee is expected to be sentenced at the end of August and could face life in prison. Prosecutors, however, plan to seek a sentence of 17 to 27 years, reports the Times. In February, a former Air Force intelligence officer was charged with espionage for defecting to Iran and giving information about her former colleagues, The Daily Wire reported :​ CBS News reports that Witt is accused of defecting to Iran in 2013 and sharing highly-classified U.S. intelligence about a classified Department of Defense program. Authorities claim Witt collaborated with the elite Iranian military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The FBI’s wanted listing says that Witt was indicted by a grand jury on February 8, and charged with “Conspiracy to Deliver National Defense Information to Representatives of a Foreign Government and Delivering National Defense Information to Representatives of a Foreign Government.” ""Monica Witt is charged with revealing to the Iranian regime a highly classified intelligence program and the identity of a U.S. Intelligence Officer, all in violation of the law, her solemn oath to protect and defend our country, and the bounds of human decency,"" assistant attorney general John Demers wrote in a statement. Witt, 39, had high-level security clearances and was in the Air Force from 1997 to 2008, then became a Defense Department contractor until 2010. She also reportedly went abroad several times on counterintelligence missions."

While writing a book about American politics, Bennet said he “became convinced in that process that if we continue to go down the path, we’re going … to be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more to the next generation.”
“I just need to do everything I can do to make sure we don’t do that,” he said.

Top officials are deeply upset about Attorney General Bill Barr’s announcement that he is investigating the reasons the FBI spied on Donald Trump’s campaign.
In a statement made while he was pasting on a fake beard and disguising himself as an Egyptian goatherd, former FBI Director James Comey said, “It is a very sad day for this nation when I have to leave town as quickly as possible in this ridiculous getup. I can’t believe that anyone could doubt the righteousness of the most righteous person this universe has produced since Paul Scofield in A Man for all Seasons , and you can’t get any more righteous than he was, believe you me.” Mr. Comey than excused himself, climbed out the bathroom window and has not been seen since.
In a statement delivered to the bottom of a table in O’Malley’s bar in Chappaqua, Hillary Clinton vehemently denied any collusion with the Russians, saying, “Yes, I paid a foreign national to gather Russian disinformation on Donald Trump and yes I passed that completely false disinformation to the FBI and yes they used that totally invented slander to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign but the crucial element of intent was not there. Just ask James Comey, if you can ever find him.”
Former CIA Director John Brennan, in an impassioned speech delivered from a car speeding toward the Canadian border, said, “I am so aggrieved by this odious calumny that I have decided to change my name and live in an undisclosed location until the heat’s off. You’ll never take me alive, John Law.”

CNN: Trump’s Economic Approval Rating ‘The Highest Number We’ve Ever Seen’ For His Administration | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46691/cnn-trumps-economic-approval-rating-highest-number-ashe-schow,"May 2, 2019 views
While discussing President Donald Trump’s recent polling numbers, a CNN analyst made a startling exclamation.
When the topic of the president’s approval rating on the economy came up, CNN’s David Chalian said Trump’s 56% approval was “the highest number we’ve ever seen at CNN polling.” Chalian was making the claim in reference to only Trump, saying a few seconds later, “It’s the high watermark in the entirety of the Trump presidency in CNN polling.”
Indeed, it is the highest approval rating on the economy that Trump has received during his presidency from CNN, but it is not the highest approval rating CNN has ever seen.
Former President Barack Obama, for example, beat that number twice during his eight years as president — in the first months of his presidency in 2009 and as he was leaving office in 2017. Both of these numbers should be looked at with a grain of salt. He entered office with high hopes. Remember, he had won the Nobel Peace Prize for a speech he gave before he was inaugurated. His approval rating on the economy jumped eight points from before the 2016 election to just before Trump was inaugurated, so one can also assume that might have had more to do with apathy over Trump than anything Obama had actually accomplished.
Trump is now in his third year as president. At this same point in Obama’s presidency, his approval rating for the economy was just 42%. So on that, at least according to CNN polling , Trump has him beat.
Other polls, however, have not been so kind to Trump. Real Clear Politics averaged Obama’s approval rating on the economy at 57%, which is far higher than CNN’s average.
Newsweek reported in March that former President Bill Clinton’s economic approval rating blows everyone else out of the water:
While Trump’s economy rating essentially matched Obama’s, they both paled in comparison to President Bill Clinton’s, who had the record economic approval rating of 81 percent in 1999. The record low rating since Gallup began polling on the economy, at the start of President Ronald Reagan’s term, was 17 percent for President George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump’s latest rating is well above the average rating of 43 percent. Trump’s economic approval rating never dipped below 45 percent.
CNN further reported that Trump’s high economic approval rating comes after the economy performed better than expected during the first quarter, growing 3.2% compared to the expected 2.5%. (CNN conveniently left those numbers out of its report on Trump’s economic approval rating.)
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said at a recent conference in Los Angeles that Trump’s handling of the economy would help him win re-election in 2020.
""You hate to sound like a cliché, but are you better off than you were four years ago? It's pretty simple, right? It's the economy, stupid. I think that's easy. People will vote for somebody they don't like if they think it's good for them,"" Mulvaney said."

He did offer drumsticks to a couple of female aides seated in front of him.
Later, at an impromptu press conference, Cohen brandished the plastic chicken for reporters, explaining that: “Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions … this man was picked to be Donald Trump’s fixer. The black socks look clean compared to this team. It's a sad day in America.”
Cohen eventually put the chicken down behind AG William Barr's name placard at the congressional witness table for a photo opportunity. It’s official... a plastic chicken where a U.S. Attorney General should be. #ChickenBarr pic.twitter.com/CHfoaiPSvo — Trish Zornio (@trish_zornio) May 2, 2019
Thanks to Cohen's efforts, ""#ChickenBarr"" began trending on Twitter, as progressive social media activists caught on to the joke.
Other legislators, including Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who called the hearing, chose to leave their mark on Barr in other ways. Nadler gave a speech to Barr's empty chair (sans plastic chicken), berating him for failing to appear and connecting Barr's decision not to testify to further, secretive Trump administration policies.
Barr said Wednesday that he would not attend the House hearings on Thursday after a dispute with Democrats over whether committee staff members and outside legal counsel, rather than legislators themselves, should be allowed to question the acting Attorney General, according to CNN . The Attorney General's office also refused to turn over a full, unredacted version of the Mueller report to Nadler and other Democratic legislators, despite a subpoena.
Nadler has said repeatedly that he will not be satisfied until he obtains a full, clean version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report and a copy of the evidence Mueller used to come to the conclusion that President Donald Trump and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign did not collude with Russian officials to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
On Wednesday, Barr spent hours in front of a Senate committee where, instead of being questioned on the content of Mueller's report, he was repeatedly interrogated over a letter, issued in early April, describing the contents of Mueller's report as clearing the president of collusion charges. Democrats were focused on how Barr characterized the report, despite having actual copies of the report in hand.
Nadler did promise retribution for Barr's absence, telling reporters ominously that House Democrats ""will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith. If he does not provide this committee with the information it demands and the respect it deserves, Mr. Barr’s moment of accountability will come soon enough.”"
"KNOWLES: Sorry, AOC, Bernie, Nordic Countries Are Not Socialist | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46677/knowles-sorry-aoc-bernie-nordic-countries-are-not-daily-wire,"KNOWLES: Sorry, AOC, Bernie, Nordic Countries Are Not Socialist Yana Paskova/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 2, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host debunks the talking points claiming that Nordic countries are socialist and that the United States should model their countries after their example. Transcript and video below.
Bernie, AOC, they want to tell you that the socialism that they're pushing is like the Nordic countries. It's not like Venezuela. Not a lie. The Nordic countries have relatively free economies, and they have no minimum wage. None of those countries have a minimum wage.
Sweden has a universal school choice, a far more free-market approach to education than even the United States has. Iceland has a freer economy than the United States, according to the Heritage Foundation index for economic freedom.
If AOC wants to be more like Iceland, then she ought to support freeing up the economy, not increased socialism. The former Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen puts the point very clearly. He says, ""Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.""
But what AOC and Bernie Sanders are pushing is a socialist planned economy. And it's so disingenuous if you hear Bernie Sanders or AOC talk about this. Bernie Sanders didn't have his honeymoon in Denmark, and he didn't go on his honeymoon to Iceland. He went on his honeymoon in 1988, the day after he got married, to the Soviet Union. In fact, I'm sorry to say we have video of this Bernie Sanders shirtless drinking vodka singing commie songs with the Russkies in the Soviet Union in 1988.
Bernie Sanders was so enthralled with the Soviet Union, with Soviet communism, the most repressive regime on Earth, and one of the most repressive regimes in the history of the world, that he took his honeymoon there. He didn't want to go to Scandinavia, he wanted to go there, worse even than Venezuela. And to remind you that he's not pushing policies that would bring us to Iceland, and he's pushing the policies of Latin America — just three years earlier in 1985, Bernie Sanders was defending socialist breadlines in Latin America.
Bernie Sanders: ""It's funny sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is because people are lining up for food. That's a good thing. In other countries, people don't line up for food. The rich get the food and the poor starve to death.""
Bernie says, ""bread lines are a good thing, in a lot of countries the rich get food and the poor starve to death."" Right, in socialist countries that's what happens. That's what's happening in Venezuela right now. And if they don't starve to death, they get run over by tanks. That doesn't happen in the United States. Nobody starves to death in the United States. The biggest problem afflicting the poor in the United States is obesity. The problem among the poor in the United States is that they're eating too much — that's not what happens in socialist countries. They starve to death while the rich and the well-connected and the cronies all benefit. "
Poynter Removes Unreliable List Of ‘Unreliable News Websites’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46736/poynter-removes-unreliable-list-unreliable-news-ashe-schow,"Poynter Removes Unreliable List Of ‘Unreliable News Websites’ Nipitphon Na Chiangmai / EyeEm / Getty Images
Ouch, that’s embarrassing.
On Tuesday, the Poynter Institute published a list of allegedly “unreliable” news websites. The list included nearly every conservative media outlet and virtually no liberal media outlets. Within a day of publication, Poynter had to issue a correction and removed two websites from the list. Following more complaints, the organization has now removed the list entirely.
In a “ letter from the editor ” published Thursday, Poynter’s managing editor Barbara Allen apologized for the list, acknowledging that it was itself unreliable.
Allen first explained how the list was created, which consisted of other lists created by biased “journalists” and “fact-checkers,” such as Snopes and Politifact. The intention of the list was to help others – such as advertisers – boycott allegedly “unreliable” news websites by allowing them “to gauge the legitimacy of the information they were consuming.”
As Allen notes, it was not just websites on the list that complained, but also “readers who objected to the inclusion of certain sites, and the exclusion of others.” Poynter then decided to “audit” the list (as opposed to doing this before publication) and “found weaknesses in the methodology.” The organization “detected inconsistencies” between the original lists and their “own rendering” of the final version.
“Therefore, we are removing this unreliable sites list until we are able to provide our audience a more consistent and rigorous set of criteria. The list was intended to be a starting place for readers and journalists to learn more about the veracity of websites that purported to offer news; it was not intended to be definitive or all encompassing,” Allen wrote. “We regret that we failed to ensure that the data was rigorous before publication, and apologize for the confusion and agitation caused by its publication. We pledge to continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”
Poynter had already published a correction to the list shortly after it was put online, removing my former employer The Washington Examiner and Indian outlet FirstPost from the list.
“This index previously listed The Washington Examiner and FirstPost as unreliable news sources. After reviewing our methodology, we found that neither met the criteria for inclusion, so both were removed,” the correction read.
Read Allen’s full statement below:
Dear readers:
On Tuesday, April 30, Poynter posted a list of 515 “unreliable” news websites, built from pre-existing databases compiled by journalists, fact-checkers and researchers around the country. Our aim was to provide a useful tool for readers to gauge the legitimacy of the information they were consuming.
Soon after we published, we received complaints from those on the list and readers who objected to the inclusion of certain sites, and the exclusion of others. We began an audit to test the accuracy and veracity of the list, and while we feel that many of the sites did have a track record of publishing unreliable information, our review found weaknesses in the methodology. We detected inconsistencies between the findings of the original databases that were the sources for the list and our own rendering of the final report.
Therefore, we are removing this unreliable sites list until we are able to provide our audience a more consistent and rigorous set of criteria. The list was intended to be a starting place for readers and journalists to learn more about the veracity of websites that purported to offer news; it was not intended to be definitive or all encompassing. We regret that we failed to ensure that the data was rigorous before publication, and apologize for the confusion and agitation caused by its publication. We pledge to continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.

Woman Who Married Herself: It Was The Best Day Of My Life | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46742/woman-who-married-herself-it-was-best-day-my-life-hank-berrien,"May 3, 2019 views
Writing in The Telegraph, a 42-year-old British woman chortled that the best day of her life came last June — the day she married herself .
Melissa Denton, a two-time divorcee with two children, writes, “The idea to marry myself came to me in January last year, when I was at work one day. Three weeks before, on Christmas Eve, I had received a text message from my boyfriend of five and a half years: ‘I can’t do this any more, it’s over,’ it said … It was devastating and left me in a funk, unable to eat, sleep or smile.”
Seizing upon the idea of marrying herself, Denton recalls a TV interview with Sophie Tanner, who had married herself in May 2015. Denton writes, “I was so down, and knew that I needed to learn to love myself before I would be able to attract the right people into my life. For years, I had poured myself into relationship after relationship, losing myself in the process. It was time to put ‘me’ first - a way to affirm that I can be happy on my own and to move on from the relationship.”
Denton bought a ring and set the wedding date. She admits her colleagues thought she was crazy, but she had previously shaved her head to raise money for a cancer charity and later dyed her hair pink and wore a nose ring.
Denton writes that her children, Ruby, 15, and Jasper, 11, were initially skeptical but came around, as did her family, but her brother did not bring his son to the wedding because he thought it would confuse him. She writes, “I’m hoping his opinion has now changed.”
Denton’s mother was initially against the idea, but Denton notes, “She soon came around. At the end of the day, she told me she was really proud.”
The wedding featured “a DJ, live band, karaoke and a huge vegan feast.”
Denton writes, “For the first time in my adult life, I was single and happy - the experience was empowering. Rather than wasting my time, energy and love on someone else, I was putting myself first.""
Denton explains, “My potted and relentless history with men started at 16, when my father died in a car accident.” She segues to her two failed marriages, then adds, “Relationships only got more difficult from there, as I bounced from one man to the next with little time in between to heal or become independent. I often transferred emotions from my last relationship into the next, all the way until that awful Christmas Eve text. “
She describes the wedding: “The atmosphere at the wedding was amazing, and everyone was celebrating, including a couple of ex-boyfriends and some former in-laws. It was just like any other wedding - just without a groom. I walked down the aisle, in a pink dress, with a big smile - towards no-one. A friend gave me away and another officiated. I repeated the vows and put the ring on myself, and we passed a paper plate around the 130-person congregation for everyone to sign in lieu of a register, as it’s not a legal procedure. It was the best day of my life.”
Denton concludes that now that she is fulfilled, she is “ready for a new challenge – and to start cheating on myself – so I applied to go on First Dates. I didn’t consider that for some people it might be a bit too mad. Instead, I planned to joke that I was married, but a bit bored.”
She’s committed to the idea of marrying herself, though: “Some people don’t understand it – but to me, it made absolute sense and that’s why I’m going to renew my vows at a similar ceremony every year, even if I am in a relationship. I have even bought four wedding dresses that can be used in the future. It is a way to centre and value myself, as well as remember that I can receive love that is equal, not one-sided. “
And there’s this: “Being Mrs Denton has taught me to be happy in my own company and skin, to not put pressure on myself to look or act in a certain way. Confidence is the most attractive thing a person can have and the marriage has given me that. My marriage to myself might not have come with a wedding night or honeymoon, but the plans for the future are far more exciting.” Recommended For You"
CA Senate Votes To Keep Trump Off Primary Ballot Unless He Releases Tax Returns | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46750/ca-senate-votes-keep-trump-primary-ballot-unless-hank-berrien,"CA Senate Votes To Keep Trump Off Primary Ballot Unless He Releases Tax Returns Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images May 3, 2019 views
On Thursday, the California state Senate took a shot at President Trump, passing a bill that would require presidential candidates to release five years' worth of income tax returns or not appear on the primary ballot.
As AP reported , a similar bill was passed in 2017, but Gov. Jerry Brown, who himself would not release his tax returns while in office, vetoed the bill, claiming it was unconstitutional. Brown stated , ""Today we require tax returns, but what would be next? Five years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?""
But new California Governor Gavin Newsom may well sign the bill, which is coauthored by state Sen. Mike McGuire and state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the 2017 bill.
In 2017, McGuire stated, ""For decades, every president has put their personal beliefs aside and put our country first and released their returns. The American people shouldn’t be in the dark about their president’s financial entanglements."" Wiener added, ""This bill is about giving the American people the honesty and transparency they deserve from anyone who wishes to serve as their president.”
This week, McGuire stated, “We believe that President Trump, if he truly doesn’t have anything to hide, should step up and release his tax returns.” He said recently , “President Trump’s refusal to release his income tax returns has broken a time-honored, bipartisan tradition which has weakened our democracy and his jaw dropping business conflicts have now put the security of our nation at risk.”
Last December , McGuire ranted, “Voters not only deserve full disclosure of their leader’s tax returns, they should be entitled to them. If President Trump had released his tax returns we would know why he’s ignoring intelligence agencies and snuggling up to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who has been linked to the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Transparency is a nonpartisan issue and it’s time to put the speculation to bed and bring to light any conflicts of interest that could drive an American president into the arms of a foreign power. It’s time to make President Trump’s tax returns public.”
Newsom spokesman Brian Ferguson said the bill “would be evaluated on its own merits.”
McGuire noted that Newsom has released his tax returns, adding, “I never want to put words into his mouth, but here’s what I’ll say: Gov. Newsom has led by example.” He said, “We can all debate on the floor about the constitutionality of this bill. But we also have to look at what makes our democracy strong. The foundation of any successful government is transparency.”
AP wrote, “Candidates would have to submit tax returns to the secretary of state’s office, which would work with the candidates to redact some information before posting the returns online.”
Similar bills have been proposed in New Jersey and Washington state.
According to a Morning Consult poll in April, a bare majority of respondents, 51%, want to see Trump’s tax returns released."
WALSH: Why Facebook's War On ‘Hate’ Is Just A Thin Excuse To Censor Conservatives | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46743/walsh-why-facebooks-war-hate-just-thin-excuse-matt-walsh,"May 3, 2019 views
Without giving a warning or any specific reason, Facebook purged a number of "" far-right extremists "" from its platform this week. Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopolous, Alex Jones, and Laura Loomer were all summarily banished. Louis Farrakhan was also given the boot — though he is not, despite media claims, in any way ""far-right.""
This ban reaches farther than anything we've yet seen. Facebook and Instagram will neither allow links to their content nor mentions of any events they attend. According to the The Atlantic , the only Infowars content permitted on either platform is that which expressly condemns Infowars:
Infowars is subject to the strictest ban. Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing Infowars videos, radio segments, or articles (unless the post is explicitly condemning the content), and Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share Infowars content and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures, according to a company spokesperson. (Twitter, YouTube, and Apple have also banned Jones and Infowars.)
The social media conglomerate offered only vague justifications for this move. It claimed that the targeted people are guilty of ""hate"" and ""violence,"" and are therefore ""dangerous."" As for evidence of this dangerous hate and violence, it gave only a few rather bizarre examples. From the BBC :
It said Alex Jones had hosted on his programme Gavin McInnes, leader of the Proud Boys, whose members are known for racist, anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Mr McInnes has been designated a ""hate figure"" by Facebook.
Facebook said this year Milo Yiannopoulos had publicly praised both Mr McInnes and English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, both banned from the network.
Laura Loomer also appeared with Mr McInnes, and Facebook said she also praised another banned figure, Faith Goldy, a Canadian.
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was banned for making several anti-Semitic remarks earlier this year.
Apparently it is a violation of Facebook’s policies to speak positively anywhere in public about people Facebook doesn’t like. Yiannopolous has been banned not for promoting Gavin McInnes on Facebook, but for expressing positive opinions about him in public . Can I then be banned for writing this article questioning the decision to ban these newly dubbed ""hate figures?"" I suppose I'll find out soon enough.
Indeed, it is impossible to know ahead of time whether you are operating according to the rules or in defiance of them, because the rules are intentionally obscure. What counts as ""hate"""" What is ""extreme?"" Which ideas are ""dangerous?"" Well, we can only try and narrow it down by the process of elimination.
Hamas and Hezbollah must not be considered ""hateful"" because they still have Facebook pages . This burlesque performer posted a picture of herself half-naked with a young girl stuffing dollar bills into her underwear while the girl's parents watched and cheered. She still has a page, so I guess the exploitation and abuse of children is not ""dangerous,"" according to Facebook. Speaking of which, this 11-year-old drag queen has a page, though dressing a child in drag seems both dangerous and ""extreme"" by any objective standard. PETA is extreme. The Animal Liberation Front is extreme. The National Abortions Rights Action League is extreme. Michael Moore is extreme. Sarah Silverman is extreme. Al Sharpton is extreme. Bill Maher is extreme. Everybody at the Daily Kos and Think Progress is extreme. All of these people and organizations, and the hundreds similar to them, are not only extreme but often quite hateful, yet their Facebook presence has not been interrupted by either bans or suspensions.
It seems that Facebook is operating with the same definition of ""extremism"" and ""hatred"" as the above-cited left-wing extremists themselves. If they were really interested in enforcing some objective and fair set of rules, they wouldn't have waited to issue all of these bans at the same time, as part of one big P.R. spectacle. If Alex Jones were going to be banned for spreading the insane and evil Sandy Hook conspiracy theory, Facebook would have made that move five years ago. If Yiannopolous or Watson or Loomer really did something that violates the terms of service (and, in Watson's case especially, I have no clue what that could possibly be), then they would have been kicked off the platform in response to that specific violation. Instead, Facebook handled it this way because the real ""violation"" is political. Whether these individuals can rightly be described as ""extremist"" or not, their only sin, in Facebook's eyes, is that their alleged extremism falls on the right end of the political spectrum. The extremists and hateful bigots on the Left — of which there are many — have been granted full immunity.
Two questions now arise: (1) Is Facebook correct to censor people based on politics?; and (2) Does Facebook have the moral right to censor people based on politics?
The answer to the first question is obviously no. A social media giant with over a billion users suppressing speech is far more dangerous than a right-winger expressing his views in a blog post or a YouTube video. Facebook's underhanded, dishonest, and absurdly biased actions should be condemned by anyone who cares about the free and open expression of ideas (an increasingly small group, perhaps).
The answer to the second question is more complicated. One thing I can say for sure is that Facebook does not have the right to smear and libel anyone. If they are going to publicly label someone like Paul Joseph Watson ""dangerous,"" ""hateful,"" and ""violent,"" they must provide evidence for that description. Otherwise they are baselessly defaming him, and that defamation, coming as it does from one of the most powerful companies in the world, will certainly have a negative impact on his life and professional career.
Leaving aside the libelous aspect of the matter, the question of whether or not Facebook has the moral or legal right to censor as it sees fit really comes down to category. What is Facebook? Is it a public utility, like a phone company? Is it just a ""platform?"" If so, what is a platform and how exactly can it be distinguished from a utility? Could a phone company claim that it is just a platform for phone calls? And if a platform makes editorial decisions about the content it publishes — such as allowing only negative references to Infowars — then hasn't it actually become more of a publisher than a platform? And if it's a publisher, then isn't it responsible for everything posted to the site — such as that picture of the young girl and the burlesque dancer?
I don't know the answers to all of these questions. But I do know that Facebook can't weave around the cones forever, never defining itself or explaining what it is and how it operates. Facebook has to be one thing or the other or the other. It can't be all three. And whatever it decides to be, ultimately, it must accept the responsibilties that come with that."
"Man Who Voiced ‘Winnie The Pooh’ Accused Of Rape, Abuse By Ex-Wife | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46757/man-who-voiced-winnie-pooh-accused-rape-abuse-ex-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Man Who Voiced ‘Winnie The Pooh’ Accused Of Rape, Abuse By Ex-Wife Photo by Mike Marsland/Mike Marsland/WireImage May 3, 2019 views
Jim Cummings, the man who voiced the iconic character of “Winnie the Pooh,” has been accused of rape by his ex-wife.
According to documents obtained by The Blast, the voice actor’s ex-wife Stephanie Cummings says Jim has engaged “in physical, sexual, and emotional abuse including but not limited to death threats, rape, and various sexual deviant behavior forced upon me without my consent” since the couple’s divorce in 2011.
Stephanie claims she has two separate domestic violence restraining orders against the actor after violent incidents, including one in August of 2011, “when she says Jim came over to her home and slapped her on the buttocks and forced himself on her in front of their 4-year-old daughter,” The Blast reports.
“He later came up behind me,” the ex-wife claims, “grabbed my arm, spun me around, and forcefully put his hand on the back of my neck and kissed me while holding me in place against the wall.”
The 66-year-old actor then allegedly asked Stephanie if she could “see him leaking, because that’s what I make him do when he touches me.” She said the experience left her “humiliated and degraded.”
Jim recalled the incident differently, saying in court documents that hef was “joking and laughing” with his ex-wife. “I touched her slightly on the butt,” he recalled. “[T]the whole incident was happy” and consensual, he said, noting that Stephanie “is much taller than I am, and a large woman, made no objection to anything.”
Jim denied the alleged incident further in an email to Stephanie: “Shame on you, you’re [sic] distortions are obscene. ‘forcing?’ Please, everyone, Gracie myself and especially YOU were all giggling and laughing, it was pleasant to have one moment of light-heartedness,” he wrote. “We both erupted into laughter ... I’m hardly the first person in the world to point out one ‘catches more flys [sic] with honey than vinegar’ for you to overlay a reference to being a whore is little too telling, Let’s get this over with for the love of God.”
A police report was filed after Jim allegedly raped her in 2013, the ex claims.
“Jim would frequently ‘without consent, would touch my buttocks, my groin, and my breasts. He would hold me in place attempting to kiss and fondle me. He would spank me in front of our daughters. He would then follow up by making sexual comments to me that I found repugnant,” Stephanie said, according to the report.
The former Disney star voice actor would allegedly say he could “touch Mommy’s breasts since he had paid for them” in front of their daughters.
In 2017, Stephanie moved to Utah with their two daughters. When Jim asked to stay at their home during a visit, she accepted. “However, during the middle of the night, she claims Jim was ‘standing over me with his erect penis in my hand. He was using my hand to stroke his penis while my youngest daughter was asleep on the other side of me. She was 10 years old at the time,’” the report said.
“I told him to stop and get out of the house. He refused. He then came back and did the same thing, insisting I masturbate him or he would wake Lulu up. I did as he asked given his threat to wake up my daughter and my worry that I could not control what he would do in front of her,” claimed Stephanie.
That was when the second restraining order was allegedly obtained by Stephanie, she said."

On MAS's website, the organization did condemn the recent anti-Semitic white nationalist terror attack against the synagogue in California and the organization did condemn the Islamic terrorist attacks last month in Sri Lanka on Christian churches on Easter day.
Here is MAS's statement on the Poway synagogue attack:
Muslim American Society condemns the terrorist attack that targeted a synagogue in San Diego. As worshipers observed the last day of Passover, a 19-year old white male started targeting and shooting members of the synagogue. This person is the same individual who attacked a mosque in Escondido, 9 miles away from the Chabad Synagogue of Poway. One person is dead and three are wounded, including the Rabbi.
“Hate has no place in our society. In an era where we’ve seen an increase in hate crimes, including rising Islamophobia and anti-semitism, we must stand tall together in solidarity.” said Ayman Hammous, Executive Director of MAS, “these acts of terror in places of worship and against humanity cannot become the norm.”
MAS strongly condemns this white supremacist attack and we call on our leaders to call this out for what it is, an act of terror meant to terrorize a faith community. Places of worship are sacred and human life is sacred. The Muslim community has faced acts of hate numerous times and we stand tall with the Jewish community who also faced similar acts of hate one too many times. “We know that our faith communities are resilient. We will bounce back stronger together,” says Ismahan Abdullahi, National Deputy Director of MAS PACE, “Hate is scared of love, for it’s the only thing strong enough to keep it at bay. This world can and must do better.”
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Jewish community in Poway. We offer our sincerest condolences to all the families impacted by this tragedy. We urge all faith communities and centers to be vigilant and take extra precautions. Together, we will stand tall against hate.
Here is MAS's statement on the Christian churches in Sri Lanka:
The Muslim American Society (MAS) offers its sincerest condolences to the families of the victims of the bombings in Sri Lanka.
The bombings, which resulted in the tragic deaths and wounding of hundreds of congregants, Sri Lankans and tourists from around the world, took place during one of the holiest days in the Christian faith, Easter. MAS Executive Director Ayman Hammous said, “These senseless acts of violence do not accomplish anything other than drawing humanity into a state of chaos. We need to stand together as brothers and sisters in humanity, across all faiths, united against all acts of terror and destruction.”
MAS calls on all people to come together during these difficult times and stand for peace and justice for all. Recommended For You "
Pope Francis Criticizes The Nation-State: ‘Common Good Has Become Global’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46760/pope-francis-denounces-nation-state-common-good-paul-bois,"May 3, 2019 views
In the effort to stop climate change, human trafficking, and nuclear threats, Pope Francis said that nation states should give way to globalization in some aspects, calling on them to create ""intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests.""
“In the current situation of globalization not only of the economy but also of technological and cultural exchanges, the nation-state is no longer able to procure the common good of its population alone,” Pope Francis told the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, according to Catholic News Agency .
The Pope did emphasize the need for subsidiarity that would allow nations to maintain their sovereignty but ultimately conceded that intergovernmental institutions would have to fill the global gaps. ""While, according to the principle of subsidiarity, individual nations must be given the power to operate as far as they can, on the other hand, groups of neighboring nations — as is already the case — can strengthen their cooperation by attributing the exercise of certain functions and services to intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests,"" he said.
Issues like climate change and human trafficking are just two examples that Pope Francis cited that call for a ""supranational common good."" Pope Francis also touched on the issue of nationalism, which he says has sparked a rise in distrust toward migrants and a neglect of the ""common good.""
""The Church observes with concern the re-emergence, almost everywhere in the world, of aggressive currents towards foreigners, especially immigrants, as well as that growing nationalism that neglects the common good,"" Pope Francis told the professors gathered to hear him speak.
The Roman Pontiff called on nations to welcome all immigrants and to regulate migratory flows with ""virtue of prudence.""
“It is the task of public authority to protect migrants and to regulate migratory flows with the virtue of prudence, as well as to promote reception so that local populations are trained and encouraged to consciously participate in the integrating process of migrants who are welcomed,” he said. ""The way in which a nation welcomes migrants reveals its vision of human dignity and its relationship with humanity. Every human person is a member of humanity and has the same dignity.""
Earlier this week, 51 Catholic theologians and priests issued an open letter to bishops calling on them to admonish Pope Francis for speaking heresy and appointing people in powerful positions who openly flaunt Church teaching.
“We take this measure as a last resort to respond to the accumulating harm caused by Pope Francis’s words and actions over several years, which have given rise to one of the worst crises in the history of the Catholic Church,” the group said in a 20-page open letter this week that was published at LifeSiteNews .
In an 11-page letter released last year , Archbishop Viganò, former Nuncio from the Vatican to Washington, D.C., alleged that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had been sanctioned under Pope Benedict XVI only to have those sanctions removed by Pope Francis upon his ascendancy in 2013. Cardinal McCarrick had an alleged history of sexually abusing male seminarians and, according to Viganò, was ordered by Pope Benedict to refrain from saying Mass or public ministry.
Pope Francis has still not responded to the accusations laid against him by Viganò."
Rashida Tlaib’s Father Says She ‘Lied Big-Time To Get Elected’ In Resurfaced 2010 Newspaper Article | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46777/rashida-tlaibs-father-says-she-lied-big-time-get-ryan-saavedra,"Rashida Tlaib’s Father Says She ‘Lied Big-Time To Get Elected’ In Resurfaced 2010 Newspaper Article Zach Gibson/Getty Images May 3, 2019 views
In a March 11, 2010 newspaper article in The Detroit News, Rep. Rashida Tlaib's (D-MI) father accused her of lying ""big-time to get elected"" by falsifying her address on an election affidavit.
Tlaib's father, Harbi Elabed, made the accusations against Tlaib, who at the time was a freshman state-level representative from the 12th District in Detroit’s Southwest side. The newspaper article was scrubbed from the internet when The Detroit News migrated to a new website but was available in a subscription-based digital archive. The Detroit News reported:
He said his daughter misrepresented her residency when she signed an election affidavit in 2008 with the Wayne County Clerk claiming she was a citizen of Detroit.
According to that affidavit, Tlaib claimed she lived at 9123 Rathbone in Detroit. That house is owned in part by her father, Harbi Elabed, and he now says she did not live there and he was only recently made aware that she had claimed so.
""She lied,"" Elabed said. ""She lied big-time to get elected. I never teach her that way. I teach her the right way. It’s my house. She didn’t live there. She lived in Dearborn in her house with her husband and boy."" Here's the March 11, 2010, report in The Detroit News pic.twitter.com/rFe5lH0iLt — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) May 3, 2019
The Detroit News continued:
Dearborn is not a part of the 12th House District that Tlaib was elected to represent.
Residency issues are very difficult to prove. To become a candidate, you must be a “registered and qualified elector” of that district, according to state law. That means you must have your primary residence — the address on your driver’s license and where you’re registered to vote — in that district.
There is no law however, according to state election officials, saying that a person must spend any particular number of days, weeks or months at a certain location. Perjury is an offense punishable by up to five years in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Tlaib even admitted at the time that accusations against her caused problems for her, saying: ""People have questioned that a lot, but never my father and I’m sad about that. The point is I complied with the law. I moved into the district before I filed. Period.""
The Detroit News added:
According to property and tax records, Tlaib lived in a house on Tireman in Dearborn that her husband purchased a decade ago. Taxes were paid on that house in 2009 with her husband claiming it as his primary residence.
But in 2008, as Tlaib was preparing for a run for the seat, she said she separated from her husband and moved into her father’s house with her two brothers.
Tlaib said she had bills to prove where she lived but it does not appear that she ever provided those bills to the newspaper to validate her claims.
Tlaib's father said that he came forward with the allegation because it was part of a ""growing litany of transgressions that his daughter committed upon him — culminating in a dispute about care of his aged mother, who suffers from dementia,"" adding that Tlaib ""sided against him and in favor of his nephew in a battle of custody, a complete breach of family values.""
""My sons told me blood is thicker than water and I should keep my mouth shut, so OK, I did,"" Elabed said. ""Then she crossed the line with her father. When she interferes in the father’s business, when she shows him no respect. This life in politics has changed her.""
Tlaib ended up reconciling with her husband and moved next door to her father.
""It’s not surprising that he did this to me. It’s not. He was abusive to me as a girl and he’s angry at me about my grandmother,"" Tlaib claimed. ""I know he’s proud of what I’ve accomplished but he’s also vindictive. It’s all very embarrassing. What do they say, you can’t choose your family?"" "

ERICKSON: Fighting Over The Body | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Erick Erickson,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46767/erickson-fighting-over-body-erick-erickson,"ERICKSON: Fighting Over The Body photo by David S. Holloway/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
Read about a lot of high-profile deaths and you find families fighting over the corpses. They've long since stopped arguing about issues; they just want control over the body, and maybe an inheritance. Both sides have a sense of grievance for some emotional wound. But the fight has escalated so much that no one really remembers why it started or what the endgame should be other than control of a dead body.
Washington seems to be that way these days, and the William Barr hearing is another reminder of that.
According to Barr, Russia and others will probably try to impact the 2020 election. That should be really big news, but it wasn't. Democrats have trotted out James Comey to attack the attorney general while ignoring so many of the indiscreet things Comey has done over the past few years, including his letters about Hillary Clinton.
Suddenly, Comey is awesome because he is on the Right Side of History. Democrats who blamed him for Clinton's loss pivoted to blaming Russia once Comey signaled he was sympathetic to their cause.
Meanwhile, MSNBC hosts are speculating that perhaps the President is actually helping Russia in Venezuela, where the Russians have decided to set up shop, ignore the Monroe Doctrine and prop up a dictator that the President is actually handling responsibly. It amazed me that MSNBC anchors would suggest Donald Trump is really helping Russia on this. I get that they hate the President, but he has actually been a responsible leader on this one.
Ilhan Omar, however, has not. She's gone on a television program to denounce American treatment of Venezuela. Omar and several of her freshmen colleagues in the House of Representatives have gravitated to the ""blame America first"" crowd. The world, she would have us believe, would be a peaceful utopia, but for the United States. In her scorn, she also indicts Barack Obama's foreign policy. He did not coddle enough dictators for her.
All this is happening as Joe Biden tells everyone China is not really a threat to us, just like Russia was not a threat in 2012. Biden says China is not even competing with us. Perhaps he said something so ludicrous to distract from his own Russia scandal: His son sat on the board of a Ukrainian company with ties to the Russians and only resigned once his dad decided to run for President. Some allege that Biden previously helped pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor looking into that company.
No one in Washington seems to have noticed that China now has a navy in the Western Pacific that is capable of kicking our butts in a fight. In fact, the American fleet over there is still suffering from issues with leadership, training and morale. In Venezuela, the Cubans and Russians have set up shop and military operations. North Korea has gone back to building weapons of mass destruction.
Then there is our own nation's pending bankruptcy. Democrats and Republicans can only agree on spending more money together. Democrats are willing to work with Republicans on a $2 trillion infrastructure package but cannot fund a $5 billion border wall. They will not even acknowledge the situation at the border.
I'm reminded that when Rome fell into chaos, the bureaucracy still basically functioned, so it was a long time before anyone realized the empire had no pulse. It took the barbarians storming the gates to open people's eyes.
At this point, we probably ought to ask if the United States still has a pulse. It looks more and more like the political class in Washington is just fighting over the corpse. Our nation is completely unprepared for coming crises and on the verge of bankruptcy, and both sides are pointing fingers and focusing on partisan squabbles instead of real threats.
For every Democrat who would read all this and say, ""But Trump,"" I'd reply that Russian meddling began during the Obama administration after Obama said they were not a threat. Pointing fingers is beside the point now. We have problems as a nation without anyone in Washington ready to play a long game to fix them.

"In Response To FOIA, A County Clerk Gave A Reporter A PICTURE Of A CD-ROM, But Not Its Contents | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46786/response-foia-county-clerk-gave-reporter-picture-ashe-schow,"In Response To FOIA, A County Clerk Gave A Reporter A PICTURE Of A CD-ROM, But Not Its Contents Hannelore Foerster/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
Journalists and concerned citizens file hundreds of thousands of Freedom of Information Act Requests each year, and government officials continue to find new and unique ways to avoid complying.
Each year since 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit dedicated to free speech and transparency, publishes The Foilies , a list of the “year’s worst in government transparency.” The 2019 list contains some doozies, but perhaps none more absurd than what happened to ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman:
ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman has been digging deep into the child welfare system and what happens when child abuse results in death. While following up on a series of strangulations, she requested a copy of a case file from the St. Joseph County Superior Court in Indiana. Apparently, the clerk on the other end simply took the entire file and ran everything through a scanner. The problem was that the file contained a CD-ROM, and that's not how CD-ROMs work. ""Well this is the first time this had happened,"" Huseman posted to Twitter, along with the blotchy black-and-white image of the top of the disc. ""They scanned a CD as part of my FOI and didn't give me its contents. Cool cool.""
That’s right, the clerk sent her a photo of a CD-ROM but not the contents within. There are plenty of examples of ridiculous redactions in FOIA requests, but that’s certainly a novel idea.
In another example of government employees using CD-ROMS to annoy reporters who filed FOIA requests, EFF described an episode in which the CIA sent someone six discs containing eight documents – each just three to nine pages long.
Kel McClanahan, executive director of the nonprofit public interest law firm National Security Counselors, filed a request an expected eight documents. The CIA sent him the six discs containing the small documents, which could have easily fit on one.
“What makes this ‘extra silly,’ McClanahan said, is that the CIA has previously complained about how burdensome and costly fulfilling requests can be. Yet the CIA could have easily combined several requests onto the same disc and saved themselves some time and resources. After all, a standard CD-ROM can hold 700 MB, and all of the files took only 304 KB of space,” EFF reported.
Many of the other “awards” were for some serious transparency issues, like the city of Seattle telling a man he could have the information he sought for $33 million, or Michigan State Police trying to charge another report $485,645.24 – 25 cents for each line of a 1.9-million-line dataset.
One last silly example: The Federal Communications Commission tried to avoid a FOIA request for emails relating to Chairman Ajit Pai’s YouTube video “7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality.” After some legal wrangling, Muck Rock editor JPat Brown was able to get the unredacted emails released. They showed that Pai wanted to know when the video would be live and that the FCC wanted to be able to ax the video. Oh, and one redaction literally covered up the word “OK.”"
