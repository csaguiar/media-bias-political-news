Legislators are expected to vote for J.B. Pritzker’s progressive income tax plan by the time the session ends in May. And you can expect the capital bill and budget to be approved at the same time, too.
That’s because Democratic leaders are subtly offering a piece of the capital bill to get votes for the progressive income tax. Lawmakers get a sense that they could be treated well in the capital bill if they vote in favor of a graduated income tax, which Pritzker calls “the fair tax.”
The constitutional change to secure the progressive income tax is expected to be introduced in the state Senate by next week for a first reading.
The message to lawmakers is that the capital bill won’t be possible without supporting the progressive income tax. “If we can’t put ourselves on a path to balance the budget, we can’t ask people to support the taxes necessary to fund a capital bill,” a Dem leader told POLITICO. Funding the capital bill would likely include a gas tax and license-plate fees.
House Speaker Mike Madigan, meanwhile, has been meeting individually with lawmakers over dinner at Saputo’s to hear their thoughts on the session. During those one-on-one conversations, members are telling him “things are moving too fast,” according to another Democrat. That explains how state Rep. Marty Moylan secured 60 signatures on a bill that calls for more study into recreational marijuana—another revenue generator proposed by Pritzker.
Slowing down or rejecting a revenue proposal has consequences. During a recent Democratic Caucus meeting, lawmakers were told that they’ve got to come up with areas in the budget to cut if Pritzker’s menu of revenue generators aren’t met. After going through that exercise, it’s expected the progressive income tax might be more appealing after all.

Ald. Carrie Austin wants to make one thing clear. She’s just fine with Mayor Lori Lightfoot moving in to the Fifth Floor of City Hall. The powerful alderman just doesn’t like Lightfoot’s marquee message—getting rid of aldermanic prerogative. Austin (34th) says her opposition to the idea doesn’t mean she’s organizing against Lightfoot. “I’m not,” she told POLITICO. But Austin, who oversees the Committee on Budget and Government Operations, has been outspoken on the issue, saying it’s essential to her ability to govern. She’s made that loud and clear to aldermen and media alike. At least a few council members interpret that as Austin “advocating for a strong council against the mayor.” Austin says not exactly. “I believe in both being strong. However, we may not agree on every issue.” Austin opposes ending aldermanic prerogative “because that’s opposing my community. It opposes my residents.” Her ward covers portions of Morgan Park, Roseland, Washington Heights and West Pullman on the South Side. Austin also is the ward’s Democratic committeewoman.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker and first lady of Illinois M.K. Pritzker hosted their first Passover Seder at the governor’s mansion last night. Other governors have held Seders in the mansion but he's the first Jewish governor to do so. About a hundred people attended—Jewish lawmakers, gubernatorial employees, rabbis from around the state and plenty of friends. The service was led by Seth Limmer, the Pritzkers’ rabbi from Temple Sinai. A fun moment in the evening saw rabbis break out into song as violinist Allison Zabelin played—she’s a cousin to state Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, who also attended.Other notables: Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, Deputy Gov. Jesse Ruiz and his wife, attorney Michelle Ruiz; Consul General of Israel to the Midwest Aviv Ezra ; Holocaust survivor and chair of the board of the Illinois Holocaust Museum Fritzie Fritzshall; stateRep. Robyn Gabel, stateRep. Yehiel Kalish, stateRep. Bob Morgan, stateSen. Julie Morrison and state Sen. Ram Villivalam. The food was kosher and catered by Zelda’s in Skokie.

— It was pure theater in City Hall yesterday when Mayor Rahm Emanuel acquiesced to Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot and asked the Finance Committee to hold off on voting on Lincoln Yards and The 78 development projects. The activists who helped elect Lightfoot cheered upon hearing the news. But Ald. Brian Hopkins (2 nd ), whose ward includes the 55-acre Lincoln Yards site, shot back. He told reporters: “The mayor doesn’t sit on the Finance Committee.” He called on the committee to vote anyway. All eyes shifted to lame-duck Ald. Pat O’Connor, who heads Finance. An Emanuel ally to the end, he pushed the pause button, saying the vote would take place Wednesday to give Emanuel and Lightfoot a chance to figure out how to “move forward.” Given aldermen have already voted in favor of the projects, minds aren’t likely to be changed. But there could be maneuvering that allows Lightfoot to get a little more out of the deal for the sake of her supporters. Sun-Times’ Fran Spielman has more details here . And here’s the Tribune’s take by John Byrne.
— Fair work week on hold. Some parliamentary maneuvering put the fair workweek proposal on hold yesterday. It was up for a vote in the Committee on Workforce Development and Audit. But it was 4:45 p.m. by the time Ald. Pat O’Connor (40 th ) arrived to the meeting. He called for a vote and then Ald. Tom Tunney (44 th ) called for a quorum. By that hour, they didn’t have it. So O’Connor adjourned the meeting. That means the issue will be taken up by the new city council after the May 20 inauguration.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print EU and Chinese officials meeting in Brussels on Tuesday proclaimed their summit as a win-win, but far more striking was the big loser: Donald Trump.
European Council President Donald Tusk declared a ""breakthrough"" on some of the EU's major trade disagreements — including a joint pledge to back tough World Trade Organization rules on industrial subsidies. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""Today, we are making good on our joint commitment to uphold and to update the rules-based global order that has served us so well.""
And Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, appearing at a news conference with Tusk and Juncker, declared the agreements reached at the summit ""something good for China's reform and opening-up endeavors, and good for European unity and prosperity.""
While Li and his European counterparts were celebrating what he called ""concrete goals and outcomes,"" a newspaper close to the Chinese Communist Party cast doubt on Trump's suggestion that he would reach a deal to end his trade war with China within four weeks.
The newspaper, the Global Times, which is affiliated with the People's Daily, the official publication of the party's central committee, published an editorial calling Trump's prediction ""just an uncertain timetable"" and it warned that any effort to force through a deal could have serious negative consequences, the South China Morning Post reported .
""The word you have heard most here today is reciprocity"" — Senior EU diplomat
In Brussels, during a series of summit meetings at which officials worked hard to focus on common interests, perhaps the foremost imperative for Brussels and Beijing was to showcase the failure of Trump's belligerence — his slapping of unilateral tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and his threats of punitive levies against EU-made automobiles — in achieving real gains for the U.S. vis-à-vis the world's biggest trading powers.
Last week, Tusk urged EU leaders not to support a joint statement with China, saying there has not been sufficient cooperation from the Chinese side to address European concerns on a range of issues. But an intense 72 hours of negotiations led to key breakthroughs, particularly on the issue of industrial subsidies, as well as on geographical indications , and it yielded a robust joint statement .

Gillibrand: I was wrong on immigration - POLITICO,www.politico.com,MATTHEW CHOI,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/09/kirsten-gillibrand-immigration-wrong-1264199,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Democratic presidential hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday confronted some of her previous stances on immigration, saying they ""didn't care"" about the needs of diverse Americans.
""When I was a member of Congress from upstate New York, I was really focused on the priorities of my district,"" the New York senator said during a CNN town hall. ""When I became senator of the entire state, I recognized that some of my views really did need to change."" Story Continued Below
Before becoming a senator in 2009, Gillibrand represented a largely Republican district in the House and expressed ideas on immigration — from blocking certain benefits for undocumented immigrants to establishing English as an official language — that have come back to haunt her as she seeks the Democratic nomination in 2020.
Those old stances especially corrode her platform as the antithesis of President Donald Trump, who has made harsher penalties and stricter enforcement of immigration laws a cornerstone of his campaign and administration.
During the town hall, Gillibrand said she has changed considerably since her times in the House, and that she was ""ashamed"" of her past positions. She used her ideological evolution to further distance herself from the president, who she said is incapable of change."

Oil drilling plan threatens Trump's 2020 chances in Florida,www.politico.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-florida-2020-oil-drilling-1264194,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
The Trump administration is considering auctioning off Florida’s coastal waters for oil and gas drilling — and Republicans are warning it could cost the president dearly in Florida in the 2020 election.
An industry lobbying offensive has put it on the cusp of achieving its holy grail: access to the resource-rich eastern Gulf of Mexico. The idea is so politically toxic in Florida that past presidents haven't even entertained it. But behind the scenes, oil and gas interests are appealing to Trump's desire to turbocharge U.S. energy production, including his past openness to drilling off the Florida coast. Story Continued Below
The president and his top advisers haven't yet weighed in on the plan taking shape inside his Interior Department. But giving it the green light would be tantamount to a declaration of war on his second home state, given the uniform opposition from Florida Republicans, including prominent allies like Sen. Rick Scott, Gov. Ron DeSantis and others.
“He would have a price to pay for that,” Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a staunch Trump supporter, told POLITICO.
Industry representatives have said a plan has been imminent since last fall, but many expect the Interior Department is waiting for the Senate to confirm acting Secretary David Bernhardt to fill the agency's top slot before formally releasing the draft. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed cloture Monday on Bernhardt’s confirmation, teeing up a vote this week.
Multiple oil and gas industry sources told POLITICO that the eastern Gulf, along with the Atlantic coast, are included in the administration’s current five-year off-shore drilling proposal, which hasn’t yet been released. The deliberations surrounding that plan are occurring mostly at Interior between lower-level policy aides who are being lobbied by industry representatives, they said.

You can unsubscribe at any time.
The administration's position was muddied when former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke held an elaborately staged Jan. 2018 meeting with Scott, then Florida's governor, to declare the state wouldn’t be on the drilling map. The announcement was seen as a favor to boost Scott’s electoral fortunes in his ultimately successful challenge against Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, who tried to use environmental issues to separate himself from the Republican challenger.
In reality, Trump was upset by the announcement. People familiar with his reaction said Zinke’s statement came without White House approval and contradicted the administration’s “energy dominance” message.
Both parties in Florida oppose offshore drilling. Memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which sent tarballs ashore in Florida, bring fears of a future spill damaging the state’s fisheries and tourism. Many in the state also say drilling would conflict with military exercises in the area.
Bernhardt has stayed mum about what’s in the offshore leasing proposal, remarking in a March 28 confirmation hearing that the department is at “step one” of the process. Several industry sources disputed that, though, saying the plan is nearly complete.
“For all intents and purposes, it’s done,” said an industry lobbyist familiar with the plan.
But the senior political officials charged with protecting Trump’s electoral prospects haven’t yet focused on the drilling plan, said a source close to the president who met recently with members of Trump’s energy policy team.
The White House referred a request for comment to the Interior Department. An agency spokesperson did not immediately reply to questions about whether the eastern Gulf of Mexico would be included in any draft plan. Bernhardt said at his nomination hearing that the latest draft plan hadn’t reached his desk.
Offshore drilling is broadly unpopular in Florida. A Quinnipiac University poll of Florida voters released March 13 showed 64 percent oppose the practice. Republicans, though, supported it by a 54-38 percent margin. A ballot measure banning oil and gas development in state waters passed overwhelmingly in November."

On the first Wednesday evening in February, Anthony Scaramucci entertained a packed house of like-minded souls at Rewind, a retro diner off Dupont Circle.
There, the former White House communications director fielded friendly questions and made cracks about his intra-Trump world vendettas against rivals like Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus. Story Continued Below
The occasion was a meetup of the 45 Club, a private group reserved exclusively for President Donald Trump’s current and former staffers.
The club, an informal gathering that provides solidarity and networking opportunities in a hostile Washington, is open to what it calls “the Team” — Trump administration appointees as well as alumni of the campaign, transition and inaugural committee. Members wear a lapel pin fashioned after the butt end of a .45 caliber bullet casing and attend semi-regular gatherings that often feature remarks by better-known Trump-world figures such as Brad Parscale, Corey Lewandowski and Scaramucci.

Its operations, described here for the first time, offer insight into how the anonymous foot soldiers of Trump’s Washington have organized their social lives: discreetly, with an eye toward exclusivity and the aspirational lifestyle that has always marked the Trump brand.
Not quite a secret society, the club nonetheless goes to some lengths to fly under the radar: Public hints of its existence are scarce, and the locations of its events are withheld from attendees until they RSVP, all the better to evade the notice of pesky activists and nosy reporters. “In this political climate, there’s a lot of people who would not have pure intentions of coming to network,” explained a former campaign staffer familiar with the club. “They may be trying to infiltrate.”

While it is common for veterans of presidential campaigns and administrations to form alumni groups, the 45 Club has taken on an outsized role as a refuge for junior operatives and appointees who have few connections in the capital. Barack Obama’s young staffers were the toast of Washington, and George W. Bush rode into town with a clubby, multi-generational political network that was heavy on the GOP establishment. But, in a reflection of his outsider campaign, Trump’s hires often came from outside the traditional feeding grounds of Republican politics. And in a city that has largely shunned them — dating app profiles here often declare an unwillingness to meet Trump’s supporters, let alone his aides — Trump’s young aides have formed an insular social scene.
“When you’ve kept the Washington Illuminati at a distance, I think you’re more likely to form groups of your own,” explained one club member.
Of course, because this is the Trump administration, there has been infighting: The 45 Club has been the subject of internecine sniping over charges that it is run by hangers-on bent on exploiting their tenuous connections to the president.
“They’re trying to create an exclusive club because they’ve been banned from every other exclusive club in D.C.,” sniped one former campaign staffer.
“Ironically enough, the two guys who started it were never on the campaign, never in the administration,” lamented Kevin Chmielewski, a member of the campaign’s advance team who went on to serve at the Environmental Protection Agency. “We were all kind of pissed about it, because it’s like, ‘Who are you to do that?’”"

NEW … HOUSE MINORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE (R-LA.) is beginning the process to try to force a vote on an anti-BDS bill, as Republicans look to use Israel as a wedge to split Democrats. SCALISE is using the only tool the minority has -- a discharge petition -- to try to force Democrats to sign onto “Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act of 2019” -- the House version of a bill the Senate has already passed.
The legislation would allow “states to divest from entities boycotting Israel.” The idea is to try to force vulnerable Democrats to sign the petition. It needs 218 signatures to reach the floor. All 197 Republicans are sure to sign on, which means 21 Democratic signatures are needed. Discharge petitions rarely work, but this is tailor-made for campaign season.
THE TICK TOCK … WAPO’S DAVID NAKAMURA, JOSH DAWSEY and SEUNG MIN KIM: “Twelve days of chaos: Inside the Trump White House’s growing panic to contain the border crisis”: “Trump’s increasingly erratic behavior over the past 12 days — since he first threatened to seal the border in a series of tweets on March 29 — has alarmed top Republicans, business officials and foreign leaders who fear that his emotional response might exacerbate problems at the border, harm the U.S. economy and degrade national security.
“The stretch also has revealed that a president who has routinely blamed spiking immigration numbers on others — past presidents, congressional Democrats, Mexican authorities, federal judges, human smugglers — is now coming to the realization that the problems are closer to home. Though his aides have taken the fall, and it is unlikely that Trump will blame himself, the president is facing an existential political crisis ahead of his 2020 reelection bid over the prospect of failure on his top domestic priority.” WaPo
NYT, A1: PETER BAKER and MAGGIE HABERMAN: “Mick Mulvaney Tries Letting Trump Be Trump”: “In his first 100 days as the president’s acting chief of staff, Mr. Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr. Trump’s circle but one markedly different than the previous two occupants of his corner office. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Trump has a chief of staff who has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president’s conservative instincts — to let Trump be Trump, in effect. …
“During tense negotiations amid the government shutdown earlier this year, Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican and Appropriations Committee chairman, complained bitterly about Mr. Mulvaney’s penchant for undoing weeks of bipartisan work with a quick comment to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Mr. Shelby told Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee’s top Democrat, that Mr. Mulvaney was ‘the most dangerous man’ in Washington, according to three people familiar with the exchange.
“Mr. Shelby has not repeated that in public, but when a reporter on Capitol Hill asked him about Mr. Mulvaney last week, the senator tartly interrupted to offer a correction. ‘You mean the acting chief of staff?’ he said before walking away.” NYT

ELIANA JOHNSON and DANIEL LIPPMAN, “Inside Trump’s ‘truly bizarre’ visit to Mt. Vernon”: “President Donald Trump had some advice for George Washington. During a guided tour of Mount Vernon last April with French president Emmanuel Macron, Trump learned that Washington was one of the major real-estate speculators of his era. So, he couldn’t understand why America’s first president didn’t name his historic Virginia compound or any of the other property he acquired after himself.
“‘If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it,’ Trump said, according to three sources briefed on the exchange. ‘You’ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.’ The VIPs’ tour guide for the evening, Mount Vernon president and CEO Doug Bradburn, told the president that Washington did, after all, succeed in getting the nation’s capital named after him. Good point, Trump said with a laugh. ... The Macrons, Bradburn has told several people, were far more knowledgeable about the history of the property than the president.” POLITICO
NEWS THE PRESIDENT WILL LIKE … BLOOMBERG’S CHRIS STROHM and BILLY HOUSE: “Barr Forms Team to Review FBI’s Actions in Trump Probe”: “Attorney General William Barr has assembled a team to review controversial counterintelligence decisions made by Justice Department and FBI officials, including actions taken during the probe of the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016, according to a person familiar with the matter.
“This indicates that Barr is looking into allegations that Republican lawmakers have been pursuing for more than a year -- that the investigation into President Donald Trump and possible collusion with Russia was tainted at the start by anti-Trump bias in the FBI and Justice Department.” Bloomberg

“Half of Democrats polled said the allegations from women that Biden made them uncomfortable by invading their personal space will make no difference in their vote. Twenty-nine percent said the allegations would make them less likely to vote against Biden. The responses were nearly identical among Democratic men and women.

NETANYAHU WINS, KIND OF … AP’S ARON HELLER in Jerusalem: “Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to be headed toward a historic fifth term as Israel’s prime minister on Wednesday, with close-to-complete unofficial election results giving his right-wing Likud and other nationalist and religious parties a solid majority in parliament.
“The outcome affirmed Israel’s continued tilt to the right and further dimmed hopes of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Re-election will also give Netanyahu an important boost as he braces for the likelihood of criminal charges in a series of corruption scandals.
“With 97.4% of the vote counted, Likud and its traditional political allies were in command of a 65-55 majority in parliament. A couple of small parties were still teetering along the electoral threshold and fighting for their survival, so the final makeup of the next parliament has yet to be decided. Final results were expected Thursday.” AP

CONGRESS TO GET MUELLER REPORT WITHIN A WEEK -- House Dems forced to scrap budget vote -- HERMAN CAIN’S NOMINATION IN TROUBLE -- Mnuchin clashes with Waters at hearing - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/04/10/congress-to-get-mueller-report-within-a-week-house-dems-forced-to-scrap-budget-vote-herman-cains-nomination-in-trouble-mnuchin-clashes-with-waters-at-hearing-423215,"BARR BUSINESS -- House Democrats got their first crack at grilling Attorney General William Barr over the special counsel’s final Russia report. While there were no major bombshells revealed during yesterday’s hearing (which was supposed to be focused on the DOJ’s budget), Barr’s first public appearance did provide a couple of newsy nuggets. Here are the big takeaways:
Timing: Robert Mueller’s report is expected to be handed over to Congress “within a week”, said Barr, which would put its release over the two-week recess. Democrats are contemplating coming back to Washington if that happens. Incomplete : Barr said lawmakers will be getting a redacted version of the report, saying Congress does not have a right to view sensitive grand jury information — which has infuriated Democrats. But so far, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is holding his fire on a subpoena, report Andrew and Kyle. Declined : Mueller rebuffed a chance to review Barr’s summary of the report before the attorney general sent the letter to Congress. This comes amid reports that some members of the special counsel’s team were frustrated with how Barr summarized the findings. Bias : Barr said he is looking into GOP claims that the origins of the Russia probe were politically motivated. And the attorney general has already assembled a team to review the FBI’s actions in the investigation, reports Bloomberg. Related read: “Newly released testimony: Former top FBI lawyer says agency concerned Trump obstructed justice,” via Kyle: https://politi.co/2uU39aD .
TELL ‘EM BOY, BYE -- House Democrats were forced to cancel an expected vote on a key budget measure because it was facing opposition from both corners of the caucus, report Sarah, Heather and Bres. Progressives, who have been looking to flex their muscles in the new majority, threatened to tank the bill — which would have set federal spending levels — if it didn’t include more money for domestic programs. Moderates, meanwhile, were concerned about the plan’s price tag.
Budget chief John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said he isn’t giving up on the bill quite yet. But it still represents a major setback for Democratic leaders as they head into their annual conference retreat this week and celebrate their first 100 days in power. It also sets an ominous tone for future budget battles, where lawmakers will need to negotiate with the GOP to lift budget caps and raise the debt ceiling. Much more: https://politi.co/2X1RLVV .

COMING ATTRACTIONS -- Republicans are eager to keep Democratic divisions over Israel in the spotlight. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) will start the process today to file a so-called “discharge petition” on legislation condemning anti-Israel boycotts and sanctions, an aide tells your Huddle host. Once the petition is filed in May, they can begin collecting signatures to force a floor vote on the bill. While petitions are a long shot and require 218 signatures to work, Republicans think they can peel off a significant number of Democrats on the issue — and expose some major rifts in the Dem party in the process.
NO CAIN, NO GAIN -- It looks Herman Cain’s nomination to the Federal Reserve is in serious trouble. Republicans have been urging Trump to drop the nomination, warning he will face a difficult confirmation process. Burgess lays out all the reasons why: Cain runs a pro-Trump super PAC and is viewed as a partisan pick, he has been accused of sexual harassment and the GOP is already concerned by Trump’s other nomination to the Fed, Stephen Moore.

TURN TEXAS BLUE -- The House Democratic campaign arm is setting up shop in Texas, the latest sign that the Lone Star state will be a major House battleground in 2020. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced that it will be opening a new satellite office in Austin, which Democrats hope will help them play offense in the increasingly purple state.

Trump to unveil pipeline push - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-energy/2019/04/10/trump-to-unveil-pipeline-push-423333,"With help from Alex Guillén President Donald Trump will unveil executive action today aimed at speeding up the permitting process for pipelines — likely launching another political fight between the administration and blue-state governors.
— Committees in both the House and Senate will take up a spate of energy bills today on energy efficiency and carbon capture and sequestration technologies.
— Bipartisan senators have unveiled new legislation to permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, hoping to squash reoccurring debates over appropriations levels.
WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY! Tamborrino. ClearPath's Darren Goode knew former President William Henry Harrison was the only president who studied to become a doctor. For today: How many states have sent three women to the Senate? TRUMP'S PIPELINE PUSH: The president is in Texas today to unveil long-expected executive orders aimed at speeding up pipeline permitting. The administration is targeting the ability of governors like New York's Andrew Cuomo to use the Clean Water Act to block or delay pipelines and other infrastructure projects, as Pro's Ben Lefebvre and Annie Snider report . Trump will direct EPA to update guidance on states' authority under the Clean Water Act and to begin work on a more formal regulation aimed at ending ""confusion and uncertainty"" about how states are implementing it, a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday. But it would be up to Congress to fundamentally alter that authority, dampening the effect of today's order.
The order also targets activist investors that have pressed oil companies like Exxon Mobil to address climate change, directing the Labor Department to look into whether such funds are complying with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ""The focus of ERISA plan is retirement savings and not other social and political goals,"" the official said.
Trump will sign a second order giving himself ""inherent authority"" over foreign affairs, including cross-border infrastructure permits such as the new one issued last month for the Keystone XL pipeline.
HEADS UP: Questions over the orders could come up today when Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works R.D. James testifies on the Army Corps of Engineers' budget before the Senate Appropriations Energy-Water Subcommittee.
— Also ahead of the announcement, Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso reintroduced S. 1087, the ""Water Quality Certification Improvement Act of 2019."" The bill would narrow the scope of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to limit it to water quality impacts only, and would clarify that states can only consider discharges from federally permitted or licensed activity, not from other sources.

AROUND THE AGENCIES EPA TAKING COMMENT ON CASAC NOMINEES: Nine scientists have been nominated to the single open seat on the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and EPA will take public comment on them until April 30, after which Administrator Andrew Wheeler makes the final pick. The seat opened up after Timothy Lewis retired from the Army Corps of Engineers and asked to leave his CASAC term early. Whoever Wheeler picks will help review the agency's science in ongoing reviews of the ozone and particulate matter standards; CASAC members have been critical of EPA in both cases in recent months.
Who's who: Several of the nominees have experience with ozone, most notably Danica Lombardozzi of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who founded a citizen science ozone data collection project. Seven of the nominees are university professors; the ninth is Bill Jackson, a recent retiree from the U.S. Forest Service, where he worked on air pollution for decades.
ON THE HILL TOP BILLING: The House Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee will hold a hearing this morning on ""investing in America's energy infrastructure,"" where lawmakers will look at several bills related to energy efficiency and a diverse workforce. Assistant DOE Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Dan Simmons and James Campos, director of DOE’s Office of Economic Impact and Diversity, will testify.
One of the bills, H.R. 1315 (116) , from subcommittee Chairman Bobby Rush , would improve workforce-training programs in the energy industry and make it easier for workers to receive wages while they're going through training.
Expect pushback from Republicans on the measure over concerns the bill echoes the Obama administration's green jobs program and uses the term ""minority"" instead of ""underrepresented,"" which Republicans say excludes women and veterans. Previous iterations of the bill also included contributions from Rep. Richard Hudson , who told POLITICO last month he was excluded from this year's bill.
Also this morning: The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will mark up a bill, S. 383 (116) , from Barrasso to support carbon dioxide utilization and direct air capture research, and another from ranking member Tom Carper , S. 747 (116) , to reauthorize the diesel emissions reduction program.
MOVING ALONG: A second House committee advanced Democrats' bill, H.R. 9 (116) , calling on the U.S. to re-enter the Paris climate accord, Pro's Zack Colman reports . No Republicans voted in support of the measure.
SENATORS INTRODUCE LWCF BILL: Senate Energy ranking member Joe Manchin and Republican Sen. Cory Gardner introduced legislation Tuesday that would provide full, mandatory funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund at a level of $900 million. The bill introduced Tuesday and backed by 12 bipartisan senators would nix the requirement that funds must be appropriated. It comes after a year of ups and downs for the landmark conservation program that only recently received permanent reauthorization, while expenditures are left subject to the appropriations process. Read the bill text .
PIPELINE SAFETY GETS SENATE LOOK: The Senate Commerce Transportation and Safety Subcommittee will hold a hearing on pipeline safety this afternoon following a similar hearing last week in the House. Howard ""Skip"" Elliott, administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, will testify today, alongside representatives of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and American Petroleum Institute.

FBI brass discussed possibility Trump fired Comey 'at the behest of' Russia,www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/fbi-trump-comey-russia-1264700,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
James Baker, the former top lawyer of the FBI, said senior bureau officials — including at least one deemed to be free of anti-Trump bias — discussed the possibility in May 2017 that President Donald Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey “at the behest of” the Russian government.
In testimony to two Republican-led committees last October, Baker described mounting concerns that crystallized in the frantic days after the FBI director’s ouster, days that were punctuated by Trump’s on-air declaration that he fired Comey because of the Russia probe and his chummy Oval Office meeting with senior Russian officials, at which he reportedly trashed Comey as a “nut job.” Story Continued Below
Baker described a discussion in those turbulent days that he had with Andrew McCabe — who became acting FBI director after Comey’s departure — and the bureau’s top counterintelligence official Bill Priestap, as well as top national security official Carl Ghattas. He also said it was possible that bureau attorney Lisa Page and counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok — whose anti-Trump text messages have drawn attention from Trump and Republicans — attended the meeting as well.
“So there was — there was a discussion between those folks, possibly all of the folks that you’ve identified, about whether or not President Trump had been ordered to fire Jim Comey by the Russian government?” asked Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), one of the committee members interviewing Baker. Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

“I wouldn’t say ordered. I guess I would say ... acting at the behest of and somehow following directions, somehow executing their will,” he said. “[A]nd so literally an order or not, I don’t know.”
His comments, some of which have been revealed in news reports in recent months, were included in a 152-page transcript of Baker’s testimony to the House Oversight and Judiciary committees in October 2018, when Republicans led an investigation into the handling of the FBI’s Russia probe. The transcript was released Tuesday and Wednesday by the panel’s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who has been incrementally entering testimony from last year’s investigation into the congressional record.
Though Republicans have questioned whether senior FBI officials were collectively biased against Trump — especially McCabe, Strzok and Page — investigators probing questions about bias have noted that there’s “ no evidence” of bias on Priestap’s part. McCabe, Strzok and Page have also denied that their personal views of Trump affected their decisions at the FBI. In the past year, McCabe and Strzok were both fired amid the scrutiny, and Page left the bureau as well. Priestap left the FBI at the end of 2018.
Baker’s comments are also newly relevant as Attorney General William Barr prepares to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on links between Russian and Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Mueller examined whether Trump attempted to obstruct the probe, and Baker’s testimony provides a window into the FBI’s view of that question in the immediate days following Comey’s firing. Mueller, according to a limited excerpt revealed by Barr, declined to reach a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” on whether Trump obstructed justice, but Mueller’s analysis has not been revealed.
Baker said the discussion among the top officials was meant to discuss the range of possibilities behind Trump’s firing of Comey. Acting at Russia’s urging “was one extreme,” he said.
“The other extreme is that the president is completely innocent, and we discussed that too,” Baked noted. “And so — and then you have things in the middle. And so —— so that was how it came up. There’s a range of things this could possibly be. We need to investigate, because we don’t know whether, you know, the worst-case scenario is possibly true or the president is totally innocent and we need to get this thing over with — and so he can move forward with his agenda.”
Baker’s description of this “hypothetical” concern about Trump acting at Russia’s behest also indicated to lawmakers that there were widespread concerns inside the FBI that Trump had attempted to obstruct the bureau’s investigation into his campaign’s links to Russians, according to a newly releasedtranscript of Baker’s testimony.
Under questioning in 2018 by a Democratic committee lawyer, Baker described numerous officials who were distressed that the president might have obstructed justice when he fired Comey in May 2017. Baker said he had personal concerns and that they were shared by not just top FBI brass but within other divisions and at the Justice Department as well."
Trouble at the federal CIO’s office - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2019/04/10/trouble-at-the-federal-cios-office-577520,"With help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak and Alexandra S. Levine
 The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer is afflicted by low morale and confusion about a reorganization. The office helps agencies upgrade their cyber defenses.
— Two out of every three hotel websites leak guests’ personal data. Symantec found a number of reasons why security is poor.
— The Justice Department wants money for countering foreign influence, defending national assets and cyber information sharing. The department detailed its requests in a congressional hearing.
HAPPY WEDNESDAY Do not click on this unless you are prepared to be horrified.
Driving the Day NOT A GREAT SIGN — The White House office that helps agencies upgrade their IT systems and improve cybersecurity is floundering amid low morale, confusion about a recent reorganization and grumbling about inaccessible leaders, Eric reported in a story for Pros published Tuesday. The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, housed within OMB, is grappling with “high turnover,” “a lot of infighting,” a “crushing workload” and “inaction from leadership,” according to a current OMB employee familiar with the situation. The employee said there was “real concern at the staff level that if this continues, something bad will happen and we won’t be ready for it.”
OFCIO employees aren’t getting enough clarity from leadership about what their priorities should be, according to sources and internal staff survey data obtained by POLITICO — a major problem in a 30-person office constantly overwhelmed by the magnitude of federal IT issues. The November reorganization, conducted after an outside consultant recommended major changes to the long-beleaguered office, only increased confusion and frustrations. Employees from other OMB offices and other agencies regularly seek guidance that OFCIO staffers can’t provide, because key issues remain unresolved.
The turmoil could eventually disrupt efforts to coordinate government-wide security upgrades, according to the OMB employee, five former OFCIO staffers and three former senior IT and cyber officials. “This organization looks like it’s in free fall,” said one former official. Pros can read the story here .
CAPTAIN OBVIOUS: ‘THIS IS BAD’ — Two out of every three hotel websites unwittingly share guests’ personal data, including credit card information and passport numbers, to third-party sites, according to research out today from Symantec. Hackers could use that information to track a person’s movements and potentially grant them physical access to a victim’s location, the firm warns.
The breaches occur for a variety of reasons, including the fact that 57 percent of hotel websites send a confirmation email to customers with a direct access link to their booking that also features ads, which allows the direct sharing of information with others. Meanwhile, only 29 percent of sites used encrypted links, which could allow a potential attacker to steal customer credentials. The research was based on an analysis of more than 1,500 hotels in 54 countries spread across five continents, according to Symantec.
THE SAUCE ON DDoS — With cryptomining benefits on the decline, cyber attackers were more inclined to employ DDoS attacks in 2018, according to a report out this morning from NSFOCUS. However, the total number of DDoS attacks fell 28 percent from 2017, the company found. Most used DDoS only, but 13 percent combined attack methods. And of all attack types, 25 percent of attackers were repeat offenders responsible for 40 percent of attacks.
FEMA, CYBER, AGAIN — FEMA’s grant management system was at “increased risk of exploits” because it didn’t follow all DHS cybersecurity guidance, a watchdog report released Tuesday concluded. Although FEMA does follow most of that guidance, according to the Government Accountability Office, it didn’t initially have corrective action plans for 13 medium and low-risk vulnerabilities. After the GAO audit, FEMA did develop such plans. FEMA recently suffered a data breach that exposed millions of disaster victims’ sensitive information.
DOJ SEEKS CYBER MOOLA — The Justice Department needs more money to improve FBI cyber information sharing, FBI cyber tools and DOJ security monitoring, Attorney General William Barr told House appropriators in prepared testimony Tuesday. DOJ also wants money for the FBI to help fight counterintelligence threats from other nations and criminals who employ cyberattacks. ""These resources will allow the Department to combat these growing and serious threats by bolstering cyber investigative and collaborative capabilities and capacities,"" he said, adding that the department was requesting other funds to keep foreign spy agencies from accessing sensitive information on technology and to defend national assets against cyber threats.

You know who that is? It’s me,” Trump told reporters of his immigration agenda.
Story Continued Below
But the president also complimented Miller,saying he’s “a wonderful person” and “a brilliant man.”
“Stephen is an excellent guy,” Trump said. “People don’t know him. He has been with me from the beginning.”
Miller is reportedly aggressively pushing for a widespread DHS shakeup to help enact controversial new steps to curb illegal immigration.

Trump’s immigration plans face likely turbulence in courts By TED HESSON
So far, the White House has pushed out Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles and Homeland Security acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady. He’s also yanked the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Miller is reportedly looking to create tent cities along the border to house migrants and has pushed for an updated version of the family separation policy.
The president, however, claimed on Tuesday that the White House is not looking to reimpose the family separation policy, which was heavily criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike."
Trump: Likely Netanyahu reelection means 'better chance' of Middle East peace,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-netanyhu-reelection-israel-1265205,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump on Wednesday predicted that his administration’s goal of bringing peace to the Middle East has a better shot at success now that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely going to be reelected.
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump congratulated one of his closest international allies on his likely victory in the tight race. Story Continued Below
“It may be a little early but I'm hearing he’s won it and won it in good fashion. So he has been a great ally. He is a friend. I would like to congratulate him,” he said, referring to the prime minister by his nickname. “That was a well fought-out race I can tell you. But it looks like Bibi has won that race.”
Trump, who welcomed Netanyahu to the White House shortly before Tuesday’s elections, cast the prime minister's win for a fifth term as a promising development for his administration’s plan to strike a peace deal between Israel and Palestine.

“The fact that Bibi won, I think we'll see some pretty good action in terms of peace,” he said. “Look, everyone said — and I never made it a promise — but everybody said you can't have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians. I think we have a chance. I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won.”
The administration has yet to release its blueprint for the deal that has eluded U.S. leaders for decades, but has said it would do so after Israel’s elections.
On Wednesday, national security adviser John Bolton suggested that the plan would be unveiled imminently now that Netanyahu is likely to remain in power.
“We’ve been in the preparatory stages to getting it ready. And I think we’re going to see that coming out in the very near future,” he told conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt. Bibi’s reelection “opens all kinds of prospects,” he noted.
While Netanyahu's reelection signals consistency for the friendly relationship between the U.S. and Israel, the prime minister still faces the hurdle of potentially being indicted on corruption charges later this year, while Trump faces the looming prospect of being hammered by Democratic investigations into his presidency.
Despite Netanyahu’s legal troubles, the Associated Press reported that unofficial election returns indicate the prime minister and his party will have solid control over the country’s parliament.
But the elusive prospect for peace as envisioned by the White House, which has indicated support for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, stands to clash with Netanyahu’s election eve promise to annex parts of the Israeli occupied West Bank, long a contentious issue.
Later Wednesday, Trump posted a photo on Twitter that appeared to show supporters waving Trump campaign flags at an election night victory party for Netanyahu."
Trump calls Mueller probe an 'attempted coup',www.politico.com,REBECCA MORIN,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-mueller-probe-attempted-coup-1264714,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday called special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation an ""attempted coup"" intended to remove him from office. ""It was an illegal investigation. It was started illegally. Everything about it was crooked,"" the president told reporters outside the White House before departing on a day trip to Texas. The president also claimed Mueller and his investigators, charged with probing allegations that the president's 2016 campaign colluded with the Russian government, ""were people that truly hated Donald Trump.""
Story Continued Below
""This was an attempted coup,"" he continued. ""This was an attempted takedown of a president, and we beat them.""
Trump has long derided Mueller's probe as a ""witch hunt"" and accused the former FBI director of building a team stacked with Democrats. Mueller, a registered Republican, submitted a report on his two-year long investigation last month.
Attorney General William Barr, in a summary of the report, wrote that Mueller didn't find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. The attorney general also wrote that Mueller did not fully exonerate Trump in an obstruction of justice inquiry, but Barr added that he did not believe there was enough evidence to bring charges on the matter.

The president, responding to Barr's ostensible exoneration of the president, said Mueller acted honorably in conducting his investigation. Trump has since called for an investigation into how Mueller's probe began. The president previously said that he would like to see the full Mueller report released, but Trump has since backpedaled somewhat from that position.
Several members of Mueller's team, however, have disputed Barr's assessment of the investigation.
Democrats have urged Barr to release the more than 300-page report. Barr on Tuesday said a redacted report will be released within a week, an assurance that fell short of placating Democrats who want unfettered access to all of Mueller's findings as well as related information from a federal grand jury.
Trump said he has not seen or read the report.
""As far as I'm concerned, I don't care about the Mueller report,"" the president said."
De Blasio cites 'urgent steps' in declaring public health emergency for measles,www.politico.com,aeisenberg@politico.com (Amanda Eisenberg),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/09/de-blasio-cites-urgent-steps-in-declaring-public-health-emergency-for-measles-959225,"“Children are in danger. We have to take this seriously,” de Blasio said at the Brooklyn library’s Williamsburg branch. “We’re taking urgent steps right now to make sure we can stop this.” | AP Photo De Blasio cites 'urgent steps' in declaring public health emergency for measles
Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency in Williamsburg, the epicenter of the city’s worst measles outbreak in a generation, on Tuesday morning.
The emergency order mandates that both adults and children who may have been in contact with infected patients get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine or face a $1,000 fine, according to the city. The city will be making unannounced visits to yeshivas and inspecting school records to determine which children have not been vaccinated, officials said.
The order also allows the city to issue violations and fines to yeshivas and day care centers that allow unvaccinated children on the premises, the mayor said.
“Children are in danger. We have to take this seriously,” de Blasio said at the Brooklyn library’s Williamsburg branch. “We’re taking urgent steps right now to make sure we can stop this.”
“Disease detectives” from the city health department will interview New Yorkers with measles symptoms and find out everyone they’ve been in contact with to make sure those people are vaccinated, de Blasio said.
The city is offering low- and no-cost vaccines, said Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, adding the city health department has doubled the estimated number of people in Williamsburg and Borough Park who need vaccinations. The declaration comes ahead of the Passover celebration where family celebrations heighten the risk of spreading the disease.
More than 280 people in New York City have contracted measles since October 2018 — the largest outbreak of the preventable disease since 1991. Most of the 285 cases occurred in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn.
Of the 285 cases, the vast majority are children under the age of 18. The disease can cause swelling of the brain and lungs, and children under the age of 5 can develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a progressive neurological disorder, if they contract measles.
Twenty-one people have been hospitalized from the disease.
Some parents in the Orthodox Jewish community are rumored to be holding “measles parties” where they bring children together to contract the highly contagious disease, said Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio.
“Exposing your unvaccinated child to measles is very dangerous, and it could be deadly,” Palacio said.
Barbot added that the best way to keep children safe is to get them vaccinated.
The city has sent out physical mailings and robocalls to 30,000 households in Yiddish to educate the community about vaccines, Barbot said. The city has also advertised in Yiddish newspapers, officials said.
“The point here is to make sure that we maximize the number of people who have accurate information,” Barbot said.
The city health department issued a directive in December for more than 250 yeshivas and day care centers to keep unvaccinated students out of class. Five yeshivas flouted that mandate, which led to more children contracting the preventable disease.
Now, those schools are subject to commissioner’s orders and on Monday, the city threatened to close yeshivas that ignore the directive — an unprecedented move by the health department.
“Schools that do not help us ... if they persist in allowing this danger to continue, we have the option to close them for a period of time,” de Blasio said.
It is the first time in recent history that the city declared a public health emergency around measles, Palacio said.
The city said it is confident that the executive order will not be challenged. Rockland County’s state of emergency was recently overturned by a judge.
Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, agreed that the executive order is justifiable to quell the outbreak but that singling out zip codes might make the decision contentious.
“It was unwise of the Mayor to single out specific zip codes. This could be viewed as discriminatory, and opens the city up to the criticism that it is targeting specific religious groups,"" Gostin said in a written statement. “It could also create a backlash against vaccines by religious communities who could believe they are being victimized.”
Rockland County’s state of emergency, which Gostin said was “overly restrictive of individual liberty,” was recently overturned by a judge."

A majority of voters in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ’s district still like her, even if they don’t personally identify as Democratic socialists and wish Amazon hadn’t reneged on its deal to come to Queens, according to a new Siena poll released Wednesday.
The poll shows the 29-year-old freshman congresswoman, whose outspokenness and media savvy have catapulted her to stardom on the left and drawn scorn on the right, has a 52-33 percent favorability rating in the 14th Congressional district, several months into her term. She has already become well known, where only 15 percent of voters said they didn’t have an opinion about her. Sixty-five percent of voters said they’d been following the wall-to-wall coverage of their Congresswoman across multiple media platforms “very closely” or “somewhat closely.”
She has the highest net favorability rating out of a group of eight high-profile politicians, including New York’s Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Donald Trump, and former Rep. Joe Crowley, whom she defeated in last year’s June Democratic primary elections.
Crowley represented the district for 20 years, but 38 percent of voters said they didn’t know enough to have an opinion of him.
Among Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez’s favorability is 65-22 percent. Her favorability is also higher among black and Latino constituents, 64 percent of whom approve of her. Just 45 percent of white voters said they had a favorable view of her, though. And she does better with younger voters than older ones. Her favorability rating among voters under 35 stands at 63-18, while voters over age 55 are split, 45-42 percent.
Ocasio-Cortez has described herself as a “Democratic Socialist,” but most of her constituents wouldn’t use that term to describe themselves, even if they agree with many of her policy ideas. Just 25 percent said they identified as “Democratic Socialist,” while 70 percent of voters said they’d call themselves something else.
But even if they disagree with the label, Ocasio-Cortez's constituents largely agree with her policy positions. Forty-three percent support taxing income above $10 million at a rate of 60 percent or more. Fifty-two percent are in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump. Seventy-five percent favor banning assault weapons. Seventy-three percent favor a federal guarantee of a job that pays a living wage, 76 percent favor free tuition at public universities and 75 percent favor Medicare for All.
The proposal she’s become most identified with — a plan to address climate change and create new jobs, called The Green New Deal — was less popular, with 41 percent in favor of it and 20 percent opposed. Thirty-eight percent said they didn’t know enough about it to have an opinion.
Voters also disagree with Ocasio-Cortez’s opposition to Amazon’s plans to build a huge new facility in Long Island City. Fifty-seven percent said they thought the company’s decision to pull out of the deal was “bad for New York” and 58 percent said they supported Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other elected officials’ attempts to woo the company back.
The poll, which sampled 607 registered district voters between March 31 and April 4 this year, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percent."
How Amy Astley learned to be a boss,www.politico.com,ZACK STANTON,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/amy-astley-architectural-digest-anna-wintour-1263654,"Subscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here . | Subscribe via Spotify here .
Amy Astley’s workday is a whirlwind. The editor-in-chief of Architectural Digest , her job is nonstop — business breakfasts, meetings with staff, an endless array of emails that she proudly responds to “until I pass out” at night.
It’s a pace that many would find daunting. But there’s a reason why Astley thinks it’s important: it shows her staff that she’s in the foxhole with them. And there’s an example Astley has in mind as she thinks about how to lead: Anna Wintour, the legendary Vogue editor who mentored her.
You hear the name “Anna Wintour,” and Astley knows what you imagine: Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada,” whose character is a relentlessly demanding boss. But in real life, Astley says it’s not quite that simple.
“They’re caricatures, they’re stereotypes,” Astley said in an interview for POLITICO’s Women Rule podcast . “This is a businessperson successfully running a business. It’s not easy. And some of those things that were heaped upon her, you don’t see it heaped upon men as much.”
Astley has led AD through something of a renaissance — dramatically expanding its digital business, launching new products and rejuvenating the century-old brand.
Working in the world of style and fashion journalism, Astley sees her role as reflecting on the culture and illuminating why certain things are important to society. And that makes politics an unavoidable topic — even if you’re not intentionally being political.
“I had Ricky Martin on the cover [of Architectural Digest] with his husband and his two kids … in their house in L.A.,” Astley said. “They were barefoot, casual. I didn’t really give it two thoughts because to me, they’re just a fabulous couple — beautiful family, great house. I had a lot of letters thanking me for just presenting them as a gay couple without putting any politics around it or pointing it out in any way, and it didn’t really occur to me that we would single them out in any way; to me, they were a family. That’s political.”
She came to the job after 13 years as Teen Vogue’s founding editor-in-chief — a position she was hand-picked for after a decade spent at its parent publication, Vogue. Astley credits her success at the top of the publishing world to the lessons she learned from Wintour’s example.
“She is a person who works all the time … and I have tried to bring that to all my jobs,” she said. “You see that she’s in it with you, working really, really hard. We all know of bosses who, like, don’t really come to work. And it’s not a positive.”
“I really learned watching her be relentless: Keep trying things; do new things,” Astley said. “Don’t worry if people say negative things about you. If something fails, carry on.”
For Astley, one of those “new things” was launching Teen Vogue in 2003 with a decidedly different perspective than other publications aimed at girls and young women.
“My thinking was feminist, to be honest. I wanted the magazine to be about the life and the well-being of the young woman,” she said. “It wasn’t about how to kiss or … silly quizzes or how to dress to attract boys. I didn’t want any of that. I didn’t want it to be about how you are in relation to men; how you attract them, how you make them happy, how you please them. [That’s] so dated, but that is still what teen magazines were largely doing at that point.”
Young women responded, and the magazine quickly became one of the most circulated in the publishing world and blazed a path for the rush of woman-positive media that followed — which Astley credits to the generation of people who followed her and “were able to deepen and continue that work.”
In that way, Astley herself became a model for young women pursuing leadership, much as Wintour was for her.
“I know what my staff thinks about me and they know what I think about them,” Astley said. “I think they’re the best, and I support them and I feel that comes back to me, and that’s why I’ve had a good career and have been able to make good products.”
“My team that I built, they know that I’m working hand-in-hand with them, and they know that I respect them and care about them. … It’s that simple. Respect, it all comes to respect.”

Barr: I think FBI spying on Trump campaign ‘did occur’,www.politico.com,ANDREW DESIDERIO,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/barr-fbi-spying-trump-campaign-1266531,"The nation’s top law enforcement official on Wednesday appeared to back up President Donald Trump’s assertion that the Justice Department “spied” on his presidential campaign — an explosive comment that heightened partisan tensions ahead of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. During his second day of Capitol Hill testimony this week, Attorney General William Barr also suggested that the Justice Department was gearing up to investigate the genesis of the counterintelligence probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — a key rallying cry for Trump and his congressional allies that comes amid the president’s consistent claims that the Mueller report exonerates him.
Story Continued Below
“Spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee during a hearing about the Justice Department’s budget. “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”
Barr’s statements are certain to please Trump, who said earlier Wednesday that the FBI’s decision to launch such an investigation amounted to an “attempted coup.” The president has long decried the counterintelligence probe as a “witch hunt” that was launched by officials who were biased against him, citing the approval of a surveillance warrant for Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.
Congressional Democrats blasted Barr’s claim and accused him of spreading a debunked plot.
“Barr knows how counterintel investigations work. He knows there was ample evidence of Russian attempts to infiltrate the Trump campaign and that the FBI took lawful action to stop it,” Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted. “Giving a wink and a nod to this long-debunked ‘spying’ conspiracy theory is irresponsible.”
There is no evidence that officials were “spying” on the president’s campaign, and the warrant was approved after Page had left the campaign. The Justice Department’s inspector general is already investigating whether the warrant process was abused. Barr previously said that probe was slated to wrap up in May or June.

“I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now,” Barr later said. “I do have questions about it.”
When pressed by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) about his use of the word “spying,” Barr clarified: “I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.”
“I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I am saying I am concerned about it and looking into it,” Barr added. “I believe there is a basis for my concern. But I’m not going to discuss the basis.”
The attorney general said he has not yet set up a team to investigate the origins of the probe. While Barr said he would not launch an investigation into the FBI over the alleged spying, he said it was likely that there was a “failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.”
“I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the FBI,” Barr said.
Democrats said Barr’s comments suggested he was trying to do Trump’s bidding.
“It’s very concerning when the top law enforcement officer in the country uses incendiary language like that. That’s the kind of thing you hear the president say at his rallies, when he’s advocating a deep-state coup attempt. It ought to concern all of us,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told Politico.
“He was unclear in his remarks,” Schiff added. “But all Americans should be concerned if this represents what we urge new democracies not to do and that is when you win, investigate or persecute your political rivals.”
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Barr’s remarks “directly contradict what DOJ previously told us,” adding that he has asked the Justice Department for an immediate briefing.
Barr’s Senate testimony was his second Capitol Hill appearance in as many days, as the attorney general prepares to release a redacted version of Mueller’s highly anticipated report within the next week.
Barr infuriated lawmakers on Tuesday when he said he would not turn over the report to Congress, defying Democrats’ demands to see not only Mueller’s full report but also the underlying evidence. The attorney general also said he would not seek a court order to release top-secret grand jury information, and that Congress has no inherent authority to view grand jury information.
On Wednesday, Barr promised again to work with Nadler and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) if they seek to view some of the redacted portions of the report. But he said grand jury information is the “most inflexible” category for a speedy release.
“I am willing to work with the Judiciary committees to see if there is a workaround that could address any concerns or needs that they have,” Barr said.

Barr: Mueller turned down offer to review Russia probe findings By KYLE CHENEY and ANDREW DESIDERIO
Barr told senators that one of his four categories for redactions — to protect the reputations and privacy of “peripheral third parties” — would not apply to the president, who has changed his tune in recent days about his desire to see the full report made public.
“No,” Barr said when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked whether he would redact damaging information about the president. Barr said those redactions apply only to “people in private life, not public officeholders.”
In his four-page summary, Barr wrote that Mueller could not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Barr also noted that Mueller uncovered evidence of obstruction of justice on the part of the president, but he dismissed the possibility of filing charges, saying it wasn’t clear that Trump’s “intent” was to obstruct the investigation.
Barr told Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) that he had a conversation with Mueller about why he did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question. When asked if Mueller sought to leave it to Congress to decide whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr said: “He didn’t say that to me.” When asked whether Mueller believed the decision should be up to the attorney general, Barr said: “He didn’t say that either. But that’s generally how the Department of Justice works.”
Barr declined to go into further detail, citing the imminent release of the redacted report. But he later said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — who helped Barr prepare the four-page memo — agreed with his conclusion on obstruction. Barr said he did not know whether Mueller himself backed that conclusion.
Nadler said Tuesday he would hold off on issuing a subpoena for the full report and the underlying evidence, but that he expects to issue one “in short order.” The committee voted last week to give Nadler the authority to subpoena the report.

Paul to Pompeo: You do not have ‘permission’ for war with Iran,www.politico.com,NAHAL TOOSI,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/pompeo-rand-paul-iran-war-1266526,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Sen. Rand Paul on Wednesday warned the Trump administration not to go to war with Iran, at least not without getting permission from Congress.
The libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican spoke directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Story Continued Below
He asked Pompeo if the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which allowed for U.S. troops to fight entities responsible for the 9/11 attacks and associated forces, included Iran.
Pompeo declined to directly answer the question, saying he’d defer to lawyers, but stated that there is “no doubt there’s a connection” between the Iranian government and al-Qaeda, the terrorist group behind the 2001 attacks.
“You do not have the permission of Congress to go to war with Iran,” Paul responded, while chiding Pompeo for trying to deflect the question. “Only Congress can declare war.”
Pompeo was testifying before the Republican-controlled committee, a session that came the same week President Donald Trump designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization, prompting concerns about future clashes between the U.S. and Iranian-backed forces.

The hearing was supposed to focus on the Trump administration’s proposal to slash the State Department budget by about a fourth. But lawmakers from both parties have dismissed the Trump administration’s budget proposal, saying it was a non-starter the way past such Trump plans have been.
Instead they zoomed in on other subjects, from the administration’s strategy in Afghanistan to its struggles to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
Pressed by Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland on whether the North Koreans have taken meaningful steps to share details of their nuclear program, Pompeo instead tried to switch the topic to Iran, alleging that what the Iranians had shared as part of the Iran nuclear deal was “a total fraud.” The Trump administration has pulled out of that nuclear deal.
Cardin noted he was talking about North Korea, not Iran, then asked if international inspectors were on the ground in North Korea examining its nuclear program, the way they were in Iran. Pompeo said they were not.
Senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concern about China’s rising global influence and the potential harm it could cause to U.S. interests.
Pompeo agreed with their assessments of the threat and insisted that the Trump administration is keen on countering China’s activities in cyberspace and beyond.
One especially testy moment came when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire who is the only woman on the committee, pressed Pompeo on whether the U.S. would insist that Afghan women be given a significant role in ongoing peace talks with the Taliban.
Pompeo wouldn’t commit to such action, but he stressed that the welfare of Afghan women was a priority, especially given the Taliban’s brutal treatment of women when they ran Afghanistan.
Shaheen appeared frustrated with Pompeo’s answer. “This is half the population of the country,” she said.
“I hope they will make their voices heard,” he said.
The secretary of state was similarly unwilling to be pinned down on another sensitive subject: the Israeli-Palestinian crisis."

 Organized labor will slow-walk its 2020 endorsements.
— Former McDonald's chief raps McDonald's for pledge to no longer lobby against minimum wage hikes.
GOOD MORNING! It’s Wednesday, April 10, ANOTHER SHOE DROPS AT DHS: Claire Grady, acting deputy secretary at the Homeland Security Department, resigned effective today, departing DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted early Tuesday evening. For those keeping score, this is the fourth DHS departure in five days, following Monday's removal of Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles; Nielsen's own announced resignation Sunday; and the White House's withdrawal Friday of Ron Vitiello to be director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Still awaiting removal, according to administration officials, are USCIS director Lee Francis Cissna and DHS General Counsel John Mitnik. White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, a hard-line immigration restrictionist, is driving the shakeup, which President Donald Trump doesn't wish to hear described as a housecleaning. ""I never said I was cleaning house,"" the president said Tuesday. ""I don't know who came up with that expression. We have a lot of great people over there.""
Grady's departure is the consequence of a federal statute that requires Grady, as acting deputy, to replace temporarily the departing Nielsen; since President Donald Trump has already designated Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to be acting secretary, Grady had to be made unavailable.

LABOR SLOW-WALKS 2020: As Democratic presidential contenders line up today to address a D.C. gathering of North America's Building Trades Unions, labor leaders are reluctant at this early stage to choose among them, POLITICO's Ian Kullgren and Natasha Korecki report. “Everybody’s kind of taking a step back,” said Steve Rosenthal, a former political director for the AFL-CIO who's advising unions on 2020 campaigns. “I don't see ... any movement toward any type of major endorsements.”
More than a dozen national unions endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2015, including the American Federation of Teachers and the SEIU. That prompted criticism from the rank and file as Bernie Sanders' presidential bid gained momentum. Then, of course, Clinton lost in November, at least partly because she scored the narrowest majority of union households seen by any Democratic presidential candidate since Walter Mondale in 1984. Now organized labor says it won't make that mistake again. ""There’s no process in place. We’re not making any endorsements,” said Sean McGarvey, president of the North America’s Building Trades Unions. “We don’t see ourselves making any endorsements any time early … if at all.” More here .
DEMS INTRODUCE HARASSMENT BILL: In the first presidential election of the #MeToo era, Democratic presidential candidates lined up Tuesday behind a broad proposal to strengthen protections against workplace harassment, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. The legislation, introduced Tuesday by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), would eliminate the tipped minimum wage, bar mandatory arbitration and pre-employment non-disclosure agreements, and extend civil rights protections for LGBT workers. The bill would also extend federal protections against harassment to independent contractors and interns.
Sens. Amy Klobuchar , Kamala Harris , Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand , Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all signed on to the bill, which for some of them cuts close to the bone. Sanders , Harris , Gillibrand , and Klobuchar have all been accused of presiding over, tolerating, or contributing to various types of hostile work environments. “They know they are under the microscope when it comes to sexual harassment,” Ollstein writes, “Their campaigns have implemented mandatory trainings, set up anonymous hotlines for staff to report misconduct, and rigorously screened new hires for any history of past accusations.” More here .
KENNEDY BILL BARS NDAS IN HARASSMENT SETTLEMENTS: Republican Sen. John Kennedy is preparing to introduce legislation to disallow non-disclosure agreements in sexual harassment settlements if the alleged perpetrator is a public official or a public employee, POLITICO’s Marianne LeVine reports .
AT THE BORDER WH TO APPEAL 'REMAIN IN MEXICO' LOSS: The White House said in a statement Tuesday that it will appeal a Monday court ruling halting ’s ""remain in Mexico"" policy on the grounds that the ""cooperative program"" was ""extensively negotiated with the government of Mexico."" (Mexico has insisted it was a unilateral move by the U.S.) A San Francisco-based judge issued a preliminary injunction Monday against the administration's policy of forcing certain non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico during their court proceedings. ""This action gravely undermines the President’s ability to address the crisis at the border with the tools Congress has authorized and disrupts the conduct of our foreign affairs,"" the statement from the White House said.

Wages BANK OF AMERICA HIKES MINIMUM TO $20: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan announced Tuesday that the bank will increase its hourly minimum wage to $20 over the next two years, POLITICO’s Victoria Guida reports. “If you get a job at Bank of America, you’ll make $41,000,"" Moynihan said on MSNBC, up from a current hourly minimum of about $16. In response, SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a written statement: “Bank of America is racing to raise wages for their lowest-paid employees thanks to the brave workers in the Fight for $15 and a union movement whose strikes, protests, and organizing on the job have made $15 and a union a demand that cannot be ignored.""
The announcement came one day before Moynihan was set to appear before the House Financial Services Committee, where Democratic lawmakers are expected to excoriate corporate leaders for not passing tax-cut savings on to their employees. “From last summer to this summer, Bank of America will buy back more than $20 billion of its own stock,” Guida notes.

FORMER MCDONALD’S CEO RAPS WAGE MOVE: Ed Rensi, who was chief executive and president of McDonald’s Corp. in the 1990s, doesn't approve of the fast-food chain’s March pledge not to lobby against minimum-wage hikes. “McDonald's pursued a path of political correctness,"" Rensi wrote Tuesday in Forbes, ""leaving policymakers, state restaurant associations, and franchisees unsure where it stands on radical wage proposals"" and “providing a public relations coup for its detractors at the Service Employees International Union.” POLITICO’s Rebecca Rainey broke the news in March that McDonald's was halting its lobby efforts on minimum wage at all levels of government.
McDonald's' declaration, Rensi wrote, blindsided McDonald’s franchisees who were already “seeing their equity dwindle and margins squeezed.” Rensi's most interesting point: ""The corporation benefits when mandates force its franchisees to charge higher prices,"" because McDonald's Corp. ""receives a portion of all sales as a percentage of rent and franchise fees."" Read Rensi's piece here .
ON THE HILL AWKWARD AT APPROPRIATIONS: The House Homeland Security appropriations panel postponed indefinitely a hearing scheduled for today with Acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello, following the White House's decision Friday to withdraw Vitiello’s nomination to lead the agency on a permanent basis. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), who chairs the subcommittee, said in a written statement: “It is unfortunate that the president is impulsively robbing the department of so much of its leadership at a time when it is more important than ever for Congress to hold the department accountable for its actions.”
Inside the Agencies ROBOTS AT WALMART: In an effort to keep up with Amazon, mega-retailer Walmart is adding more machines and robots to its stores to take over tasks such as cleaning and sorting products that come off trucks, Sarah Nassauer and Chip Cutter report for the Wall Street Journal. This year the company plans to add “autonomous floor scrubbers” in 1,500 of its 4,600 stores, and machines that scan shelves in at least 300. “The company said the addition of a single machine can cut a few hours a day of work previously done by a human, or allow Walmart to allocate fewer people to complete a task,” they write.

Driving the Day DEVOS TO FACE HOUSE DEMOCRATS TODAY: Expect fireworks when the Education secretary appears for the first time before the House Education and Labor Committee since Democrats gained control of the chamber this year. She returns to Capitol Hill about two weeks after generating a stir at separate appearances before House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees — particularly over the Trump administration's budget proposal that sought to cut $17.6 million from a Special Olympics education program.
— During the hearing, Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) is expected to challenge DeVos for what he sees as the department's ""lack of transparency"" in answering questions on a host of K-12 and higher education matters — including the department's position pertaining to using federal funds to arm teachers.
— ""In August 2018, we asked the Department to clarify its position on the use of taxpayer money to arm teachers, which has left a dangerous opening for school districts to use federal education funding to put firearms in classrooms. We have not received a substantive explanation of its position,"" Scott is expected to say, according to his prepared remarks.

RESHUFFLING THE FEDERAL STUDENT AID OFFICE: The Trump administration is planning a major reorganization of the Education Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid. The department will significantly reduce number of senior officials who serve on the FSA executive committee and who report directly to the head of the office, according to a plan presented during a staff meeting on Tuesday and reviewed by POLITICO.
— Senior officials began developing the Federal Student Aid reorganization last October , and DeVos signed off on the plan last week, according to the presentation slides.
— Under the plan, fewer senior officials will report directly to Mark Brown, the new chief operating officer whom DeVos appointed last month. The 18-member executive committee of senior leaders will be reduced to eight members, including Brown, to make it “a smaller, decision-focused body,” according to the presentation slides.
— The executive committee will consist of four new deputy chief operating officers: A. Wayne Johnson, deputy for strategy, innovation, and transformation; Michael Dean, deputy for strategic measures and outcomes; Robin Minor, deputy for partner participation and oversight; and Chris Greene, deputy for customer experience. It will also include senior advisers John Kane and Julian Schmoke Jr. as well as a spot for a new chief of staff. Michael Stratford has more .

— A timely announcement by DOT that it will hand out $1.36 billion in Capital Investment Grants could help Elaine Chao have a smoother House appearance today.
— Senate leaders are hoping to have a surface transportation reauthorization bill out of committee before the August recess.
— House Democrats say the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to TSA and the Coast Guard would leave the country vulnerable to security threats.
IT’S WEDNESDAY:
""The sun shines / And people forget / The spray flies as the speedboat glides / And people forget.""
Transit CIG FOR YOU AND ME: FTA announced Tuesday that it is handing out $1.36 billion in Capital Investment Grants funding, including $225 million to five new bus rapid transit projects. The five new projects included are in Jacksonville, Reno, Albany, Portland and Spokane. As our Tanya Snyder reports , lawmakers have pressured the agency to release CIG funds faster, and Chao is (or was) likely to face questions about the pace when she testifies about the administration's fiscal 2020 budget request on Capitol Hill today. If last month’s Senate Appropriations hearing is anything to go by, this week’s appearance in front of the House’s spending committee could also be consumed by questions about the FAA’s certification and grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.
Infrastructure THE ON RAMP: Senate committee leaders have their sights set on an ambitious timeline for the surface transportation reauthorization, which is due by next September, Tanya reports . Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) is hoping to pass a bill through the committee before the August recess, and ranking member Tom Carper (D-Del.) is on board. ""In the past we've sometimes waited till too late,"" Carper said. ""I'd rather be too early than too late."" It remains to be seen how that approach will mesh with that taken by the House, where Democrats are planning to advance a broader infrastructure bill later this year. Barrasso said that should be phase two, after passing the reauthorization (phase one).
PELOSI'S READY: Speaking before a building trades union's national legislative conference Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats are ready to ""get to work, advancing an historic, at least $1 trillion plan"" on infrastructure. She also gave a nod to rhetorical jockeying over the Green New Deal, saying ""I think we should have a green ideal. Take the best of what we all have to offer to build the infrastructure in a green way to preserve our planet, that creates jobs.""

Security DEAD ON ARRIVAL: House Democrats said Tuesday they will fight the administration’s proposed budget cuts to TSA and the Coast Guard, saying the reductions would jeopardize the country’s security, our Stephanie Beasley writes . Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) said at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing that TSA would “struggle” under the cuts and they would leave America vulnerable to attacks.
Hurry it up: Lawmakers also pressed TSA to speed up its deployment of computed tomography scanners in airports. Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) called the current rate is “completely unacceptable.” Agency chief David Pekoske said he expects 75 new scanners this year and 225 more in 2020.
Aviation AIRLINES FRET OVER PROLONGED BOEING GROUNDING: United Airlines is having to use larger airplanes on routes usually flown by the grounded Boeing 737 MAX, costing the carrier money in the short-term, President Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees Tuesday. “Of course, we can’t keep this up forever,” Kirby said, according to Reuters . The CEO of Delta Air Lines, which doesn’t fly the MAX, is worrying about long-term effects, too. “I hope it doesn’t set us back as an industry,” Ed Bastian said Tuesday at an event covered by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. While Bastian said he's ""confident” Boeing will solve its problems, he noted the two recent crashes will “open up a lot of questions” about the relationship between FAA regulators and the industry.
AROUND THE WORLD: Here are the countries whose aviation safety agencies will take part in a joint review of the 737 MAX, as our Brianna Gurciullo confirmed with the FAA Tuesday: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Ethiopia, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, Indonesia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The review will be headed by former NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart.
WRITE IN: Drone giant DJI is urging professional operators in the U.S. to submit comments to the FAA on its proposed new rules for drones to fly at night and over people. Fewer than 100 people have commented on that rulemaking, and the feedback period ends next week. “Given how vital these rules are for every professional drone pilot in America, it is surprising to see how few comments have been received,” DJI Vice President Brendan Schulman said.
Safety DRUG-ADDLED: Lawmakers peppered witnesses at Tuesday’s House Transportation Committee hearing on highway safety with questions about drugged driving. “Everybody, I think, intuitively knows that marijuana influence does slow down your thinking ability and your ability to process more than one thing at a time,” said Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.). “We got to do a lot more on the marijuana situation.” Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) noted that while about 30 percent of traffic fatalities are associated with impaired driving, DUI arrests have gone down. Whether it’s an enforcement problem or an education problem, Garamendi mused, “that probably means money.”
Here’s how you can spend that money: NTSB board member (and former Democratic House Transportation Committee staffer) Jennifer Homendy testified that “the difficulty with drugs is that there’s no impairment standard,” and NTSB has recommended that DOT work with HHS to develop one. “In the meantime, we’ve recommended that NHTSA issue guidance to states that tells law enforcement officers when to test, what drugs to test for, how to test and cutoff levels to help determine impairment,” Homendy said. She gave a shoutout to NHTSA’s advanced classroom and field trainings for law enforcement officers that go beyond the basic field sobriety testing to teach officers to identify and detect impairment.
What Americans think: The hearing came the same day as a survey commissioned by the National Safety Council found that Americans strongly support safety measures including lowering local speed limits, mandating alcohol ignition locks and instituting motorcycle helmet laws.
Get out of your car: The hearing also focused heavily on bicycle and pedestrian safety. Highways and Transit Subcommittee Chairwoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said bicycle and pedestrian safety was a personal priority that she wants to see reflected in the next surface transportation bill. “All of these modes of transportation must be treated equally, not cars over scooters, not bicycles over walking,"" she said.
Lobby Watch A couple of hires to keep your eye on: Hyperloop America hired First Rule, a firm started by former Monsanto executive Travis Brown, to “educate policy makers on Hyperloop technology, advocate for innovative transportation financing models, and advocate for clear regulatory guidance on Hyperloop technology,” according to a disclosure form. And the Association of American Railroads brought on Susan Andres of The Cactus Group to lobby on freight railroad issues.

Texas is at the center of the battle over the House,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-score/2019/04/10/texas-is-at-the-center-of-the-battle-over-the-house-577772," The DCCC announced it will open a headquarters in Texas, the latest sign the nation’s second most-populous state will be a 2020 House battleground.
Story Continued Below
— Democrat Dan McCready raised $1.6 million for the redo election in NC-09 while Republicans are still split in a crowded primary.
— Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) raised $1.4 million in the first quarter while the major pro-Senate Democratic super PAC went up with an early radio buy in the state.

THE TOPLINES BATTLEGROUND TEXAS — Look no further than Texas for the next frontier of the House battleground map. The DCCC announced Tuesday it would open a headquarters in Austin to focus on six battleground seats it hopes to flip, with the effort led by Southern Regional Political Director Michael Beckendorf and state senior adviser Roger Garza.
Texas was more competitive than many expected in 2018. Three races saw over $32 million combined in outside spending: TX-07 , TX-23 and TX-32 (Democrats won in TX-07 and TX-32, while GOP Rep. Will Hurd hung on by the narrowest of margins in TX-23). But there were five districts the GOP won by a margin of five points or less that saw practically no investment from outside groups: TX-10 , TX-21 , TX-22 , TX-24 and TX-31 . They saw a combined outside spend of just over $2.7 million — with the lion’s share coming in TX-21, helping to muscle now-GOP Rep. Chip Roy out of a competitive, open-seat primary and through the general election. With its new headquarters, the DCCC is signaling that the six close districts it didn’t flip will be central to its offensive strategy to hold the House in 2020. Additionally, three other Republican-held districts — TX-02, TX-06 and TX-25 — were decided by a single-digit margin.
Of course, Republicans aren’t going to roll over in the Lone Star State. Freshmen Reps. Colin Allred and Lizzie Fletcher are both on the NRCC’s target list, and Hurd remains a top Democratic target. Plus, the other races won’t be as under the radar this cycle. “We’ll make sure their candidates don’t get by unscathed” in the districts that saw close races, a NRCC official told Score, who was granted anonymity to speak about internal planning. The official said the committee will spend to “define” Democratic challengers in districts that were largely ignored by both party committees last cycle.
 After a rough 2016, union leaders are holding back . “Even as Democratic contenders are well into the process of courting high-ranking and local labor officials, union leaders plan to delay their endorsements as they take the temperature of members on the ground in an attempt to avoid the top-down approach that caused so much heartburn” in 2016, POLITICO’s Ian Kullgren and Natasha Korecki reported .
— Many of the Democratic presidential hopefuls in the Senate are signing on to a bill to tackle a problem that’s plagued some of their own operations: workplace harassment, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reported.
— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pledged to release his tax returns by Monday (which is Tax Day), per The New York Times’ Sheryl Gay Stolberg .
— Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) got her time in the CNN town hall spotlight.
NC-09, FOREVER — McCready is raking in the dough ahead of the redo election. His campaign said he raised $1.6 million in the first quarter and has $1.46 million in cash on hand, per Campaign Pro’s Laura Barrón-López .
— Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop released a TV ad featuring McCready next to a bunch of prominent Democrats (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is in the foreground, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi blurry in the background) as Bishop calls them “clowns.” The campaign said it is a six-figure buy. The Charlotte Observer’s Jim Morrill notes this is the first TV ad from a Republican ahead of the May 14 primary, while several other candidates told him they're focusing on mailers.
THE GRANITE STATE — Shaheen raised $1.4 million in the first quarter and has $1.5 million cash on hand, WMUR’s John DiStaso reported. Her campaign told WMUR that it was the best off-year Q1 haul for any New Hampshire candidate, ever.
— Senate Majority PAC is running a new radio ad in New Hampshire boosting Shaheen. In the ad , the narrator blasts “out of state billionaires” for running attacks against Shaheen and praises her record on health care, prescription drugs and the opioid crisis, Campaign Pro’s James Arkin reported. SMP is spending $200,000 on the radio spot, a surprisingly large number to spend on a radio ad this early in a state that’s not expected to be a battleground. Advertising Analytics tracked the buy as starting on Tuesday and running through early June.
— New Hampshire Republicans are waiting for Gov. Chris Sununu to decide what he’s going to run for. “A half-dozen GOP operatives familiar with Sununu’s political quandary … cautioned against reading too much into the governor keeping his options open,” National Journal’s Madelaine Pisani reported.
HOUSE RECRUITMENT WATCH — Republican Chele Farley, who unsuccessfully challenged Gillibrand in 2018, launched a bid to run against Democratic Rep. Sean Maloney in NY-18, per POLITICO New York’s Laura Nahmias .
— Lancaster City Council Member Angela Underwood-Jacobs, a Republican, said she’ll run to challenge Democratic Rep. Katie Hill in CA-25, per Roll Call’s Bridget Bowman .
ECHO CHAMBER — Twitter is not real life, and that’s especially true for those talking about the Democratic primary. “The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online, according to data from the Hidden Tribes Project ,” The New York Times’ Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy wrote.
POLLS POLLS POLLS — The top two Democratic statewide officials in Virginia have low approval ratings in a new poll from The Wason Center at Christopher Newport University. Just 40 percent approve of Gov. Ralph Northam, with 49 percent disapproving. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has 31 percent approving of his job, while 35 percent disapprove. Of note: The poll was taken before CBS aired interviews with the women who accused Fairfax of sexual assault. (1,067 registered voters, March 11-31). In a generic ballot for the upcoming General Assembly elections, 43 percent say they’d vote for a Democrat, and 39 percent say they’d vote for a Republican (854 likely voters).
— Ocasio-Cortez may be the foil for Republicans nationally, but she’s popular at home. A new Siena poll found that voters in her district approve of her, 52 percent to 33 percent, POLITICO New York’s Laura Nahmias reported.
PRIMARY PROBLEMS — Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader in OR-05 is getting a primary challenger from Milwaukie Mayor Mark Gamba. Gamba “was elected to the Milwaukie City Council in 2012 and has been mayor of the 21,000-population city on the southern border of Portland since 2015,” per OPB’s Jeff Mapes .
THE CASH DASH — Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards announced he raised $2.55 million in the first quarter of 2019. He has $10.19 million cash on hand. Republican Eddie Rispone’s campaign told LaPolitics he has $10.4 million in his war chest and put in “seven figures” of his own money.
— Freshman Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids (KS-03) raised $450,000 in the first quarter, per her campaign.
VOTING SECURITY — The launch of the California Department of Motor Vehicles’ automated voter registration program was marred by an apparent hacking attempt, rushed deadlines and more, the Los Angeles Times’ John Myers reported.
— Aki Peritz, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst, was able to obtain personal information about 40 states’ governors through online voter registration systems (and detailed his findings in The Washington Post ).
CONSULTANTS CORNER — Democratic consulting firm Red Horse Strategies is opening a D.C. office and named Chris Fleming, formerly of STG, as its D.C. director.

Disaster aid talks break down as new storm nears,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2019/04/10/disaster-aid-talks-break-down-as-new-storm-nears-577842,"With help from Catherine Boudreau, Liz Crampton and Oma Seddiq Disaster aid negotiations have collapsed in Congress, as another potential “bomb cyclone” storm is bearing down on the Midwest and the Plains. Producers affected by wildfires, hurricanes and flooding dating back to last year are likely to be left waiting for extra aid until after lawmakers return from a two-week recess.
— Environmental groups and individual farms today are asking Congress to focus on specific food and ag policies as lawmakers debate climate change legislation. Major food manufacturers also laid out their own climate policy priorities.
— Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told House lawmakers he wants to work with Congress on disaster aid to develop a fix for Midwestern growers whose stored grain was swamped by floodwaters last month but wasn’t insured. Perdue also defended the use of Roundup and said the definition of “able-bodied” as applied to food stamp recipients could benefit from “fine-tuning.”
HAPPY WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10! we can’t believe more dockless scooters are coming to D.C. DISASTER AID TALKS BREAK DOWN AS NEW STORM NEARS: With both chambers of Congress racing toward recess at the end of this week, Senate negotiations over a disaster relief package have collapsed, POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma and Marianne LeVine report . That means storm-struck communities from the Midwest to Puerto Rico will continue waiting for additional federal aid until at least the end of April.
The latest delay comes as another major storm threatens to cause further damage to farms, businesses and infrastructure in the Plains and Midwest, just a few weeks after the region was pummeled by a “bomb cyclone” that triggered massive flooding.
Forecast: The storm is projected to “rapidly strengthen across the nation’s heartland around Wednesday and Thursday,” bringing heavy winds, rain and snow, per AccuWeather. The National Weather Service is warning of a “potentially historic storm.”
On the Hill: Perdue said Tuesday that USDA can provide technical assistance to Congress on appropriations language that would enable farmers to access federal aid for crops that were in storage but weren’t covered against flood damage by current safety net programs, our Liz Crampton reports .
“We would love to be involved in helping the language as the disaster bill moves along, to be sure they get the flexibility,” Perdue said during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing.
Democrats and Republicans are both proposing to assist Midwestern states affected by the recent catastrophic flooding, but broader talks have been bogged down over financial relief for Puerto Rico. House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a new $17.2 billion measure, HR 2157 (116) , that includes $3 billion for farm-belt flood relief, Caitlin reports .
The Midwest doesn’t need billions in disaster aid like farmers in Southern states do, House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) told reporters on Tuesday. The majority of crops or livestock damaged by flooding in Nebraska and Iowa were covered by crop insurance or are eligible for farm bill disaster programs, which isn’t the case for many Southern crops like pecan trees and peaches hit by last year’s hurricanes, Peterson said.
“People are saying we have to get billions of dollars to the Midwest. Well, that’s a bunch of baloney,” he said. “The only thing that is not covered [in the Midwest] is this stored grain that was damaged. I think this is something we should look at, and do a one-time thing to help.”
FOOD, AG IN THE CLIMATE DEBATE SPOTLIGHT: More than 300 environmental groups, farms and other organizations today will send a letter to lawmakers asking them to “advance a Green New Deal that reflects the central role of food and agriculture in our climate crisis and its solutions,” referring to the non-binding progressive proposal to shift the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels within a decade.
MA got an early look at the letter , which represents the latest call to focus on changing food and farm policies through a federal effort to curb climate change.
The coalition calls for legislation to restrict methane emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations; reduce consumption of “industrially produced animal products” and promote plant-based foods; combat ag consolidation; and other policies likely to draw pushback from the industry.
FOUR TOP FOOD COMPANIES DEBUT CLIMATE PRINCIPLES: Mars, Danone, Nestlé and Unilever — which together formed the Sustainable Food Policy Alliance — unveiled climate policy principles today that will inform their advocacy on Capitol Hill.
The two-page document endorsed a carbon pricing system that would set prices transparently. There also should be incentives for the agriculture and forestry sectors to reduce and sequester greenhouse gas emissions that are combined with technical assistance for adopting certain practices, the alliance said.
Several other principles touch on accelerating innovation in renewable energy, investing in infrastructure that’s more resilient to the impacts of global warming, and ensuring vulnerable communities have the resources to take on the costs of any regulatory changes.
PERDUE: ‘ABLE-BODIED’ DEFINITION MAY NEED REFINING: During the same appropriations hearing, the secretary defended USDA’s proposed rule tightening work requirement waivers for some food stamp recipients, and suggested the definition of able-bodied adults without dependents — the population the rule would apply to — might need to be further refined.
“The definition describing able bodied may need some fine-tuning,” Perdue told the panel amid a back-and-forth with Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) about whether people deemed disabled or physically unfit for work considered able-bodied under Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program rules (they are not).
“Certainly we’re talking about people who are able to work,” Perdue added. “I think when you hear the term able-bodied, it’s people who are able to work from ages 18 to 49, not senior citizens, not parents with dependents, not pregnant women. Able-bodied adults without dependents.”
House Agriculture Democrats, including nutrition panel leader Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), have requested USDA provide lawmakers with demographic information on the population of able-bodied adults without dependents who would be affected by the rule.
“There’s probably a legal definition I’m just not aware of, of able-bodied,” Perdue told reporters after the hearing. “But that was a fine point that probably needs to be discussed further and communicated and convinced in that way.”
ROUNDUP’S DEMISE WOULD BE ‘DEVASTATING,’ PERDUE SAYS: The USDA chief told House appropriators that Roundup has “exponentially” increased agricultural productivity in the last 25 years, along with other crop protection chemicals, and he thinks it would damage the ag industry if the herbicide was pulled from the market, Liz writes .
The glyphosate-based weedkiller developed by Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) was the subject of two recent court cases resulting in multimillion-dollar verdicts against the agribusiness, and thousands more federal and state cases are lined up.

ROW CROPS — Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to begin talks on a two-year budget deal, Caitlin and Pro Budget’s Jennifer Scholtes report . House Democrats on Tuesday scrapped floor action on a bill, H.R. 2021 (116) , to raise the annual spending caps, following criticism from progressive and centrist members.
— China’s Commerce Ministry is preparing to review the anti-dumping duties it slapped on U.S. exports of distillers grains in 2016 , Reuters reported . The wire service cited a document that a Chinese industry group sent to member companies. It was not clear whether the review would lead to any tariff relief for producers of the ethanol byproduct, commonly used in livestock feed.
— A California lawmaker withdrew a state bill to ban restaurants and retailers from selling “Big Gulp”-style fountain drinks ahead of a committee hearing, but a broader package aimed at reducing soda consumption was still moving ahead in the state Assembly, our Pro California colleagues report .

— U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer dined with Blue Dog Democrats this week in a bid to get support for USMCA. Meanwhile, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal sends the first of a series of letters on Democrats’ demands for the pact.
— The U.S. scored a win with Peru, using provisions in a trade deal to get Lima to back off a move that would have arguably reduced the effectiveness of a forestry watchdog agency. The win could bolster efforts to placate Democrats’ concerns over USMCA enforcement.
— Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will target China’s close ties to South America during a trip to the region, where he will urge countries to embrace fair trade and market access with transparency and strong legal frameworks.
IT'S WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10! took a look in the mirror before marking his birthday today and can report that the past two years of trade coverage hasn’t caused too many gray hairs. Got any tips to gift me today? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi
Driving the Day LIGHTHIZER’S USMCA GRIND CONTINUES: Lighthizer dined with the Blue Dog Coalition on Monday evening as part of his drive to court moderate Democrats for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Neal also attended, according to multiple congressional aides.
The meeting, which focused partly on USMCA, comes after Lighthizer met with House Democratic freshmen last week and with members of the New Democrat Coalition, another group of centrist Democrats that’s considered a source of votes for the new deal. Lighthizer also discussed the deal with the entire Democratic caucus last month at the invitation of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Neal puts it in writing: The Ways and Means chairman sent a letter to Lighthizer on Tuesday outlining Democrats’ concerns over whether the new deal’s labor and environmental standards are strong and enforceable. Neal said he and other panel Democrats will detail other concerns in letters “in the next days.” Sabrina has more here .
Trumka talks USMCA: Pelosi’s next guest on USMCA at her regular “speaker’s meeting” this morning will be AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. The labor group has said it would reject the deal in its current form but is actively working with the administration to try to address its concerns. Trumka has been skeptical that the White House can get an acceptable deal passed in Congress by the summer. Labor groups and Democrats are also waiting for Mexico to pass laws that would fully implement its labor commitments under the deal.
The view up north: Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland reiterated on Tuesday that Ottawa sympathized with Democrats’ concerns but said Canada is staying out of a domestic ratification debate. She also told reporters she’s met regularly with Democratic lawmakers but said Canada was not interested in reopening the deal. “Canada has done its part,” she said.
Freeland also said Canada is in no hurry to ratify USMCA, indicating that Ottawa is no longer fazed by President Donald Trump’s threat to withdraw from NAFTA. She said the country was more pressed to ratify the deal with the European Union and Asia-Pacific countries to enjoy new benefits.
USTR PROVES ITSELF WITH PERU: Peru backtracked on plans to move an independent forestry agency under the purview of the environment ministry — an action the U.S. said would have violated the terms of their free trade agreement. The administration had threatened to move toward potential tariff retaliation if Lima didn’t change course. The trade pact required Peru to establish the forestry watchdog agency as an “independent and separate agency” to better combat illegal logging.
Congressional Democrats believe the forestry annex in the Peru trade deal is a model for improving USMCA to better enforce labor rights in Mexico. A proposal from Senate Democrats would emulate inspection and verification provisions in the Peru deal. Read the story here .
REFRESHING THE RETALIATION: Freeland confirmed that Canada is looking at reconfiguring its retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. steel and aluminum penalties in order “to have the greatest possible impact in the United States.” Freeland also repeated Canada’s demand for the tariffs to be removed entirely.
Perdue continues advocacy effort: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has had a front-row seat to the impact of the retaliation on farmers, told reporters Tuesday that he continues to be an “advocate” of resolving the steel and aluminum tariffs with Canada and Mexico. The U.S. wants Canada and Mexico to accept quotas, although talks on that issue haven’t made much progress. Perdue said he “would hope to persuade President Trump that quotas may work in lieu of tariffs.”
TRUMP’S NEW TARIFF THREAT: The U.S. could be entitled to retaliate against the EU with tariffs that could hit $11 billion worth of European imports in its dispute over Airbus. Pro’s DataPoint team breaks it down here . Want to add DataPoint to your Pro account? Learn more.
TRUMP’S ‘$4.5 BILLION GIFT’ TO THE U.S. STEEL INDUSTRY: Trump’s decision to impose Section 232 tariffs on steel imports last year helped boost the domestic industry’s net income by 116 percent, a steel market analyst said Tuesday at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries Inc.’s annual meeting in Los Angeles. “So what the gave to the steel industry was a gift of $4.5 billion,” said Markus Moll, managing director of the analytical firm SMR GmbH.
The windfall allowed the companies to spend about $1 billion on new equipment. “There are steel mills being built,” Moll noted. “This means the plan worked. What the government intended to do, it actually delivered, at least to some extent.” But surprisingly, the market value of the companies’ shares dropped by 30 percent, which indicates the financial community has doubts about the long-term sustainability of the industry, Moll added.
ROSS HEADING TO MEXICO: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be in Mexico later this week to meet with Mexican Economy Secretary Graciela Márquez and other officials as well as attend the U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue. Ross and Márquez will also speak on a panel at the two-day event, which begins Thursday.
FROM ZERO TO HERO AT THE WTO: The U.S. practice of “zeroing” when calculating anti-dumping duties finally got a win at the World Trade Organization in a panel report Tuesday. Canada challenged the use of the controversial methodology in a case against U.S. tariffs against imports of softwood lumber. The WTO panel faulted the U.S. for how it determined instances of so-called targeted dumping by Canadian lumber producers but upheld the U.S. use of zeroing despite the method being struck down by the WTO’s Appellate Body. Canada said it is considering an appeal of the ruling. Read the full story here .
POMPEO TARGETS CHINA IN SOUTH AMERICA: Pompeo will take aim at China’s close trading ties with South American countries during a trip to Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Colombia from April 11 to 14, a senior State Department official said Tuesday.
The secretary of State will continue to emphasize the ’s economic vision for the region that centers around fair trading and market access with transparency and strong legal frameworks, the official said in a call with reporters. “We well know that China doesn’t always follow these principles,” the official added.
“On this, we make the same arguments in the Americas that we make all around the world: Economic engagement in China should meet the same high standards — in terms of transparency, adherence to anti-corruption standards, … debt sustainability, labor rights and environmental best practices — that we’d expect of any other fair competitor in the world’s markets,” the official said.
Looking to APEC: Pompeo will also meet with Chilean President Sebastián Piñera to discuss the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Chile is hosting this year, the official added. APEC leaders are scheduled to meet in November, and APEC trade ministers will meet in May.
CUTLER URGES NEW U.S. APPROACH TO CONFRONTING CHINA: Raising tariffs on Chinese goods has brought Beijing to the negotiating table, former U.S. trade official Wendy Cutler acknowledged in a new paper in her role as vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. But now it’s time for the United States to shift from its “go it alone” approach to working with other countries that share its concerns because that’s more likely to achieve more meaningful and longer lasting reforms, Cutler argued.
The should use upcoming meetings of the G-20, APEC and other international forums to retool its strategy and regain the trust of key trading partners, Cutler said. The White House should remove steel and aluminum tariffs and refrain from imposing new 232 tariffs on autos to gain support for its China trade and investment agenda, Cutler said.

Budget TWO-YEAR DEAL: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have agreed to begin negotiating a two-year budget deal that would raise caps on defense and non-defense spending, POLITICO’s Jennifer Scholtes reports .
The agreement came as House Democrats pulled a bill that would have raised defense spending caps to $733 billion in fiscal 2020 and $749 billion the following year, writes POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle and John Bresnahan.
Democrats had planned to let the House vote on the measure this week, but it was facing too much opposition from progressives and moderates.
ACQUISITION CHANGES: Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) says he plans to unveil two acquisition reform bills before the House Armed Services Committee begins hashing out the defense policy bill, our own Connor O’Brien reports .
The first would carry out previous changes and the second would focus on spurring innovation in small and medium-sized companies.
Thornberry also said he hopes the Defense Department won’t lose its ability to move money among different accounts, a possible consequence of Trump’s decision to shift $1 billion in funding toward wall construction on the southern border, O’Brien reports.
GET READY FOR NDAA: Senate Armed Services, meanwhile, released its schedule for marking up its version of the defense policy bill. Action begins the week of May 20, per O’Brien.
The subcommittee markup schedule is here and the full committee markup schedule is here . Aside from the Personnel Subcommittee, all other sessions will be closed.
HOMELAND SECURITY WALL CONTRACTS: The Pentagon announced Tuesday night it had awarded two contracts totaling $976 million for border wall construction, making good on Trump’s pledge to divert funds without asking Congress. SLSCO of Galveston, Texas, received $789 million for “border replacement wall construction” in New Mexico. Barnard Construction of Bozeman, Mont., received $187 million for “primary pedestrian wall replacement” in Yuma, Ariz.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Trump “just robbed” military personnel to pay for his “vanity wall.”
“This move lays bare the fallacies of [this] administration’s unbelievable argument that the wall is about protecting American communities by securing the border. It isn’t. It’s about the President’s ego and his nationalistic agenda,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “His reckless, self-centered demagoguery is endangering our security and creating a true national emergency.”
NELLER’S VIEW: Marine Commandant Gen. Robert Neller told senators on Tuesday that a memo he wrote that was later leaked to the press had been taken out of context, and that border deployments were not harming readiness, O’Brien writes .
And predicts that U.S. troops’ role on the border will expand as the situation there deteriorates, per Defense News.
ON THE HILL HERE IS TODAY’S LINEUP:
— 10 a.m.: Top Navy and Marine leaders discuss the budget before the House Armed Services Committee.
— 10 a.m.: Guard and reserve leaders testify on the budget before Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee.

— Fraught free speech: A Senate Judiciary panel led by Ted Cruz will devote a hearing to allegations that online platforms repress conservative content.
— Broadband mapping latest: Senate Commerce puts a spotlight on broadband data gathering, particularly in rural communities that lack decent internet connectivity.
— Welcome, Vera Jourová: During her visit to Washington, the EU Commissioner for Justice will focus on tech regulation (or a lack thereof).
GREETINGS AND WELCOME TO MORNING TECH . It’s me again, your new host and neighbor, Alexandra Levine. Since I last landed in your inbox, I’ve decided that D.C. is the most acronym-packed city I’ve ever lived in, but I’m proud to report I’m learning my letters reasonably well. . And
Have an event for MT’s tech calendar? Email us the details at SENATE PANEL DELVES INTO TECH BIAS ALLEGATIONS — Today Cruz’s Judiciary subcommittee on the constitution will dive deep into allegations that online platforms “censor” conservative content — a charge tech companies flatly deny. Both Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), a new addition to the panel after shifting from the House, have long accused online platforms of bias and are expected to lead the charge on the topic today. It’s a sign the Senate is taking up the tech “censorship” mantle embraced last year by the then-Republican House.
— Not all conservatives are happy with the theme. Billy Easley, a senior tech policy analyst for the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, is warning the committee against infringing on free speech. “Senator Cruz is right: tech companies ought to provide an open platform for speech across the political and ideological spectrum,” he said in a statement. “But asking the government to police online speech — either through direct action or by cajoling private firms — sets a dangerous precedent.” Carl Szabo, vice president for right-leaning trade group Net Choice, called it “inconsistent for conservatives to support the free speech rights of businesses” while opposing it for “private platforms when moderating content they host.”
— What to watch for: While we’ll be monitoring for exchanges between lawmakers and the two tech representatives slated to testify — Twitter’s Carlos Monje and Facebook’s Neil Potts — other key witnesses include film director Chuck Konzelman and Robbie Parker, the father of a Sandy Hook school shooting victim. Konzelman’s anti-abortion movie “Unplanned” has become a flashpoint for allegations of an anti-GOP tech bias ( more on that here ), and Parker is one of a number of family members who filed a defamation suit against Infowars founder Alex Jones for spreading hoaxes about Sandy Hook.
— Who you won't see: Google, which planned to send manager of external outreach Max Pappas, a former Cruz aide, is not slated to participate, the committee said. A source familiar with talks said the committee spurned Google's offer to send Pappas, as first reported by Axios. A Cruz spokesperson did not offer comment. The incident is reminiscent of a similar flap from last year, where the Senate Intelligence Committee declined Google's offer to send an executive below the CEO level to testify on foreign meddling on social media.
THE STATE OF OUR MAPS — Senate Commerce holds a hearing this morning on the steps needed to improve the accuracy of broadband mapping data, particularly in rural communities where the lack of reliable information has become a source of frustration for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Panel Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) has criticized the FCC’s handling of the issue and, six months ago , contemplated the use of a congressional spending bill to force the commission to revisit the problem. “Flawed and inaccurate maps ultimately waste resources and stifle opportunities for economic development in our rural and underserved communities,” Wicker said in an opening statement shared with MT.
— Witnesses include USTelecom President Jonathan Spalter, who is leading his own mapping initiative . ( Charter Communications and Microsoft both outlined their own concerns with the mapping process and suggestions for improvement in blog posts this past week.)
JOUROVÁ'S IN WASHINGTON TO TALK TECH — EU Commissioner for Justice Vera Jourová is on this side of the pond this week for meetings and other events centered on how regulators can confront the downsides of tech, from privacy risks to the spread of misinformation online to election interference. On Thursday, Jourová will give a speech at Brookings on how well Europe and the U.S. are cooperating on that front. Remember: She's been critical of her American counterparts on that score in the past — once telling MT, for example, that the FTC here needed to ""hurry up"" its Cambridge Analytica-sparked investigation into Facebook. And that was eight months ago.
— No doubt the status of that Facebook inquiry will come up during Jourová’s planned sit-down with FTC Chairman Joe Simons, per a trip agenda shared by the EU delegation to the U.S. She's also slated to meet with Attorney General William Barr, as well as a trio of lawmakers with prime roles in the debate over federal privacy regulation in the States: Wicker, Commerce Consumer Protection Subcommittee ranking member Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).
ALL ABOARD THE NET NEUTRALITY TRAIN? — House lawmakers on Tuesday moved to successfully hitch a bevy of amendments to the Save the Internet Act, H.R. 1644 (116) , ahead of its expected passage today. They agreed by voice votes to attach the two GOP amendments: one requiring a Government Accountability Office study on all companies’ role in the internet ecosystem and another requiring the FCC to provide a list of what common-carrier regulations the commission would not apply to broadband (the Obama-era FCC declined to specify that last part).
— Republicans didn’t fight initial Democratic amendments to add language compelling a GAO study on net neutrality’s effects on minorities and underserved groups and provisions mandating FCC reporting on broadband mapping. Lawmakers will continue debating amendments and vote on the bill’s final passage today.
— Reality check: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) deemed the bill, which lacks much GOP support, “dead on arrival” in the Senate, as John reported Tuesday .
BLACKBURN’S BACK WITH BROWSER — Blackburn is today planning to introduce a Senate version of her privacy legislation known as the BROWSER Act, which she originally offered in 2017 as a House member, a Republican aide confirmed to John. The measure embodies many of the data privacy issues now on the table, such as putting the FTC in charge of privacy, the need for opt-in consent for collecting sensitive information and federal pre-emption of state law.
AND FINALLY, A ROUND OF APPLAUSE — Congratulations to this year’s Congressional Innovation Fellows, selected by TechCongress to serve as policy advisors to lawmakers across the Hill on tech issues including national security, cybersecurity, election security, AI and facial recognition. Aaron Barruga joins Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.); Leisel Bogan joins Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.); Allison Hutchings joins Sen.

QUICK FIX
—Sen. Bernie Sanders is releasing a new version of “Medicare for All” legislation this morning.
—The top three insulin makers and pharmacy benefit managers step into the hot seat today at a congressional oversight hearing on the rising costs of the diabetes treatment.
—Medicare's innovation center is planning a primary care announcement later this month.
Welcome to Wednesday PULSE , where your author is reminding everyone that congressional spring break (err, recess) is just around the corner. Dan Diamond will be back at the helm tomorrow. Greet him with tips at ddiamond@politico.com .
Driving the Day SANDERS TO UNVEIL ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ BILL – Sen. Bernie Sanders will unveil a revamped version of his Medicare for All legislation this morning, switching the Washington health care conversation back to the progressive plan dividing Democrats – and away from President Donald Trump's efforts to tear down Obamacare.
The Sanders bill will largely be similar to the version he introduced in September 2017. And it again comes with the support of several high-profile colleagues, who are now also running for president.
What's changed: The bill will now include coverage for long-term care services, bringing it in line with the House version, H.R. 1384 (116) , introduced in February. The bill has lost one co-sponsor since 2017 who's still in the Senate: Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who said she's backing more incremental plans to expand coverage.
What hasn’t changed: Four candidates for the Democratic nomination are again expected to co-sponsor the bill – Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand , Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker and Kamala Harris .
IN CONGRESS TODAY: THE INSULIN PRICE SHOWDOWN – The three top insulin makers and the three largest pharmacy benefit managers testify about the diabetes medicine’s soaring cost in front of the House Energy and Commerce’s oversight subcommittee this morning. While there have been a slew of drug pricing hearings this year, this will be the first to jointly call up pharmaceutical companies (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi) and the middlemen (CVS, Express Scripts and OptumRx). That sets up a brawl about insulin’s steadily climbing list prices (700 percent over 20 years) and the heavy rebates that drugmakers argue are driving the trend.
The three major PBMs on Tuesday were at the Senate Finance Committee, where senators grilled them — along with relatively smaller PBMs, Humana and Prime Therapeutics — on rebates and whether the middlemen benefit from higher prices. PBMs denied that they discouraged slashing prices, and some pledged to get on board with legislation to provide their rebate data to congressional advisers. More for Pros .
Meanwhile both sides scale up insulin access efforts. Sanofi announced it would expand a savings program allowing patients with high out-of-pocket costs to pay $99 per month for 10 boxes of insulin pens, or 10mL vials, dropping down from $149 for a box of pens in the same program last year. Sanofi’s plan comes one week after Cigna announced a deal with all three drugmakers to cap monthly insulin costs for its commercially insured consumers at $25.
Inside the Agencies BRAIN DRAIN IN CMS’ MEDICAID DIVISION – Two career staffers are leaving the CMS office overseeing Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, the latest in a string of departures at the agency, POLITICO’s Rachana Pradhan scoops. Including the latest exits, at least five people have decided to leave the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services since the start of the year.
Who’s out this time: Michael Nardone, who joined CMS in early 2016 and ran the Medicaid division's Disabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, is retiring from the agency this month. Jim Golden, who reports to Nardone and is responsible for policy implementation and oversight of Medicaid managed care companies, is also leaving. More for Pros.
PRIMARY CARE ANNOUNCEMENT COMING APRIL 22 – The CMS Innovation Center director, along with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma, invited stakeholders to an “exciting discussion on primary care delivery, including care for the complex, chronically ill” at the American Medical Association’s office, according to an invite CMMI Director Adam Boehler sent stakeholders and obtained by your author. A CMS spokesperson confirmed that an event is scheduled for April 22 , and it will be open to the press, though the spokesperson didn't confirm the event's contents.
Provider groups have been anticipating a primary care announcement for months . It's been known that CMMI has been working on a new track to an existing primary care model, as well as developing a project to test direct contracting. POLITICO recently asked Boehler if the two concepts would be merged into one model or separated. He responded that they're different, but, “the way we thought about them together is when we do talk about these, I want to make sure we announce a broad spectrum. If you just look at one thing, then someone may not know the other options.”
IN THE COURTS COURT GRANTS WISCONSIN’S REQUEST TO DROP OUT OF TEXAS V. AZAR – Wisconsin’s request to be dropped from the federal lawsuit seeking to strike down all of Obamacare has been granted by a federal appellate court. Wisconsin was a co-leader on the lawsuit when the state's previous Republican attorney general filed it with 19 other GOP-led states last year. The state's withdrawal won't have a practical impact on the lawsuit going forward .
FEDS CHARGE 24 IN TELEMEDICINE FRAUD SCHEME – A series of payments were allegedly made to physicians and telemedicine companies to get them to prescribe medically unnecessary back, shoulder, wrist and knee braces, according to a DOJ announcement. Medicare was reportedly billed $1.7 billion, of which $900 million was paid out in one of the largest fraud schemes HHS and the FBI have investigated together. More for Pros.

EYE ON PHARMA FDA announces new opioid label requirements. The changes are intended to help health care providers safely decrease the dose in patients who are physically dependent on pain medications. They were spurred by reports of serious harm, including withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, psychological distress and suicide in opioid-dependent patients who abruptly had their medicines discontinued or the doses rapidly decreased, the agency said. More for Pros.
Indivior indicted over opioid treatment – A federal grand jury indicted the drugmaker Tuesday in a nationwide scheme to allegedly boost prescriptions for Suboxone Film used to treat opioid addiction. The company is accused of increasing prescriptions by deceiving health care providers and benefit programs into believing the medication is “safer” and “less susceptible to diversion and abuse” than other similar medications, according to the indictment.
The company said the indictment was ""wholly unsupported by either the facts or the law.""
AROUND THE NATION IDAHO LIMITS VOTER-BACKED EXPANSION – Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed legislation to add work requirements to the Medicaid expansion voters approved in November. The state follows Nebraska and Utah, which also placed limits on an expansion approved by a ballot initiative.
But Little, a Republican, noted his concerns about the idea, citing “costly lawsuits” over similar work requirements that were recently struck down in Arkansas and Kentucky. More for Pros .
TEXAS SENATE PASSES BILL TO MOVE SMOKING AGE TO 21 – A bill ( TX SB21 (19R) ) prohibiting sales of tobacco products and e-cigarettes to people under the age of 21 got preliminary approval from the Republican-led chamber on Tuesday after a short debate. Senators attached an amendment that would exempt active duty military personnel from the ban. Similar legislation ( TX HB749 (19R) ) unanimously passed a House committee last month. If it passes, Texas would join a handful of states – mostly blue ones – raising the tobacco age to 21.

HITAC meeting today,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-ehealth/2019/04/10/hitac-meeting-today-423363," Mohana Ravindranath ( @ravindranize
We’ve got a buzzy meeting today and more important business developments. Here’s what you need to know:
— HITAC meeting today: The Health Information Technology Advisory Committee will be chewing on the big interoperability rules today. We’ve got a preview and will be updating you about new developments.
— Cerner gets new pressure: The Kansas City EHR developer will be getting new business pressure as the company has a deal with a group of activist shareholders to increase profitability.
— Feds bust fraudulent telemedicine scheme: : DOJ announced a huge bust against 24 individuals – including many executives at a telemedicine company – who the feds say were involved in a huge Medicare fraud scheme.
But first, the jump.
eHealth tweet of the day: David Bates @DBatesSafety “Absurd Epic moment of the day: a refill to approve for diabetes test strips. ‘Route’ was required. 235 options not including ‘none!’ Shouldn’t the system know what routes are ok for test strips (surely intra-articular not a good idea)?!?”
WEDNESDAY: Your correspondent’s softball season is starting up again this year — let’s all hope for winning and no injuries! Talk batting tips at dtahir@politico.com . Discuss no injuries @Morning_eHealth .
Driving the Day HITAC MEETING TODAY — The big interoperability rules are at the top of the agenda in today’s Health Information Technology Advisory Committee meeting. Here are some of the interesting points from the preview materials posted Tuesday night:
— Info blocking committee report: The information blocking task force will be making some draft recommendations today on the info-blocking portions of the rule — maybe the most contentious part of the Trump administration's proposal. A lot of the recommendations dwell on technical and logistical points — for example, that the timelines to update contracts might be too tight — but some points are more philosophical. In the latter category, for instance, the task force argues that more and more developers will choose not to certify as health IT — which might make information blocking rules somewhat weak going forward. The full presentation here .
— Also on the agenda: Pediatric certification recommendations: The “Health IT for the Care Continuum” task force is issuing recommendations on pediatric certifications, a requirement of the 21st Century Cures Act. The recommendations are envisioned as ways to certify products as being particularly useful for pediatrics providers; they include a requirement for transitioning control and access for data for pediatric patients, as a given child will grow up and may eventually want to block parental access. Full presentation here .
HEALTH IT BUSINESS WATCH CERNER GETS NEW PRESSURE — The Kansas City-based EHR vendor got some new business pressure Tuesday as it agreed with activist investors Starboard Value to install four new members on its board of directors and hit certain operating margin targets.
Wall Street was broadly happy with the announcement, as the company's stock price jumped just more than 10 percent. The good vibes weren't universal, though. Investment bank Evercore's analysts said the company's 2020 target “looks aggressive.”
Such investments can be a prelude to a broader shakeup. The health IT sector’s most famous example is athenahealth, when activist investors Elliott Management took a 10 percent stake in May 2017 and later precipitated a chain of events resulting in the sale of the firm. Starboard owns a much smaller stake than Elliott did: only 1.2 percent.
Inside the Agencies FEDS BUST MASSIVE TELEMEDICINE SCHEME — Twenty-four people — including executives at telemedicine companies, doctors and the owners of durable medical equipment — have been charged for their participation in a massive Medicare fraud scheme, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. It’s one of the largest fraud schemes HHS’ Inspector General’s Office and the FBI have investigated, according to news release.
Some defendants allegedly ran an international call center that advertised to Medicare beneficiaries. The center bribed telemedicine companies, who in turn bribed their doctors to prescribe medically unnecessary back, shoulder, wrist and knee braces. They made those prescriptions often without any patient interaction at all. The defendants billed CMS for $1.7 billion, about $900 million of which was paid out. Pros can read the rest of the story here .
— In other telemedicine news: Researchers found virtual consultations lead to increased antibiotic prescription for children, according to a study published in Pediatrics this week. The study found that pediatric patients with respiratory infections were prescribed antibiotics more frequently when consulting with a clinician through a direct-to-consumer-telemedicine platform, compared to in-person primary care or urgent care visits. The study is a first step toward understanding how pediatric patients are affected by telemedicine, lead researcher Kristin Ray said in an interview. Pros can read the rest of the story here .
CMS PROPOSES EXPANDING BLOOD PRESSURE TRACKING COVERAGE — CMS on Tuesday proposed expanding coverage for blood pressure monitors that track patients outside the doctors’ office. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is currently only covered for patients whose anxiety about being in the doctor’s office might drive up their blood pressure, but that leaves out potential hypertension patients whose blood pressure might be lower in the doctor’s office as compared to other settings, according to CMS. The proposal would expand coverage to that group. CMS is currently seeking public comment on the proposal.
— Shakeup at CMS Medicaid office: Two top career staffers at CMS’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program office are departing, the latest chapter in a string of exits there, our colleague Rachana Pradhan reports.
Michael Nardone, who joined CMS in early 2016 and ran the Medicaid division's Disabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, is retiring from the agency this month, three sources said. He's among five people who announced their departures from the office since the year began, Rachana reports.
TURMOIL IN WHITE HOUSE IT OFFICE — The White House office responsible for coordinating IT initiatives across the government — from cybersecurity to the cloud – is suffering from turmoil, including burnout, departures, and dismal morale, our Cybersecurity colleague Eric Geller reports .
The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer is tasked with coordinating the government’s $105 billion in IT and cybersecurity spending, but only 19 percent of the office’s 30 employees expressed satisfaction with their workplace in February, down from a hardly sterling 50 percent in October. That’s despite a November reorganization and new leadership. Pros can get the rest here .

IN CONGRESS — No Dem-backed net neutrality bill in Senate: Hopes for the House Democratic bill restoring Obama-era net neutrality rules are dim, as top Senate Republicans dismissed the chances of advancing the Save the Internet Act, H.R. 1644 (116), Tuesday.

Cain could be done,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2019/04/10/cain-could-be-done-423107," Cain could be done — You don’t get much stronger of a brush back pitch than this piece from our Burgess Everett on Senate Republicans pushing back on Herman Cain for the Fed. The message to the White House: Don’t send him up because we may not confirm him.
The message MM gets from the White House: The vetting process on Cain is only getting started. And it could take a couple of months. One official suggested the idea that Trump may get Steve Moore but not Cain is certainly possible. But added that “people say a lot of things.” Right now there is pretty much a constituency of one for Cain: Trump. The most likely outcome is he never gets nominated. But nothing is certain.
Bankers in the dock — It will feel like 2009 all over again when CEOs of seven of the largest banks face off against fired up House Democrats on the Financial Services Committee at 9:00 a.m. this morning. Only this time, there are no bailouts to bash bankers about and no devastating financial crisis seizing the globe.
Still, CEOs from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, State Street, Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon will face hot fire over the rise in leveraged lending, relaxed regulations by the Fed and the size of share buybacks and dividends in the wake of President Trump’s tax cuts. Hearing memo is here .
2020 DEMOCRATS EYE BANKS — Our Zachary Warmbrodt and Victoria Guida report here that big banks will be a top target of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders.
GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING — Happy bash a banker day! Zachary Warmbrodt on federal regulators rebuke of Wells Fargo’s response to its record of customer abuses. House Financial Services bankers hearing begins at 9:00 a.m. … Senate Finance has a hearing at 10:15 a.m. on “The 2019 Tax Filing Season and the 21st Century IRS"" … Consumer Prices at 8:30 a.m. expected to rise 0.3 percent headline and 0.2 percent core … FOMC Minutes at 2:00 p.m. should give insight into the decision to drop both expected 2019 rate hikes …
MORE ON MOORE — NY Mag’s Jonathan Chait: “A little over two and a half years ago, Stephen Moore appeared at a conservative panel on the election and the economy, where one questioner asked about monetary policy. ‘Well, you know, I’m not an expert on monetary policy,’ admitted Moore, before proceeding to deliver an answer bearing out this very confession.” Read more .

Greg Baer, President and CEO or the Bank Policy Institute to MM on the hearing: “Wednesday’s hearing will likely highlight the fact that the rhetoric about banks hasn’t caught up to the reality that today banks are stronger and safer and an essential driver of America’s economic success.” Read more .
HITTING BACK AT BETTER MARKETS — The Financial Services Forum has its own report out responding to the Better Markets report scooped in MM on Tuesday.
Per Forum President and CEO Kevin Fromer: “In an attempt to politicize a serious hearing and discussion about the United States’ robust financial system, this report offers nothing more than a gross mischaracterization of the response to the global financial crisis.”

MARKETS STOCKS CLOSE LOWER — AP’s Alex Veiga: “Industrial companies led a broad slide in stocks on Wall Street Tuesday, ending the benchmark S&P 500′s eight-day winning streak. The sell-off came as traders weighed growing trade tensions between the U.S. and the European Union, and a report forecasting dimmer global economic growth this year”
IMF LOWERS GROWTH OUTLOOK — Bloomberg’s Andrew Mayeda: “The International Monetary Fund cut its outlook for global growth to the lowest since the financial crisis amid a bleaker outlook in most major advanced economies and signs that higher tariffs are weighing on trade. The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, down from the 3.5 percent the IMF had forecast for 2019 in January” Read more .
FLY AROUND CONGRESS EYES DEAL TO AVOID CUTS — Our Jennifer Scholtes and Caitlin Emma: “Congressional leaders are charging ahead with negotiations on a deal to skirt $126 billion in spending cuts, even as an internal divide among House Democrats killed their bill staking an opening offer.
“But the Trump administration is reluctant. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday afternoon that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had agreed to begin negotiating a new two-year deal to raise budget caps, starting with discussions among congressional staff.” Read more .
MNUCHIN: WHITE HOUSE, TREASURY DISCUSSED TRUMP TAX RETURN REQUEST — NYT’s Alan Rappeport: “Treasury told lawmakers on Tuesday that White House lawyers had been in touch with his department about a congressional request for President Trump’s tax returns but said he had not personally spoken to Mr. Trump or those lawyers about how the matter was being handled.
“Mr. Mnuchin’s disclosure is the first public acknowledgment of communication between the White House and the Treasury Department related to Mr. Trump’s tax returns. It comes as the president has made clear he has no intention of handing over his personal financial records without a fight.” Read more .
Mnuchin also commented on Brexit — WSJ’s Kate Davidson: “Mnuchin told lawmakers Tuesday that U.S. financial institutions were prepared for the prospect of a disorderly Brexit, but said it would likely cause significant market and trade disruptions. ‘We need to be prepared for a hard Brexit as a very realistic outcome,’ Mr. Mnuchin said at a House hearing on the international financial system.” Read more .
And he butted heads with Waters — AP’s Martin Crutsinger: “Things got a bit heated at the end of more than three hours of testimony by … Mnuchin before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday when he was peppered with questions about releasing President Donald Trump’s tax returns. Mnuchin, who had already faced similar questions before a different committee earlier Tuesday, told the committee chairwoman, Maxine Waters, that he needed to leave at 5:15 p.m. to make a 5:30 p.m. meeting in his office with a foreign leader.” Read more .
CFPB WEIGHS OPTIONS FOR ENFORCING WELLS FARGO ORDER — Reuters’ Michelle Price and Imani Moise: “The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has told Congress that ‘all options are on the table’ for enforcing a 2018 order against Wells Fargo, raising the prospect of potential future penalties or other sanctions again the bank. In a letter to Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown published by the lawmakers on Tuesday, CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger said she was unhappy with Wells Fargo’s progress fixing its risk management issues.” Read more .
FED TO REVIEW INFLATION TARGETING, POLICY TOOLS — WSJ’s David Harrison: “Federal Reserve vice chairman Richard Clarida said Tuesday that the central bank’s review of its monetary policy will look at new ways to deal with low inflation as well as novel approaches to stimulate a weak economy and to communicate with the public. The Fed kicked off its review this year after officials realized interest rates are likely to remain lower than in the past, even in periods of economic growth. Since lower rates could limit the central bank’s ability to boost a slumping economy, officials are looking for new ways to respond to downturns.” Read more .

QUICK FIX The House easily passed an IRS revamp on Tuesday, but the vote also cause a backlash about the measure’s treatment of the agency’s free file program.
— The Senate has the interest in tax extenders, and until this week hadn’t received a revenue bill from the House. But don’t expect leading Senate tax writers to use the IRS bill as an extenders vehicle.
— IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig returns to the Hill today for a second consecutive day of testimony, after revealing little about how his agency plans to respond to House Richard Neal ’s request for President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

Driving the Day INTERESTING ALL OF A SUDDEN: It’s not every day you can say a measure that passes the House by voice vote sparked some drama. But that was certainly the case with the Taxpayer First Act, H.R. 1957 (116) , the latest in a series of bipartisan efforts to restructure the IRS.
How it happened: The proposal to codify the IRS’s free file program, a partnership in which tax prep companies like Intuit and H&R Block offer filing services to lower-income taxpayers, was also included in previous versions of IRS bills. But it certainly seems that a ProPublica article outlining that provision , which noted that only around 3 percent of eligible taxpayers currently use the free file program, caught a mostly freshman group of progressives off-guard. And as your Morning Tax author noted , it took Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a senior Ways and Means member and sponsor of the measure, talking up the importance of other provisions aimed at helping low-income taxpayers to ease the concerns of those like Reps. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and smooth the bill’s passage.
What’s next? Hill said that progressives are going to try to use the attention caused by Tuesday’s vote to upend the free file program and move toward allowing the IRS to implement its own tax filing system. “We have to use this moment. This is something people are very worked up about,” Hill told Morning Tax. “We have some clout to get movement on this.”
Hill added that progressive lawmakers are hoping to have their own proposal ready by the time Congress returns from its upcoming two-week recess, and that Lewis supports their efforts. But she acknowledged that one potential avenue for rolling back the free file program — making changes to the IRS overhaul in the Senate — would be an uphill battle, given that the other chamber is controlled by Republicans.
Should also be noted: It’s fair to question whether the rebellion against the IRS measure would have been quelled without Lewis, the civil rights hero viewed as a moral authority on both sides of the aisle. “The fact that Lewis got Katie Hill and AOC to come around is unbelievable,” one Democratic aide said. “The man is a legend.”
More on free file: Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a sponsor of that chamber's Taxpayers First Act, S. 928 (116) , took issue with reports that said the bill would ban the IRS from offering free online tax filing of its own. (A memorandum between the IRS and the tax prep companies says that the agency won’t offer its own filing system, but the IRS can also terminate the program at any time with a year’s notice.) At the same time, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on Finance and another sponsor of the measure, also took issue with the bill’s “prohibition on the agency competing with private tax preparation services.”
The extenders angle: Grassley has been pushing to revive dozens of expired temporary tax breaks, while House Democrats have been slow to focus on the incentives. That led to some speculation on K Street and elsewhere that Grassley might try to attach the extenders to the IRS bill — the first revenue measure moved by the House this year. But not so fast: Michael Zona, Grassley’s spokesman, told Morning Tax that the chairman still has extenders atop his priority list, but that “it wouldn’t make sense to jeopardize a bicameral, bipartisan agreement that’s the product of many years of work when House Democrats still haven’t shown any interest in moving forward on extenders.” (Another potential revenue bill that could be coming down the pike: The retirement security bill that cleared House Ways and Means last week.)
FIRST LOOK: Rettig returns to Senate Finance today for the first time since his confirmation hearing, and a day after his first testimony as commissioner in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee.
Grassley will say in his opening remarks in today’s hearing that it’s somewhat understandable that “the current tax filing season has been the most scrutinized that I can remember,” given that it’s the first under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115) . The chairman will also note that IRS systems have worked as they’re supposed to so far, and that average refunds are basically in line with previous years.
Tax return update: Today marks the deadline that Neal set for Rettig when requesting Trump’s tax returns, and the commissioner would only say on Tuesday that he’d have some sort of answer today.
Probably the bigger news on tax returns from Tuesday: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that Treasury lawyers had discussed the Democrats' effort with the White House, albeit before Neal made his formal request, as Pro Tax’s Aaron Lorenzo reported.
INTERNATIONAL UPDATE SURE THAT’S A GOOD IDEA? Japan is looking to hike its sales tax, but The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Bird argues Tokyo should reverse field to save the country’s recent economic progress. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said the increase is needed because of Japan’s aging population, but has already delayed implementing it once. Bird noted that Japan taxes consumption less than other areas, but also argued that policies that could impede growth could play into China’s hands.

STATE NEWS PARADISE WITH A PRICE: Hawaii lawmakers are pushing to tax vacation rentals offered at Airbnb and similar companies, but The Associated Press notes that’s not as simple an idea as it might sound — because most rentals are operated illegally. Still, both the Hawaii House and Senate passed separate bills on the subject on Tuesday, and are hoping to reconcile the differences this month. Gov. David Ige vetoed similar legislation several years back, but lawmakers say he’s at least been receptive to what they’re trying to do now.

The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.’ …
“While Barr said he would not be launching an investigation into the FBI over the alleged spying, he said it was likely that there was a ‘failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.’ …
“Barr told Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) that he had a conversation with Mueller about why he did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question. When asked if Mueller sought to leave it to Congress to decide whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr said: ‘He didn’t say that to me.’ When asked if Mueller believed the decision should be up to the attorney general, Barr said: ‘He didn’t say that either. But that’s generally how the Department of Justice works.’” POLITICO
-- REP. JERRY NADLER (D-N.Y.) tweets, regarding Barr’s “spying” statements: “These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us. I’ve asked DOJ to brief us immediately. In the meantime, the AG still owes us the full Mueller report.”
-- @desiderioDC: “Big: Barr suggests that his redactions to protect privacy & reputation of ‘peripheral third parties’ would NOT apply to President Trump.”
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, riffing to reporters this morning: “As far as I’m concerned, I don’t care about the Mueller report.” A guess at why he’s not worried: The president got the headline he wanted from Barr’s letter -- no collusion! -- and, in the White House’s view, that’s good enough even if the report itself contains damaging information. He called the investigation an “attempted coup.” More from Rebecca Morin
-- ON BIBI’S APPARENT WIN: “He’s a great ally and he’s a friend,” Trump said, adding: “Everybody said you can’t have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians. I think we have a chance. I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won.” More from Caitlin Oprysko
-- ON STEPHEN MILLER: A “brilliant man.” Asked whether he’s considered picking the 33-year-old White House aide to replace Kirstjen Nielsen as DHS secretary, given Miller’s expansive role in immigration policy, Trump said: “Frankly, there is only one person that is running it. You know who that is? It’s me.” More from Rebecca Morin
-- ON RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS: “I would love to give them but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit. … I have no obligation to do that while under audit and no lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you’re under audit.” Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee have set a deadline of today for the Treasury Department to fork them over -- no way that’s happening.
Trump added: “Frankly, the people don’t care.” A recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 49% of registered voters do care that Trump has not released his tax returns, while 42% do not (8% were undecided). The poll … More from Caitlin Oprysko

DEPARTURE LOUNGE … Today is DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s last day at the agency. Our colleague Anita Kumar emails: “After a pre-scheduled gathering at 2:30 to recognize DHS’ move to the old St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Nielsen has invited some staff back to the secretary’s suite to celebrate her last day. About 200 people, many political appointees across DHS, are invited to the 3:15 p.m. event, one person tells us.”
DHS LATEST -- “White House eyeing former head of anti-immigration group for DHS job,” by Ted Hesson, Anita Kumar and Andrew Restuccia: “Julie Kirchner, the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which pushes for lower levels of immigration, is being considered as an option to lead the agency, the sources said. She had also been considered for the deputy director role in recent weeks.
“If selected, she would replace Francis Cissna, who is expected to be ousted by the end of this week, according to three sources familiar with the matter, as President Donald Trump and aide Stephen Miller continue their purge of top Homeland Security officials.” POLITICO
JARED VS. EVERYBODY …
-- Anita Kumar: “GOP senators try to undermine Kushner’s immigration plan”: “Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, David Perdue of Georgia and Josh Hawley of Missouri, key allies of President Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, will introduce a bill Wednesday that would favor admitting skilled workers and their immediate family members but cut by half the number of legal immigrants, according to officials close to the process.
“The bill will serve to both challenge [Jared] Kushner’s unexpected effort to increase the number of low- and high-skilled workers, and to remind Trump to make good on his promise to cut both legal and illegal immigration. …
“Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, who has been working on a plan for months, presented his proposal to the president last week, according to one person familiar with the situation. The president told him he should expand the proposal to include both changes to legal and illegal immigration so as to address what he calls a crisis on the southern border, the person said.” POLITICO
JARED VS. STEPHEN … WaPo’s Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Bob Costa: “Miller and Kushner on a potential collision course in Trump’s border crisis”: “The two political survivors from Trump’s 2016 campaign have emerged as all but untouchable because of their close relationship — and, in [Jared] Kushner’s case, familial ties — with the president. But if [Stephen] Miller represents Trump’s id — reaffirming his hard-line immigration impulses — Kushner attempts to channel the president’s desire to be seen as a consummate dealmaker.” WaPo

THE INVESTIGATIONS … “Hush-Money Probe Gathered Evidence From Trump’s Inner Circle,” by WSJ’s Nicole Hong, Rebecca Ballhaus and Rebecca Davis O’Brien: “The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office has gathered more evidence than previously known in its criminal investigation of hush payments to two women who alleged affairs with Donald Trump, including from members of the president’s inner circle.
“Prosecutors interviewed Hope Hicks, a former close aide to Mr. Trump and White House communications director, last spring as part of their campaign-finance probe, which ultimately implicated the president in federal crimes. They also spoke to Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump’s former security chief. …
“New details of the investigation — gleaned from interviews with 20 people familiar with the probe and from nearly 1,000 pages of court documents — show prosecutors had gathered information about Mr. Trump’s alleged involvement in the payments weeks before Mr. Cohen asserted it in open court.” WSJ
MORE TROUBLE FOR HERMAN CAIN … WaPo’s Tracy Jan and Heather Long: “She was vilified for accusing Herman Cain of sexual harassment. Eight years later, she has no regrets”: “[Sharon] Bialek’s experience, after she accused Cain of groping beneath her skirt and pushing her head toward his crotch when she came to him in 1997 seeking employment advice, offers a rare glimpse of an often overlooked aspect of sexual misconduct allegations. What happens to the women who come forward with accusations against men in positions of power, once the story has moved on?
“Now back in the spotlight — this time in the Me Too era when a number of prominent men have been accused of sexual harassment — Bialek said she expects her allegations to be part of Cain’s vetting process. She is willing to testify before the Senate Banking Committee if called upon. And she said Cain’s past behavior with women, including three others who have accused him of sexual harassment, should disqualify him from the Fed post.” WaPo
-- TRUMP was asked by reporters this morning whether his pick of Cain to serve on the Fed board is safe, and said “I like Herman Cain and Herman will make that determination. … As to how he’s doing in the process, that I don’t know. … Herman’s a great guy and I hope he does well.”
ICYMI -- KYLE CHENEY: “FBI brass discussed possibility Trump fired Comey ‘at the behest of’ Russia, ex-official told Congress”
RIP OPM? -- “If Trump has his way, this major federal agency is on the way out,” by WaPo’s Lisa Rein and Damian Paletta: “If the Trump administration succeeds at dismantling the Office of Personnel Management, the closure could be a blueprint for shuttering other departments as it tries to shrink government.
“The agency would be pulled apart and its functions divided among three other departments. An executive order directing parts of the transition by the fall is in the final stages of review, administration officials said, with an announcement by President Trump likely by summer. OPM employees were briefed at a meeting in March. For Trump, the breakup of the 5,565-employee federal personnel agency would offer a jolt of bureaucratic defibrillation to a slow-to-change workforce that the president and his top aides have targeted as a symptom of a sluggish, inefficient government.” WaPo
-- The key question: But who would tell us about D.C. snow days?
HEALTH CARE LATEST … “Republicans Revive Efforts to Preserve Health-Law Provisions,” by WSJ’s Andrew Duehren: “The legislation is an opportunity for Republicans to show that they also support protecting pre-existing conditions, as the party gears up for another election cycle, according to a Senate GOP aide. Republicans may push for it to become law if the ACA is invalidated in court, the aide said.” WSJ
-- “Sanders unveils revamped ‘Medicare for All’ plan,” by Adam Cancryn: “Sen. Bernie Sanders tried to stake his position as the leading progressive in a crowded presidential field on Wednesday by rolling out a ‘Medicare for All’ plan, in the process reopening divisions among Democrats after President Donald Trump united them with his renewed assault on Obamacare.” POLITICO
-- DEEP DIVE: “Would ‘Medicare for All’ Save Billions or Cost Billions?” by NYT’s Josh Katz, Kevin Quealy and Margot Sanger-Katz
2020 WATCH -- “Burned in 2016, unions hold back endorsements,” by Ian Kullgren and Natasha Korecki: “Even as Democratic contenders are well into the process of courting high-ranking and local labor officials, union leaders plan to delay their endorsements as they take the temperature of members on the ground in an attempt to avoid the top-down approach that caused so much heartburn. …
“The candidates will face one of their first hurdles Wednesday when nine of them speak at a conference of the North America’s Building Trades Unions. The federation of construction unions will serve as an early litmus test for winning over blue-collar workers in swing states that went for Donald Trump over Clinton.” POLITICO
BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Eying Supreme Court, abortion foes promote tough state bans,” by AP’s David Crary: “Emboldened by the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court, anti-abortion lawmakers and activists in numerous states are pushing near-total bans on the procedure in a deliberate frontal attack on Roe v. Wade.
“Mississippi and Kentucky have passed laws that would ban most abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected — which means as early as six weeks, when many women don’t even know they’re pregnant. Georgia could join them if Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signs a measure that has been sent to him, and similar bills are pending in at least eight other states with anti-abortion GOP majorities in their legislatures.” AP
WHAT NIKKI HALEY’S UP TO -- “Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has book coming in the fall,” by AP’s Hillel Italie: “St. Martin’s Press announced Wednesday that Haley’s book, currently untitled, will come out this fall. According to the publisher, the 47-year-old Haley will write about her experiences as ambassador in 2017-18 and her six years before that as governor, sharing ‘the consequential actions, decisions, confrontations, and behind-the-scenes negotiations that shaped national and world events.’ Haley also will offer ‘deeply personal’ insights and the ‘challenges’ she faced as a woman during her time in government.” AP

She lobbied for clients including CVS Health , FedEx and Target at the Bockorny Group and expects to bring some clients with her, according to Invariant. She’s also a former lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a former chief of staff to former Rep. William Jefferson (D-La.). She’s the second Democrat who’s joined Invariant in recent weeks, along with Quincy Enoch , a former lobbyist for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies .
LONGTIME RAILROAD LOBBYIST STARTS HER OWN FIRM: Susan Andres , a longtime lobbyist for the Union Pacific railroad, has started her own lobbying firm, the Cactus Group . (The name is a nod to Arizona, where she grew up.) She’s signed two clients so far — the Association of American Railroads and Merck — and plans to add two more in the coming weeks, she told PI in an interview. She’ll focus on trade, health care and appropriations work, among other issues.
— Andres has particularly strong relationships with many of the eight Republican women in the Senate and the 13 in the House, she said. She’s involved in the Value in Electing Women PAC and E-PAC , the leadership PAC of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), both of which support female Republican candidates. She wrote personal checks last year to the campaigns of Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Reps. Martha Roby (R-Ala.) and Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), according to campaign finance records. “It’s time for the party to look more like America than it has” in the past, Andres said.

HOW MUCH THE BANKS ON THE HILL TODAY SPENT ON LOBBYING: The chief executives of seven major bank and investment firms — Bank of America , Bank of New York Mellon , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and State Street Corporation — arrived on the Hill this morning to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. As you might expect, all of them have a presence in Washington. The seven companies together spent $14.8 million on Washington lobbying last year, filings. Citigroup spent the most, at $4.5 million; State Street spent the least, at $1.5 million. All of them also have active corporate PACs that give to members of Congress — including, of course, members of the committee.

Mnuchin: China to establish ‘enforcement office’ as part of any U.S. deal,www.politico.com,ADAM BEHSUDI,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/mnuchin-us-china-trade-1342091,"The United States and China are working on the establishment of an “enforcement office“ to help Beijing live up to commitments it makes in a trade deal with the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reiterated on Wednesday.
“We will have a process on both sides with significant resources,” Mnuchin said during the annual Bretton Woods Committee conference in Washington.
The two countries have “pretty much agreed on an enforcement mechanism,” Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC earlier the same day. “We’ve agreed that both sides will establish enforcement offices that will deal with the ongoing matters. This is something both sides are taking very seriously.”
Those comments echoed what Mnuchin told a House Financial Services Committee hearing earlier this week. The enforcement office will be under Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, he said Tuesday.
At the Bretton Woods event, Mnuchin declined to go into more detail about the enforcement setup, but said he mentioned the concept to “emphasize the commitment both sides have” in terms of enforcing a deal.
Mnuchin said he was “cautiously hopeful” the two sides could reach an overarching agreement to address China’s industrial policies that the U.S. has criticized.
President Donald Trump met with Liu last week when China’s chief negotiator was visiting Washington for a round of talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Trump said he was hopeful a deal could be reached within the next month but a White House statement after the meeting said “significant work remains.”
The two sides have yet to reach a compromise on the conditions under which the U.S. will agree to withdraw tariffs on more than $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, according to a source briefed on the talks.
Reaction to the news that the U.S. and China reached a deal on enforcement was cautious on Capitol Hill.
“I feel very good, if that information is accurate,” Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said Wednesday. “There’s only one caveat I’d put on this statement: Mnuchin is making the statement instead of Lighthizer. Mnuchin is a little softer on trade issues with China than Lighthizer is, but they’re a team so maybe they’re on the same page.“
Mnuchin said he and Lighthizer spoke by phone with Liu last night for “a very long time” and another call was scheduled for Thursday morning.
He said a deal with China will be comprised of seven chapters and said a chapter to address currency manipulation is “basically complete.”
“I would say this is one of the strongest currency agreements we have reached,” he said.

DeVos 'not familiar' with affirmative action guidance her agency scrapped,www.politico.com,BENJAMIN WERMUND,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/betsy-devos-affirmative-action-1342089,"Education told a House panel Wednesday that she is ""not familiar"" with affirmative action guidance for schools that the Trump administration rescinded last summer or with a major Supreme Court ruling on which portions of the guidance were based.
The administration in July rescinded several guidance documents issued by the Education and Justice departments under the Obama administration that called on school superintendents and colleges to consider race when diversifying their campuses.
They included 2011 guidelines for public schools that detailed a number of ways that school districts could consider diversity without making decisions based on the race of individual students. The Obama guidance stressed that school districts must “use race-neutral approaches only if they are workable.” But when they’re not, “school districts may employ generalized race-based approaches.”
Under questioning on Wednesday from Rep. David Trone (D-Md.) about the move to scrap the guidance, DeVos said she is ""not familiar with that particular document."" The exchange came during DeVos' first appearance before the House Education Committee since Democrats took control of the chamber.
When asked about a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 , which portions of the guidance were based on, DeVos said, ""I'm not familiar with that particular case.""
A majority of the justices in the ruling recognized that seeking diversity and avoiding racial isolation are compelling interests for school districts but ruled the Seattle school district’s use of race as the second most important tiebreaker in high school admissions was unconstitutional.
Trone told DeVos that the ""rescission of that guidance has caused confusion and fear about the intent of the Trump administration.""
""So I’d like to give you an opportunity to clarify,"" he said. ""I want to be clear that no matter what your action is, federal law and Supreme Court precedent still stands.""
DeVos responded: ""It’s valuable for every student to be in a school setting that has great diversity. I think it’s valuable for every student.
""The goal should be to have diversity of every sort,"" DeVos said. ""The Supreme Court has opined in this and has given very clear guidance.""
Earlier in the exchange, Trone asked DeVos whether she believes racial segregation ""poses a threat to the educational opportunities for children of color,"" to which DeVos responded: ""I’m concerned about every student, no matter where they are and where they go to school.""
Trone pressed her again, saying, ""That’s an easy one, give me a yes on that one.""
""I am concerned with every student,"" DeVos responded.
The questions came a day after revelations that Texas Tech University’s medical school would stop considering race in admissions under an agreement with the Trump administration, which has targeted affirmative action in college admissions.
The Texas Tech agreement marked the first time the administration has reached a resolution in a probe of the use of race in admissions — and it could foretell how the administration will proceed with ongoing investigations into whether Harvard and Yale universities are discriminating against Asian-American applicants in their use of race in admissions.
The Justice Department, separately, has also backed a lawsuit targeting Harvard's use of race in admissions.
Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the chairman of the committee, told DeVos at the end of the hearing that Democrats will follow up on questions about the diversity guidance, as “you seem to be a little unclear on that.""

The same has been the case with policy-oriented liberals like George McGovern in ’72 and Michael Dukakis in ’88."" In other words: In most instances, the more the public sees a Democrat actually doing policy, and the more familiar they are with the person over time, the less they like him/her. I actually predicted this when Hillary announced her run. I knew enough people in exactly the right states liked the _idea_ of Hillary way more than they were going to like the reality, and the more they saw of her, the more they were not going to be able to stand her. And that's exactly how it turned out. So why is this, exactly, if the author's thesis and its corollaries are correct, which I think they mostly are? What does it mean that people like the ""feel"" they get from somebody like O'Rourke, or Bill Clinton, or whoever? (At least Clinton had run a state. I'm not making a comparison on the merits, experience, etc., here.) And what does it mean that they play into that ""feel"" and away from the details?

Michael Grimm schmoozed with former colleagues on the House floor Wednesday, eager to make his case for why he’s the best GOP candidate to win back a highly competitive New York City congressional district next year.
Grimm, the former congressman who resigned after pleading guilty to felony tax fraud, told POLITICO last month that he’s “90 percent of the way” to running for his old, Staten Island-based seat. But he faces an uphill battle in convincing House Republicans in D.C. that they should back him as the GOP's nominee to take on freshman Democratic Rep. Max Rose .
A number of key House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), have contributed money to a different candidate: state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis. But McCarthy still met privately with Grimm early Wednesday afternoon to discuss the Staten Island Republican's candidacy.
Grimm stressed that the grassroots support is behind him and told McCarthy that some in Washington are not doing their homework on the local dynamics of the race, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting.
“McCarthy always believes that the power rests with the constituents of the district to choose their representatives,” McCarthy spokesperson Matt Sparks said in response to questions about the meeting.
Malliotakis, who announced her candidacy in January, has spent the first few months locking down support from GOP power-brokers. In addition to McCarthy, she received contributions from New York Reps. Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin . Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), who oversees recruitment of the National Republican Campaign Committee, also donated to Malliotakis' campaign.
“The $10,000 donation from McCarthy’s leadership PAC speaks volumes,” said Rob Ryan, Malliotakis’ spokesperson.
But multiple local GOP officials expressed irritation with national Republicans for jumping into the race so early and picking a candidate they think could lose to Rose.
“That’s nice that Washington is deciding what we should have over here,” quipped Art Cappabianca, the former GOP Staten Island district leader. “Don’t tell me who I should or shouldn’t vote for. I kind of resent that.”
Party officials on Staten Island are worried about the positions Malliotakis took during her 2017 run for New York City mayor against Bill de Blasio, including her comments that she regretted voting for Trump.
“I’ve known Nicole for a long time,” Zeldin said, but added that he hasn’t had conversations with people on the ground in the district, which went for Trump in 2016 by 9.5 points. “I’d be interested to know what the full story was as far as exactly where the support is.""
Fellow New York Rep. Chris Collins said he “absolutely” thinks Grimm could win back the district.
“We want to get that seat back,"" said Collins, who is under indictment on securities fraud as part of an alleged insider-trading scheme and is awaiting a trial next year. ""He's very well-respected.""
A 2020 campaign would be Grimm's second comeback attempt. After resigning in 2015 and serving less than a year in prison, Grimm challenged then-GOP Rep. Dan Donovan in a primary last year. But Grimm's campaign failed to gain traction after President Donald Trump endorsed the incumbent Donovan, who went on to lose to Rose in last November's Democratic wave.
Grimm and Malliotakis aren't the only two Republicans eyeing the race. A potential third candidate, city councilman Joe Borelli, is expected to announce a bid for city public advocate this fall. The run doesn’t necessarily run him out for a House bid, however.
Rose, an Army veteran who is very aware of his status as a top target of the GOP in 2020, responded to Grimm’s visit to the Capitol: “Was sorry I missed him! I would’ve loved to catch up.”

"MTA to hire a ‘restructuring, efficiency, cost-cutting firm’ to rethink the bureaucracy",www.politico.com,drubinstein@politico.com (Dana Rubinstein),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/09/mta-to-hire-restructuring-expert-to-rethink-the-mta-962013,"Continue to article content
For $3.75 million, the MTA wants AlixPartners to develop that plan by July 31, according to an April 3 memo sent by Chairman Pat Foye to the authority’s board of directors, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO. | AP Photo MTA to hire a ‘restructuring, efficiency, cost-cutting firm’ to rethink the bureaucracy
First Enron and General Motors, now the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The MTA plans to hire AlixPartners, the restructuring firm that worked for the aforementioned clients, to help devise a plan to restructure its sprawling bureaucracy.
For $3.75 million, the MTA wants AlixPartners to develop that plan by July 31, according to an April 3 memo sent by Chairman Pat Foye to the authority’s board of directors, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.
""They’re solely a restructuring, efficiency, cost-cutting firm,” Foye said in an interview.
In management consulting jargon, restructuring and efficiency-finding exercises often translate into layoffs. Foye didn't rule out the prospect.
“Look, layoffs are a last resort, but they’re a possibility, yes,” he said Tuesday.
In early April, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state‘s legislative leaders reached agreement on a budget that includes several new funding streams for the MTA, including the institution of a toll on drivers entering Manhattan’s central business district.
Nevertheless, the MTA continues to face operating deficits of $500 million next year and $1 billion in 2022. More broadly, the MTA — which Cuomo effectively controls — continues to face what Foye described as a “credibility gap” with both riders and elected officials.
In recognition of that, Cuomo demanded the budget include several MTA reforms. They include hiring a management consultant to review the MTA’s operations and looking for ways to consolidate duplicative functions spread across its various agencies.
In an apparent response to the governor's insistence on that sort of exercise, the MTA in March sought board approval for a smaller, $2.3 million contract with AlixPartners.
In a rare act of defiance, the board’s finance committee voted to table the measure until the budget was approved.
Board members took issue with their exclusion from the consultant selection process — and the MTA’s insistence on enacting a gubernatorial priority ensconced in the budget — before that budget was complete.
“I’m somewhat concerned ... that staff is picking a consultant which may theoretically eliminate or change their positions,” said David Jones, an appointee of Mayor Bill de Blasio who supports the reform measures. “I think you may be circumventing what a board should be doing in this case.”
Now-former board member Charles Moerdler, an appointee of former Gov. David Paterson, called the MTA’s move “an unlawful delegation of the board’s authority.”
Meanwhile, an unusually emotional Peter Ward — a labor leader and Cuomo appointee — refused to vote on the measure, citing its rushed nature.
“I feel as if this would create the appearance that each one of us is a rubber stamp, to approve this,” he said. “I don’t want to have to hold my nose to make a decision like this ... This just doesn’t in my view appear correct, appear right, and it’s not something I want to do.”
In the interview, Foye — who was not present during that March meeting — said that thanks to the imminent deadline, the MTA didn’t have the luxury of going through an extended solicitation process involving board members, but that he would involve them moving forward. The board will have the opportunity to review the consultant’s findings, he said.
The board will also have another opportunity to consider the AlixPartners contract later this month, even though its composition has changed. Ward has resigned from the board. He did not respond to requests for comment. Moerdler has been removed.
AlixPartners, meanwhile, is already working to collect relevant documents to get a jump start on its sizable workload. The MTA won’t pay the consultant until the board approves the contract, the MTA says.
The cost of that proposed contract, meanwhile, has grown from $2.3 million in March to $3.75 million this month, something Foye attributed to the budget now mandating the consultant look for waste, fraud and conflicts of interest, as well as review the MTA’s ongoing capital plan. Its description of the restructuring work required of the consultant is also significantly more robust.
Though his memo doesn't explicitly mention it, Foye said the consultants might also look at reforming the MTA’s labor contracts, which many outside critics consider wasteful.
“I think everything is on the table,” he said.
Transit advocates, meanwhile, worried that this whole process might be too rushed.
In an interview, Manhattan Institute transportation expert Nicole Gelinas noted that “it takes years” to figure out the MTA.
Nick Sifuentes, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, agreed.
“I doubt we’re going to be in a position to have a full reorganizational plan by July,” he said. “That’s a monumental effort.”"
"Yes, Investigate the Investigators - POLITICO Magazine",www.politico.com,Peter Canellos,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/10/william-barr-trump-campaign-226648,"Attorney General William Barr dared to use the s-word. He said in congressional testimony Wednesday that the Trump campaign had been spied on by the U.S. government. Pressed by incredulous Senate Democrats, he clarified, “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.”
“Spying” has a negative connotation, so perhaps “surveilling” would be the better way to put it. But a key question is indeed whether there was “improper surveillance” of the campaign, as Barr stated at another point in the hearing.
The day before on Capitol Hill, Barr said he’s reviewing the conduct of the Russia investigation, which is getting denounced as an outrage by his critics. But why shouldn’t the attorney general of the United States seek to understand his department’s role in the high-stakes investigative melodrama of the past two years?
The Mueller probe was a national trauma. Its boosters didn’t experience it as such, of course. They enjoyed it and played it up and hoped for the very worst. But it cast a shadow over the White House, occupied an inordinate share of the nation’s political attention and saddled innocent people who were caught up in it with large legal bills.
And for what? To establish that the far-fetched theory that the Russians coordinated with the Trump campaign indeed wasn’t true, and to take a pass on pronouncing one way or the other whether President Trump allegedly obstructed justice? (And to nail Paul Manafort to the wall, something the Department of Justice surely could have done without the help of a special prosecutor?)
You don’t have to be a deep-state conspiracy theorist (I don’t particularly like the phrase “deep state” in the American context), to want to know how this got started and why.
Not to visit vengeance upon Trump enemies or “lock them up,” in the repurposed chant from Trump rallies, but to get to the truth, both for the sake of transparency and, one hopes, to avoid going down this route ever again.
After the Ken Starr investigation into Bill Clinton, even though the two parties had very different views of the merits of Starr’s work, there was a broad consensus that constantly subjecting a president and his Cabinet members to independent counsel probes was a bad idea. The independent counsel statue was allowed to lapse.
There’s going to be no similar consensus that this process went off the rails, obviously. The posture of Democrats will be to make the most of the actual Mueller report (including advancing dark theories about the reasons for redactions), and then move on to investigating Trump’s business dealings and to the fight to get his tax returns.
Everything is fair game is the era of nonstop investigations — except for the work of the people who stoked a yearslong hysteria about a nonscandal.
We should try to find out as reliably as possible how much FBI and other high-level officials were legitimately — and understandably — freaked out by some of the Russia connections of Trump associates and by what Trump said about Vladimir Putin, and how much they were acting in an amateurish panic and out of partisan malice.
How was it that a garbage anti-Trump dossier gathered by an ex-foreign spy from shadowy Russian sources came to set so much of the media narrative about the Russia probe, and evidently have an outsize influence on the thinking and the actions of the FBI?
It may be that without the dossier there wouldn’t have been a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against Carter Page. Barr is surely at least thinking of Page when he talks of spying during the campaign. It’s true that the FISA warrant on Page was approved after he had left the campaign, but the surveillance would have extended both forward and backward in time, to likely include campaign communications.
And the FBI obviously had the campaign in mind. It wrote in the FISA application, “The FBI believes that the Russian government’s efforts are being coordinated with Page & perhaps other individuals associated with [Trump’s] campaign.”
It can be true both that Page is an oddball with noxious views about Russia, and that an injustice was done to him.
How was it that the FBI opened an investigation against the president when he fired its director? And why did it apparently think it could make an obstruction of justice case against Trump for acting within his lawful powers?
In those fraught days after the firing of James Comey, why did Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoint Robert Mueller, in part, to investigate the cashiering of Comey that he was party to, and without specifying the crime that the president was being investigated for, as required under the special counsel regulation?
The appointment of Mueller was so key because once you have a special counsel, even one who is highly professional and judicious, you have an investigative beast roaming the landscape that will inevitably command an enormous amount of press attention and, past experience shows, find crimes to prosecute even if they are removed from his original charge.
Of course, this is precisely one of the reasons why Mueller had such fervent support among Trump’s detractors. But there is no reason that Barr should share their assumptions, or their horror at the idea of finding out more about the investigation that, for two solid years, they portrayed as the single most important event in American public life.
Maybe the s-word is indeed too pejorative. By getting as much information out publicly about the roots of Russia probe, Barr can let people decide for themselves."

— Disaster aid negotiations have collapsed in Congress, as another potential “bomb cyclone” storm is bearing down on the Midwest and the Plains. Producers affected by wildfires, hurricanes and flooding dating back to last year are likely to be left waiting for extra aid until after lawmakers return from a two-week recess.
— Environmental groups and individual farms today are asking Congress to focus on specific food and ag policies as lawmakers debate climate change legislation. Major food manufacturers also laid out their own climate policy priorities.
— Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told House lawmakers he wants to work with Congress on disaster aid to develop a fix for Midwestern growers whose stored grain was swamped by floodwaters last month but wasn’t insured. Perdue also defended the use of Roundup and said the definition of “able-bodied” as applied to food stamp recipients could benefit from “fine-tuning.”

DISASTER AID TALKS BREAK DOWN AS NEW STORM NEARS: With both chambers of Congress racing toward recess at the end of this week, Senate negotiations over a disaster relief package have collapsed, POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma and Marianne LeVine report . That means storm-struck communities from the Midwest to Puerto Rico will continue waiting for additional federal aid until at least the end of April.
The latest delay comes as another major storm threatens to cause further damage to farms, businesses and infrastructure in the Plains and Midwest, just a few weeks after the region was pummeled by a “bomb cyclone” that triggered massive flooding.
Forecast: The storm is projected to “rapidly strengthen across the nation’s heartland around Wednesday and Thursday,” bringing heavy winds, rain and snow, per AccuWeather. The National Weather Service is warning of a “potentially historic storm.”
On the Hill: Perdue said Tuesday that USDA can provide technical assistance to Congress on appropriations language that would enable farmers to access federal aid for crops that were in storage but weren’t covered against flood damage by current safety net programs, our Liz Crampton reports .
“We would love to be involved in helping the language as the disaster bill moves along, to be sure they get the flexibility,” Perdue said during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing.
Democrats and Republicans are both proposing to assist Midwestern states affected by the recent catastrophic flooding, but broader talks have been bogged down over financial relief for Puerto Rico. House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a new $17.2 billion measure, HR 2157 (116) , that includes $3 billion for farm-belt flood relief, Caitlin reports .
The Midwest doesn’t need billions in disaster aid like farmers in Southern states do, House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) told reporters on Tuesday. The majority of crops or livestock damaged by flooding in Nebraska and Iowa were covered by crop insurance or are eligible for farm bill disaster programs, which isn’t the case for many Southern crops like pecan trees and peaches hit by last year’s hurricanes, Peterson said.
“People are saying we have to get billions of dollars to the Midwest. Well, that’s a bunch of baloney,” he said. “The only thing that is not covered [in the Midwest] is this stored grain that was damaged. I think this is something we should look at, and do a one-time thing to help.”
FOOD, AG IN THE CLIMATE DEBATE SPOTLIGHT: More than 300 environmental groups, farms and other organizations today will send a letter to lawmakers asking them to “advance a Green New Deal that reflects the central role of food and agriculture in our climate crisis and its solutions,” referring to the non-binding progressive proposal to shift the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels within a decade.
MA got an early look at the letter , which represents the latest call to focus on changing food and farm policies through a federal effort to curb climate change.
The coalition calls for legislation to restrict methane emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations; reduce consumption of “industrially produced animal products” and promote plant-based foods; combat ag consolidation; and other policies likely to draw pushback from the industry.
FOUR TOP FOOD COMPANIES DEBUT CLIMATE PRINCIPLES: Mars, Danone, Nestlé and Unilever — which together formed the Sustainable Food Policy Alliance — unveiled climate policy principles today that will inform their advocacy on Capitol Hill.
The two-page document endorsed a carbon pricing system that would set prices transparently. There also should be incentives for the agriculture and forestry sectors to reduce and sequester greenhouse gas emissions that are combined with technical assistance for adopting certain practices, the alliance said.
Several other principles touch on accelerating innovation in renewable energy, investing in infrastructure that’s more resilient to the impacts of global warming, and ensuring vulnerable communities have the resources to take on the costs of any regulatory changes.
PERDUE: ‘ABLE-BODIED’ DEFINITION MAY NEED REFINING: During the same appropriations hearing, the secretary defended USDA’s proposed rule tightening work requirement waivers for some food stamp recipients, and suggested the definition of able-bodied adults without dependents — the population the rule would apply to — might need to be further refined.
“The definition describing able bodied may need some fine-tuning,” Perdue told the panel amid a back-and-forth with Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) about whether people deemed disabled or physically unfit for work considered able-bodied under Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program rules (they are not).
“Certainly we’re talking about people who are able to work,” Perdue added.“I think when you hear the term able-bodied, it’s people who are able to work from ages 18 to 49, not senior citizens, not parents with dependents, not pregnant women. Able-bodied adults without dependents.”
House Agriculture Democrats, including nutrition panel leader Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), have requested USDA provide lawmakers with demographic information on the population of able-bodied adults without dependents who would be affected by the rule.
“There’s probably a legal definition I’m just not aware of, of able-bodied,” Perdue told reporters after the hearing. “But that was a fine point that probably needs to be discussed further and communicated and convinced in that way.”
ROUNDUP’S DEMISE WOULD BE ‘DEVASTATING,’ PERDUE SAYS: The USDA chief told House appropriators that Roundup has “exponentially” increased agricultural productivity in the last 25 years, along with other crop protection chemicals, and he thinks it would damage the ag industry if the herbicide was pulled from the market, Liz writes .
The glyphosate-based weedkiller developed by Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) was the subject of two recent court cases resulting in multimillion-dollar verdicts against the agribusiness, and thousands more federal and state cases are lined up.

Sanders vows to blow up Senate rules to pass Medicare for All - POLITICO,www.politico.com,msn.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/sanders-rules-healthcare-1267463,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
A President Bernie Sanders isn’t going to let something as trivial as the Senate rules thwart his drive to pass Medicare for All.
The Vermont independent, one of the top-tier contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been skeptical of getting rid of the legislative filibuster to pass a sweeping legislative agenda. Instead, Sanders is taking a page from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who wanted to shred Senate rules in order to pass ambitious GOP health care legislation in 2017. Story Continued Below
Sanders has settled on budget reconciliation as his solution for evading the Senate’s 60-vote requirement, a blunt maneuver that allows certain spending bills to pass the Senate with a 50-vote majority. Most senators believe that sweeping legislation like Medicare for All would not be allowed under reconciliation, but Sanders said he’s not going to let that stop him.
“It is the vice president who determines what is and is not permissible under budget reconciliation. I can tell you that a vice president in a Bernie Sanders administration will determine that Medicare for All can pass through the Senate under reconciliation and is not in violation of the rules,” Sanders said in a statement after introducing the bill on Wednesday.
The move smacks of Cruz’s request from two years ago, when he argued the Senate GOP should disregard parliamentary guidance and jam through a full repeal-and-replacement of Obamacare in reconciliation. Cruz argued that Vice President Mike Pence should have ruled that the full gutting of Obamacare could pass via Senate rules, a move that GOP leaders rejected."

What Donald Trump Doesn’t Get About George Washington - Magazine,www.politico.com,Peter Canellos,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/10/trump-mount-vernon-george-washington-226619,"On March 4, 1797, George Washington did something that put him on a historic pedestal above Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte and every past conqueror and crowned head of Europe: He gave up power. This wasn’t expected of him; most Americans hoped he would remain president—for life, if possible.
Story Continued Below
He chose instead to return to his farm at Mount Vernon. He yearned for home but also to establish enduring precedents for the nation whose independence he had helped painfully win: No man is bigger than the country. The office is more important than any president. Power is a privilege to be wielded and then handed to another.
When Donald Trump visited Mount Vernon with French President Emmanuel Macron last year, he reportedly commented: “If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it. You’ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.”
There are ironies on top of ironies in the father of Trump Tower offering posthumous advice to the father of our country. But the greatest of them is that, 220 years after George Washington’s death, his name is everywhere and remembered by everyone, largely because he chose not to maximize his own opportunities for self-promotion.
With his offhand comment, Trump inadvertently revealed a key difference between himself and Washington, though no one, friend or foe, was likely surprised. More importantly, he spotlighted the distance between merely temporal fame—essentially, name recognition in one’s lifetime—and the grail of posthumous recognition that motivates so many people in public life, as much now as in the Revolutionary era.
Trump’s comment, while squiring Macron and his wife around Washington’s estate, no doubt reflected the truth of his experiences as a New York City real estate developer, reality-TV star and rookie presidential candidate who defied the odds—and all political norms—to win the office. In the worlds where Trump forged his reputation, few points were awarded for reticence. The opposite, however, can be true in posterity. In the long, considered judgment of history, selflessness is far more honored than self-aggrandizement.
Washington was neither modest nor lacking in ego. He was, by some measures, the wealthiest American of his age, combining his inheritance with his wife’s fortune and an extremely lucrative series of land purchases that made him proportionally far wealthier than his 43rd successor. But few people today either know or care that he was so vastly rich. He’s entirely remembered for the qualities that made him an outstanding steward of a young and fragile nation: the good judgment and sense of propriety that led him to put the national interest ahead of his own.
Washington understood that institutions outlive individuals. That may not seem like a radical notion, but it’s striking how unfamiliar it was in Washington’s day. Even more shocking was the idea that one could gain power and esteem by not coveting it. After leading the American Army to victory in the Revolutionary War, Washington made his first decision to retire to Mount Vernon, even though there were calls for him to be the monarch of the new nation.
Eight years later, after the failure of the Articles of Confederation showed the need for a stronger central government, Washington answered the call to become the nation’s first president. After eight successful years, he heeded his own instinct to step down. He was entirely conscious of the statement he was making. He stayed in the temporary capital of Philadelphia to attend the inauguration of his elected successor, John Adams, and then made a point of walking behind Adams as the crowd of worthies dispersed from the podium: The office is more important than any man.
The American tradition that even the most revered former officeholders must humbly stand behind their successors, recognizing that they are only guests in the house of power, is almost entirely the product of Washington’s exertions. So, too, are other traditions handed down from the Washington presidency, including the chief executive’s commitment to share power with Congress and the courts. It was one thing to sketch out such a system of government under the Constitution, but it didn’t become real until individuals—Washington foremost among them—actually chose to abide by those rules, creating a precedent we still follow today.
These concepts are now so widely accepted that they seem inevitable, like the products of natural law. They are the pillars of the American system. And even in a presidency as committed to pushing boundaries as Trump’s, they are barriers he can’t cross.
None other than King George III of the United Kingdom understood the force of Washington’s precedent, how in renouncing power for himself he was bestowing power on the nation he helped create. There’s an oft-told story of how the king once asked the British-American painter Benjamin West about Washington’s plans after the Revolution, to which West replied, “They say he will return to his farm.”
“If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world,” the king supposedly replied.
It’s unlikely that the conversation was so succinct, but the American diplomat Rufus King did relate in a letter a conversation with West in which the painter described the king as saying that Washington’s ability to climb to the heights of power and then climb down “placed him in a light the most distinguished of any man living” and that “he thought him the greatest character of his age.”
Indeed, at the tail end of the tour of Mount Vernon, a guide stationed in Washington’s study dutifully relates the story that he was the first person in all of history to assume so much power and then renounce it. So all these centuries of reverence, symbolized by the unending stream of visitors to Washington’s home, are the product of a decision not to call attention to himself.
Two hundred and thirty years after Washington assumed the presidency, the nation is shaped by forces Washington couldn’t have imagined—not just technologies like television and social media, but a whole ethos that conflates fame and success, money and virtue, and which gave rise to a leader who literally engineered his own fame through sticking his name on every building, and every product, he could manage.
It’s hard to imagine a more different sensibility than the one that guided the young Washington when, in 1761, he inherited the family plantation. He chose to keep the name his half-brother had given it—Mount Vernon, after Lawrence Washington’s former commanding officer. There is no evidence that he ever considered Trump’s suggestion that he name it after himself.
To this day, the white mansion on a hill remains Mount Vernon, not Mount Washington. But Wikipedia reveals that there are currently no fewer than 15 Mount Washingtons in the United States.
