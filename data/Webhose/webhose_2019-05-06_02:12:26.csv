British Internet Firewall European Union Launches Its Own Online ‘Fact-Checker’ to Fight ‘Europhobics’ European Commission, https://decodeursdeleurope.eu/ OLIVER JJ LANE 7 Apr 2019 The EU has set up its own “fact checking” service in order to combat the spread of so-called “fake news” ahead of May’s European elections. The new ‘Decoders of Europe’ site, based on the Boulevard St Germain in Paris, seeks to “answer a series of questions or accusations, explaining what constitutes the reality and sometimes the complexity of European policies. Beyond these explanations, our goal is also to better inform, on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, what works in Europe!” according to the EU website.
The site was launched by Isabelle Jegouzo, head of Representation of the European Commission in France. She said “Without getting involved in politics, we want to inform citizens, restore the balance between factual and misinformation ”

— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 14, 2018
Most of the “independent fact-checkers” operating at present tend towards a strong left-liberal bias, however, with well-known services such as Snopes rating debunked anti-conservative memes as “true”, and a clearly satirical article about left-liberal news network CNN purchasing a washing machine to “spin the news” as “false”, as if it had been a genuine news report.
PolitiFact, another well-known “fact-checker”, rated accurate claims by U.S. President Donald Trump about Russia’s nuclear arsenal as only “half-true”, on the subjective grounds that he was “missing the big picture”, and claims that Democrat presidential candidate Hilary Clinton had called for open borders as “mostly false”, despite her clearly stating that “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.”
How impartial an EU “fact-checking” service centred on the activities of the EU could ever hope to be seems open to doubt, considering how often the at least nominally independent ones cited above would appear to fall short.

According to a report by French newspaper Le Parisien , the “Decoders of Europe” are hoping to end false rumours and reports about the EU by what they describe, in rather loaded terms, as “europhobics”.
The move to establish the website follows actions the EU has already taken to combat supposed “fake news” as part of a broad strategy. According to questions posed to the commission, the EU has a four-point plan, which they described as:
Improving the capabilities of the Union’s institutions to detect, analyse and expose disinformation;
Strengthening coordinated and joint responses by EU institutions and Member States to disinformation;
Mobilising the private sector to tackle disinformation; and
Raising awareness about disinformation, and improving societal resilience.
In December 2018 the EU discussed the possibility of such a site, declaring that “measures to tackle disinformation online, including a self-regulatory EU-wide Code of Practice on Disinformation, signed by large online platforms and the advertising industry, as well as support for an independent network of fact-checkers” should be introduced.
The website appears to be a reaction to the rise of eurosceptic and populist parties ahead of the EU parliamentary elections in May. Reports last week indicate that a third of seats in the elections may be won by populist parties from across Europe, with Italy’s League party (Lega) under Matteo Salvini set to be the biggest winner.

Advertisement It is a completely spurious argument intended to protect the conservative agenda of it's links to fascist ideology of nationalism, racism, real power being only in the hands of the top state officials, supporting the wealthy and the powerful corporations and f*cking over everybody else.
They want the stupid low IQ poorly educated and gullible to believe that nazis and various forms of fascists are left wing, when the history and reality show the opposite.

Jonah Goldberg just keeps inspiring people—whether he intends to or not.
Take Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, for example. Earlier this week, after visiting a Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, Bolsonaro was asked whether he agreed with comments made by his foreign minister claiming that the Nazis of Germany were “leftists.”
He did: “There is no doubt, right?” he said to reporters. He added that the appearance of the word “socialist” in the Nazis’ official party name proved it.
The museum he had just visited, however, is clear about the matter, telling visitors at its website that the German Nazi party arose out of “radical right-wing groups” in Europe.
Where would Bolsonaro get such ideas? He didn’t credit anyone, but the ultimate lineage of this idea really belongs to Goldberg. Perhaps, secondarily and more contemporarily, he’s been absorbing the derivative work of Dinesh d’Souza.
Worst of all, he is far from alone. From Charlottesville to Portland to Christchurch, we’re awash in the effects of a resurgent white-nationalist movement that considers the “liberal smear” that fascism was a right-wing movement further evidence of a “cultural Marxist” campaign against white Western civilization.
D’Souza’s book The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left—which has been a bestseller, despite having been systematically dismantled by everyone from Ross Douthat to Mark Bray to Kevin M. Kruse and exposed as a risible fraud from start to finish—was in fact, as Douthat suggests, essentially a dumbed-down, frat-boy repackaging of Goldberg’s 2008 best-seller, Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning. D’Souza also made a slickly produced “documentary” pursuing this thesis further, titled Death of a Nation.
Indeed, it seems that even though Goldberg has been previously supportive of d’Souza’s work—including appearing in, as well helping to promote, his previous film, Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, which in fact includes his earliest iteration of the “Nazis were leftists” claim—he’s becoming uncomfortable with where the whole thing has been going.
This all came up, I should mention, in the context of a post Goldberg published at National Review’s blog The Corner last weekend, attacking me for a series of tweets in which I had tweaked him recently. But this is an argument dating back more than a decade.
“I am not a fan of Dinesh D’Souza’s effort to take my argument and twist it into the kind of indictment of liberals Neiwert levels at conservatives or that I was accused of doing,” he wrote.""

WTF? U.S. Wants 2 Years To Find Thousands Of Separated Migrant Children,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120732.html,"WTF? U.S. Wants 2 Years To Find Thousands Of Separated Migrant Children Advertisement They cause the separations in an instant, ripped children from their parents ,shipped them many states away over night, failed to track the children and now they are trying to slow the court ordered return of the children to their parents because it is some kind of burden because they didn't track the children. This is so horrible, and this was completely avoidable, destructively abusive, permanently traumatizing these children and their families. Stephan Miller, Kirstjen Nielsen and Trump should all resign immediately and be tried for child abuse on a massive scale. U.S. Wants 2 Years To Find Thousands Of Migrant Children Separated From Parents The ACLU criticizes the government’s timeline request. ""The Trump administration seeks up to two years to track tens of thousands of additional immigrant children who may have been separated from their parents under President Donald Trump’s controversial “zero-tolerance” policy. It will take at least a year to review a total of about 47,000 cases of children taken into government custody between July 1, 2017, and June 25, 2018, before the practice of splitting families was halted, according to a Justice Department court filing on Friday in San Diego. “Defendants estimate that identifying all possible children” separated from their parents among that population “would take at least 12 months, and possibly up to 24 months,” according to the filing. Records would be assessed using data analysis, statistics and a manual review of whatever records exist. The children have already been released from government custody, the vast majority to parents or close relatives. But the Customs and Border Protection agency didn’t start tracing separated families as a searchable data set before April of last year, according to the filing, so records are spotty. Government officials propose releasing any information as it’s obtained to the American Civil Liberties Union, which launched a class action suit against the government last year addressing the family separations. The organization blasted the government’s timeline. “The government was able to quickly gather resources to tear these children away from their families and now they need to gather the resources to fix the damage,” ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said in a statement. “The government needs to make this a priority.”"" More: Making LOP Great again since 06-07-2013!

A surprising quantum front-runner - Axios,www.axios.com,Kaveh Waddell,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.axios.com/quantum-computing-cars-vw-mercedes-ford-3223a464-c65a-4163-b92b-6b7761116384.html,"Go deeper 567 Words The big picture: This new generation of computers, built on measuring the inscrutable activity of tiny, tiny particles, is at a drawn-out inflection point. Quantum computers are inching from theory toward practice, driven by a first wave of companies playing the long game, betting that the hires and investments they make today — plus the patents they file — will pay off years down the line. For car companies especially, there's a cosmic alignment between their big problems and the tasks quantum computers are likely to excel at, says Michael Brett, CEO of QxBranch, a D.C.-based quantum computing company. It's thought that the new technology will be able to optimize complex systems, like an assembly line. It could simulate chemical reactions essential for battery design with previously impossible accuracy. Or it might supercharge artificial intelligence , a key challenge for autonomous driving. But all of these are maybes. The research suggests that quantum computers will be able to do all these things — but they haven't yet. ""The field is so nascent that we haven't settled on the equivalent of transistors,"" says Yianni Gamvros, head of business development at QC Ware, a Silicon Valley quantum computing company. So companies are in a familiar bind: Jump in now and risk losing big, or wait it out and watch the competition possibly pull away. Despite the uncertainty, automakers have been hiring quantum experts and launching early experiments. Volkswagen was first on the scene with a project three years ago to optimize traffic in Beijing . Now, the group, which includes Audi, Porsche, and Ducati, is throwing all sorts of problems into the quantum machine, like developing chemical simulations and encryption that can withstand attacks from future quantum computers. Daimler, Mercedes' parent company, is using quantum computers to optimize routing for autonomous vehicles , and for battery research. Ford recently announced it is using quantum computing to manage energy consumption for commercial fleets . What's worrying them: Companies searching history for clues of how to proceed see a cautionary tale in the sudden explosion of artificial intelligence, says Matt Johnson, QC Ware's CEO. Businesses that were caught flat-footed by AI later rushed to catch up — only to find that most of the best and brightest minds had been lured by sexy startups and Big Tech. Already, quantum experts are scarce. ""There's a complete absence right now of actually talented people who can do quantum computing,"" says Lawrence Gasman, president of Inside Quantum Technology, a consulting firm. ""We want to make sure we have a group of people within Volkswagen who can work with these systems when we're ready to tackle this industrially relevant problems,"" says Florian Neukart, the scientist who heads VW's 15-person quantum effort. Plus, he says: ""We want to generate IP. We think now is the time."" If the first wave of adopters — which also includes Big Pharma and the oil and gas industry — strike gold, that could embolden many other sectors who are still waiting in the wings. ""If you're a fertilizer maker, you're probably not thinking about quantum computing at the moment,"" says William Altman, an analyst at CB Insights. That's despite the fact that quantum computers could help find new, profitable ways of making ammonia, an essential fertilizer ingredient. ""But if you see a company like Mercedes getting into quantum computing, it might open your eyes to the fact that quantum isn't just about tech companies."" "

[PHOTO/ COURTESY]
Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga was this evening roughed and beaten up by irate Gor Mahia supporters who also seem to be ODM diehards at the Nyayo Stadium after the Gor Mahia vs RS Berkane match.
Rasanga was beaten for messing the ODM campaigns and threatening to deny Ugenya wealth for electing David Ochieng.
The Governor’s kaunda suit was completely torn and was rescued by ODM party leader Raila Odinga and his bodyguards who whisked him away in his car.
Chants of poor performer! poor performer! were heard.
The ODM and Gor Mahia supporters say they must discipline all those who disappointed the party in the by-elections.
Read: Governor Rasanga Threatens To Halt Development In Ugenya In Case ODM Candidate Loses
ODM failed to clinch parliamentary seats for Embakasi South and Ugenya, where they claimed to have political muscle against other parties.
The failure was attributed to poor organisation and campaign strategies, where they branded their opponents DP Ruto projects instead of outlining their manifesto.
A Embakasi South, Wiper’s Julius Mawathe has won the seat with a total of 1,628 votes while ODM’s Irshad Sumra got 7,988.
In Ugenya, little known Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) party candidate David Ochieng trounced ODM’s Christopher Karani who garnered 14, 567 votes, against Ochieng’s 18,730 votes.
Governor Rasanga had warned the residents that they would not get development in case they did not vote in ODM’s candidate.
“You risk losing county goodies if you don’t vote for ODM candidate Chris Karan. Just like ODM party leader Raila Odinga said we should not embarrass him in the by-election elections, it is the same way community health workers on county payroll should not embarrass me,” Rasanga said.

Visit the African savannas in Zimbabwe or Namibia, and you might notice large, towering termite mounds dotted about the landscape -- nature's skyscrapers, if you will. And nature is quite the engineer: those mounds are self-cooling, self-ventilating, and self-draining. New 3D X-ray images have revealed that one of the secrets to this impressive efficiency is a vast network of micropores in the walls of the mounds, according to a recent paper in Science Advances.

Identity politics: The new form of privileged tyranny,www.blabber.buzz,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.blabber.buzz/conservative-opinion/541539-identity-politics-the-new-form-of-privileged-tyranny-special,"Sunday, 07 April 2019 00:53 Identity politics: The new form of privileged tyranny Featured Written by Washingtonexaminer
When a member of the House of Representatives was accused recently of making anti-Semitic remarks, some of her accusers supported their accusations by saying that her remarks were ""hurtful."" What an odd thing to say.
Anti-Semitism is odious, unjust, and wrong. Why not use those words to describe it? Why call it ""hurtful?""
The answer becomes clear if we consider this exchange between a professor and a student that took place at Evergreen State College in Washington, as reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education. When the self-described progressive professor objected to the plans of certain students and faculty on his campus, he defended himself by saying, “I am talking about terms that serve the truth.” The student responded, “We don’t care what terms you want to speak on. We are not speaking on terms of white privilege.”
What the student meant was that the most important fact about the professor’s words was not whether they were logically consistent or based on evidence, and thus true or false. The important thing was that they were spoken by a white man, and therefore the student chose to deem them worthless.
Another Evergreen professor reportedly remarked about his colleague’s objections that it was “unintentionally racist, but racist nonetheless” for a white person [the professor] to question the wisdom of [students] who “know the experiences of exclusion and oppression.” This professor was pointing to the inevitable result of privileging, as people now say, identity over truth.
When truth gives way to identity, logic, and evidence inevitably give way to mere experience and the feelings that accompany that experience. What else is left? Thus, the proof that a statement is anti-Semitic is that it hurt someone’s feelings.
Certainly anti-Semitism does hurt feelings, but to object to it only on that ground is trivializing. But the harmful effects of replacing truth with identity go well beyond trivializing anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice.
Those who see identity as fundamental also tell us that it is changeable or fluid. Gender, for example, is held not to be natural, but rather assignedand subject to change according to the feelings or will of each individual. Gender and other forms of identity have no basis, therefore, other than the will of the individual who asserts an identity.
But if identity is the source of truth, and identity is a matter of will, then truth — and all claims of oppression and injustice — are also only matters of will. This is the point where identity politics produces its greatest harm.
If issues of justice and oppression must be decided on identity or mere willfulness, then no one can appeal to facts and evidence to bridge the gap between opposing views. Politics can only be about asserting power, as in the confrontation between the student and the professor described above. The student was in effect telling the professor, “You’re wrong because you’re white. Shut up and obey.”
Identity politics leaves no room for civil discussion. It inevitably leads to power politics, a modern euphemism for tyranny.
There is a terrible irony here. Those who decry injustice and oppression on the basis of their identity make the same argument that antebellum slave owners made when they claimed the right to rule, indeed, to own, others solely on the basis of race.
Fortunately for all of us, the slave owners met their match in Abraham Lincoln. Politics being what it is, Lincoln needed armies to destroy the institution of slavery, but Lincoln and all who supported him knew his armies marched in the cause of right and justice because of the irrefutable logic of Lincoln’s words.
It is to those words, inspired by the claim of human equality in the Declaration of Independence, that all who today care about justice and freedom may still turn.
David Tucker, Ph.D. is the Director of Teacher Programs at the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio, and General Editor of Ashbrook’s “Core Document Collections.” Senate due diligence should trump identity politics
After the Wall Street Journal editorial board took to task Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., earlier this year for asking substantive due process questions of a Republican judicial nominee, George Mason law professor David Bernstein decided to take his turn this week, setting his sights on Sen.
Mike Lee, R-Utah.
Both the Wall Street Journal and Bernstein took issue with these senators, whose constitutional role requires them to vet nominees, for asking these nominees serious policy and legal questions, instead of just rubber-stamping them.
In a recent piece in Reason, Bernstein levels a heavy charge at both Hawley and Lee. Their questioning of the nominees, he claims, is “skating awfully close to white Christian identity politics.” (This was his original headline, before ‘white Christian’ was removed.)
After routing Hawley for vetting Neomi Rao (who, by the way, both Hawley and Lee voted to confirm), Bernstein turns most of his attack on Lee for raising legitimate questions about the pro-life positions of Jessie Liu. Liu was considered, though never formally nominated, for the position of associate attorney general. Bernstein, as he discloses, is personal friends with both Rao and Liu.
In his deep dive into identity politics, Bernstein grossly mischaracterizes and disregards Lee’s legitimate concerns about Liu, undersells to the point of dismissing altogether Liu’s role and leadership of a blatantly pro-abortion organization, and bows to the forces of the Left that see everything through a racial and gender bias lens.
Bernstein asserts that Lee only opposed Liu because of her “prior affiliation with the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), which opposed Sam Alito’s 2005 nomination to the Supreme Court based in part on concerns about reproductive rights.” NAWL “is a professional development organization,” he says, and “any statements it makes related to abortion are tangential to its mission.”
Bernstein is glossing over a lot of details here that are actually quite important.
First, Liu was not simply “affiliated” with NAWL. She was in the group's leadership. Liu was vice president of the group in 2005, and later president-elect (she left the group before officially receiving the promotion). Her name appears on the masthead of letters critical of both Alito as well as Chief Justice John Roberts over their pro-life views. The letter to Alito, in particular, declared him unqualified to serve on the Supreme Court due his dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which NAWL called “a pointed attack on the abortion right.”
Moreover, as NAWL vice president, Liu served on the board that approved the organization as a signatory to amicus briefs. Amicus briefs are submitted by parties who have a strong interest in one side of the case or the other. One of those amicus briefs filed during Liu’s tenure opposed a New Hampshire law that would have required a 48-hour waiting period for minors seeking an abortion. In the brief, NAWL describes itself as an organization which “promotes reproductive rights.”
After Liu withdrew her name from consideration for associate attorney general, NAWL issued a press statement attacking those who had questioned Liu and whom they blamed for Liu’s withdrawal. Their statement actually underscores the legitimacy of Lee’s concerns about Liu’s leadership of an organization publicly devoted to protecting abortion, not babies.
In its statement, the group noted that it is dedicated to upholding women’s legal rights, “including protecting those rights reflected … in the U.S. Supreme Court.” An article in which the statement appears notes that NAWL has, over the past few decades, taken sides on political issues and ""believes in a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion.”
Liu’s involvement with NAWL is far from a mere affiliation. Rather, the actions the organization took while Liu was in a leadership position, which she presumably knew about and was involved in, raise completely reasonable questions as to her beliefs on life and abortion. Her leadership role with a pro-abortion organization compelled March for Life Action to issue a strongly worded opposition letter to her potential nomination.
Senators to whom protecting life is a significant issue of jurisprudence are well within their rights and obligations to ask questions of any nominee, but particularly one whose activities and background raise several red flags, as was the case with Liu.
To malign a senator for performing his constitutional role with claims of racism is absurd on its face. Moreover, it absorbs the Left’s tired identity politics hurled against anyone who opposes them on anything. Case in point, in reporting on the Liu nomination, CNN quoted an anonymous “senior” Department of Justice official, who called Lee a “moron” for opposing “an Asian woman.”
Since when did race and gender become more important to conservatives and libertarians than jurisprudence, qualifications, and a commitment to principles to which senators have committed themselves, such as the rights of the unborn?
Bernstein holds himself out to be a learned commentator on legal and jurisprudential affairs, but rather than recognizing the substantive concerns that Liu’s background raise, he chooses to denounce Lee with dismissive arrogance and gripes of identity politics.
In doing so, he does a disservice to the country, and more so, to these senators who are diligently carrying out their responsibilities and their pledges to protect the unborn.
The Senate would do well to have more members doing their jobs like Hawley and Lee are doing theirs.

Stacey Abrams: ‘Identity Politics Are the Politics That Win’
Failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams praised the “identity politics” of the progressive left as both electorally effective and morally right during a speech at Reverend Al Sharpton’s National Action Network convention in New York on Wednesday.
“Identity politics is nothing more complex than saying, ‘I see you,’” Abrams said. “I lean in to identity politics. I believe in identity politics. And I believe identity politics are the politics that win.”
Abrams went on to fan the speculation surrounding her possible entry into the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential field, telling the audience that she has not yet made a decision. “No, I don’t know what I’m doing next yet” she said when asked about a possible presidential run. The comments come after Abrams shot down the suggestion that she might enter the race as Joe Biden’s running mate early in the primary in order to bolster his credibility among racial minorities and younger progressives. “I think you don’t run for second place,” she said during an appearance on ABC’s The View last week. “If I’m going to enter a primary, then I’m going to enter a primary. And if I don’t enter a primary, my job is to make certain that the best Democrat becomes the nominee and whoever wins the primary that we make sure that person gets elected in 2020.”
Abrams refused to concede after losing the Georgia gubernatorial race to Republican Brian Kemp last year, arguing during her appearance on The View that to do so would have been to surrender her “power.”
“We are so often, if you come from the outside, taught to be complicit in your own demise. You are taught to accept what happens to you because that’s the only way you can make progress. But the reality is, the more you accept the diminution of your power, the more powerless you become,” she said.
The former Georgia state lawmaker has cast her defeat to Kemp in explicitly racial terms on many occasions, arguing that Kemp, in his role as secretary of state, actively worked to disenfranchise voters. She has also attributed the disparity between the donations and media attention Beto O’Rourke’s Senate campaign received and those her own gubernatorial campaign received to race.
“I don’t think success is zero-sum so I don’t want to disparage or take away from the reaction or the legitimate response people had for his campaign,” she said. “But I do want to call the question. I think race plays a part. I think region plays a part. I also think phenotype plays a part.” Political correctness, identity politics could create huge problems for the military, country at-large: Dan Crenshaw
Former Navy SEAL-turned-politician Dan Crenshaw is taking aim at political correctness.
Rep. Crenshaw, R-Texas, said Friday that identity politics is a problem in America that will have dire consequences for the military and the country.
“It’s certainly a problem in America at-large. What is identity politics? It’s this temptation to divide us up into different groups. Whether that be based on race, gender, or some other category and then pit those groups against each other and compete for power accordingly,” Crenshaw said on “Fox & Friends.”
“The way America should be is the only colors that matter are red, white, and blue. And that we compete according to our competency, that we compete according to a meritocracy which is really a fundamental element to the military. If you take that away from the military... the military will eventually fail and our country at-large will fail.”
Crenshaw was reacting to comments from retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland who Monday called identity politics a “cancer” and said it was getting harder to get everybody “playing for the same team.”
The way America should be is the only colors that matter are red, white, and blue. — Rep. Dan Crenshaw
""Is it getting harder in the U.S. military to assimilate everybody and get everybody on the same — playing for the same team? Yeah, it is. Identity politics is a cancer,” MacFarland said at an event hosted by the American Enterprise Institute.
Crenshaw agreed with MacFarland and was critical of America’s colleges for their role in promoting identity politics.
“It’s sort of this postmodern mentality... on college campuses especially, there’s this real temptation to tear down everything this country was built on to tear down these enlightenment ideals of equality,” he told ""Fox & Friends.""
“They have different ideas of what equality means, right. They think quality means egalitarianism. They think it means everybody should have the exact same thing and… that there’s injustices all around them.
""But the reality is that we’re supposed to compete in a free society as free individuals and part of that competition is a meritocracy and that’s what our country was founded on. And I think people are forgetting that.”
