""I think this is a really important time in our country's history, when women are coming forward and able to say when they have been made to feel uncomfortable, whether in a sexual way or a non-sexual way,"" Bennet said during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ADVERTISEMENT
Bennet, who has said he is likely to run for president if he beats a recent cancer diagnosis, added that it's up to voters to determine if the allegations against Biden are ""disqualifying."" Biden is also likely to announce a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination this month.
""On the question of whether it's disqualifying or not, that's up for the voters in a Democratic primary and in a general election to decide,"" he said.

Several women have come forward in recent weeks and alleged that Biden touched them inappropriately over the years.
Biden responded by saying in a video last week that he would be more ""mindful"" in respecting the personal space of women. But on Friday, he made jokes about the accusations in his first public appearance since the allegations were made.
“I want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,” Biden said to the crowd of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers conference after giving a hug to Lonnie Stephenson, the union president.
Biden later invited children on stage and put his arm around one of the boys on stage.
""By the way, he gave me permission to touch him,” Biden said."

New satellite imagery shows that construction on an experimental reactor is making ""expeditious"" progress -- just three months after the Kingdom announced plans to build it, according to former director for nuclear inspections at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Robert Kelley. Kelley estimated that the reactor could be completed in ""nine months to a year."" The Kingdom has been open about its nuclear program with the IAEA, which sent a team to Saudi Arabia last July to check on building plans. It has repeatedly pledged that the program is peaceful. But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year that ""without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible."" COMMENT:- Nothing to see here folks. The Saudis are America's friends. The Saudis are America's partners in the war on terrorism. Not a single Saudi has ever been involved in a terrorist act. Not a single member of the leading families in Saudi Arabia has ever made a false statement to the government of the United States of America. The Saudis are a peaceful people and have no involvement in violence outside of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia in one of the most progressive and egalitarian countries in the world. The whole world admires the Saudi's for their staunch defence of human rights both domestically and outside of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis practice and promote the most moderate, tolerant, and progressive form of Islam in the world. Well, naturally, due to the length of time that it would take to develop a nuclear bomb, it is only natural that the Saudis should start on developing one immediately because everyone knows that the Iranians are building vast stockpiles of WMD and to wait until AFTER we find out where those vast stockpiles of WMD are hidden before starting work on developing a nuclear bomb would mean that the Iranians would use their VAST STOCKPILE OF WMD to murder millions without the Saudis having the ability to defend themselves by exercising their ""Constitutional Right"" to ""keep and bear arms"".

For Trump, 'complete and total exoneration' ain't what it used to be Nearly two weeks ago, Attorney General William Barrs summary of Robert Muellers investigation of collusion between Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and possible obstruction of justice shook up the worldview of the entire political and journalistic establishment. Barrs four-page appraisal of Muellers nearly 400-page report was read as vindicating Trump of all wrongdoing, and set off euphoric celebrations on Fox News, among the presidents Republican loyalists in Congress and, of course, from the commander in chief himself. This despite the fact that even Barr's somewhat slanted summary specifically said that the report does not exonerate Trump. But, now there is some dissent: On Wednesday, members of Muellers hitherto tight-lipped team began to speak of their frustrations with Barrs recounting of the special counsels findings. The New York Times reported that some Mueller investigators had concluded that Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than the attorney general had let on.

One million metric tons of rice smuggled into the country in 3 months – RIPAN,hallmarknews.com,Obinna Ezugwu,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://hallmarknews.com/one-million-metric-tons-of-rice-smuggled-into-the-country-in-3-months-ripan/,"One million metric tons of rice smuggled into the country in 3 months – RIPAN Bags of rice
The Rice Processors Association of Nigeria (RIPAN) has decried that over one million metric tons of rice have been smuggled into Nigeria in the last three months.
The group’s Chairman, Mohammed Maifata who disclosed this at a media briefing in Abuja on the latest development in rice smuggling in the country, regretted that investors have committed huge sums of money to local rice production, but their investments are now being threatened by importation.
“Investors in Nigeria have made enormous financial commitment in the rice sub-sector. Unfortunately, the only threat to the industry’s total development is smuggling,” he said. ” Over 1 million metric tons of Rice which is equivalent to about 20,000,000 bags of 50kg Rice have been smuggled into Nigeria in the last three months.
“Nigeria currently loses huge revenues, foreign exchange and Jobs to this menace as Nigeria rice processing companies are shutting down because of their inability to gain market access.
“More painfully millions of small-holder Farmers are stuck with their Paddy because the Millers can no longer afford to buy from them.”
He explained that investigations conducted by the association in the last few months indicated that “all our international borders have been converted to smugglers route and our markets are filled with smuggled foreign rice.”
Maifata warned that there was the need for urgent actions to avert eventual national food emergency by combating smuggling so that we can continue to grow our local Rice industry and the economy.
While commending the efforts by the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) in its intervention in the rice sub-sector of the economy, he lamented that investors in the country despite their financial commitment are met with the threat to the industry’s growth due to the activities of smugglers
Speaking further on CBN and federal government’s deliberate intervention in the sub-sector, the RIPAN boss who is also the Chairman Umza International Farms Limited said “all the programmes have impacted greatly on our integrated processing capacity which has increased from 800,000 metric tons in 2014 to 1.6 million metric tonnes in 2018. This is in addition to about 3.9 million metric tons of finished Rice milled by thousands of cottage millers scattered across the country”.
The association among other things recommended the immediate raid of the various rice smugglers market across the country while appealing to the federal government to begin to sanction officers and employees of Customs, NAFDAC, SON who are saddled with the responsibility of enforcement, and who compromise their offices or fail in their various responsibilities.
The RIPAN boss drew the attention of the government to the fact that some officers working in these government agencies are in collaboration with these smugglers and called on the authorities to fish them out and prosecute them for economic sabotage.
“Government must deal firmly with smuggling and severely punish infractions in a way that makes smuggling too costly to risk. Particularly, Government must begin the fish out and punish multinational Companies who play on both sides of the Border; – those who drive the syndicates (the Promoters),” he said.
Mr Maifata also stated that “government must as a matter of urgent national importance, take strong diplomatic action with our neighbouring countries who allow parboiled rice into their country for final destination to Nigeria. The government may consider closing the borders for some time if diplomatic overtures fail.”

CDC Study: Violence Against Older Adults Is Rising And An 'Underreported Public Health Problem',townhall.com,Timothy Meads,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/timothymeads/2019/04/07/study-violence-against-older-adults-rising-and-an-underreported-public-health-pr-n2544365,"CDC Study: Violence Against Older Adults Is Rising And An 'Underreported Public Health Problem' Share Share Tweet
A recent study from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that from 2002-2016, violence targeting adults older than age 60 rose by more than 50%. The authors of this report say this could provoke a new public health problem should the trend continue, with older men being the primary targets of both non-fatal assaults as well as homicides.
The study looked at National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–All Injury Program and National Vital Statistics System data from the early years of President Bush's administration to the end of President Obama's. It found that ""the estimated nonfatal assault rate increased 75.4% among men (2002–2016) and 35.4% among women (2007–2016). ""
As noted by the researchers, ""In 2017, older adults accounted for 22% of the U.S. population, surpassing children and adolescents aged 0–14 years (19%)."" This number will continue to rise, meaning more senior citizens may be vulnerable to attacks. These attacks often stem from somebody they know, such as a caretaker. In fact, the findings indicate that an ""estimated 58% of perpetrators had a relationship"" with their targets.
The study also notes that ""Nonfatal assault rates among older adults did not change from 2002 to 2008 but increased 53.1% from 2008 to 2016 in the overall sample."" During 2002-2016, ""on average, the highest rates of nonfatal assaults (147.4) and homicides (3.58) were perpetrated against men aged 60–69 years."" Recommended Joe Biden Needs A Hug Kurt Schlichter
The authors of the study say that ""these cases potentially meet CDC’s definition of elder abuse, suggesting a need for prevention and support services for older adults faced with family- or acquaintance-perpetrated assault."" It also notes that these findings of nonfatal assaults are likely largely underestimated because the study depended upon hospital emergency departments, meaning those who were attacked but declined seeking medical treatment were excluded from the data."

From Free Beacon :
Democratic freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) has been holding a series of secret fundraisers with groups that have been tied to the support of terrorism, appearances that have been closed to the press and hidden from public view.
The content of these speeches, given to predominately Muslim audiences, remains unknown, prompting some of Omar’s critics to express concern about the type of rhetoric she is using before these paying audiences, particularly in light of the lawmaker’s repeated use of anti-Semitic tropes in public.
Omar recently spoke in Florida at a private event hosted by Islamic Relief, a charity organization long said to have deep ties to groups that advocate terrorism against Israel. Over the weekend, she will appear at another private event in California that is hosted by CAIR-CA PAC, a political action committee affiliated with the Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR a group that was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a massive terror-funding incident.
Is this any different than if a Republican Congressman held a secret fundraiser with a Nazi-affiliated outlet?
VOTER POLL: Do You Support TERM LIMITS For Members Of Congress?
Imagine the outrage from the media, if that were the case.
Omar’s appearance at these closed-door forums is raising eyebrows in the pro-Israel world due to her repeated and unapologetic public use of anti-Semitic stereotypes accusing Jewish people of controlling foreign policy and politics. With Omar’s popularity skyrocketing on the anti-Israel left, it appears her rhetoric is translating into fundraising prowess.
It remains unclear what Omar has told these audiences in her private talks. Washington Free Beacon attempts to obtain video of past events were unsuccessful, and multiple local news and television outlets in the Tampa, Fla., area, where Omar spoke to Islamic Relief last month, confirmed they were unable to gain access to the closed door event.
Islamic Relief has come under congressional investigation for what lawmakers have described as its efforts to provide assistance to terrorist group such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The charity has been banned by some countries as a result of these ties . "
Update on investigations of Trump,www.capitolhillblue.com,AP,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.capitolhillblue.com/node/77850,"Update on investigations of Trump Congressional investigations also are swirling around the president. By - April 7, 2019 President Donald Trump visits a new section of the border wall with Mexico. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)
Where the investigations related to President Donald Trump stand and what may lie ahead for him:
WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?
The White House continues to push back against a Democratic request for the IRS to provide six years of Trump’s personal tax returns and the returns for some of his businesses. The returns were officially requested Wednesday by Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.
An attorney representing Trump argued Friday that a request for the president’s tax returns “would set a dangerous precedent” if granted and that the IRS cannot legally divulge the information.
William Consovoy, whose firm was retained by Trump to represent him on the matter, said in a letter to the Treasury Department’s general counsel that requests for tax returns “must have a legitimate legislative purpose.” He said Neal’s request for Trump’s tax information is intended to damage the president politically.
Asked Thursday for his response to Neal’s demand, Trump didn’t provide a direct answer.
“They’ll speak to my lawyers; they’ll speak to the attorney general,” Trump said at the White House.
___
DID THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA?
According to special counsel Robert Mueller, the answer is no.
In his letter dated March 24, Attorney General William Barr quotes from Mueller’s report saying the investigation “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
The letter does not detail what Mueller learned about a broad range of Trump associates who had Russia-related contacts during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition period. It also doesn’t answer why several of those people lied to federal investigators or Congress during the Russia probe.
Barr is confronting concerns that his four-page letter unduly sanitized the full report in Trump’s favor, including on the key question of whether the president obstructed justice. House Democrats have approved subpoenas for Mueller’s entire report and any exhibits and other underlying evidence that the Justice Department might withhold.
___
IS TRUMP OUT OF THE WOODS?
No.
Trump also plays a central role in a separate case in New York, where prosecutors have implicated him in a crime. They say Trump directed his personal lawyer Michael Cohen to make illegal hush-money payments to two women as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the campaign.

Kennedy Library Foundation. The award is given to those who purportedly show “political courage” over a lifetime, or for a particularly notable incident. Honorary Foundation President Caroline Kennedy called Pelosi “the most important woman in American political history,” CBS News reported.
“So, the courage that that takes, really, I think, makes her an example and an inspiration for generations of Americans, men and women,” Kennedy added.

The foundation cited Pelosi’s success as the first female House Speaker as well as the first to be elected Speaker to non-consecutive terms in over 60 years along with her thirty years in office.
“Coming from Caroline, that’s an enormous compliment,” Pelosi told CBS Sunday Morning . “However, going with it are shoulders for other people to stand on. I’ve stood on many women’s shoulders, who have paved the way for us. And now we have to pave the way for others. So, it’s about the future.”
The Speaker remarked on her tenure, saying, “You have to be ready to take a punch, and you have to be ready to throw a punch. I’m in the arena. And I know that when you’re in the arena, this is what you should expect. But if you don’t have the courage, don’t get in the arena.”
Calling him her “idol,” Pelosi also fondly recalled meeting John F. Kennedy when he was a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.
“My father was the mayor of Baltimore, and there was a big dinner, black tie dinner,” Pelosi recalled, “where Senator Kennedy was going to speak. My mother, she said, ‘If you want to go in my place to the dinner, please do.'”
The honor is named after the 1956 book titled Profiles in Courage , attributed to Sen. John F. Kennedy. The book was really mostly written by Sen. Ted Sorensen with some assistance by Georgetown Professor Jules Davids, but with Kennedy connections to the tome, it became a hit, even winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. The book follows the trials and tribulations of eight Senators who did what they felt was the right thing despite being politically unpopular.
The award was established in 1989 and has honored an array of politicians including its first honoree, Rep. Carl Elliott, as well as Senators Russ Feingold and John McCain, Presidents Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Barack Obama, U.N. Chief Kofi Anan, and many others.

ACM 2019 Nominee Kacey Musgraves: Inside the Grammy-Winning Singer's Rise to Fame,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/kacey-musgraves-acm-2019-nominee-grammy-fame-1386937,"On 4/7/19 at 12:00 PM EDT Share Culture Music
Kacey Musgraves walks into the 54th annual Academy of Country Music Awards (ACM) on Sunday with five nominations. Here's a look back the singer's rise to stardom.
Before Musgraves won the coveted Grammy Award for Album of the Year in February, ABC News reports she first performed on-stage at about eight years old. At nine, she penned her first song, titled ""Notice Me.""
""The first song I wrote, called 'Notice Me' was when I was nine,"" Musgraves, 30, told CMT in 2014. ""I just turned a poem into a song. My mom still has the piece of paper I wrote it on. But I didn’t really start writing more songs until I had more stuff to write about. Like when I was 15 and going through breakups. All that led up to this. I just kept at it and kept at it.""
The Texas-born talent's family was very hands-on and supportive of her music career. As she was starting out, her grandmother served as her booking agent. Her sister, Kelly Christine Sutton, remains her photographer to this day, and even shot the cover for her highly praised Golden Hour record—an album, which debuted in March 2018, that won Grammy awards within five categories.
Musgraves self-published three albums before appearing on the USA Network's Nashville Star in Season 5. She didn't win the singing competition series, ultimately concluding her run in seventh place. However, the experience encouraged her to move to Nashville.
Upon moving to Nashville, Rolling Stone reported that Musgraves joined the label Mercury Nashville in 2012, releasing her debut single ""Merry Go Round"" later that year. She also landed a publishing contract with Lost Highway. Through this deal, she was able to help pen songs like Miranda Lambert's ""Mama's Broken Heart,"" which debuted in January 2013. By March 2013, Musgraves would release her first studio album Same Trailer Different Park . This record features her most popular song to date, ""Follow Your Arrow."" Since this, she's becomes known for creating music that defies country standards. She abstains from sugarcoating in her songs and instead bluntly express her thoughts.
""It's weird because the ideas in my songs aren't controversial to me,"" she told Elle in 2013. ""I feel like I should be able to sing about anything.""
After Same Trailer Different Park , Musgraves dropped her sophomore effort Pageant Material in 2015. She would later release A Very Kacey Christmas , her third album and first Christmas record, in 2016. By 2018, Musgraves would surprise her loyal fanbase—and honestly the world—with her fourth studio effort Golden Hour .
Golden Hour incorporated some of the ingredients a typical Musgraves album would feature, including strong and straight-forward lyrics. Despite this, the record ultimately veered away from her standard folksy country sound. Instead, Golden Hour featured a sound that could be classified as contemporary meets country. Or, as Musgraves puts it: ""galactic country."" The sound featured on Golden Hour opened her up to a wider audience as well.
""With this record, I tried to change it up a little bit,"" Musgraves told NPR in April 2018. ""This record to me is all about feeling. It's not about thinking as much. My prior records have been more about thinking—thinking about each line, thinking about the way that I'm flipping a phrase. And thinking is great, but if you have all thought no feeling ... I think that's a mistake.""
Musgraves is currently on the road for her Oh, What a World: Tour. She added several new North American dates in February.

Matt Walsh on How ‘Veep’ Season 7 'Delivers' and His Advice for Sean Spicer,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/matt-walsh-veep-season-seven-advice-sean-spicer-1387875,"On 4/7/19 at 11:00 AM EDT Share Culture Movies & TV
Veep's seventh and final season continues to unfold Sunday on HBO, and star Matt Walsh suggests the acclaimed series' sendoff truly ""delivers.""
Walsh, 54, plays Mike McLintock in Veep, the former White House Press Secretary and the former Director of Communications to Vice President Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Season 7 sees Mike adjusting to life after being pushed out of Selina's camp.
""Season 7 finds Mike working for BuzzFeed. At the end of Season 6, Selina kicked Mike out of her inner circle. He's scrambling to support three children, thinking about getting another one,"" Walsh told Newsweek . ""He is on the road, Skyping home to his family, living with college-age kids and trying to adapt, once again, to a media world that's just much faster than he is.""
Veep 's Season 6 concluded in April 2017. Since Season 7 arrived on March 31, its been nearly two years since audiences have seen new episodes. But Walsh thinks it's been worth the wait, and that the series will conclude in a way that satisfies viewers. ""I really think our Season 7 delivers on a lovely wrap-up for all the characters. Obviously Selina, but all of us,"" he said.
""I think we get a nice sendoff and I think it's funny throughout. I do think it's like no other season before it,"" he continued. ""We've ramped up the absurdity and pace. There's also a lot of people who come back from all the seasons. You're going to get to see all the great characters who were born and they all come through for a victory lap. So I think it's a pretty special season.""
Walsh's character Mike has often drawn comparisons to real-life former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. While Walsh has addressed the pair's similarities before, he suggested to Newsweek that his character was ""better at his job"" than Spicer had been. He also noted that Mike ""has more integrity"" than Spicer, as he likely would've quit or never would've agreed to work under President Donald Trump in the first place.
Walsh also offered up a bit of advice for Spicer and current White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders over their involvement in Trump's administration:
""I would say, Sarah, Sean: I understand the need to get the best job, the best job for a press secretary in the world, and I understand the power and access you're getting. I understand how long it takes to get that job, being kicked around and suffering a lot of moments in your life to get there. But once you have that job, take that off your list and get the F out because, at some point, you're complicit in the awfulness.""
Walsh and Louis-Dreyfus star in Veep alongsideTony Hale, Anna Chlumsky, Reid Scott and Timothy Simons. The show, created by Armando Iannucci, debuted in April 2012 and has garnered a series of accolades ever since.
Veep airs Sundays at 10:30 p.m. ET on HBO.

UN Fears New Libya War As Renegade General Advances On Tripoli | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/un-fears-new-libya-war-renegade-general-advances-tripoli,"0 SHARES
The so-called international community led by the West once itself responsible for destabilizing Libya by toppling Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, is now urging Benghazi-based renegade General Khalifa Haftar to halt his ongoing assault on the country's capital .
Tripoli witnessed its second day heavy fighting on Saturday, threatening to further rip the country apart descending toward another civil war, as Haftar's self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA) fought to secure Tripoli's international airport , which the LNA later claimed full success in doing. Some international reports confirmed that the LNA gained full control of the airport later in the day Saturday, but other conflicting reports say that this was premature , which could mean only a section was wrested from Tripoli forces.

Tripoli International Airport lies 34km from the city center, and should Haftar gain it as a foothold it will likely be used as a main base of attack by the LNA to try and take the sprawling capital, which is likely to unleash many more days, weeks, or possibly months of bloodshed and heavy fighting .
Already air raids were reported against the LNA, as the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), better equipped from external backers, defended the capital.

Dramatic scenes coming out of Libya during the weekend clashes resembled battles set amidst a scarred urban backdrop from 2011 fighting which resulted in NATO military intervention led by the US, UK, and France.
Days ago Haftar ordered his troops to assault to capital , raising alarm bells among international supporters of the GNA headquartered in Tripoli.
So far over a dozen LNA fighters have been reported killed in the battle for Tripoli's airport while local media said up to four civilians died in the crossfire. #Libya - LNA video showing fighting in Ain Zara, southeastern outskirts of #Tripoli , which the LNA claim to have captured. pic.twitter.com/MLMs54igms — Oded Berkowitz (@Oded121351) April 6, 2019
Though the precise extent of the 75-year old Haftar's forces gains inside Tripoli remain unclear, international reports are unanimous in saying he's manage to overtake some areas on the outskirts of the city.
Based in Libya's oil-rich east, Haftar's militia has already captured much of the country's oil resources , especially after a successful blitz to take much of the south this year.
And now he stands ready to take the capital of Tripoli in the west — home to the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and Libya's state-run National Oil Corporation, which when combined with small subsidiaries under its direction accounts for some 70% of the country's oil output . #Libya - it's only day 3 of Operation ""Flood of Dignity"".

The UAE — a longtime Gulf backer of Haftar — has reportedly tried to intervene with Haftar, urging him to put on the brakes and negotiate a power sharing situation, but to no avail.
Interestingly, Haftar has also enjoyed the political backing of an unlikely assortment of powerful countries that include Russia, France, and Egypt . This is due to his purported secular identity and political platform, and his willingness to fight the jihadists, including Libyan ISIS.

Commonly seen as a ""secular autocrat"" with external backing and potentially ""West-friendly"", he precisely fits the model of a nationalist type dictator uniting the various large feuding tribes in the mold of Gaddafi (the late Libyan 42-year ruler himself at various times enjoyed the backing of European powers).
Bloomberg reported previously that his LNA already has immense leverage the military showdown with the Tripoli GNA continues :
Already in control of Libya’s main oil-exporting terminals, the LNA has secured its biggest oil field since beginning its southern campaign in January. That puts Haftar in control of more than 1 million barrels of production a day , giving him crucial leverage over the OPEC member’s key source of income as well as command of its most powerful fighting force.
Post-Gaddafi Libya has been largely forgotten about in the media after its ""liberation"" by NATO and Islamist militants, and since 2011 has existed in varying degrees of anarchy and chaos.
Libya has remained split between rival parliaments and governments in the east and west, with militias and tribes lining up behind each, resulting in fierce periodic clashes. The U.N. Security Council fears that the Libyan National Army's advances toward Tripoli –– where the U.N.-backed government is –– could lead to a military showdown. https://t.co/Htb5xrPhM9 — NPR (@NPR) April 6, 2019
The most significant of these warring militias nationwide has long been Haftar's LNA, which has for the past couple years controlled much of eastern Libya and emerged as the chief rival to the UN-backed GNA in the western half of the country.
Haftar has since 2017 been reported to be planning a move on Libya's vital ""oil crescent region"" while bolstering his forces with Chadian mercenaries, according to prior local reports . Now largely successful in this endeavor, control of the capital would constitute the endgame allowing him to solidify rule over all portions of the country.
Prior the 2011 Libyan war and NATO military intervention which ultimately led to the field execution of Muammar Gaddafi, the country produced about 1.6 million bpd, but years of turmoil and political instability in the aftermath have slashed that to 550,000 barrels per day as of 2018 output numbers.

Rep. Adam Schiff on Trump Claim of Democrats' Anti-Semitism: Only GOP 'Believes There are Good People on Both Sides of a Nazi Rally',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/rep-adam-schiff-trump-claim-democrats-anti-semitism-only-gop-believes-there-1388276,"On 4/7/19 at 10:45 AM EDT Share U.S.
A senior House Democrat responded Sunday to President Donald Trump's recent allegation that the ranks of the Democratic Party had become tainted by anti-Semitism by pointing to the president's previous, highly criticized remarks.
On Saturday, Trump made an appearance at a Republican Jewish Coalition event, where he not only touted his administration's relationship with Israel, but also took aim at Democrats, accusing the opposing party of harboring members with anti-Jewish sentiments.
""The Democrats have even allowed the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism to take root in their party,"" said the president, presumably referring to controversial comments made by a handful of representatives who have criticized the Israeli government.
Appearing on CNN's State of the Union Sunday, Rep. Adam Schiff, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, fired back at Trump, using the president's own words against him.
""It's not the Democratic Party that believes there are good people on both sides of a Nazi rally,"" Schiff told host Jake Tapper. ""There's just one party and one party leader who believes that, and that's Donald Trump.""
Schiff was referring to comments made by Trump in the days after the tragic ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. On August 12, 2018, a rally of far-right and white nationalist groups erupted into a violent confrontation with counter-protestors, and resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, who was killed after one rally attendee rammed his car into a crowd on a small side street.
""I think there is blame on both sides,"" Trump said in the aftermath of the event, which included throngs of white nationalists changting things like ""Jews will not replace us.""
Continued the president, ""You had some very bad people in that group. You also had some very fine people on both sides.""
On CNN Sunday, Schiff argued that Trump is actually helping to solidify the Democratic support from the Jewish community.
""If there's anything that is likely to cement the relationship between the Democratic Party and the Jewish community it's the presidency of Donald Trump,"" said the congressman. ""The lack of character and values that are certainly inconsistent with Jewish values I think are only consolidating support in the Jewish community, and I think the president needs to look inward when it comes to the rise of anti-Semitism in the country and his own actions and his own words and how that may fuel some of the rise in hate that we see, not just in the form of anti-Semitism but the rise in acts of hate of all kinds.""
Perhaps the most high-profile Democratic lawmaker to make remarks critical of Israel is Rep. Ilhan Omar, who received significant backlash following her implication that American politicians' support for Israel was ""all about the Benjamins.""
Trump specifically called out Omar by name during his RJC speech Saturday.
""Special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota,"" joked the president, adding ""Oh, I forgot. She doesn’t like Israel.""
This comment came only hours after it was revealed that a New York state man had been arrested by the FBI for allegedly threatening to ""put a bullet"" in the congresswoman's skull, accusing her of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Omar is also one of the few members of Congress who supports the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) Movement, which aims to ""end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law.""
Speaking to Tapper, Schiff responded to concerns about Democrats who are in favor of BDS.
""I certainly don't support the BDS movement and yes, there are isolated comments by members of our caucus that I have strongly condemned as being anti-Semitic but it's one thing when you have a few members who make comments and it's another when the President of the United States makes comments like he did about Charlottesville,"" he said. ""There's quite a difference. I'm very proud of our leadership and its condemnation of anti-Semitism.""
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi explicitly denounced BDS, referring to it as “bigotry masquerading as policy.”
Omar hit back at this sentiment, telling Newsweek , ""A condemnation for people who want to exercise their First Amendment rights is beneath any leader... I hope that we find a better use of language when we are trying to speak as members of Congress that are sworn to protect the Constitution."""
Watch As Tesla Model 3 Accelerates And Slams Into Car While On Autopilot | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-07/watch-tesla-model-3-accelerates-and-slams-car-while-autopilot,"0 SHARES
Concerns about the safety of Tesla's ""Autopilot"" continue to swirl after a new video of a Model 3 crash surfaced this weekend on Twitter. The video, posted to Twitter on Saturday, shows a Model 3 with its autopilot engaged going up a relatively routine exit ramp at a speed that appears to just be about 25mph.
The ramp is congested and traffic is moving relatively normally, until the turn creates such an angle that the only thing visible in front of the Tesla is a black Subuaru Forester, which may or may not have blended into the color of the road ahead of the Tesla. That's when Tesla's Autopilot makes the bold, if inexplicable, decision to accelerate directly into the back of the Forester: 1/ Here is a video of a Model 3 crashing into the back of a Subaru Forester while on Autopilot. The impact occurs about 20 seconds into the video. Not only does the Model 3 appear to accelerate into the crash, but the airbag didn't even deploy. $TSLA pic.twitter.com/XdpM7b0SFw — NetflixAndLamp (@NetflixAndLamp) April 6, 2019
""Not only does the Model 3 appear to accelerate into the crash, but the airbag didn't even deploy.""
The driver accepted blame, posting on a forum that he fell asleep behind the wheel after engaging Autopilot. Despite this, he says he was ""concerned"" that the car ""didn't stop in this situation as advertised in [Enhanced Autopilot] features"". The impact was enough to wreck the fender and cause the trunk to pop open.
Despite the fact that CEO Elon Musk recently claimed in a Tweet that the latest Autopilot update is ""epic"", examples of the ""technology"" continuing to malfunction remain ubiquitous. But Musk either refuses to, or simply fails to understand this: in his latest tweet, Musk quoted another Tweet by a human beta tester driver who bragged about Autopilot driving him ""practically all the way home with no input...on and off of 3 highways, in rush hour, in the rain, in NYC traffic!"". At no point in the video do the driver's hands touch the wheel.
Ironically, as more Autopilot accidents are caught on tape and go public, Tesla continues to remind drivers and, more importantly , anyone contacting their PR office , that just because it's called ""Autopilot"" doesn't mean that drivers can take their hands off the wheel or not be attentive. And yet, Musk's tweeting of this video showing ""no hands on the wheel"" again seems like a tacit suggestion that drivers can allow Autopilot to do all the work without paying attention. Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon. https://t.co/fTseO2JyVp — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 6, 2019
Not everyone was as amused by the video.
So if you're a Tesla driver, remember to keep your hands on the wheel. Unless, of course, you're Elon Musk doing a promotional drive for a national news program. Login "
‘Game of Thrones’ Crypts of Winterfell: Which Zombie Starks Will the Night King Awaken?,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/game-thrones-crypts-winterfell-explained-theories-feather-bran-stark-night-1387951,"On 4/7/19 at 10:00 AM EDT Share Culture Game of Thrones
The crypts of Winterfell have featured prominently in everything HBO has revealed of Game of Thrones Season 8 thus far. In the first full trailer for the final season, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) finds Jon Snow (Kit Harington) down in the crypts, perhaps contemplating the Starks in a new light after learning his true name: Aegon Targaryen. An earlier teaser trailer ventures even further into the Stark crypts importance to the Game of Thrones mythology, as Jon Snow, Sansa (Sophie Turner) and Arya (Maisie Williams) venture down into the crypts, only to find statues of themselves, a reminder of death and, according to some fan theories, a hint at what’s to be revealed about the Night King. But it’s also possible the crypts of Winterfell will fulfill more than a symbolic or contemplative purpose in the final season of Game of Thrones . As the Night King sweeps down from the North, the bodies of the Stark ancestors entombed within might join his army of the dead. Zombie Starks in the Crypts of Winterfell?

It’s possible Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, the Stark sisters and the grand alliance they’ve formed will lose the Battle for Winterfell in Game of Thrones Season 8. The Night King’s army could push Daenerys’ forces back, possibly as far as King’s Landing. If this were to happen, the dead of the North will rise up to join the army of the Night King. So who’s buried down in the Winterfell crypts that could return as a wight turned against the still-living Starks?
We only get a barest sense of the scale of the Winterfell crypts in Game of Thrones , but there’s reason to believe hundreds of Stark ancestors are buried in the multi-chambered dark beneath the castle, at least in George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire . While we know Lyanna Targaryen (née Stark), Jon Snow’s mother, is buried in the crypts, much else is uncertain.
In the books, Lord Eddard Stark’s bones went missing on their way back from King’s Landing after his execution. Eddard has a statue, but his remains may not be down there for the Night King to resurrect. On the show, Ned’s bones were returned to Catelyn Stark while she accompanied Robb and his bannermen during the War of the Five Kings. Much later, when Jon defeats Ramsay Bolton in the Battle of the Bastards at the end of Season 6, we indirectly learn that what’s left of Ned likely made its way to Winterfell after all. When discussing what to do with Rickon Stark’s remains, Jon says, “I'll bury him in the Crypts, next to my father.”
It’s also unclear whether Robb Stark’s body ever made it back to Winterfell, though the mutilation it was subjected to by the Freys after the Red Wedding suggests not. His remains, like those of his mother, were likely disposed of ingloriously somewhere around The Twins, the setting of Season 3’s infamous Red Wedding. (Catelyn’s post-Red Wedding fate in the books is a much longer story .)

There are many fan theories surrounding the crypts of Winterfell, some of which feel like more plausible Game of Thrones Season 8 scenarios than others. It has been theorized that dragon eggs are hidden beneath Winterfell (based on a court jester’s account relayed in The World of Ice & Fire ), and that the Night King’s wife has been sealed away below. But more likely than any specific secret squirrelled away in the crypts is the theory many have read into HBO’s “Crypts of Winterfell” teaser trailer:
Why doesn’t Bran Stark have a statue beneath Winterfell, like the other surviving Stark children? Could the teaser be hinting that Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) is the Night King? That’s the surprising extrapolation many have made, and while it’s outlandish to think HBO would drop esoteric hints about a massive last-season spoiler in a teaser trailer, the underlying fan theory is robust enough.
The theory holds that Bran will use his greenseer ability in an effort to alter history, going back to when the Children of the Forest first created the Night King. Warging himself into the sacrificial victim, Bran’s future could be the Night King’s past, his warg powers transformed into the Night King’s ability to raise and control the dead.
(We investigated this theory in greater depth while contemplating the many possible answers to “ Who will win the game of thrones ?”)
From teasers and trailers, we know the crypts of Winterfell play both a symbolic and material role in Game of Thrones Season 8. In the past, the crypts have been a place of contemplation for Starks making difficult decisions. This time, they may instead be turned to the Night King’s dark purpose, whatever that may be. We’ll find out sometime after Game of Thrones returns to HBO for its final season on Sunday, April 14."
Presidential Hopeful Howard Schultz Says Mostly Female Cabinet Would be 'Benefit for the Country',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/howard-schultz-mostly-female-cabinet-benefit-country-1388273,"On 4/7/19 at 10:03 AM EDT Share U.S.
Former Starbucks CEO and Independent 2020 presidential hopeful Howard Schultz said that if he were elected he would form a diverse cabinet, one that would potentially include more women than men.
Appearing Saturday evening on CNN’s S.E. Cupp: Unfiltered , Schultz, who stepped away from Starbucks in 2018, spoke about his vision for the United States. He vowed to form “a bipartisan, very diverse cabinet” that was “heavily weighted toward women” if he were elected in 2020.
“Republicans and Democrats and Independents,” would be part of the executive body, Schultz suggested. “I would do everything I possibly could to bring both sides together,” he continued. “The problem we have right now is the ideology of Republicans and Democrats who are unwilling on any issue to work together to solve America’s–people’s problems.”
Host S.E. Cupp then jumped in to ask him to clarify what he meant by “heavily weighted toward women.” Schultz explained that “we have more women running for president than any other time in the history of the country. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that women should have the opportunity to serve the government in high positions.”
Cupp then asked if the former CEO would be interested in having women “outnumber men” in his cabinet.
“I would,” Schultz immediately responded. “I would, I think it’s a benefit for the country,” he added.
Schultz announced his presidential ambitions in January, drawing criticism from many Democrats and President Donald Trump. Although the former Starbucks CEO has described himself as a “lifelong Democrat,” he has said he would run as an Independent if he officially enters the race. As progressive candidates, such as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have regularly taken aim at “the billionaire class” and its influence on politics, many have criticized Schultz’s decision to consider a presidential campaign.
In a February interview with CBS This Morning , Sanders suggested that the billionaire, who is worth an estimated $3.7 billion, knows little about politics. “There are a lot of people I know personally who work hard for a living who make forty, fifty thousand dollars a year who know a lot more about politics than, with all due respect, does Mr. Schultz,” he said.

Other male 2020 contenders have, similar to Schultz, suggested that women would take a major role in their administration, although none have said they would consider having a cabinet with women outnumbering men. Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas said last month that “it would be very difficult not to select a woman” as his running mate if he managed to secure the Democratic nomination. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is also seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination, said in February that he would “be looking to women first” when selecting his running mate.
Thus far, five high-profile female politicians have thrown their hat in the ring for the Democratic party’s nomination to run against Trump in 2020. In addition to Warren, these include Senator Kamala Harris from California, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii."

Watch This New Drone Taxi Take Off In Vienna | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/watch-new-drone-taxi-take-vienna,"0 SHARES
An Austrian aerospace company and its Chinese partner demonstrated its drone-taxi in Vienna Thursday, trying to sell the idea of flying taxis to government officials.
Local officials and journalist gathered in the Austrian capital's Generali Arena football stadium to spectate the two-seater EHang 216, liftoff and fly around the stadium at an altitude of roughly 30 feet.
Derrick Xiong, the co-founder of EHang, told AFP that the drone has been extensively tested and is ready for series production.
A new era of autonomous aircraft services is expected to revolutionize travel across the world by 2025. EHang and Austria's FACC, owned by Chinese aerospace group AVIC, entered into a strategic partnership last year to offer European countries the ability to affordably deploy flying drone services in their major cities.
EHang 216 can fly at 90 mph for 30 minutes, FACC Chief Executive Officer Robert Machtlinger said. ""It can travel between 50 and 70 kilometers depending on the payload.""
AFP photographer Joe Klama was the first passenger to take part in the flight. He said the cabin is small, with leg room that a taller person might find less-than-adequate.
Klama said: ""The rotors are scary, but we got used to it.""
FACC told journalists there are thousands of preorders for the $336,000 drone, mostly from China.
EHang's competitors over the next decade include Airbus and Uber.
Xiong said the drone could carry passengers at low altitude over distances of up to 22 miles, but there is still significant work ahead in clearing the aerial vehicle with aviation authorities.
He hopes that the company by 2021 will have already produced roughly 300 of the drones for global customers.
Austrian Transport Minister Norbert Hofer, who was one of the local officials at the demonstration, said he believes Austria could be one of the first countries in the world to have flying drone taxis in its cities.

President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign is planning ""historic"" fundraising of one billion dollars — nearly three times what the Republican candidate spent to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 — according to one family member and campaign adviser.
Speaking on Fox & Friends Sunday morning, Lara Trump — the president's daughter-in-law and 2020 senior campaign adviser — reiterated the president's re-election campaign is seeing ""historic fundraising"" and expects to raise one billion dollars to keep Trump in the White House through 2024.
Democrats have raised far more money than their respective Republican opponents in the last two elections. Former President Barack Obama raised $731 million against Mitt Romney's $474 million in 2012, while Hillary Clinton amassed $623 million compared to Trump's $335 million.
Lara Trump — wife to Eric Trump, the president's second-oldest son — bragged the majority of money already raised has come from low-dollar ($100 or less) donations, declaring ""the people are behind us.""
When pressed by Fox & Friends host Pete Hegseth about the billion-dollar fundraising plan, Trump reminded him her father-in-law defeated Hillary Clinton despite being outraised two-to-1 in 2016.
""I'm very proud of our fundraising, historic fundraising, and the vast majority of the money we raise comes from low dollar donors, so less than $100, we have the people behind us,"" Lara Trump said on Fox News Sunday morning. ""The president has done everything he promised in 2016, he's delivering results, and they want to see him in there and they want to support him...We like to set very high expectations for ourselves.""
""In 2016, we had a fraction of the money Hillary Clinton had but we had the people behind us,"" she added, despite Clinton having won the popular vote.

Trump's decision to keep his presidential campaign intact during the first two years of his presidency has allowed for his fundraising efforts to essentially continue uninterrupted since 2015. Additionally, Trump donors such as Dan Eberhart have noted the ""vast, vast majority of Republicans are rowing in the same direction"" ahead of 2020, compared to the Democrats who are likely to spend all of their current big number fundraising efforts just in the primary.
""Let them spend all that money in the primary, we’ll deal with them later,"" Lara Trump told Fox & Friends Sunday.
On Friday, Lara Trump told Fox News she is not concerned with the current field of Democratic candidates, saying they are all trying to ""out-Bernie"" one another by embracing ideas such as ""socialism."" Speaking to Fox & Friends Sunday, Trump said they are not concerned over former Vice President Joe Biden's potential run and she said the Democratic Party establishment should be ""very worried"" should an Independent candidate such as Howard Schultz run in 2020.
RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told the Associated Press Friday there have been more than 1.1 million new donors since Election Day, with 100,000 alone in January. She claimed there have been at least seven days with seven-figure, small-dollar intakes since January 1.
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale first predicted the campaign will spend $1 billion in 2020 last week. On Friday, Lara Trump told Fox News she believes Trump will win re-election ""very easily."""
"White House Chief of Staff Contradicts Trump, Admits President 'Could Always Allow' People to See Tax Returns Despite Audit",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/mulvaney-contradicts-trump-tax-returns-1388303,"On 4/7/19 at 11:57 AM EDT Share U.S.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could not release his tax returns due to their being under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), but White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney contradicted that argument on Sunday.
Mulvaney went on Fox News Sunday to discuss the contentious matter of the president’s tax returns. Last week, the Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee formally requested six years of Trump’s personal and business returns from the IRS. Trump is the first president in more than 40 years to have refused to have released the financial documents, despite significant criticism for witholding this information and in spite of promises he would eventually disclose it.
The president’s chief of staff said that Democrats on the committee would “never” see Trump’s tax returns, regardless of their efforts. “Nor should they,” he added.
""If they don't get what they want in the Mueller report, they're going to ask for the taxes,"" said Mulvaney. ""If they don't get what they want in the taxes, they're going to ask for something else. It doesn't surprise anybody,” he said, suggesting the request was merely a political stunt.
Trump has repeatedly said that he cannot release his tax returns because he is currently undergoing an audit, even though no laws or regulations prevent him from sharing this information. When Fox fill-in host Bill Hemmer pointed out that the president's audit excuse was not a valid reason for witholding the returns, Mulvaney actually agreed.
“You could always allow people to see it,” he admitted. “But that’s not what’s happening,” he continued. “The democrats are demanding the IRS turn over the documents, and that is not going to happen, and they know it.”
The president has used the audit excuse repeatedly since before his election to justify his decision not to release the returns. Trump deployed this explanation as recently as last Wednesday, when questioned by a reporter about the Ways and Means Committees request.
“We're under audit, despite what people said, and we're working that out -— I'm always under audit, it seems, but I've been under audit for many years, because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you're audited,” he said . “But until such time as I'm not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that.""
Many analysts and Democratic critics have long pushed back against the president’s audit excuse, pointing out that this does not prevent the president from being transparent about his finances.

Several Democratic politicians also appeared on Sunday morning talk shows to explain the reason why the Ways and Committee is requesting the president’s tax returns. They argued that the move is not meant to be a political attack.
“This is legitimate authority that the Congress has,” Representative Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan, said on ABC’s This Week . “This president, by the way, is the least transparent president that we’ve had in half a century,” he argued.
Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico also appeared on Fox News Sunday , pushing back against criticism from Republicans about the effort, saying, “This is not political as our Republican colleagues are making it out to be."" "
"Pete Buttigieg: U.S. Politics Is 'Horror Show,' Slams Trump’s 'Chest-Thumping' Rhetoric in Chuck Todd Interview",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/pete-buttigieg-trump-rhetoric-horror-show-chest-thumping-politics-1388268,"On 4/7/19 at 11:18 AM EDT Share U.S.
During a 15-minute interview Sunday with Chuck Todd on Meet The Press , presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg defended himself against critiques that he lacks political experience while also criticizing President Donald Trump's caustic rhetoric.
Todd began by asking Buttigieg — mayor of South Bend, Indiana — why he felt qualified to sit in the Oval Office, despite never having served as an elected official in Washington like other contenders for the Democratic ticket, including Senators Elizabeth Cory Booker , Kamala Harris , Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren .
In response, Buttigieg argued that his relative inexperience was, in acutality, an advantage.
""I would stack up my experience against anybody,"" he said. ""I know it’s not as traditional, I haven’t been marinating in Washington here for a very long time and I’m not part of that same establishment but I would argue that being a mayor of a city of any size means that you have to deal with the kinds of issues that hit really hit Americans.""
He continued by noting his extensive experience serving in the U.S. military, and then suggested his candidacy would be an antidote to the fiery rhetoric oozing out of the Trump administration, which he said suffers from a “loss of vision” and a “loss of decency.”
“It just might make sense for somebody my age, coming from experience in the industrial midwest, nonfederal, different background, bringing something that will actually help Americans envision the world as it will be in 2054, the year that I will be the current age of the current president,” he said in the conversation. “And just change the channel from this mesmerizing horror show that’s going on in Washington right now.”
Buttigieg, who is still in the exploratory stage of his campaign, is expected to make an official announcement next week in South Bend, Indiana, where he serves as the city's mayor.
So far, the 37-year-old—who would make history not just as the youngest president ever, but also as the first openly gay politician to nab a spot on a major party ticket— has made moderate gains by framing himself as the political and ideological antithesis of President Donald Trump. When asked to square Trump’s support among evangelicals with the president’s actions, Buttigieg said it was “frustrating” since Trump was preoccupied with “chest-thumping look at me-ism” rather than the tenants found in scripture.
“The hypocrisy is unbelievable,” he said, referring to Trump’s support among the religious right. “You have someone who..acts in a way that is not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or in church.
He continued, ""You see the diametric opposite of [biblical teachings] in this presidency.""

Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow and Mulvaney all made the Sunday morning talk show rounds, where each dismissed Democratic demands to see the president's tax returns, saying the opposing party is ""playing right into"" Trump's winning handbook.
Romney said he thinks the president should release his taxes, but he doesn't think it will happen and that House Democrats are ""moronic"" for pressing for hearings and possibly subpoenas to obtain the returns.
""I'd like the president to follow through and show his tax returns, he said he would, I think it was on The Today Show where he said he would be happy to release his tax returns,"" Romney told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd Sunday morning. ""But I also have to tell you, I think the Democrats are just playing along in his handbook, which is that going after his tax returns through a legislative action is moronic. That's not going to happen. The courts are not going to say you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns. So he's going to win this victory, he wins them time after time.""
Top Republicans Mitt Romney, Mick Mulvaney and Jay Sekulow said Democrats will ""never"" see President Donald Trump's tax returns. NurPhoto via Getty Images Cheriss May House Minority Leader, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy has led criticism against House Democrats' ongoing efforts to delve into Trump's highly guarded personal financial information, saying they set a dangerous partisan precedent. Mulvaney and Sekulow's Sunday TV appearances echoed McCarthy's claim Democrats are ""weaponizing"" the IRS to demand Trump's personal and business tax returns.
Mulvaney, who also serves as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Democrats are ""always asking for something"" on Fox News Sunday . The former congressman from South Carolina said because Democrats ""did not get what they want"" from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report they are now demanding Trump's tax returns.
""They know they are not going to get his taxes, they know what the law is, they know that one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else that files taxes,"" Mulvaney said. ""They know the rules...and a 'political hit job' is not one of those reasons. So they know they're not going to get it.""
""So to be clear, you believe Democrats will never see the president's tax returns?"" asked the Fox News host.
""Oh no, never. Nor should they, keep in mind that's an issue that was already litigated during the [2016] election. Voters knew they couldn't have given his tax returns and they elected him anyway. Which, of course, is what drives the Democrats crazy. But they know they're not going to get this, they just want attention on this issue because they don't want to talk to us about policy.""
Trump attorney Sekulow told ABC News' This Week host George Stephanopoulos that Democrats are trying to ""use the IRS as a political weapon...the president has not asked for Nancy Pelosi's tax returns...which is not a requirement that they do by the way.""
Sekulow lambasted the Democrats using a Ways and Means Committee hearing about IRS enforcement as a way to get to the president's private, individual and business tax returns.
