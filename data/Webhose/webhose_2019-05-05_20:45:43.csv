"Sinaloa Cartel Money Launderer Arrested in South Texas, Say Feds",www.breitbart.com,Old Timer,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/04/05/sinaloa-cartel-money-launderer-arrested-in-south-texas-say-feds/#post-36,"Illegals scarf up welfare, with new Census data confirming 63% of non-citizens helping
themselves.
Anyone who thinks illegal aliens and ""asylum"" applicants are coming here to work is living on another planet.
New data from the Census show that 63% of non-citizens are helping themselves to the welfare. They get it legally, and sometimes illegally, through food programs, general assistance programs, Medicaid, and the earned income tax credit for low-income workers, just for starters.
They get even more when benefits derived from their U.S.-born children are thrown in, though bringing in a kid born elsewhere is also an asset.
Here's the report from the Washington Examiner:
A majority of ""non-citizens,"" including those with legal green card rights, are tapping into welfare programs set up to help poor and ailing Americans, a Census Bureau finding that bolsters President Trump's concern about immigrants costing the nation.
In a new analysis of the latest numbers, from 2014, 63 percent of non-citizens are using a welfare program, and it grows to 70 percent for those here 10 years or more, confirming another concern that once immigrants tap into welfare, they don't get off it.
So no, it's not a temporary little safety net for those who just arrive here until they get their sea legs on the vast ship of America ‚Äì the percentage of non-citizens on welfare expands as such people stay a while, meaning welfare is preferable to work. Why work when Uncle Sam is giving it away for free? That's a great deal for someone otherwise condemned to living in a tin shack out in Tegucigalpa but not a benefit to our country. In fact, it's a drain, and Democrats, based on their policy positions, seem desperate to import more of it.
It's almost a given that the illegal alien population would be part of this trend. The migrant caravan of Honduras consists almost exclusively of low-skilled, zero-English people who at best have a tenth-grade education. As a result, they are likely to earn only low wages here and are least likely to assimilate, given their high concentrations. The generous welfare state
is making it easy for them, and drawing more to come.
Amazingly, even legal immigrants are higher consumers of welfare services, too. That likely speaks to the power of leftist judges who take any asylum claim no matter how unlikely an applicant is to succeed here, as well as the power of family reunifications that expand the size of non-citizen welfare families as well as their consumption of welfare. It's very rare that an uneducated legal immigrant here is going to have a lot of educated relatives to bring in through chain migration.
Every detail of the report is problematic.
Most people probably wouldn't mind if illegal aliens and other non-citizens really did come here to work and nothing else.
But even work is corrupted with the fact that illegals and other non-citizens qualify for the earned income tax credit, meaning that if they earn low wages, they get big fat tax refunds back despite not paying any taxes into the system.
That explains why nearly all non-citizen households have one member who works. The tax credit, after all, is large.
This presumably doesn't even get into other kinds of services illegals use that aren't considered welfare, such as free public school education, public defenders, highway use, and untaxed remittances on illegally earned wages.
And the use of public assistance seems to be going up. If you look at this interview done by Paul Sperry earlier this year from an immigration-skeptical think-tank, the official says 62% of non-citizens use welfare."

A NATIONAL CRIME. While gangs have long had a hand in everything from politics to gang violence, Mexican cartels are now being accused of organ trafficking as well.
Gangs, especially the Caballeros Templarios, are known to engage in illegal activity other than drug trafficking including kidnapping and organ pilfering.
‚ÄúI have no doubt organs are being removed from bodies,‚Äù says David Shirk, a professor of political science and director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego, who has investigated trafficking.
And he suggests it‚Äôs happening on and off the streets. ‚ÄúFor the most part, organ trafficking occurs in hospitals, where there are corrupt medical practitioners.‚Äù
With more than 21,000 people waiting for organ transplants in Mexico, the market for organ trafficking is a lucrative one.

Wolf's redistricting commission begins to dig into drawing of congressional maps By Kim Jarrett | Watchdog.org

Gerrymandering keeps incumbents in office and suppresses votes, according to citizens who attended the first of nine meetings with the Pennsylvania Redistricting Reform Commission.
The Pennsylvania Constitution tasks legislators with redrawing congressional districts after each census. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out maps drawn by lawmakers in 2011. The U.S. Supreme Court denied an appeal by Republican leaders to dismiss the decision and reinstate the old maps.
A bill that would have changed the way congressional maps were drawn never passed.
Gov. Tom Wolf created the reform commission last November to study the redistricting process and take public comments. Republicans said Wolf did not have the authority to form the commission and large portions of the Commonwealth were not represented by the members.
Many of those who attended the first meeting in Williamsport on Thursday were part of the group Fair Districts Pennsylvania, a nonpartisan group formed in 2016 and an arm of the League of Women Voters.
Mike Molesevich, a Democrat, said he experienced the effects of gerrymandering when he ran for the state‚Äôs congressional seat for the 10th district. The process discourages possible candidates, he said.
‚ÄúBecause so many seats are considered safe, fewer and fewer eligible citizens seek public office through the electoral process,‚Äù Molesevich said. ""The most common name on the ballot across Pennsylvania is 'no candidate filed.'""
With fewer candidates on the ballot, voters don‚Äôt go to the polls, said Peg Dombrowski of State College.
‚ÄúI think if we had better drawn lines where people voted with their neighbors and the people of their own communities that there would be more buzz and a lot more interest in the candidates that are running,‚Äù she said.
The district lines require some candidates to cross through other districts and drive for several hours to campaign. Sue Fulton said she moved two hours across the state and was still in the same congressional district.
Wayne Gray is a Republican living in a district represented by a Republican, but he thinks something is wrong with the system.
‚ÄúThe gerrymandering and the drawings of these maps are just ludicrous and are a violation of our Pennsylvania constitution,‚Äù Grays said. ‚ÄúNo one should have everything they want. Everything should be by negotiation, and I am very much appalled and do not like safe voting districts.‚Äù
The reform commission will hold meetings through June 6. The next one is April 18 at the Blasco Memorial Library in Erie. The commission will report its findings in the fall. This article originally ran on watchdog.org ."

Is Lying About Golf Worse Than War?,westernfreepress.com,Matt Doarnberger,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://westernfreepress.com/is-lying-about-golf-worse-than-war/,"Is Lying About Golf Worse Than War? Former Sportswriter Rick Reilly May Now Think So By Matt Doarnberger https://www.google.com/search?site=imghp&tbm=isch&q=Donald%20Trump%20Golf&tbs=sur:fmc#imgrc=OOcHE7AA1rVYQM: 3 shares 0 0
Former sports columnist Rick Reilly is out with a new book . The book‚Äôs is titled ‚ÄúCommander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump.‚Äù It explores Donald Trump‚Äôs behavior on the golf course as well as his claims about his golfing skill. As one could probably guess from the book‚Äôs title, it does not paint the president in a very flattering light.
Given Reilly‚Äôs history, it isn‚Äôt surprising that he has a strong dislike for Trump. But a recent exchange with sportswriter Bryan Curtis is especially curious. Curtis describes Reilly‚Äôs experience on the night of the 2016 election as a ‚Äúfamiliar nightmare.‚Äù At a bar in Charleston, SC, Reilly and a former colleague of his had expected Hillary Clinton to win (as so many did). He then describes himself as feeling ‚Äúlight-headed and nauseous‚Äù as the inevitability of Trump‚Äôs victory sets in.
The curious part of this account comes in how vehemently opposed Reilly once was of the Iraq War. In a 2005 article he titled ‚ÄúThe Hero and the Unknown Soldier,‚Äù he recounts the death of former NFL player turned US Army Ranger Pat Tillman as well as a lesser known serviceman named Todd Bates who was also killed in action. Reilly closes the column saying:
‚ÄúBe proud that sports produce men like this. But I, for one, am furious that these wars keep taking them.‚Äù
The inconsistency on the part of Reilly comes in his dread and sickness as a result of Trump beating Clinton. Trump rose victoriously through the Republican primary calling the Iraq War ‚Äú a disaster .‚Äù His beating of more hawkish opponents showed that Republican voters were willing to accept that war as being a mistake. You would think someone who was as against that war as Reilly would at least see some virtue in the party that lead that invasion nominating someone who was so strongly opposed to it.
In addition, why was Reilly so saddened upon the defeat of Hillary Clinton given her past support for the war in Iraq and several other overseas military actions ? After all, if he were consistently against operations OEF and OIF, then shouldn‚Äôt he oppose all politicians who voted for them? If this were the case, Reilly‚Äôs nightmare should have begun when the Democrats chose to make Clinton their candidate rather than when she lost the general election. Having to choose between Clinton and Trump could have been his nightmare (it was for many ), but there should have been no love lost for the former first lady for anyone claiming to favor peace.
Certainly someone‚Äôs support or opposition for a candidate can depend on many factors outside of foreign policy. But Reilly so emphatically objected to George W. Bush‚Äôs invasion and occupation of Iraq that it‚Äôs hard to see how he could just disregard one politician‚Äôs war-mongering past and lambaste a president who proved that you could object to that war and still find favor within the Republican Party. The conclusion that makes the most sense is that Reilly turns a blind eye when it comes to war to those he happens to agree with politically. Clinton voted in the affirmative for a war that Reilly claims he hated. But since he has more in common with her politically, that fact is swept under the rug. Conversely, Trump becomes the embodiment of all evil despite his harsh criticism of the same war. Even though Reilly was never a political writer, it would be nice to see some intellectual consistency in his politics. 3 shares"

Government Whistle-Blowers on the Rise With Democrats in Control of the House | HillReporter.com,hillreporter.com,Todd Neikirk,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://hillreporter.com/government-whistle-blowers-on-the-rise-with-democrats-in-control-of-the-house-29925,"BY Todd Neikirk April 5, 2019
FBI whistle-blower, Tricia Newbold, accused supervisor, Carl Kline, of overriding rejected security clearances. Newbold told officials that these overrides totaled 25 people, including Jared Kushner and other Senior White House officials. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)
A new report from The Atlantic claims Newbold is just one of dozens of officials informing on the White House. According to a congressional aide, these whistle-blowers have been on the rise since Donald Trump took office.
The aide, who works for Elijah Cummings (D-MD), said , ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this many whistle-blowers reporting waste, fraud, and abuse, and just general concern.‚Äù Cummings aide, however, also made the case that these officials need to be protected. ‚ÄúOn the flip side of that, I‚Äôve also never seen whistle-blowers so afraid of what could happen to them if somebody finds out who they are.‚Äù
Both Democrat an Republican lawmakers rely on informants to ferret out wrong-doing within the government. Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Virginia served as the head of the House Oversight Committee in the 2000‚Äôs. He explains , ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs entirely proper, and it‚Äôs really the point of what the Oversight Committee does.‚Äù
When Trump took office, Republicans controlled all three branches of government. Once Democrats took back the House during the 2018 midterms, informants became more comfortable.
Gerry Connolly (D-VA), says , ‚ÄúI think there are a lot of whistle-blowers out there, or potential whistle-blowers, who are certainly going to feel a lot more comfortable approaching us in the majority than the other side, especially in the Trump administration.‚Äù
Newbold‚Äôs claims will be looked into further. Cummings, Chair of the Oversight Committee, recently received authorization to subpoena Newbold‚Äôs supervisor, Carl Kline. Follow Us On: Facebook and Twitter Previous Post "

While known for his Beat poetry, he was also indelibly shaped by leftist politics.

In 1956, Allen Ginsberg was thirty years old, working in market research and living in Berkeley, California. Born in New Jersey, the renowned Beat poet-to-be had traveled farther than cross-country to get to California. In 1953, he left New York City, where he had attended Columbia University, stopping first in Washington DC, Miami, Havana, and Guanajuato, Mexico, before arriving in San Francisco in 1954 and moving to Berkeley the following year. The journey gave him an expansive view of the United States, both from within and without, which he channeled into his 1956 poem ‚Äú America .‚Äù
In ‚ÄúAmerica,‚Äù Ginsberg excoriated the prevailing political climate while revealing his own beliefs. The poem churns between violent indictment and unapologetic confession ‚Äî ‚ÄúAmerica when will we end the human war? / Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb‚Äù; ‚ÄúAmerica I feel sentimental about the Wobblies / America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I‚Äôm not sorry.‚Äù Jonah Raskin, a biographer of Ginsberg, calls ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù ‚Äúprobably the most effective of the overtly political poems that [Ginsberg] wrote in the wake of Howl. ‚Äù
Ginsberg had performed ‚ÄúHowl‚Äù for the first time just three months earlier, making his public debut in a career that would win him the National Book Award, the Robert Frost Medal, and an American Book Award. Throughout that time ‚Äî indeed, from his childhood to his death ‚Äî the poet was shaped by the politics of the Left. ‚ÄúI Used to be a Communist‚Äù
Ginsberg was born in Newark in 1926 to a mother and father that he described as communist and socialist, respectively. His mother Naomi had left Russia following the 1905 Revolution and emigrated to the United States, where she met Ginsberg‚Äôs father Louis, a poet and a school teacher. The household was progressive enough that when Ginsberg left for Columbia University in 1943, he intended to become a labor lawyer.
But during college, Ginsberg struggled with the politics of his childhood. Part of this involved acknowledging his ambitions as a poet, rather than a lawyer, but it was also influenced by the reactionaries he found in the lecture halls of Columbia. Not only was the university generally conservative ‚Äî ‚Äúradicalism was out of fashion with the faculty in the 1940s,‚Äù Raskin writes ‚Äî but Ginsberg‚Äôs mentor, English professor Lionel Trilling, was vociferously anticommunist. A radical in the 1930s, Trilling had since switched sides, attacking ‚Äúliberalism‚Äù ‚Äî by which he meant Marxism and communism ‚Äî with bombastic statements like ‚Äúwhen a man does begin to court the liberal-democratic ideal, it is either a sign or the beginning of spiritual collapse in his work.‚Äù While his mentor‚Äôs influence complicated Ginsberg‚Äôs politics, it did not lead the poet to completely abandon his beliefs, as he read Marx and Lenin alongside T. S. Eliot, a favorite of Trilling.
The men Ginsberg met on the streets of Manhattan were in some ways the same as Columbia‚Äôs faculty. By 1944, he had befriended Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, and Lucien Carr, all cynics about socialism, if not vocal anticommunists . The three had an enormous impact on Ginsberg. It was in their company that the poet first openly embraced his homosexuality, began developing his unique writing style, and came to celebrate alternatives to mainstream US society that at the time were aggressively ignored, if not actively denigrated. But like Trilling, they also complicated Ginsberg‚Äôs politics. ‚ÄúThere is only one man who can be more deadly a bore than a Communist,‚Äù Ginsberg wrote in 1944. ‚ÄúThat is the man who was once a Communist and is sorry for it.‚Äù
Unfortunately, Ginsberg‚Äôs sense of self around this time was also rapidly deteriorating. He was reading the fascist Oswald Spengler and putting on a racist, sexist facade. Despite coming from a Jewish family, he wrote antisemitic graffiti in class and was thrown out of school for it. He eventually returned and graduated late in 1948, but spent the next four years struggling, once being arrested and spending time in New York State Psychiatric Institute as a patient. After getting out, he worked in marketing research and tried to date women. He also missed the funeral of his mother, who had been institutionalized for years.
With little left to lose, Ginsberg decided to make his roundabout trip west after reading an article in Harper‚Äôs ridiculing San Francisco for its ‚ÄúNew Culture of Sex and Anarchy.‚Äù The Beat Poet
From the epic labor struggles of the 1930s to the contemporary bohemian art scene, San Francisco in 1954 was a paragon of radicalism. Ginsberg took in iconoclastic films like Rebel Without a Cause and The Wild One , enjoyed the fruits of sexual liberation, and befriended local poets who were both artistic and political ‚Äî from Kenneth Rexroth and Gary Snyder, both members of the Industrial Workers of the World , to Lawrence Ferlinghetti , the anarchist founder of City Lights Bookstore and publisher of Howl and Other Poems .
The influence of this new environment, along with the escalation of the Cold War, came through in Ginsberg‚Äôs poetry ‚Äî including ‚Äú Howl ,‚Äù which he composed from 1955 to 1956. The years preceding the poet‚Äôs best-known work saw not only McCarthyism‚Äôs repressive rise, but the launch of the nation‚Äôs first openly anticommunist international conflict, the Korean War . As the Cold War continued to reach new, apocalyptic heights and the counterculture bloomed in response, ‚ÄúHowl‚Äù took on greater significance. Ginsberg seems prescient in those lines in which he describes his ‚Äúangelheaded hipsters‚Äù:
who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago, who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets, who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism, who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed ‚Ä¶
Ginsberg delivered his first public reading of ‚ÄúHowl‚Äù at the Six Gallery in San Francisco on October 7, 1955. It is now widely considered the moment that launched his career, winning him attention, acclaim, and even some scorn as one of the most prominent figures of the Beat Generation, a literary movement that rejected postwar US materialism and formality in favor of spirituality and experimentation.
Ginsberg applied the unique style he developed in ‚ÄúHowl‚Äù to other subjects, including his mother in ‚Äú Kaddish ‚Äù and contemporary politics in ‚ÄúAmerica.‚Äù Similarly, the politics he evoked in ‚ÄúHowl‚Äù would find voice time and time again. While he is outspoken about his political views in ‚ÄúAmerica,‚Äù he is more subtle in ‚ÄúKaddish.‚Äù Dedicated to his mother, the communist who had fled a failed revolution in Russia only to die institutionalized in the United States, the poem blends the personal and the political:
Dreaming back thru life, Your time ‚Äî and mine accelerating toward Apocalypse, the final moment ‚Äî the flower burning in the Day ‚Äî and what comes after, looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city a flash away, and the great dream of Me or China, or you and a phantom Russia, or a crumpled bed that never existed ‚Äî like a poem in the dark ‚Äî escaped back to Oblivion ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI Feel Sentimental About the Wobblies‚Äù
Ginsberg would remain a critic of US society and politics throughout his life, but he didn‚Äôt seek Soviet-style communism in the United States. He believed that the worst things that many Americans criticized about the Soviet Union ‚Äî the conformity, the secret police, the gulags ‚Äî were about as true of the United States. And, in 1965, he learned that some of the things he hated most about the United States were also true of Communist countries, when he was deported from Cuba and Czechoslovakia for agitating for gay rights and being a ‚Äúdegenerate.‚Äù
Still, Ginsberg never became a reactionary. He visited Saigon in 1963 and understood that US imperialism had brought the autocratic Ngo Dinh Diem to power in increasingly revolutionary South Vietnam. For the rest of his life, he remained an outspoken critic of US imperialism, whether it meant opposing the Shah of Iran or the Nicaraguan Contras. Up until the year before his death in 1997, he was condemning US meddling in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.
Ginsberg‚Äôs condemnation of the United States‚Äô international machinations dovetailed with his domestic activism. He played a leading role in the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where he attempted to calm the rampaging police, before being tear-gassed himself. In 1978, he was arrested for blocking a train servicing a nuclear weapons production facility outside of Denver. Even at the age of sixty-two, he managed to get wrapped up in the 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot outside of his apartment in New York City.
For the United States, Ginsberg wanted something different. He vaguely described it as a ‚Äúshift to cooperative socialism‚Äù and the ‚Äúabandonment (perhaps) of money itself.‚Äù Maybe his poem ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù paints the clearest picture of his preferred society, one of generosity, freedom, and transformation:
America when will you be angelic? When will you take off your clothes? When will you look at yourself through the grave? End Mark"
"The Limited War Powers Precedent of the Korean ""Police Action"" - Just Security",www.justsecurity.org,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.justsecurity.org/63527/the-limited-war-powers-precedent-of-the-korean-police-action/,"by Brian Finucane
April 5, 2019
In a recent piece in the Washington Post, Professor Mary Dudziak drew attention to the Executive Branch‚Äôs continued reliance upon President Truman‚Äôs police action on the Korean Peninsula as a ‚Äúprecedent for the unilateral presidential power exercised today.‚Äù However, the current legal significance of the Korean precedent is more limited than some critics of presidential unilateralism might fear or advocates for such power may hope. These limitations have significant implications for ongoing war powers debates.
Under the Executive Branch‚Äôs own longstanding views, at least two constitutional provisions constrain the scope of the President‚Äôs authority to initiate the use of force without prior congressional authorization. Taken together, the Take Care and Declare War Clauses reduce the utility of the Korean War as a precedent supporting the initiation of large-scale uses of force by the President.
Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution requires that the President ‚Äútake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.‚Äù As I explain in a forthcoming article in the Cornell Law Review, the understanding that treaties, including the U.N. Charter, are ‚ÄúLaws‚Äù not only is a deeply rooted Executive Branch position, but also was a key element of the Truman Administration‚Äôs argument for the use of force on the Korea Peninsula in the absence of prior congressional authorization. In a 1951 legal memorandum submitted to the Senate, the Truman Administration explained, ‚Äúthe President has the authority and the duty to carry out treaties of the United States. Treaties, duly approved, are the laws of the land and it becomes the President‚Äôs duty ‚Äòto take care that they be faithfully executed‚Äô as laws.‚Äù Consequently, the President is ‚Äúunder a duty to see that the great objectives of the Charter are carried on so far as it lies within his power to do so.‚Äù
Whether or not the Truman Administration properly relied upon the Charter as a source of domestic legal authority in using force on the Korean Peninsula, the acknowledgment that the Charter is binding law that the President is obligated to execute faithfully necessarily entails constraints upon the President‚Äôs constitutional war powers. [1] Specifically, Article 2(4) of the Charter provides in relevant part that ‚Äú[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.‚Äù The United States has recognized only three exceptions to Article 2(4)‚Äôs prohibition on the use of force: (1) Chapter VII authorization from the U.N. Security Council; (2) self-defense; or (3) consent of the territorial state. (The United States has famously declined to adopt the doctrine of humanitarian intervention.)
Thus, as Professor Marty Lederman has argued, Article 2(4) imposes constitutional limitations on the President‚Äôs powers under Article II. Truman‚Äôs actions to help repel armed aggression against the Republic of Korea were consistent with Article 2(4), as the use of force could be justified at the very least on the basis of collective self-defense (and potentially also on the grounds that it was authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter). However, if in contrast to the Korean precedent, a President unilaterally directed the use of force outside of the three exceptions identified above, such action would not constitute ‚Äúfaithful execution‚Äù of Article 2(4). The Korean precedent and its ‚ÄúTake Care‚Äù justification cuts against the argument that the President has unilateral authority to use force in violation of the U.N. Charter.
The Declare War Clause imposes a further constraint on the President‚Äôs war powers. Following the Truman presidency, administrations of both parties (including the present one ), have recognized with varying degrees of clarity that if a contemplated military operation would be sufficiently extensive in ‚Äúnature, scope, and duration‚Äù to constitute a ‚Äúwar‚Äù within the meaning of Article I, ¬ß 8, cl. 11, congressional authorization would be required.
In this respect, presidential war powers are not exclusively a one-way ratchet. The Executive Branch does sometimes ratchet back prior expansive claims of inherent authority to use force in the absence of prior congressional authorization. Today, there can be little doubt that a conflict akin to the Korean police action in its nature, scope, and duration would amount to war in the constitutional sense and thus require congressional authorization. Indeed some recent administrations have implied as much in their treatment of the Korean precedent (see here at 8-9 and here at 331 n.5). And it should also be emphasized that even those uses of force not implicating the Declare War Clause, might still be prohibited as a matter of domestic law under Article 2(4) by virtue of the Take Care Clause.
Properly understood and situated in the context of subsequent Executive Branch legal positions, the Korean police action is a limited precedent, possibly neither as dangerous nor useful, as some may believe.
‚Äî‚Äì
[1] There may be some doubt as to whether the Charter and relevant Security Council provisions required Truman to use force under the Take Care Clause given that the pertinent language of these instruments did not obligate states to use force."

In 1898, Theodor Herzl made what would be his only trip to the Middle East, during which he visited Turkey and the land of Israel. Throughout the trip he mailed postcards to his eight year old daughter Paulina, who was in Vienna at the time. The National Library of Israel has recently digitized a collection of these postcards; they can now be viewed online here . The messages on the postcards contain short but heartfelt expressions of love for his daughter. On one dated October 15, 1898, Herzl wrote ""Tender kisses to my delicate daughter Paulina from her faithful Papa."" That particular postcard was sent from Constantinople, which would soon be renamed Istanbul. ""Herzl is remarkable in that his greatness has almost universally been recognized across the Zionist spectrum,"" commented Dr. Hezi Amiur, curator of the National Library's Israel Collection. ""There are few if any other figures in Zionist or Israeli history for which this can be said."" The postcards are from the Abraham Schwadron Collection at the National Library.

Late Show host Stephen Colbert hit President Donald Trump where it hurts the most on Friday, right in the ratings.
Colbert started out by noting Trump is ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with being liked, which is why ‚Äúso many people can‚Äôt stand him.‚Äù
He then turned to recently uncovered ratings which show some people don‚Äôt have positive associations with Trump at all.
According to a New York Times report , the president doesn‚Äôt fare very well when it comes to e-poll market research.
‚ÄúDonald Trump does not do well in these e-ratings,‚Äù Colbert explained. ‚ÄúHis overall strong negative appeal was 39%, compared to a strong positive appeal of just 14%.‚Äù
He added the e-score ‚Äúmeasures the appeal and awareness of celebrities and also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes‚Ä¶And the characteristics most associated with the president were ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô and ‚Äòmean,‚Äô two of the rejected seven dwarfs.‚Äù
Trump also ‚Äúscored high for being ‚Äòconfident‚Äô and ‚Äòcreepy'‚Äù according to the comedian.
‚ÄúBy the way, confident and creepy is the same combination score you‚Äôd give a spider your shower,‚Äù Colbert quipped.‚ÄúBut here‚Äôs the part Trump‚Äôs really not going to like. His lowest scores were for the attributes of ‚Äòsexy,‚Äô‚Äòhandsome,‚Äô and ‚Äòphysically fit.'‚Äù
Driving his point home, Colbert showed a series on unflattering Trump photos.

HBO host Bill Maher insisted on Friday night that the Joe Biden controversy is ‚Äúnot that fucking serious.‚Äù
Maher started off his show talking about the how Biden matter is being blown out of proportion .
Then returning to the topic during the panel discussion, Maher said that he wished the media would stop conflating #MeToo terms with their talk of Biden‚Äôs actions.
‚ÄúI wish the media would stop using the terms of the #MeToo movement. These are not allegations. They actually happened. It‚Äôs on tape,‚Äù he said.
Maher then claimed that what happened was not ‚Äúserious‚Äù enough to be allegations.
‚Äú[The women] are not victims stepping forward, all this bullshit,‚Äù Maher continued on. ‚ÄúHe kissed the back of somebody‚Äôs head.‚Äù
Hammering his point home, the HBO host finally read a quote from CNN‚Äôs Christopher Cillizza claiming Biden‚Äôs controversy is not ‚Äù a joking matter.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, it is,‚Äù Maher then countered. ‚ÄúIt is exactly what is perfect for a joking matter. It‚Äôs not that fucking serious.‚Äù

Is Bernie Sanders Behind The #MeToo Complaint Against Joe Biden?,www.nationalmemo.com,Froma Harrop,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/sanders-behind-metoo-complaint-against-biden/,"Froma Harrop April 5, 2019 Share
There was always something fishy about the #MeToo complaint against Joe Biden. Putting hands on Lucy Flores‚Äô shoulders and smooching the back of her head is in no way sexual. Even Flores admitted that.
Nonetheless, Flores gave a dramatic rendition of the distress it caused her. ‚ÄúI just froze,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to do. Because again the only thing that you‚Äôre processing is that there is a very powerful man standing next to you ‚Ä¶ and you just don‚Äôt know how to respond.‚Äù
What doesn‚Äôt add up? Everything.
Flores was not a preadolescent nymph but rather the 2014 Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor. If a kiss on the back of her head made her freeze, how would she have responded to a genuine crisis, say, a terrorist attack? She was about to go on stage, so you‚Äôd think she had other things on her mind. Then-Vice President Biden was doing her an enormous favor bestowing his prestige on her candidacy. And if this bothered her so much, why did she wait five years to ‚Äúcome forward‚Äù?
The most plausible answer is that this stunt isn‚Äôt about Biden but about helping Bernie Sanders. Lo and behold, polls show Biden leading Sanders among Democratic voters ‚Äî as Sanders faces his own accusations of disrespecting women.
Some backstory: When Flores lost the 2014 election by a landslide, establishment Democrats stopped promoting her. (Two years later, she lost a primary run for Congress.) In 2016, she joined the Sanders campaign, becoming a surrogate. She also joined the board of Our Revolution, an advocacy group backing Sanders.
Biden advisers share the hunch that the Sanders campaign is behind her charges, according to Mike Allen of Axios. And a former Sanders staffer, Tezlyn Figaro, just called Flores a ‚Äúfraud‚Äùon Fox News.
We expect that, in the future, Biden will desist from getting so affectionate with women and will lose the grandfatherly touch. A politician should not do unto women that which he would not do unto men.
But let‚Äôs look at Sanders‚Äô lamentable record on women. Women who worked on the 2016 campaign complain that they were made subservient to the boy geniuses. And there was that unforgettable moment when the Bernie bros hurled the C-word at Democratic women running the Nevada State Democratic Convention. Sanders responded to the use of that vilest of words against women with the mildest of hand slaps. Then he blamed both sides. (The official statement has been removed from his website.)
Because everyone is delving into Biden‚Äôs beliefs of decades ago, consider Bernie‚Äôs. In 1969, he opined that sexual maladjustment was linked to breast cancer. ‚ÄúYou might very well be the cause of cancer,‚Äù he wrote with his trademark air of authority. Even back then, mainstream science rejected theories that psychological factors caused cancer.
Sanders also found fault with mothers unhappy that their 16-year-old daughters spent a night out with their boyfriends. ‚ÄúAre you concerned about HER happiness,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúor about your ‚Äòreputation‚Äô in the community?‚Äù In this worldview, not putting out is an emblem of female repression.
Zoom to 2019. Sanders says he believes Lucy Flores, as do a number of other opportunistic Democrats. Thing is, we all believe Flores‚Äô account of what Biden did. Videos show Biden hugging, kissing and rubbing shoulders of numerous women over the years.
What we can‚Äôt believe is Flores‚Äô claim that she is bringing this up now to fix a grievous wrong done her ‚Äî rather than an innocent gesture by a national politician who went out of his way to help her campaign. That Sanders and his people are fueling these petty attacks is something we can believe.

"At Southern Border, Trump Delivers Another Angry Anti-Immigrant Rant",www.nationalmemo.com,Emily Singer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/at-southern-border-trump-delivers-angry-anti-immigrant-rant/,"Emily Singer April 5, 2019 Share
Trump‚Äôs attacks on Central American migrants fleeing violence in their countries continued on Friday, when he falsely claimed that the United States is full and can no longer accept immigrants.
‚ÄúThe system is full. We can‚Äôt take you anymore,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs asylum. Whether it‚Äôs anything you want. It‚Äôs illegal immigration. Can‚Äôt take you anymore. We can‚Äôt take you. Our country is full. Our area is full. Our sector is full. We can‚Äôt take you anymore, I‚Äôm sorry. So turn around. That‚Äôs the way it is.‚Äù
Trump made the remarks during a roundtable with Border Patrol officials in an area of California located on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Trump was visiting the specific area to hold a photo shoot in front of a segment of border fencing that already existed for years but that was rebuilt during Trump‚Äôs presidency. Trump‚Äôs own Homeland Security secretary admitted the visit was a stunt .
Yet Trump made the most of the stunt, spewing false comments about immigration, as well as vile and racist comments about migrants.
The U.S. is far from full. According to the most recent census, 47 percent of land in the United States is unoccupied. Not to mention, companies have struggled to find workers for jobs, meaning there is a need for more people in this country, unlike what Trump suggested.
But Trump‚Äôs racist hatred of brown people is fueling his anti-immigrant policy agenda.
At the Friday event, he shamelessly accused all migrants coming to the U.S. of being gang members.
‚ÄúI look at some of these asylum people, they‚Äôre gang members,‚Äù Trump said . ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not afraid of anything. They have lawyers greeting them. They read what lawyers tell them to read, the lawyer tells them what to read, they‚Äôre gang members. And they say, ‚ÄòI fear for my life.‚Äô They‚Äôre the ones causing fear for life. It‚Äôs a scam, ok, it‚Äôs a scam. It‚Äôs a hoax.‚Äù
There is no factual basis to say that every single migrant seeking asylum in the U.S. is a gang member. That‚Äôs just patently absurd. Yet Trump is pushing that racist theory to scare his racist base in the hopes that they stick with him in the 2020 election.
Unfortunately for Trump, he already tried this gross strategy in the 2018 midterms, using Fox News ‚Äî a.k.a. state television ‚Äî to fear monger and gin up Republican votes .
However, that strategy failed miserably in 2018.
And there are no signs to say the failed strategy will work again roughly two years from now.

"IRS Pursued Ultra-Wealthy Tax Evaders, But Lacked Resources To Win",www.nationalmemo.com,Jesse Eisinger and Paul Kiel,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/irs-went-after-ultra-wealthy-tax-evaders-lacked-resources-win/,"Share
On June 30, 2016, an auto-parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread: The Internal Revenue Service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers. He stood accused of masking about $5 billion in income. The IRS wanted over $1.2 billion in back taxes and penalties.
The magnate, Georg Schaeffler, was the billionaire scion of a family-owned German manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in Dallas. Schaeffler had extra reason to fear the IRS, it seemed. He wasn‚Äôt in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its SEAL Team 6.
In 2009, the IRS had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultra-wealthy. In an age of widening inequality, with a concentration of wealth not seen since the Gilded Age, the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers. The IRS commissioner aimed to stanch the country‚Äôs losses with what he proclaimed would be ‚Äúa game-changing strategy.‚Äù In short order, Charles Rettig, then a high-powered tax lawyer and today President Donald Trump‚Äôs IRS commissioner, warned that the squad was conducting ‚Äúthe audits from hell .‚Äù If Trump were being audited, Rettig wrote during the presidential campaign, this is the elite team that would do it.
The wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of Schaeffler in 2012, eventually determining that he owed about $1.2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties. But after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat, the IRS abandoned its campaign. The agency informed Schaeffler‚Äôs lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions, according to a person familiar with the audit.
How did a case that consumed so many years of effort, with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission, produce such a piddling result for the IRS? The Schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultra-wealthy. For starters, they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent. Such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws; they employ complex, highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage. It can take years for IRS investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation.
Once that happens, the IRS team has to contend with battalions of high-priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency‚Äôs elite SWAT team. ‚ÄúWe are nowhere near a circumstance where the IRS could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world,‚Äù said Steven Rosenthal, who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.
Because the audits are private ‚Äî IRS officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information ‚Äî details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse, with little in the public record. Attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients‚Äô taxes, and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps. Such disputes almost always settle out of court.
But ProPublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the Schaeffler case. The billionaire‚Äôs lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity, one so novel that they acknowledged, even as they planned it, that it was likely to be challenged by the IRS. Then Schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the IRS on multiple fronts. They denied that he owed any money, arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues. Schaeffler‚Äôs representatives complained to top officials at the agency; they challenged document requests in court. At various times, IRS auditors felt Schaeffler‚Äôs side was purposely stalling. But in the end, Schaeffler‚Äôs team emerged almost completely victorious.
His experience was telling. The IRS‚Äô new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied. The wealthy‚Äôs lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team. And soon after the group was formed, Republicans in Congress began slashing the agency‚Äôs budget . As a result, the team didn‚Äôt receive the resources it was promised. Thousands of IRS employees left from every corner of the agency, especially ones with expertise in complex audits, the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit. The agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012, according to a report by the IRS‚Äô inspector general. But by 2014, it had only 96 auditors. By last year, the number had fallen to 58.
The wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged. As Robert Gardner, a 39-year veteran of the IRS who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency‚Äôs tax whistleblower office, put it, ‚ÄúFrom the minute it went live, it was dead on arrival.‚Äù
Most people picture IRS officials as all-knowing and fearsome. But when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around, IRS auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the Large Hadron Collider.
That began to change in the early 2000s, after Congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich. The discovery led to criminal charges, and settlements by major accounting firms. By the end of the decade, the IRS had determined that millions of Americans had secret bank accounts abroad. The agency managed to crack open Switzerland‚Äôs banking secrecy, and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue.
The IRS came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultra-wealthy. Multimillionaires frequently don‚Äôt have easily visible income. They often have trusts, foundations, limited liability companies, complex partnerships and overseas operations, all woven together to lower their tax bills. When IRS auditors examined their finances, they typically looked narrowly. They might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine, say, a year‚Äôs gifts or income.
Belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance, the IRS formed what was officially called the Global High Wealth Industry Group in 2009. ‚ÄúThe genesis was: If you think of an incredibly wealthy family, their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate,‚Äù said former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad. ‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt really been looking at it all together, and shame on us.‚Äù
The IRS located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person.
The vision was clear, as Doug Shulman, a George W. Bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the Obama administration, explained in a 2009 speech : ‚ÄúWe want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual.‚Äù
It‚Äôs particularly important to audit the wealthy well, and not simply because that‚Äôs where the money is. That‚Äôs where the cheating is, too. Studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes. The top 0.5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income, according to a 2010 study by the IRS‚Äô Andrew Johns and the University of Michigan‚Äôs Joel Slemrod. Adjusted for inflation, that‚Äôs more than $50 billion each year in unpaid taxes.
The plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward. In a few years, the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors. A team of examiners would tackle each audit, not just one or two agents, as was more typical in the past. The new group would draw from the IRS‚Äô best of the best.
That was crucial because IRS auditors have a long-standing reputation, at least among the practitioners who represent deep-pocketed taxpayers, as hapless and overmatched. The agents can fritter away years, tax lawyers say, auditing transactions they don‚Äôt grasp. ‚ÄúIn private practice, we played whack-a-mole,‚Äù said Rosenthal, of the Tax Policy Center. ‚ÄúThe IRS felt a transaction was suspect but couldn‚Äôt figure out why, so it would raise an issue and we‚Äôd whack it and they would raise another and we‚Äôd whack it. The IRS was ill-equipped.‚Äù
The Global High Wealth Group was supposed to change that. Indeed, with all the fanfare at the outset, tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele. ‚ÄúThe impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields, highly trained. The IRS would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues,‚Äù Chicago-based tax attorney Jenny Johnson said.
The new group‚Äôs first moves spurred resistance. The team sent wide-ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets‚Äô entire empires. Taxpayers with more than $10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests, with the promise of many more to follow. The agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits.
In past audits, that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages, with narrowly tailored requests. Here, a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues. One example: a list of any U.S. or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an ‚Äúat least a 20 percent‚Äù interest, including any ‚Äúhybrid instruments‚Äù that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share. The taxpayer would then have to identify ‚Äúeach and every current and former officer, trustee, and manager‚Äù from the entity‚Äôs inception.
Taxpayers who received such requests recoiled. Attacking the core idea that Shulman had said would animate the audits, their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information, creating an onerous burden. The audits ‚Äúproceeded into a proctology exam, unearthing every aspect of their lives,‚Äù said Mark Allison, a prominent tax attorney for Caplin & Drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing Global High Wealth audits. ‚ÄúIt was extraordinarily intrusive. Not surprisingly, these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing.‚Äù
Tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency, at American Bar Association conferences and during the ABA‚Äôs regular private meetings with top IRS officials. ‚ÄúPart of our approach was to have private sit-downs to raise issues and concerns,‚Äù said Allison, who has served in top roles in the ABA‚Äôs tax division for years. We were ‚Äútelling them this was too much, unwieldy and therefore unfair.‚Äù Allison said he told high-ranking IRS officials, ‚ÄúYou need to rein in these audit teams.‚Äù
For years, politicians have hammered the IRS for its supposed abuse of taxpayers. Congress created a ‚Äú Taxpayer Bill of Rights‚Äù in the mid-1990s. Today, the IRS often refers to its work as ‚Äúcustomer service.‚Äù One result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior IRS officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns. ‚ÄúThere was help there. They stuck their necks out for me,‚Äù Allison said.
The IRS publicly retreated. Speaking at a Washington, D.C., Bar Association event in February 2013, a top IRS official, James Fee, conceded the demands were too detailed and long, telling the gathering that the agency has ‚Äútaken strides to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù The Global High Wealth group began to limit its initial document requests.
The lobbying campaign, combined with the lack of funding for the group, took its toll. One report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years. In a September 2015 report, the IRS‚Äô inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a ‚Äústandalone‚Äù group ‚Äúcapable of conducting all of its own examinations.‚Äù The group didn‚Äôt have steady leadership, with three directors in its first five years. When it did audit the ultra-wealthy, more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes.
The inspector general also criticized the IRS broadly ‚Äî not just its high-wealth team ‚Äî for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers. In 2010, the IRS as a whole audited over 32,000 millionaires. By 2018, that number had fallen to just over 16,000, according to data compiled by Syracuse University. Audits of the wealthiest Americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011, falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor. Almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making $200,000 to $399,000. Those audits brought in $605 per audit hour worked. Exams of those making over $5 million, by contrast, brought in more than $4,500 an hour.
The IRS didn‚Äôt even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed Uncle Sam. It ‚Äúappeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers,‚Äù a 2017 inspector general report said .
In recent years, the number of Global High Wealth audits has been higher ‚Äî it closed 149 audits in the last year ‚Äî but tax lawyers and former IRS officials say even that improvement is deceptive. A major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious. ‚ÄúThey were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on,‚Äù Johnson, the tax attorney, said.
Inside the IRS, agents seethed. ‚ÄúThe whole organization was very frustrated,‚Äù Gardner said. ‚ÄúThey were just really not sure what the hell their mission was, what they were supposed to be accomplishing.‚Äù
Georg Schaeffler, 54, has flowing salt-and-pepper hair that makes him look like he could‚Äôve been an actor on the 1980s TV show ‚ÄúDynasty.‚Äù The impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who, as a teenager, once asked for a copy of the German Constitution as a present.
As a younger man, Schaeffler tried to escape his legacy. He left Germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the American West. He was trying to make it on his own ‚Äúwhere people don‚Äôt know who you are,‚Äù as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later. Some might escape to Texas to live a bit wild. Schaeffler became a corporate lawyer.
Schaeffler‚Äôs law firm colleagues didn‚Äôt know much more than that he spoke with an accent, and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy. That is, until he landed on the Forbes list of global billionaires. Rueful at the loss of his privacy, Schaeffler once declared: ‚ÄúI hate Forbes.‚Äù
The family‚Äôs riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the Schaeffler Group, which was founded by Schaeffler‚Äôs father and then passed to his mother after his father died. By 2006, Georg (pronounced GAY-org) owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent. (As a Texas resident at that time, Schaeffler was required to pay U.S. income taxes.)
He very nearly lost it all. In 2008, Schaeffler Group made a big mistake. It offered to buy Continental AG, a tiremaker, just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the Great Depression. Even as Continental‚Äôs stock price crashed, Schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre-crash price.
Schaeffler Group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the German government. The media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low-profile family that ran it. German press accounts dismissed Schaeffler‚Äôs mother as the ‚Äú billionaire beggar ‚Äù for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help.
No German government aid came. The Schaeffler Group teetered, and the family‚Äôs fortune plummeted from $9 billion to almost zero . Amid the crisis over Continental, Georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company; he‚Äôs now the chairman of its supervisory board.
To pay for Continental, Schaeffler Group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks. At the time, Schaeffler‚Äôs lenders, including Royal Bank of Scotland, were desperate, too, having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages. They wanted to avoid any more write-downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans. So in 2009 and 2010, Schaeffler‚Äôs lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions.
By 2012, these maneuvers had caught the eye of the Global High Wealth group. Paul Doerr, an experienced revenue agent, would head the audit. Eventually, the IRS discerned what it came to believe was the transaction‚Äôs essence: The banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of Schaeffler‚Äôs debt.
To the IRS, that had significant tax implications. In the wealth team‚Äôs view, Georg Schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income ‚Äî on which he owed taxes.
The auditors‚Äô view reflects a core aspect of the U.S. tax system. Under American law, companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan.
This frequently comes up in the housing market. A homeowner borrows $100,000 from a bank to buy a house. Prices fall and the homeowner, under financial duress, unloads it for $80,000. If the bank forgives the $20,000 still owed on the original mortgage, the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income.
This levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts. The problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis, so in late 2007, Congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender.
Tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery. Without it, people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest-free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end. Voila, no taxable income.
The notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions, too. That means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor‚Äôs mind. ‚ÄúAny time you have a troubled situation, it‚Äôs a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it, too,‚Äù said Les Samuels, an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters.
But the efforts to avoid tax, in the case of Schaeffler and his lenders, took a particularly convoluted form. It involved several different instruments, each with multiple moving parts. The refinancing was ‚Äúcomplicated and unusual,‚Äù said Samuels, who was not involved in the transaction. ‚ÄúIf you were sitting in the government‚Äôs chair and reading press reports on the situation, your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent. And when the refinancing was completed, the government might think that banks didn‚Äôt know whether they would be repaid.‚Äù
This account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it, who were not authorized to speak on the record, as well as court and German securities filings. The IRS declined to comment for this story. Doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails.
A spokesman for Schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview. ‚ÄúMr. Schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex U.S. tax code,‚Äù the spokesman wrote in a statement, saying ‚Äúthe fact that the refinancing was with six independent, international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm‚Äôs length, commercially driven transactions. The IRS professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions, and there is no continuing dispute ‚Äî either administratively or in litigation ‚Äî related to these matters.‚Äù
Schaeffler‚Äôs lenders never explicitly canceled the loan. The banks and Schaeffler maintained to the IRS that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven.
The IRS came not to buy that. After years of trying to unravel the refinancing, the IRS homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise. The banks and Schaeffler ‚Äúhad a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn‚Äôt gone away,‚Äù a person familiar with the transaction said. But the IRS believed the debt had, in fact, been canceled.
In the refinancing, the banks and Schaeffler had agreed to split the company‚Äôs debt, which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point, into two pieces: A senior loan, to be paid back first, worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros.
Schaeffler‚Äôs income-producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt. Schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate: 4.25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money. In short, it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction.
The junior debt was another matter ‚Äî and its provisions would raise the hackles of the IRS. To begin with, the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income-producing assets. There was no schedule of payments that Schaeffler had to make on the junior debt. He wasn‚Äôt obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan‚Äôs term. And it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0.1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates, plus an additional seven percent per year, which Schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term.
The banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing: A ‚ÄúContingent Remuneration Payment‚Äù and a ‚ÄúContingent Upside Instrument,‚Äù according to German securities filings. The two additions called for Schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company.
The IRS and Schaeffler‚Äôs team fought especially over the Contingent Upside Instrument. Its value was tied to the Schaeffler Group‚Äôs future profitability, just like a share of stock would be. The IRS argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks, but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt. To the IRS, it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from Schaeffler, but they didn‚Äôt know when they‚Äôd receive it ‚Äî or even if they would ever get anything.
To the IRS, these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about $5 billion worth of debt, for which the banks had received something in return. That something looked and acted very much like equity.
The Schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the Global High Wealth group. The IRS assigned a larger than normal team to the exam. The agency would send 86 separate document requests to Schaeffler through July 2013.
But there were problems almost from the beginning, according to people familiar with the audit, who provided this account and chronology. The IRS examiners disagreed with one another over strategy. The debates sometimes spilled into the view of Schaeffler‚Äôs team. ‚ÄúI remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting. They were not presenting a coherent message,‚Äù a person in the Schaeffler camp said.
By contrast, Schaeffler‚Äôs team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified. ‚ÄúThese taxpayers aren‚Äôt exactly represented by H&R Block,‚Äù Gardner, the retired IRS official, said.
Schaeffler‚Äôs advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency. Document requests are typically voluntary at the outset. But at one point, an IRS auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the Schaeffler team‚Äôs resistance and delays and demanded, ‚ÄúWould a summons help?‚Äù according to a person familiar with the exam. Schaeffler‚Äôs team complained about the perceived threat. The IRS scolded its employee, and Doerr, the lead auditor, apologized to the Schaeffler side, according to the person.
In another instance, the IRS could not get information it sought from Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, related to its advice to Schaeffler. So it sued the accounting firm in early 2014. Ernst & Young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation. The IRS won in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, but Ernst & Young appealed.
In early November 2015, with the Ernst & Young appeal unresolved, top IRS officials gave the Schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for. They allowed the auditors to notify Schaeffler that they believed he‚Äôd failed to disclose about $5 billion in income and that he could expect a $1.2 billion tax bill. That included some $200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive.
Only days later, the IRS was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case. On Nov. 10, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district judge, slapping down the IRS‚Äô efforts to get the Ernst & Young documents, ruling they were in fact protected by privilege. The IRS had no choice. It would have to proceed without the documents.
The IRS took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents, the appeals court appeared to bolster the IRS‚Äô view of the transaction. Describing it as a ‚Äúcomplex and novel refinancing,‚Äù the court said the consortium of banks ‚Äúessentially insured‚Äù Schaeffler ‚Äúby extending credit and subordinating its debt.‚Äù The opinion found that Schaeffler‚Äôs team had known that litigation over the transaction was ‚Äúvirtually inevitable,‚Äù underscoring the sense that the billionaire‚Äôs lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits.
The two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters. The statute of limitations was about to run out. Usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit. But Schaeffler‚Äôs team raised the prospect of refusing an extension. They ultimately relented, but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors.
Even as the antagonism built between the two sides, the IRS showed deference to the Schaeffler camp. Doerr gave Schaeffler‚Äôs attorneys a heads-up that the agency was going to deliver bad news, an action that was viewed as overly solicitous, according to one person. It gave an opening for Schaeffler‚Äôs lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team‚Äôs bosses. They expressed how wrongheaded they thought the IRS‚Äô position was and how inappropriate its actions had been.
In June 2016, the IRS sent Schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties.
Schaeffler‚Äôs attorneys continued to argue, often above the heads of the audit team, that the auditors‚Äô interpretation was incorrect. They held conference calls with top IRS officials, saying the audit team had given the Schaeffler side mixed messages. Some on the team had assured Schaeffler‚Äôs attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty. Top officials then met with the Global High Wealth team to discuss the issues. ‚ÄúThe pushback is incredible,‚Äù one knowledgeable person recalled.
The pushback worked ‚Äî and here‚Äôs where an audit is radically different from a court case. Court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail. By contrast, audits are shielded by the secrecy of the IRS‚Äô process. They can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions. In August 2016, in Schaeffler‚Äôs case, officials several rungs up the IRS hierarchy told the Global High Wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request.
Even without a penalty portion, Schaeffler would still owe the original $1 billion in taxes if the IRS maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt. Schaeffler‚Äôs team then went to work on that, too. It succeeded. By 2017, the IRS had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity. After six years on a hard-fought case, the agency had effectively given up.
The IRS had a few stray quibbles, so the agency said it required a payment in the ‚Äútens of millions,‚Äù according to two people familiar with the audit. There the trail goes dark. Tax experts say Schaeffler‚Äôs team would likely have appealed even that offer, which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed, but ProPublica could not ascertain that that occurred.
Thanks in part to the U.S. government‚Äôs bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery, the Schaeffler Group‚Äôs business rebounded. Despite a recent dip in the car market , things have turned out OK for Georg Schaeffler. Today, Forbes estimates his fortune at over $13 billion.

While speaking at a union conference for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers on Friday, former Vice President Joe Biden joked at least twice about the allegations made against him that he has i nappropriately touched women and made them uncomfortable.
Biden is widely believed to be preparing to launch a 2020 bid for the presidency, and he remains at the top of most polls of Democratic voters.
His first joke about the issue came at the top of his speech after he hugged the man who introduced him.
‚ÄúI just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,‚Äù he said.
Later, when he was joined by a group of children on the stage, the vice president pulled one of the boys close to him.
‚ÄúBy the way, he gave me permission to touch him,‚Äù Biden said again.
Earlier in the week, Biden had released a video on Twitter that attempted to address the allegations that have been made against him while he promised to improve his behavior. His jokes on Friday that sentiment seem less than sincere, instead suggesting that he doesn‚Äôt take the allegations seriously. This may be a clever public relations strategy ‚Äî downplaying the allegations against him might be a useful deflection for many voters ‚Äî but it‚Äôs disrespectful of the women who are already facing blowback for speaking out about his behavior.

Trump Abruptly Pulls ICE Nominee: ‚ÄòWe Want To Go In A Tougher Direction‚Äô,www.nationalmemo.com,Alex Henderson,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/trump-abruptly-pulls-ice-nominee-we-want-to-go-in-a-tougher-direction/,"Alex Henderson April 5, 2019 Share

President Donald Trump on Friday unexpectedly withdrew his nomination of Ronald Vitiello to permanently head the Department of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Trump, on Friday, told reporters, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going in a little different direction. Ron‚Äôs a good man, but we‚Äôre going in a tougher direction . We want to go in a tougher direction.‚Äù
Vitiello has been serving as acting director of ICE, and Trump‚Äôs decision came as a shock to members of the U.S. Senate and the Department of Homeland Security because Vitiello was expected to be confirmed to take over the position permanently.
According to the Washington Post , Trump immigration policy adviser Stephen Miller may have played a major role in Trump‚Äôs decision. A senior Trump Administration official told the Post that Miller has been critical of Vitiello in conversations with the president. And another senior administration official, quoted anonymously, told the Post that Miller ‚Äúwants to put Attila the Hun as director of ICE‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to Miller‚Äôs hardline approach to immigration.
Reporting by CNN also alleges that Miller was a key factor in Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw the nomination of Vitiello, who previously served as head of the U.S. Border Patrol. Two White House officials interviewed on condition of anonymity told CNN that Miller urged Trump to pull the nomination.
CNN is also reporting that according to a ‚Äúsource close to the White House,‚Äù the GOP senators who were in the process of confirming Vitiello are furious over Trump‚Äôs decision and feel like he pulled the rug out from under them.
That anonymous source told CNN, ‚ÄúAll of this headway that they‚Äôve made on the Senate side has been completely negated. There are gonna be a number of members on (the) Senate side who are just gonna be beyond pissed off. We just burned a ton of political capital.‚Äù
‚Äú[Homeland Security Secretary] Kirstjen Nielsen has still not been officially informed about Vitiello‚Äôs withdrawal, I‚Äôm told,‚Äù noted CNN reporter Katilan Collins Friday afternoon.
Since being sworn in as president in January 2017, Trump has not had a permanent ICE director confirmed by the Senate. Trump‚Äôs first acting ICE director, Tom Homan, was nominated but never received a Senate floor vote. After Homan‚Äôs departure, Vitiello became acting ICE director in June 2018 and was formally nominated to take over the position permanently in August 2018.
Vitiello is expected to stay with ICE for the time being until Trump finds someone else to nominate for the position. Share this..."
