"I Employ Dozens Of Wonderful Guatemalans, And I Want The Border Wall",thefederalist.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/04/employ-dozens-wonderful-guatemalans-want-border-wall/,"By Ben Williams April 4, 2019
“I’ve always felt that a person’s intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting points of view he can entertain simultaneously on the same topic,” said Abigail Adams toward the end of the 18th century. This is how I feel about immigration policy.
Mrs. Adams’ quote came to mind in the last few days, as we planted trees on the farm. To be honest, the “we” doing the actual sticking in the ground was almost entirely a crew of younger men. My usefulness is more in carrying batches of trees out, picking up boxes, and performing whatever odd jobs a nearly worn-out old man can do.
“We” planted a lot of trees, too—right at 70,000 slash pine seedlings. While 70,000 may sound like a lot trees, and it is to us, in the larger scheme of the overall forestry industry, it’s not really that many. The vast majority of our trees went into the same ground where a similar planting effort two years ago failed due to drought. Beyond the expense of planting more than 100 acres a second time, we’ve also lost two years of growth on something that takes 14 years at minimum before it’s ready for any sort of harvest.
Planting by hand is more expensive and difficult than planting by machine, but when done by a skilled crew, it’s more cost-effective than the alternatives. The crews plant further to the edges of the fields and can adjust where they stick the tree, so they end up avoiding old stumps and other things that a machine would just plant a tree on top of.
Of course, Mrs. Adams’s words have nothing to do with how trees get planted. They bear directly on my seemingly conflicting views on immigration, since I employ a crew of young men, mostly immigrants, to plant these trees. Many Years of Interactions with New Americans
Having previously spent 35 years in the seafood business here in Florida, my view of immigrants has come to be positive to a great degree,because of many thousands of interactions across the fish case. These more often than not involved me in my rubber boots and apron waiting on a customer, helping him select a fish, then cleaning it for him.
On more than a few occasions, the customer could not speak English, nor could I speak Chinese or Farsi or but the smallest amount of Spanish, so their instructions for how I was to clean the fish were communicated by hand. This wasn’t too hard when they simply wanted the fish to be scaled and gutted, with head removed. It was a bit more difficult when they desired trimming the fins, removing the gills, and sectioning the fish into chunks. And it got really complicated if they wanted the bones removed while keeping the fish basically intact.
It’s posited as one of the great values of capitalism that when we engage in voluntary interactions—when we trade value for value—and when we truly understand what is in our own self-interest, that we will find politely and honestly treating others garners the same in return. This has been true for me, at least from across the fish case.
The other end of the seafood business, the sourcing of product for the market, also generated positive interactions with immigrants. Miami is a major import point for all manner of seafood from South and Central America. Only the dullest of minds could not realize how valuable immigrants are to facilitating that trade. Whether due to familial connections or an understanding of how things worked in a particular place, or simply the ability to seamlessly surmount language barriers, immigrants have made much of that trade work. Our customers in the market, whether immigrant or native-born, benefited from this also, as it enhanced the quality and variety available to them.
If you wait on a customer for decades, and if you source from a supplier for similar lengths of time, you will inevitably end up talking to one another. Invariably, the time will come when you and the supplier or customer go past the simple pleasantries of “Yes, ma’am” and “What have you got today?” to actually asking a question of substance. It’s those small extra learnings about each other that help tie us together as human and that let us more easily accept differences. These interactions create individuals from groups rather than groups from individuals, the latter being something the political professionals seek to do, so they can more easily herd us.
So, too, has been the general experience of working with a number of crews from Central America over the last few years here at the farm. Some of the men are able to speak English (the crew leaders in particular), and as in the fish market, we end up eventually getting to the learning questions—the ones that bind us as humans. The Stories of Immigrants from Guatemala
The tree crew and its leader were from Guatemala this time. As we hauled trees to the guys doing the planting, the crew leader taking time to assess planting density and give general directions, we had time to talk.
I discovered he is almost 38, has been coming to the United States for the planting season for 20 years, and likes his job. For all those years, he’s worked for the same company—something that points back to that trading value for value idea.
Back home, he farms coffee on his own land. Knowing nothing of coffee farming, I asked questions to learn. Turns out that farming coffee is as hard as planting trees, though in different ways. He also offered that some, if not all of, the other men also farmed coffee, most on their own land.
We also discussed that his wife was working their coffee farm while he was here, and that it was a busy time back home. The common thread—my wife and I having worked the fish market together, and now working the tree farm, in unison with what him and his wife are doing—was hard to miss.
Now, when you think all that through rationally, you realize this man has made a decision not all that different from one a friend’s daughter and son-in-law have made. The son-in-law takes off and works wherever his company sends him, for up to six weeks at a time, while his wife works her job here. It’s exactly the same setup, borders between nations rather than states being the big difference.
In each instance, the effort, the industry, the pulling in tandem, the familial attachments, and the personal sacrifices in service of a better life are exactly the same. In both instances, I think admiration is due. More Complex than ‘Open Borders’ vs. ‘Build the Wall’
I know, so far I sound unconflicted. You’d even possibly assume me to be an open borders advocate. To be honest, I would lobby hard for more immigration, tilted towards our neighbors to the south. But there is more to it, much more, some of it seemingly at odds with my initial exploration of the issue. It is the antithesis of embracing immigrants to embrace the lawbreaker ahead of the legal.
You see, I agree with building “the wall” provided it’s coupled with a thorough vetting of those arriving with claims of asylum, and a generally robust and prompt response to illegal crossings. I’d even entertain the idea of ending “birthright citizenship” as it currently exists and imposing some requirement for a level of proficiency in English to be attained before citizenship is granted.
Now, all of a sudden, after those last couple of sentences, you’re thinking I’m anti-immigrant. You’d be wrong, just as wrong as your initial assumption that I’m an open borders advocate.
The apparent disconnect comes down to the value of the rule of law. For I am as certain as I can be that a good portion of what makes coming to the United States (or, for that matter, England or Canada or any other nation embracing rule of law and basic ideals of liberal Western democracy) a desire for so many has to do with the freedoms and the safety and the economic opportunity that flow from those ideals.
This being so, it is a reasonable conclusion that to properly serve those immigrants who follow the law, to put them at the head of the line, to align our resources and policy to accommodate and embrace them, and to serve more of them, means that we must stem the flow of those who seek access illegally. In my view, a view not from some theoretical vantage, or from a place where seeking votes is the actual goal, but a view informed by interaction, by having served and having been served, is that it is the antithesis of embracing immigrants to embrace the lawbreaker ahead of the legal. People carry culture with them, and culture can be learned and unlearned. We need to teach a culture of legality.
When we acquiesce to the demands of the illegal as compared to embracing those who demonstrate a culture of legality, we send the wrong message. People carry culture with them, even on to the third and fourth generation, and culture can be learned and unlearned. We need to teach a culture of legality. If we desire to remain a place where immigrants want to come, then we must chose legality over illegality and embrace first and foremost those immigrants who embrace that.
By setting standards, by embracing the admirable, by adhering to ideals that have shown worth and efficacy in producing free and prosperous societies, we will remain a place where immigrants seek to bring the benefits of their abilities and talents. By doing that, we will remain an example, and it is by being an example that we can do the most good.
Realistically, we can’t take in enough people to solve the social and political problems of billions in dozens of countries around the globe. But by being an example and showing the way, we can help billions. It’s Okay if Political Categories Don’t Speak for You
That brings me back to the difficult truth penned by the most admirable Mrs. Adams. At one time, I assumed it was a deficiency in me that caused this inability to pick a political side, to climb into one of the camps on this issue. But the other day, while working out in the field, her thought really hit home.
In considering the positives I see in immigration, balanced with an understanding of the need for the rule of law, I’ve come to a different conclusion than lots of people. That conclusion: it’s those who smugly and sanctimoniously pick a side, adhere to a party line, and are willing to be driven by the political professionals rather than rationally think through such a complex and difficult issue themselves who are the problem.
A final thought: Those “political professionals”—the ones with knowledge of how to drive people emotionally, of how to divert and narrow and conflate and wordsmith such that huge amounts of us become distrustful of one another—I’d venture Mrs. Adams would find them, at best, distasteful and, at worst, dangerous. In her world, a “faction” was something to avoid rather than embrace as a tool for political gain.

How Obama Holdover Sally Yates Helped Sink Michael Flynn - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/obama-holdover-sally-yates-helped-sink-michael-flynn/,"By Jason Beale April 8, 2019
In late January 2017, President Obama’s deputy attorney general Sally Yates made a couple of urgent trips from the Department of Justice building to the White House, carrying information she believed to be critical to U.S. national security.
Yates was aware, likely through intercepts of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s communications, that the newly seated national security advisor, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, had discussed with Kislyak Russia’s response to the Obama administration imposition of sanctions for Russia’s attempts to meddle in the 2016 elections. According to news reports, Flynn had asked Kislyak to wait a few weeks and allow the incoming Trump administration a chance to review the issue before Russia retaliated. Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak occurred on December 29, the day Obama announced the sanctions.
Recall that this period between the election of Trump in early November and his inauguration in late January was characterized by a frenzy of questionable and as-yet unexplained actions taken by the Obama White House, intelligence agencies, and the State Department. The Steele dossier was in circulation at various levels of government and media officialdom; Carter Page’s communications—and those of anyone with whom he communicated, and anyone with whom they communicated—were being monitored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and National Security Agency.
The Great Unmasking had also begun, with unprecedented numbers of requests forwarded from various Obama administration officials to the NSA to reveal the identities of American citizens otherwise protected in their reporting and transcribing of intercepts of foreign official communications. Distribution regulations were relaxed to allow wider access to these NSA intercepts, and the word went out throughout the halls of every government agency to get everything into the system , lest these barbarians coming into office destroy evidence and deny their roles as Russian agents. The David Ignatius Leak
It was inevitable, then, that David Ignatius of the Washington Post would publish a column on January 12 describing Flynn’s December 29 phone calls with Kislyak, information he attributed to “a senior U.S. government official.” Ignatius’ column began thusly:
‘Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,’ mutters Marcellus as ghosts and mad spirits haunt Elsinore castle in the first act of Shakespeare’s ‘ Hamlet .’
After this past week of salacious leaks about foreign espionage plots and indignant denials, people must be wondering if something is rotten in the state of our democracy. How can we dispel the dark rumors that, as Hamlet says, “shake our disposition”?
The “senior U.S. government official” who leaked both the name of a U.S. citizen captured in an intercept of a foreign government official’s communications, and the fact that the foreign official was under NSA surveillance, has not been identified. Nor has there been any indication that a thorough investigation has been, or is being, carried out in search of his or her identity.
The leak of Flynn’s conversation occurred two days after CNN published a separate leak from “U.S. officials with direct knowledge” and “two national security officials” that then-FBI director James Comey had briefed Trump on parts of the Steele dossier after a more expansive briefing on Russian meddling by the directors of the NSA, FBI, Central Intelligence Agency, and national intelligence. That CNN leak was the “hook” that provided journalistic license to publish the details of the unsubstantiated dossier, which media organizations hadn’t considered appropriately vetted and sourced to merit publication—until the leak.
The FBI and Yates were similarly galvanized by the “hook” the Ignatius leak provided on January 12. Less than two weeks later, on January 24, FBI agent Peter Strzok and his partner were in Flynn’s office, questioning him on the Kislyak phone call. Yates made her first trip to the White House two days after that, on January 26.
Her message? Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak, and the vice president was erroneously telling reporters Flynn didn’t discuss sanctions during those calls. Flynn was in great danger of being compromised by the Russians, who were aware of the true nature of the conversations. Planting the Idea of Flynn Being Compromised
Don McGahn, the former White House counsel to whom Yates reported her concerns, asked a valid question: “Why does it matter to the Department of Justice that one White House official lied to another?” According to Yates, the answer to that question was simple: No administration should want its national security advisor to be in a position where he is compromised with the Russians.
Yates is right—no administration should want that, and it’s pretty safe to assume that none do. The only entity that seemed to “want that” was Yates’ Justice Department, as they had no legitimate reason to believe Flynn was either compromised or susceptible to compromise based on the facts at hand, yet they carried on as if it were so.
A compromise is a relatively simple concept. In this case, it would be a foreign government possessing derogatory information on a U.S. official, the threatened exposure of which would be embarrassing or damaging enough to compel the U.S. official to enter an illicit agreement with the foreign government to do their bidding when called upon. This could come in the form of passing classified information, favorably influencing foreign policy, or calling off the dogs in the event of a dispute between the two countries.
For a compromise to be effective, two things must exist: A secret, significant act worthy of treason to keep hidden from exposure; and an individual whose lack of character and integrity allow for the possibility of becoming a traitor.
As Yates was and is aware, neither of those elements were present in the Flynn case. Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak were no longer secret—they were public knowledge. Everyone in government knew it, and everyone on earth who followed U.S. news knew it. The exposure element was gone. There was no hook for Russia to employ against Flynn, nothing secret to threaten to expose to gain his cooperation. So the first element was missing.
The second element—the susceptibility of an individual to commit an act of treason to protect himself from embarrassment or dismissal from his position—is perhaps the most offensive and ridiculous piece of this manufactured madness.
Flynn is a complicated man, with some questionable judgement in business dealings after he retired from military service. His consulting engagements with Turkey and other foreign entities, while not illegal, required Foreign Agents Registration Act and other notifications that he apparently failed to complete in a timely manner. While he seems to dispute the charge, he has nonetheless pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with Kislyak. All of this suggests he was certainly susceptible to occasional lapses in judgement, worthy of whatever penalty and punishment may come his way.
What it does not suggest, by any stretch of the imagination, is that this retired lieutenant general with 33 years of distinguished service to his country, including multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, directorship of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and numerous national-level intelligence leadership positions—a highly decorated and admired military intelligence professional—would be willing to commit treason against the country he had dedicated his life to serving in order to keep the Russians from telling the world he asked their ambassador to hold off on taking adverse action against the United States until the Trump administration had a chance to weigh in.
It is, quite literally, a notion worthy of ridicule. Yet, for some reason, Yates chose to run to the White House and get it on the record that she believed Flynn to be in imminent danger of becoming a compromised national security liability, despite being fully aware that such compromise was impossible. The very fact that she was having that conversation with McGahn eliminated the clandestine element necessary for a compromise. Everybody knew. Yates Explained Her Motivations to Rachel Maddow
One can speculate as to what was really driving Yates those three or four days in January 2017. Perhaps she saw the Flynn affair as a last stand against an administration she’d come to despise in the very short time she served under Trump’s leadership. Perhaps she needed one last scalp before she moved on to private life. Who knows?
What we do know, however, is the level of contempt with which she viewed Flynn, and her willingness to assassinate his character in her quest for whatever satisfaction she sought. We know this because she made it clear in this conversation with Rachel Maddow in July of last year:
Maddow: ‘What are the potentially practical consequences of the kind of compromise you were worried about with Flynn?’
Yates: ‘Well, you know, the Russians are pretty crafty with this – they can do the overt type of threats that you described there, but they can also do the more subtle forms, where they can just let you know that they have evidence that would be embarrassing and troubling to you. And here, where this had become a big public thing about whether or not General Flynn had been talking to the Russians about sanctions – it had become such a big, public thing and there were denials out there by various members of the White House all the way up to the Vice President, saying that this had not happened. Then, when the Russians had what we expected were recordings that would prove that it did, that’s the kind of thing you can hang over someone’s head. You know, no administration should want their National Security Advisor to be in a position where he or she is compromised with the Russians.’
Maddow: ‘Because what they could do with that leverage is to get him, theoretically, to hand over intelligence that they shouldn’t have, to hand over the names of spies in Moscow that are working for U.S. intelligence that they could then go take out and kill. Is that – ?’
Yates: ‘Any number of things, or, even more subtly, not necessarily a specific quid pro quo, but they could put the National Security Advisor in a position where he never wants to get cross-wise with the Russians.’
Maddow: ‘And so he inclines himself towards the Russian point of view (Yates nodding head) almost as a matter of course rather than any individual transactional thing.’
Yates: ‘Right.’
One would expect such an outrageous, shameless attack on Flynn’s character from Maddow—after all, Flynn was working for The Devil and Maddow is in the business of hyping up false claims, allegations, and innuendo about The Devil and anyone associated with him.
But Yates is a career DOJ official with adequate understanding of the character of the military personnel she encountered over the years, and the patriotic mindset of career military and government officials. That she sat across from Maddow and accepted her suggestion that Flynn would “hand over intelligence” to the Russians is bad enough. That she didn’t stop Maddow in her tracks when she suggested Flynn would provide Russia the names of spies working for U.S. intelligence so they could be taken out and killed is unforgivable.
It’s a sign of the times that Yates would sit still for such slander. It’s a stain on her own character that she seemed to agree with it.

Was Nellie Ohr Research Used In Requests To Surveil Trump Campaign?,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/nellie-ohrs-research-used-fisa-applications-surveil-trump-campaign/,"By Margot Cleveland April 8, 2019
Last year, Rep. Devin Nunes exposed the Department of Justice’s use of the Hillary Clinton-funded Christopher Steele dossier to obtain orders to surveil former Trump campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page. Recently released transcripts of congressional testimony now raise the specter that the FBI also used Nellie Ohr’s opposition research in the FISA applications.
Over the last month, Georgia Republican Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, has released a series of transcripts, including that of Department of Justice lawyer Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr . In his congressional testimony, Bruce confirmed that he and his wife met with former MI6 spy Steele on July 30, 2016, and that during that breakfast meeting Steele shared his initial research on supposed connections between Trump and Russia. Bruce said within days he passed Steele’s information to the FBI’s then-deputy director Andrew McCabe, and that after the FBI terminated Steele as a source, Steele continued to feed Bruce information he relayed to the FBI.
During his testimony, Bruce also confirmed that his wife Nellie worked for Fusion GPS—the firm that had hired Steele to collect opposition research on Trump for the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton. The DOJ attorney also revealed that after the FBI launched an investigation into the Trump campaign, his wife handed him a flash drive consisting of the Trump-Russia research she had compiled for Fusion GPS. Bruce passed Nellie’s opposition-funded research on to the FBI.
How the FBI used Nellie’s research is unclear, but a close examination of Nellie’s congressional testimony , the Steele dossier, and the FISA applications raises the real possibility that the FBI used Nellie’s work product to obtain a court order to surveil Page.
In her testimony, Nellie stated that in researching Trump and possible connections he, his family, his business, or his campaign had with Russia, she reviewed open-source material and, independent of Steele, discovered that then-campaign foreign policy advisor Page had traveled to Moscow in July 2016. While in Moscow, according to Nellie’s research, Page spoke at a university. Nellie explained that her research matched Steele’s claim that Page was in Russia in July 2016.
Steele, of course, went much further, claiming that while in Moscow Page met with Igor Sechin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin, and that the two discussed lifting sanctions against Russia. Steele’s dossier also maintained that Page spoke with Divyekin about Russia releasing damaging information about Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign.
In seeking a FISA order to surveil Page, the DOJ relied extensively on the Steele dossier, and Page’s purported interactions with Sechin and Divyekin, telling the secret court that “the FBI has learned that Page met with at least two Russian officials during this trip.” In an extended footnote, the FISA application also discussed Steele’s role as the source of this information.
However, immediately preceding the discussion of Steele’s “intel,” the FISA application stated that “[a]ccording to open source information, in July 2016, Page traveled to Russia and delivered the commencement address at the New Economic School.” This claim mirrors Nellie’s testimony of her open source research, leading one to wonder whether the FBI relied on Nellie’s Democratic-funded opposition research in crafting the FISA application.
It is impossible to tell from the FISA application because the footnote related to that passage is entirely redacted—even though it came from “open source information!” Why? What lies beneath the redaction? And what other details included in the FISA applications might have their genesis in the reports Nellie complied for Clinton and the DNC?
Further, even if the FBI did not rely on Nellie’s research, the fact that publicly available information revealed Page’s trip to Moscow underscores the deficiencies in the FISA applications. The FISA applications relied extensively on Steele’s unverified dossier, including hearsay from sub-sources of unknown reliability.
Also, while there was no corroboration of the sub-sources’ tips regarding Page’s purported criminal conduct, the FISA applications sought to strengthen the believability of the unverified claims by highlighting Page’s presence in Moscow at the time of his supposed meeting with Putin’s associations. Yet such open source information cannot legally corroborate an informant’s tip. The DOJ and FBI knew this, but then again, they also knew better than presenting the unverified Steele dossier to the FISA court.
Americans concerned with the rule of law and the abuse of power running rampant during the Russia collusion investigation have long condemned the government for relying on the Steele dossier. Now they must ask themselves whether Nellie Ohr’s research also paved the way for the government to spy on Page. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

I Really Did See An Ultrasound-Guided Abortion That Made Me Pro-Life,thefederalist.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/yes-really-see-ultrasound-guided-abortion-made-pro-life/,"By Abby Johnson April 8, 2019
I left Planned Parenthood nine years ago after assisting in an ultrasound-guided abortion of a 13-week-old fetus. I saw the unborn child struggle for its life against the abortion instruments. I saw the empty uterus on the screen where life had been just moments before.
This story is now a major motion picture released in theaters nationwide, called “Unplanned.” While the movie defied industry expectations at the box office, attention has also been drawn to an article written about my story soon after I left the abortion industry. I had never felt the need to respond to the false claims in this story until now.
The Texas Monthly published a story just a few months after I left Planned Parenthood entitled “The Convert.” It’s a biased article from a liberal publication that has been used as the sole source for every other abortion-supporting website to try and debunk my story, most of them outright claiming I never witnessed the ultrasound-guided abortion or that it simply never happened.
The article claims there were no 13-week abortions done that day, September 26, 2009. It claims the doctor didn’t use an ultrasound to guide his instruments. But that incorrect information comes only from a sheet of paper from Planned Parenthood, not from an official record from the Texas Department of Health, which would never, under any circumstances, release any reports regarding specific abortions performed at specific clinics, in order to protect patient privacy.
In fact, the only abortion data that the Texas Department of Health releases is general information about abortions performed by county, ethnicity, age, and type of abortion performed. Under no circumstance, even an open-records request, would the Texas Department of Health release the induced abortion report for any facility (Texas Health and Safety Code 245.011).
The Texas Monthly reporter sent me a form from Planned Parenthood that was used as the basis for the story, which looks like something akin to a bad Excel spreadsheet. Planned Parenthood said this is what was sent to the Texas Department of Health, yet that’s not the correct form at all. The actual form is called the Induced Abortion Reporting form and the state requires it for each abortion appointment, not an Excel document. I was the clinic director for this Planned Parenthood, so it was my job to know this information and how to report abortions.
The form Planned Parenthood claims they sent to the Texas Department of Health also has some glaring disparities. Firstly, it doesn’t even have all the information that must be reported to the state, such as any complications and what type of anesthesia was used. Secondly, the form states that the facility performed a surgical abortion on a four-week old fetus. There is no way that would happen until five weeks of gestation at the very earliest, preferably six weeks, because you have to be able to visibly identify the chorionic villi—“ tiny parts of the placenta that are formed from the fertilized egg”—which are usually not visibly present until six weeks.
Both this random document and the official Induced Abortion Reporting document never state if an abortion is done with an ultrasound guide. What’s important to them is that the abortion is completed. Ultrasound-guided abortions aren’t common, but the doctor doing them that day at the clinic wanted to do it that way, which is how I ended up holding the probe and witnessing the death of a baby on the screen.
The document Planned Parenthood sent the Texas Monthly reporter also shows that it was completed on September 30, 2009. But I didn’t resign as clinic director until October 6, 2009, so this supposed “proof” of a document would have been filled out by me. If I had this big scheme to talk about an abortion that never took place, don’t you think that I would have made sure that this form had a 13-week abortion included? However, I had never seen a form like this in my life, because it didn’t exist. The only form that I was aware of was the Induced Abortion Form that is an official Texas Department of Health document.
Understand that Planned Parenthood isn’t great at keeping records and the records they do manage to keep are often not correct or are deceptively altered. Planned Parenthood has been successfully sued many times over for Medicaid fraud, paying millions of dollars back to the government for defrauding taxpayers. Undercover videos shot by Lila Rose and Live Action show Planned Parenthood employees on camera willfully acknowledging they have no problem fudging dates here and there. This isn’t a trustworthy organization.
Another argument that is supposed to prove that my conversion didn’t take place as I said it did was that I did an interview for Planned Parenthood on the Sunday after this ultrasound-guided abortion took place. It was a little show on a local station that was hosted by a pro-choice friend of mine. I had agreed to the interview weeks before, and I had not left Planned Parenthood by that time.
An important part of my story is that I didn’t walk out of Planned Parenthood immediately after witnessing the ultrasound-guided abortion. It is made to appear that way in the film, “Unplanned,” because they are trying to fit 10 years of my life into an hour-and-a-half-long movie. But as I explained in my book, after witnessing the abortion, it took me a full week to reach out to the Coalition for Life.
I didn’t watch the ultrasound-guided abortion and say to myself, “Well, now I am pro-life.” I didn’t want to be pro-life. I hated the pro-life movement. I had been taught to hate them. I thought they hated me.
In fact, for at least 72 hours after witnessing the abortion, I was trying desperately to justify what I had seen. My husband was a special education teacher and I didn’t want to give up my salary, my friends, or my identity. I didn’t know who I would be if I wasn’t an abortion-loving feminist. It was much easier for me, less than 24 hours after witnessing this shocking abortion, to continue on with my job. At that point, I didn’t know if I was going to leave Planned Parenthood. I certainly never thought I would find myself walking into a pro-life office, and I never thought that I would one day be pro-life.
If none of my reasons are sufficient responses, consider that I have already been to court against Planned Parenthood and won. They tried to put a gag order on me after I left to ensure I couldn’t tell my story. The judge not only threw out the case but reprimanded them for wasting his time.
Since then, I have written a best-selling book talking about my experiences. I have a nationally distributed film whose pivotal scene is the ultrasound-guided abortion. If Planned Parenthood actually had proof that this abortion I witnessed never took place, they would have brought it up when they took me to court. They would have already presented this evidence to the public and most certainly have taken further legal action.
But they haven’t, because they know they can’t. They can’t because my story is the truth. Abby Johnson is a former Planned Parenthood manager who now runs And Then There Were None, which helps abortion workers leave their jobs. She is also the author of “Unplanned.” "
Californians Flood Gun Stores When Magazine Ban Lifted For One Week,thefederalist.com,Alec Orrell,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/californians-flood-gun-stores-magazine-ban-lifted-one-week/,"April 8, 2019
“Do you have standard-capacity magazines in stock?” The salesman at the San Diego GlockStore just laughed.
Late last month, federal judge Roger T. Benitez struck down a California law in place since 2000 that banned the sale of gun magazines holding more than 10 rounds. The next day, San Diego firearms owners were jamming the phone lines of every gun store in town, desperate to lay hands on the larger, freshly legal pistol magazines before the People’s Republic of California pulled new shenanigans and made them illegal again.
When Gunfighter Tactical on Miramar opened at 10 a.m. on Saturday, the line at their front door stretched around the building. They were sold out within the hour.
In his decision, Benitez excoriated California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and the state for “turning the Constitution upside down” with the magazine restrictions. Benitez said, “Individual liberty and freedom are not outmoded concepts.” The question will likely go to the U.S. Supreme Court, one of several California gun control laws headed there. Hence the hurry: Within a week, Becerra won a fresh injunction banning standard-capacity magazines again while the ruling appeals.
Ownership of the not-tiny magazines amounts to a symbolic gesture a much as a practical improvement. None of the patrons standing in line evinced a professional need for a 15-round (or more) pistol magazine. These were not police officers or career criminals expecting a shootout against a well-armed adversary at any moment. They are mostly law-abiding, duly registered private owners with a few extra dollars to spare and an urge to own something exotic in their state, something on the edge of illicit.
As they bagged their purchases, they joked about sticking it to Beccera: “Every time the cash register rings, a gun grabber somewhere loses his wings … and his s–t.” Guns Kill People But They’re Not Going Away
Firearms advocates and firearms controllers talk athwart one another most of the time, with one side shouting “Fascists!” and the other shouting “You want children to die!” There’s really no point outlining the back-and-forth for the thousandth time, so straight to the chase: Yes, firearms kill an alarming number of people in the United States every year, a great number by accident or suicide.
Yes, a great number of already enacted and newly proposed restrictions on firearms are staggeringly unconstitutional and effective only at irritating responsible gun owners while the irresponsible and the criminal flout them. Nothing short of a thundering authoritarian disarmament of the entire country is likely to substantially reduce death by firearms, and such a “solution” presents existential dangers of its own. In the end, America’s dilemma with gun rights will remain what it is for the seeable future.
Manifestly, no other constitutional right has been manhandled like the Second Amendment. Consider this hypothetical for perspective: a black American who wants to exercise his 15th Amendment right to vote finds out he must complete a weekend voting responsibility class and obtain an up-to-date voting license. He must undergo a background check before every vote he casts. He must wait ten days after filling out the ballot to turn it in, lest he mark his ballot in anger.
He must show two different forms of identification when he arrives at the polls. If his family believes he is unfit to vote, they can disenfranchise him with a phone call. If he gets diagnosed with a mood disorder or beats his wife, he can never vote again.
Such an outrage would, of course, trigger the American Civil Liberties Union apocalypse: “Voting is this man’s right , and these rules are a violation of his dignity and privacy!” Yet mutatis mutandis , California gun owners put up with just such absurdities in infringements on their gun rights. Gun Privileges vs. Gun Rights
Well-meant wisdom engendered a confusion in American cultural attitudes toward firearms in the later 20th century. The bilateral consensus was that no adult should be able to procure a semi-automatic at the corner store as though he were buying cigarettes: “Give me a Milky Way, a pack of Camels, and throw in a Ruger SR9c 9mm and some cartridges. Neighbor’s getting on my nerves…”
Firearm owners acquiesced to escalating regulation of their right to keep and bear arms from an abundance of caution. Somewhere along the way, the whole culture began to view firearms as a privilege, like driving a car or practicing medicine, rather than a right, like voting or freedom of speech.
The Overton Window shifted, and a great misunderstanding evolved. Now, predicated mostly on their cultural intuition, gun control advocates feel entitled to regulate away firearms for social engineering, as they might cars with bad fuel efficiency, or doctors who overprescribe opiates.
On the other side, firearms advocates have unwittingly accepted gun control’s terms of debate by justifying themselves with statistics and stories of good guys with guns—in all cases arguing and begging for their rights as though they were privileges. Judge Benitez is spot on: the discussion has turned upside down. The Founders would never have justified or bargained. They would have slung their muskets, filled the Capitol Mall, and explained to Congress how it was going to be if lawmakers wanted to keep playing at government: “Our rights came before you bunch, and they will be here after.”
Rights are not a question of common sense or rhetoric. Rights are not a question of social engineering or social optimization. Pace Benitez, rights are not even a question of statistics about how many rounds one really needs to stop an attacker. Rights are not a question at all .
Rights are answers — uncommon, counterintuitive answers to timeless human problems that transcend fashions and centuries. In particular, the Second Amendment is an answer to that unfortunate, perennial human question: “What are you going to do about it if I take away your so-called rights?” Civil conflagrations and oppressive governments all over the world demonstrate that the Second Amendment is a hard-won answer that must be freshly remembered.
Anything worthy of the name right is a private matter, living within every citizen, not displayed in a government building for public perusal and debate. Like voting, the right to keep and bear arms should not deign to justify itself publicly, only assent to universally acknowledged boundaries: “A citizen cannot vote twice, and he cannot own a rocket launcher. So agreed.”
Gun rights supporters must recall the dignity that comes with their private right and cease bargaining. The answer to the question “Why do you even need a 15-round magazine for your Glock if you’re not a police officer?” should be “None of your business . ” It’s time to turn the Constitution and the argument right side up again, to stop explaining and instead demand an explanation: what happened to a fundamental American right?
The conventions of privacy are coming apart in the West at an astonishing clip. Private and public are collapsing to a singularity. Oversharing has become the national pastime. The erosion of faith, technological surveillance, and evermore state intrusion into family life wash away the underpinnings of post-Enlightenment individuality more and more every day.
George Orwell worried in “1984” that totalitarianism would end all privacy. The equation seems to run in reverse, too: loss of privacy breeds totalitarianism, a society full of fussy laws to protect overexposed citizens from one another, as civility deteriorates and citizens become perpetual children. The Framers understood that the Enlightenment ideal of privacy was grounded neither in nature nor history and would not survive on its own unprotected.
If Western private life is to continue—what Judge Benitez calls “individual liberty and freedom”—Americans must not surrender their ability to set boundaries and hold them.

All Democrats' 'New' Ideas Are Repackaged Failures Baby Boomers Like,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/democrats-new-ideas-just-repackaged-old-failures-baby-boomers-like/,"By Warren Henry April 8, 2019
The Democratic Party, or at least its 2020 presidential candidates and new stars, are allegedly lurching significantly leftward. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ platform seems to be a center of gravity , even a bit of a throwback for relying mostly on class warfare instead of identity politics. Some see Joe Biden as the avatar of old Democratic ideas .
This may be the Democrats’ dirty little secret: most of the big, “new,”“progressive” ideas are really decades old. Most of these ideas have been flogged by the lefties who grew up among the New Left of the 1960s and ’70s, eventually dominating the party establishment while settling for neoliberalism when mugged by political reality. Bernie just Recycles Old Ideas
Take Bernie’s signature proposal of Medicare for All, please. Single-payer health care has been Democrats’ holy grail since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman. After Lyndon Baines Johnson got Medicare through Congress, Democrats immediately started talking up a national insurance program, which is mentioned several times in the party’s 1972 platform .
Once New Left-era boomers got to high office, Bill Clinton (who cut his teeth on George McGovern’s 1972 campaign) proposed a “health care security card” entitling every citizen to medical treatment and preventative care. In his heart, Barack Obama preferred single-payer, but was forced to settle for Obamacare.
So the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates supports Medicare for All or–in a common equivocation–”the goal of” Medicare for All. Most voters outside Iowa and New Hampshire are not policy wonks reading white papers. They just want to know candidates are on board with the vision, even if the talk is about a “broken health care system” that Democrats are largely responsible for breaking.
Sanders is also considered the godfather of the Green New Deal, although the Green Party got there first. This behemoth, reduced to its essence, would mark the return of central planning of our economy–yet another progressive idea dating back at least as far as FDR and his “brain trust” of people who thought Soviet Russia was the way of the future. Central Planning Clothed in Green
In this case, the central planning comes clothed in green. Environmentalism is another movement born during the New Left era. In the early ’70s, Democrats focused on alternative forms of energy and included nuclear power in their plans. But the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 (which had no significant health effects) threw lefty boomers into the “No Nukes” paranoia from which they have not emerged, even while claiming Earth has only a decade or so left to take revolutionary action.
Environmentalism has always had its Malthusian streak. Left-wing cranks like Paul Ehrlich feared a population explosion, with widespread famine that did not happen (except in socialist dictatorships). Today’s progressives claim they do not want to bring kids into this doomed world, despite projections of global fertility and population decline.
Lefty boomers like Al Gore took the idea of global warming and ran with it. This last major innovation in progressive thinking on the environment came in 1992, conveniently when our defeat of the Soviet Union required progressives to find new rationalizations for anti-market politics.
The Green New Deal incorporates not only Medicare for All, but also Universal Basic Income (UBI) proposals. Presumably, the left knows their environmental planning would wreck large segments of the economy, thus requiring a much broader safety net for displaced American workers. Welfare for All Has Deep Roots, Too
This”‘new” UBI idea dates back at least as far at Thomas More’s “Utopia,” which ought to be a clue as to its practicality. Nevertheless, UBI came back into vogue in the late ’60s, championed by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his last book, “Where Do We Go From Here?” (1967).
UBI was also advocated by Milton Friedman, while Richard Nixon tasked Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney with conducting UBI experiments in the ’70s (the results were not good ). Expect Democrats to feign outrage (as they do about the health-care mandate) that Republicans are not embracing this “right-wing” idea. They will forget to mention their past advocacy of guaranteed jobs programs in the ’70s.
The Green New Deal’s quixotic fascination with high-speed rail also comes out of the New Left era, when the government funded research into magnetic levitation trains. Similar projects were funded during the Clinton era (another residual boomer fixation). High-speed rail is not as successful elsewhere as the left pretends and there are myriad reasons it fails in America –yet this creaky old idea keeps getting sold as bold and new, like a bad scene from Cameron Crowe’s “Singles .”
Nevertheless, a number of Democratic candidates have signed on to the Green New Deal. Most of them voted “present” when the resolution was brought to the Senate floor. Others have decided to support “the goals of” the Green New Deal. Again, most Democratic voters do not care about the nuances. Radical Proposals belong to the Boomers Too
Even some of the left’s most radical ideas are not new. Abolishing the Electoral College was championed by Democrats, like Birch Bayh , who were angry when Nixon narrowly defeated Hubert H. Humphrey, Jr. in 1968 with a strong third-party showing by George Wallace. Packing the Supreme Court is an idea from the Roosevelt administration; further weaponization of the courts is pushed by lefty boomers who have come to dominate the legal academy.
That most of the left’s platform is not new does not mean the ideas are not radical. To the contrary, while “radical” generally means drastic change from the status quo, the word also means “constituting or growing from a root.” The Democrats’ roots have always been in far-left ideologies. The only thing “new” about progressives’ ideas now is that there is a younger generation or two, many of whom are too poorly educated to understand they are being sold a very old boomers’ bill of goods.

Research Finds Connection Between Pulitzer Prize Winners And Jurors,thefederalist.com,Kiran Somvanshi,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/research-finds-connection-pulitzer-prize-winners-jurors-media-affiliations/,"By Kiran Somvanshi April 8, 2019
Few media bodies enjoy as revered a reputation as that of the century-old Pulitzer organization. Mere mention of its coveted prize in the profiles of journalists catapults their reputations. So it seems only fair that, just as Pulitzer Prize scrutinizes and awards the best of American journalism, the overall process behind the granting of these vaunted awards should similarly undergo closer examination.
Pulitzer jurors serve as gatekeepers for the awards. The jury for each of the 14 categories includes five to seven members—typically former prizewinners or editors of winning publications. They meet to cull through the entries and select three finalists for each category. The 17-member board makes the final determination of the winner in each category.
The board members are former jurors or award winners from the fields of journalism, academia, and literature. To help avoid conflicts of interest, both jurors and board members physically recuse themselves from discussion and voting on specific entries from their own publications. Lobbying for any entries is explicitly prohibited. However, the judging and selection process is shrouded in secrecy and not made public.
Some of the who’s who of the American journalism — the current and former administrators of the Pulitzers Dana Canedy, Mike Pride, and Sig Gissler; former board members like Greg Moore, Jim VandeHei, and Margaret Sullivan; and former jury member Leonard Downie — have defended the fairness of the Pulitzer prizes.
Given this august backdrop, it was surprising to discover instances of a dozen publications that have predominantly won their Pulitzers during a period when a current or former editor or publisher was serving on the Pulitzer board. In examining the awards won by the 117 large and small publications, it is difficult to determine whether these patterns are sheer coincidence; stray examples of potential bias; simply the law of averages due to the hundreds of entries over time; or perhaps even indication that the judges were truly outstanding leaders during the time they served as judges. The Evidence Reveals a Pattern
For instance, Concord Monitor of New Hampshire won its only Pulitzer Prize in 2008, in the category of feature photography, while its editor, Mike Pride, was one of the co-chairs of the Pulitzer board. It was Pride’s last year on the board.
The Denver Post, which has won nine Pulitzers, brought home four of the awards between 2004 and 2013 while its editor, Gregory Moore, served on the Pulitzer board. It won its most recent Pulitzer in 2013, when Moore was one of the board’s two chairmen.
The Tampa Bay Times won a third of its dozen Pulitzers during the tenure of its chairman and CEO, Paul Tash, who served on the Pulitzer board from 2006 to 2014. The publication did not receive any Pulitzer Prize in 2015, when there was no member on the board with a past affiliation with the paper. The publication won again in 2016, the same year Neil Brown, its former editor, joined the board.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has won eight Pulitzers, with three of these awards occurring between 2002 and 2014, during the time its former editor, Sig Gissler, was an administrator of the Pulitzer. The paper has not won any such prize since Gissler’s retirement from the board in 2014.
According to the Gissler and Moore, as the resources of small and regional newspapers wane, their capacity to produce award-winning journalistic work also dries up. “Newspapers like the Milwaukee Journal put in new resources in investigative journalism and that resulted in them having some strong entries for the Prize,” explained Gissler.
Bloomberg won its sole Pulitzer in 2015 during the tenure of its executive editor, Robert Blau—a member of the board since 2011. Politico, founded in 2007, won its only Pulitzer in 2012 for editorial cartooning. Its executive editor and co-founder, Jim VandeHei, served on the Pulitzer board from 2010 to 2012.
Similarly, the nonprofit news organization ProPublica won a Pulitzer in 2016 and again 2017; its editor in chief, Stephen Engelberg, has been on the Pulitzer board since 2012. The Missouri-based St. Louis Post-Dispatch won its first Pulitzer in 43 years in 2015 while Joyce Dehli, the vice president of Lee Enterprise—the company that publishes the Post-Dispatch—was on the Pulitzer board, serving from 2008 to 2017. Seven of the nine Pulitzers won by The Dallas Morning News in its history have been during the tenure of its editors on the Pulitzer board.
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, an online publication, won its last Pulitzer award for editorial cartooning in 2003 while its former editor, Joann Byrd, was part of the Pulitzer board, serving from 1999 to 2008. The last Pulitzer victory for Ohio-based Akron Beacon Journal came in 1997 during the tenure of John Dotson, the president and publisher of the Journal and member of the Pulitzer board from 1992 through 2000.
The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, Louisiana, has won four Pulitzers. The last two came in 2006 when its editor, Jim Amoss, was a member of the Pulitzer board, upon which he served from 2003 to 2012. The Times-Picayune won its 2006 Pulitzers for its coverage of Hurricane Katrina, underscoring the inherent struggle in deciphering a correlation between prizes won and the tenure of the editor on Pulitzer board.
Large papers like The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The Los Angeles Times have won Pulitzers irrespective of the years their editors were (or were not) on the board. The New York Times, which has won more Pulitzers than any other news organization, has had an editor on the board nearly continuously since 1939. The Pulitzer Prize’s Response
Dana Canedy, the administrator of the Pulitzer Prize, believes the organization’s system is fair and questions the appearance of a correlation between awards won and editor or publisher tenure.
“It’s simply a dozen of cases or so where (publications of) board members have won Pulitzers,” she said when contacted last year, adding that “thousands” of journalists have won the prize over the past hundred years, making these cases “a small percent” of the total. “If you did an opposite kind of research,” she later added, “you would see that far more board members’ organizations have never won while they are on the boards than have won.”
The “opposite kind of research” showed that 170 publications have won awards without having any past or present editors or publishers on the Pulitzer board. Reuters is a significant example, having won five Pulitzers with no representation on the board ever.
Board members are discouraged from discussing their votes publicly. Perhaps as a result, no current board members responded to a request for comment. Some former board members were willing to go on the record, however.
“I was only on the board for a year, but I did not feel any pressure, direct or indirect, to vote for a fellow board member’s entry,” said Margaret Sullivan, the media columnist for the Washington Post, when approached last year. “Before that, I was a juror four times, and our decisions as jurors in choosing finalists were, I’m quite sure, not affected by who was or wasn’t on the board.”
Jim VandeHei, formerly of Politico, echoed this sentiment. “There is definitely no explicit bias. I never saw any evidence of that. Is there a subconscious bias? I don’t know how. It is human nature that you might be inclined to help people who are represented already. But I never saw that or evidence of that during the time I was there,” he said.
Leonard Downie Jr., the former executive editor of the Washington Post, said any instances found are coincidence, not correlated. “I would be very surprised if there is any causation,” he said. “I have known the deliberations that result in the final selection and I do not see any causation.” In Downie’s view, related reforms the organization enacted over the years have worked. “It was a long time ago in 1940s that the board was more of a club—but not now,” he said.
Canedy echoed this assessment. “I think the board members take the entire process with integrity,” she said. “The reason that Pulitzers have endured so long is because the system does work the way it should.”
Yet questions about objectivity of the awards, which have haunted the prizes since their inception, linger to this day. The Pulitzers have attracted a variety of criticisms, ranging from arbitrary selection of awards to board errors . Opportunity for Change
There’s obviously room for improvement. Increased transparency and democratization of the jury and board selection process could be a step in the right direction. In his critique of the prizes, Erik Wemple, a media critic for the Washington Post, highlighted the secrecy code of the jury and the board.
“The group that celebrates journalism’s highest achievements contravenes the core value of journalism,” he wrote in a 2012 column. “Pulitzer jurors and board members are having discussions about the merits of published articles—information that is available to anyone. The evaluators have opinions about those stories. Yet they don’t want those opinions known.”
Measures like making public the rationale of the board’s choice of the winning entry and having a set of eligibility criteria in place for selecting a jury or a board member could be helpful.
In the end, the advantage a publication enjoys with a representative on the board is less about influence over the final vote, and possibly more about influence back in the newsroom.
“The only advantage the board member has is that you get to know the quality of work that is required to win the prize,” says the Concord Monitor’s Pride, a four-time juror, a member of the board for nine years, and the administrator of the board for three years. “If you are on the board, you develop a better understanding of what it takes to win or what you do to win the prize.”
Perhaps it is time for the Pulitzer board to make this understanding clearer for all publications, not just those with a window into its hidden world.
This article’s headline has been updated to say “board” instead of “jurors” to be more precise, although many board members have served as jurors also. Kiran Somvanshi was a Fulbright Humphrey Fellow at the Arizona State University from 2017 to 2018. "
Why It's Entirely Relevant To Ask If Representatives Believe In Sharia,thefederalist.com,Jocelynn Cordes,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/entirely-relevant-ask-whether-elected-representatives-believe-sharia/,"By Jocelynn Cordes April 8, 2019
When I was in graduate school many years ago, I dated a Lebanese Muslim who wasn’t particularly devout. However, despite his secular, sophisticated upbringing—he grew up in a pricey neighborhood in Beirut and attended a Swiss boarding high school—he still struggled with my criticisms about Muslim countries’ treatment of women. When I once referred to clitoridectomies as a Muslim practice, he became positively apoplectic that I viewed the procedure as a Muslim norm. After all, no one in his family had undergone such a procedure.
But I persisted. As an earnest young feminist, I couldn’t help but want to have a conversation about the political and personal oppression of women in Muslim countries, an oppression quite often manifested in violence. I needed to know that it mattered to him and that he recognized it as a social ill that needed rectifying.
He would counter these observations by pointing out that his uncle, who was doing his residency at a local Philadelphia hospital, treated battered women all the time. Battered women here, battered women in the Middle East. What was the difference? A Culture’s Intentions Matter
Sadly enough, I struggled with that one. After all, he had a point. With or without prohibitive legislation, the abuse of women happens everywhere. What was the difference?
Implicit within that question lies another more general question about law: Of what value is a law to a country if the behavioral outcome in its society is no different from those in countries without such a law? For it is an obvious truth that a society that legislates against certain behaviors doesn’t eradicate them by doing so. It may not even diminish those behaviors to an appreciable degree.
After a lengthy consideration, I eventually arrived at the conclusion that, although justice may often elude us, the law has an essential value. This is that a society, through its laws, is declaring something fundamental about itself, something equal in importance to the efficacy of the law. Legislation makes explicit a culture’s intentions .
Now let’s return for a moment to the issue of battered women. In the West, after hundreds of years of fierce debate concerning women’s status in society, most people now agree that a woman’s safety and wellbeing should not be left to the mercy of the men into whose hands fate has delivered her. Rather, we have come to believe that, as autonomous beings with equal rights, women should be afforded the protections of the state—protections equal to those of men.
Thus, in the developed world, women have recourse to the law, which means an opportunity for some degree of justice if those rights are infringed. That’s one layer of value to the law—deterrence and punishment—which ideally increases the safety of all members of a society.
In addition, it’s essential to appreciate that, in our culture, the law represents shared intentions—the general population’s agreement to a set of desired social norms we elect representatives to codify. The progression from tribal customs to written legal codes was thousands of years in the making, and for most of that time law was a top-down affair, instituted by tribal leaders and kings.
In contrast, our historical moment is unique in that each member of our society contributes to the formation of that code with his or her vote. But the important point here is that it’s these shared beliefs that are the foundation upon which the law is predicated. Our laws reflect who we want to be as a society, and they derive from values we hold in common (despite a cacophony of arguing voices) and which, it is no exaggeration to say, form the foundation of our entire world. We Should Ask Hard Questions When Values Conflict
The tricky part is when our values appear to conflict. Those are the issues that need to be on the table, and this is why asking the hard questions of each other—and especially our legislators—is essential.
The abortion debate concerns the very definition of life; the issues surrounding homosexuality give rise to fundamental questions about sexual and marital freedom, and perhaps even whether there is such a thing as truly private choices. We need to debate these issues thoroughly and not hold back for fear of offending people so that we fully understand the implications of our positions. This we definitely don’t, as evidenced by the readiness with which we align ourselves with certain popular trends in order to be “nice” or “accommodating.”
For instance, we might think it’s “nice” and “supportive” to don a head scarf on World Hijab Day, but those who do are like Marie Antoinette playing at being a shepherdess, merely play-acting. After the day is over, we can take off our scarf and return to our wide-ranging freedoms. But in Iran, women are arrested for removing theirs.
Here, it’s a game of dress-up; over there it’s a matter of imprisonment and torture. It might make us feel open-minded to support the ideas of all cultures, but some of these ideas clash irremediably with the foundational values of our republic. We must face this head-on.
Take, for instance, the photo of endlessly accommodating Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attending a gay pride event wearing socks adorned with “Eid Mubarek” in honor of the last day of Ramadan. He was trying to have it both ways, when that is impossible. His performance, intended to be culturally generous, was instead a superficial display of deeply contradictory values.
Homosexuality is punishable by death under Islamic Sharia law, as we’re now hearing trumpeted from Brunei . It’s one or the other, not both. We need to be honest about these contradictions, and define with clarity what our real values are. Otherwise, by blindly following the herd, we might be chipping away at our own foundations.
This is why the uproar over Jeanine Pirro’s recent Fox News opinion segment, in which she posed questions regarding Rep. Ilhan Omar’s allegiances, was a mistake. We must ask people about their belief systems. Doing so is bringing their fundamental values into light, which especially matters when dealing with elected representatives.
Otherwise, even something that appears to be bedrock to our polity, such as equality under the law, becomes vulnerable to extinction. This work is what the Founders were referring to when they said the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. It means embracing—and even engaging in—that cacophony, even when it’s shrill.

Why Are Democrats Kissing The Ring Of Al Sharpton?,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/why-are-democrats-kissing-the-ring-of-al-sharpton/,"By David Harsanyi April 8, 2019
Rev. Al Sharpton’s fortunes have been on the upswing. A few years ago, in a Politico whitewashing of his career, we learned that Sharpton had been transformed into the go-to civil rights guru for the Obama administration. “If anything,” Glenn Thrush noted at the time , “the Ferguson crisis has underscored Sharpton’s role as the national black leader Obama leans on most, a remarkable personal and political transformation for a man once regarded with suspicion and disdain by many in his own party.”
The former president claimed that Sharpton was “the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden.” In the real world, of course, the only downtrodden Americans helped by Sharpton’s activities are the ones who find themselves on the payroll benefitting from his numerous corporate shakedowns .
Yet apparently Obama’s resuscitation of Sharpton (who, since 2011, has been at MSNBC, a cable news network that interminably lectures uncouth Americans on proper tone) has worked. Many of the very same Democratic Party hopefuls who boycotted the tepid bipartisanship of an AIPAC conference last month could be found speaking at Sharpton’s National Action Network Convention in New York this past week, pandering to a charlatan with a history of inciting violence and racism.
Texas politician Beto O’Rourke, who this week accused 12-year Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being a “ racist ” and a false leader of Israelis, was there, obsequiously telling Sharpton he would support a study on reparations. He wasn’t alone. Many of the people who had recently defended anti-Semite Ilhan Omar—Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, among others—were yucking with a guy who once said , “We taught philosophy and astrology [sic] and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around to it.”
Sharpton most famously threw an entire city into turmoil in 1987 when he cynically exploited the hoax of a black teen named Tawana Brawley—who claimed to have been raped, kidnapped, smeared with feces, and left wrapped in a plastic bag by a group of white men in Dutchess County, New York—for attention. To the surprise of absolutely no one, a state grand jury would find that her claims had been fabricated, perhaps as a way of avoiding punishment from her dad for staying out late.
When Sharpton and Brawley lost their defamation suits, it would not be the founder and president of the National Action Network Convention who would struggle. After 26 years, Brawley was the one who couldn’t pay her debt .
Then again, ruined lives are strewn across Sharpton’s career. Maybe Democrats need to be reminded that Sharpton used a tragic 1991 car accident to incite a four-day race riot in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Or maybe they just don’t care. It was Sharpton who stoked anger over the imaginary nexus between “Tel Aviv” and “South Africa” and the “diamond merchants right here.” After the Jewish community protested, Sharpton said, “Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house.”
But, of course, Sharpton’s bejeweled and rotund frame was, as always, hiding behind bodyguards. It was his mob that took over. And one man who forgot to pin back his yarmulke was Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year old Orthodox Jew visiting from Australia who, after turning down a wrong street, was dragged from his car to the shouts of “Kill the Jews!” by throngs of angry protesters and stabbed to death. Never once has Sharpton shown any remorse for his role in this bloodletting.
When, in 1995, Fred Harari, a Jewish sub-tenant who operated a store called Freddie’s Fashion Mart, evicted his own sub-tenant, a black-owned record store owner, Sharpton, who told the protesters, “We will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business,” saw another opportunity to provoke chaos.
Never mind that it had been a black Pentecostal church that had asked Harari to evict the record store owner. If you’re inclined, you can listen to his ceaseless race-baiting and anti-Semitism that Sharpton allowed, and engaged in, on his show day in and out. The venomous protests, fueled in part by his show and his presence, soon began to resemble a mob. When Roland Smith Jr. went in with a gun, he asked all the black patrons to leave before he killed everyone else. The “white interloper,” as Sharpton perceptively predicted, “did not expand his business in Harlem.”
Never once, as far as I can tell, have any of his didactic colleagues on cable news asked him about these career highlights. Not once did a reporter ask any of the presidential candidates about Sharpton’s history.
As a native New Yorker, I hold a grudge. That doesn’t mean others can’t forgive Sharpton for the horrible things he’s done. It’s something else, however, when a remorseless man with a history of hucksterism and cruelty is not only being flattered as national moral leader by presidential candidates but that those same politicians are being given a free pass as they kowtow to a reprehensible character.

Parliament Is Betraying Brexit By Postponing It Indefinitely,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/parliament-betraying-brexit-postponing-indefinitely/,"By Sumantra Maitra April 8, 2019
In a couple of recent long-form articles, I explained what led to Brexit , and what might await Brexit . In sum, we’re stuck in this purgatory until Brexit is either diluted beyond recognition or revoked after a second, or possibly a third, referendum.
The nationalist-conservative reaction that started against a borderless, transnational, technocratic union is being stealthily stifled by a bunch of craven technocrats. Sadly, that it is happening under a “nominally” conservative government, the same party of Winston Churchill, Viscount Palmerston, and the Duke of Wellington, after what was arguably the biggest ever mass voting in entire British history. Accusations of racism and xenophobia followed, as well as another Russian collusion narrative. Of course, it’s not proven . But the “resistance” was in motion.
Brexit provided Britain a historic opportunity. Those in the United Kingdom have always viewed the European Union skeptically. Margaret Thatcher outlined British skepticism of the European project in 1988, even when idealists in the Euro-Atlantic were looking for an end of history.
Speaking to the European who’s who in Bruges , she said, “To try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the centre of a European conglomerate would be highly damaging and would jeopardise the objectives we seek to achieve. Europe will be stronger precisely because it has France as France, Spain as Spain, Britain as Britain, each with its own customs, traditions and identity. It would be folly to try to fit them into some sort of identikit European personality.”
She was farsighted. For all the idealism in the world, Thatcher understood that open borders in Europe would inevitably mean the erosion of sovereignty, and the end of nation-states in favor of a European Empire ruled by technocratic elites.
In 2016, Britons were given a choice: to leave the EU or remain in the EU. Despite the overwhelming elite interest in remaining in the European Union, Britons voted leave. But as Michael Brendan Dougherty summarized , there was no intention for anyone among the ruling elites in the United Kingdom to implement that result.
There was no Leave party, and an overwhelming majority of the parliamentarians favored economic stability over aspirations of independence. The bank of England, liberal media, majority of the academia, and almost all the bureaucrats favored remaining in the EU. They simply chose to ignore the result, and slowly and subtly erode the voters’ mandate.
British Prime Minister Theresa May was a Remainer during the Leave EU referendum, with no wish to follow the referendum’s verdict, and too myopic to understand that the British might choose to leave, and consider sovereignty and independence to be of higher importance than a steady supply of French cheese. One of the hearsay anecdotes concerns when May headed to India to secure a bilateral deal immediately after Brexit.
The fifth-largest world economy, an allied country with deep historical ties with Britain, welcomed May, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met her. May started with the complaint that some Indian students at British universities are under the wrong visa. Imagine that for a moment: an embattled PM visiting a bigger economy asking for a trade deal, in front of a circle of bemused and flabbergasted foreign policy makers of an allied nation, started a small talk about students overstaying visas.
If that was not the first clue of her remarkable consensus-building prowess, May started with a “ novel negotiating strategy ” of giving the EU everything before even their negotiation started. The Parliament essentially took the “No Deal” option off the table, thereby removing any incentive of a deal from the EU.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently tweeted that he was willing to give the UK a bilateral deal. Rightfully pouring scorn on the idea of another, second Brexit referendum, Trump said, “We can do a very big trade deal with the UK. We are also re-negotiating our trade deal with the European groups and literally individual nations.”
There’s no other way of poetically phrasing it, no other form of academic nuance, no obfuscating the fact, no traditional British politeness about it: Trump is right about Brexit, and the current British “conservative” PM is wrong. She’s disastrously wrong, possibly deliberately so. And if Trump were in charge of negotiations, maybe things would be different in the UK.
During their first meeting, Trump offered May a bilateral deal then and there. May, of course, started gabbing about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Having lived and succeeded in London, a completely sclerotic political atmosphere, for the last 20 years, she who was once compared to Margaret Thatcher was simply unprepared to realize that Trump was actually an ally and leverage against the EU.
A cynic would not hesitate to explain her meager small talk capabilities, euarthropodian charisma, and phenomenally atrocious political acumen via anything other than clinical reasons. Now the elites of the country and the Remain backing institutions—the liberal media, and the left-wing activists—have decided to delay Brexit until a deal is reached.
There are of course strong arguments against shooting oneself in the foot, like Brexit could arguably be for Britain. Direct democracy is not good, and plebiscitary instincts are guided by emotions and therefore should be rejected. But that was never the choice once the vote was over.
The credibility of any democracy relies on the acceptance of a result. Otherwise, the whole process turns farcical. What we saw in the last two years in the United States, with a section of sore losers attempting to deny the legitimacy of the 2016 election, is in exact replay in the UK with regards to the legitimacy of the 2016 referendum. Only in Britain it is far more successful.
As it now stands, Parliament has decided that it will seek an extension from the European Union and extend the deadline for leaving. The No Deal option is taken off the table preemptively. Therefore under no circumstances will Britain just walk away, which essentially means surrendering to the EU, as the EU has the upper hand knowing that Brits will continue to extend, as no British parliament would have the guts to go to the World Trade Organization. It also means diluting Brexit up until a possible eventual cancellation. The largest mandate in British electoral history is being just completely ignored.
In London there is a statue of St George slaying the dragon in front of the Lords stadium, with nothing other than 1914-1919 and 1939-1945 encrypted in the grey stone. For a land that once saw off the Spanish Armada, Napoleon, and Hitler to not manage to walk away from this televised humiliation is worse than shameful—it is perplexing. This is what happens to any civilization that has forgotten its own history, is full of narcissistic elites fixated on only the economy, for whom sovereign aspiration is the ultimate curse.

Howard Schultz Needs An Issue To Run On,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/howard-schultz-needs-issue-run/,"April 8, 2019 By David Marcus
Howard Schultz needs an issue. The former Starbucks CEO who spent most of his career amping up Americans on burnt coffee wants to now be their president. But why? In a town hall on Fox News last week, he couldn’t quite answer that question. He takes a “pox on both your houses” approach to the Trumpian GOP and the Democrats he says have wandered too far left. But so far, his candidacy seems to be based on little more than being the other choice.
In some ways, Schultz feels like the missing Democrat. He says, “I’m a centrist, I’ve been a lifelong Democrat, but the Democratic Party left me, I didn’t leave them.” He supports funding Immigration and Customs Enforcement, opposes Medicare for all, and dares to utter the phrase “safe, legal, and rare,” regarding abortion. As the Democratic nominee for president, he would be formidable, but he is not choosing to join that race that resembles nothing so much as a bunch of 1950s teenagers cramming into a telephone booth.
Instead, Schultz is chasing the white whale of American politics: trying to win the presidency as a third-party candidate. This never works, and it’s easy to see why. By granting executive authority to a single person, the Constitution compels the left and the right to form binary parties. This is because to fracture your own party hands enormous power to those you oppose. Schultz likely understands that he is almost certainly not going to win the 2020 election. So what is he doing?
The gold standard of third-party candidacies is H. Ross Perot’s stunning run in 1992. Although he did not carry a state, he won almost 20 percent of the popular vote, and likely greased the skids into Bill Clinton’s presidency. In some respects, Schultz and Perot are similar. Both are successful businessmen, both take on the role of the outsider. But there is a key difference. Perot had an issue that defined him.
That issue was trade — the great sucking sound of jobs going to Mexico. It was the one note that he pounded over and over and over again, and it resonated. In fact, even though Perot never became president, a one-time member of his Reform Party did, and Donald Trump’s presidency looks a lot like what Perot promised. So in losing, Perot didn’t really lose, he just primed the pump for someone who could win.
On trade, Perot had one enormous advantage. In 1992 the leadership of both the Republican and Democratic parties were basically free-trade globalists. They saw how much money was to be made, and in the 1990s that money was made, and they didn’t want to get in the way. It was a bipartisan Congress and a Democratic president that signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law. So Perot really had the economic protectionist lane all to himself.
Schultz needs an issue like that, something where he is opposing both parties. But it’s difficult to see what that might be. The Democrats and Republicans are much farther apart now than they were in 1992, so to find a point of common ground that can be exploited seems almost impossible. It could be something like the national debt, an issue both parties can take blame for, but that’s not a sexy issue. Hearing about the national debt is like hearing your grandmother say she cheated on your grandfather. It’s bad, but mostly you just want her stop talking about it.
So where does this put Schultz? He had a bit of a media barrage last weekend that will extend into this week. But what is he really doing? He does come off as someone who would be a pretty decent and effective president, but that doesn’t matter. Unless he can find an issue that sets him against both parties, that makes him the man we need, he will fizzle into the sub one percentile.
Does the issue he needs exist? Maybe. But I have no idea what it might be. If he actually wants to run for president, Schultz needs to figure out what it is.

Christianity Answers Barbara Bush’s Questions About When Life Begins,thefederalist.com,Holly Scheer,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/christianity-answers-barbara-bushs-questions-about-when-life-begins/,"By Holly Scheer April 8, 2019
Newly released details from her personal papers reveal that former first lady Barbara Bush laid out her thoughts on abortion in the 1980s, while her husband was running for president for the first time. She did not release these personal musings for publication during her life, nor share them in any of her many press interviews.
These opinions on abortion came to light when Susan Page was given permission to read through Bush’s private papers as Page researched a biography. Bush’s diaries and papers were donated to the presidential library named after her husband, meant to be held in reserve and privacy until 35 years after her death.
Page was allowed to make notes of what she read, but not photograph the content. She was to meet with Bush again to discuss her research in these archives, but Bush fell and later died before they could.
Bush’s thoughts on abortion centered on whether unborn babies have souls: “When does the soul enter the body is the #1 question. Not when does life begin, as life begins in a flower or an animal with the first cell. So the question is does the life begin (soul entering the body) at conception or at the moment the first breath is taken? If the answer to that question is at conception, then abortion is murder. If the answer to that question is the moment the first breath is taken, then abortion is not murder.” Christianity Definitely Teaches that Souls Exist Before Birth
The question of when the soul enters the body is an important one to Christians and faithful believers of many other religions. Parents, grandparents, and other people close by when a baby has died in stillbirth or miscarriage are often deeply concerned about this when they ask if their dear baby is in Heaven. In Bush’s musings on whether abortion is murder, she reportedly did not consider these children, their fate, nor the distress the idea of unborn babies being soulless would cause families.
The Bible isn’t silent on this point, though. Rather, through the ages, people have had the hope of salvation and an eternal reunion because of the words written about the faith of the unborn. In a long work about unborn children and those who pass away before they are able to be baptized, the famous theologian Martin Luther said: “[O]ne must leave such situations to God and take comfort in the thought that he surely has heard our unspoken yearning and done all things better than we could have asked.”
The Bible’s Luke 1 records the virgin Mary’s visit to her cousin Elizabeth, who was pregnant then with the prophet John. In faith, the unborn John leaps in his mother’s womb at meeting his also unborn Lord: “And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”
The Catholic Church points to the faith of the preborn John the Baptist in “ Evangelium Vitae ,” a Catholic discourse on the importance of life at all stages, and how children before birth can have saving faith: “the value of the person from the moment of conception is celebrated in the meeting between the Virgin Mary and Elizabeth, and between the two children whom they are carrying in the womb. It is precisely the children who reveal the advent of the Messianic age: in their meeting, the redemptive power of the presence of the Son of God among men first becomes operative.”
Neither Mary, the mother of Jesus, nor Elizabeth believed that they were bearing soulless babies, waiting to be born to become fully human. These babies were clearly ensouled and conscious beings while still within their mothers’ wombs.
The Old Testament also addresses God’s plan for the unborn in Psalm 139: “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.”
Even clearer is Psalm 22: “From birth I was cast on you; from my mother’s womb you have been my God.” Bush Is Welcome to Muse, But She Didn’t Hit on the Truth
It is clear that Barbara Bush formed her feelings about abortion with little knowledge about what the Bible says about the soul. Very likely, personal tragedy also played a role. The Bushes tragically lost a three-year-old daughter to cancer, and that loss weighed into her writing on this subject.
Of this loss, Bush wrote: “Judging from both the birth and death of Robin Bush, I have decided that that almost religious experience, that thin line between birth, the first breath that she took, was when the soul, the spirit, that special thing that separates man or woman from animals + plants entered her little body. I was conscious at her birth and I was with her at her death. (As was G.B.) An even stronger impression remains with me of that moment, 27 years ago [when she died]. Of course, extreme grief, but that has softened. I vividly remember that split second, that thin line between breathing and not breathing, the complete knowledge that her soul had left and only the body remained.”
There is grief here that as a mother myself I want to respect and not minimize, but also as a mother I have to note that each of my children has been just as vibrantly alive, as different from a plant or an animal, before they were born as after. The moments before a baby is born when a mother can feel them moving, where it’s clear that they’re responding to touch, to sound, to spicy food or too much caffeine, makes it very difficult for me to understand not seeing them as people.
Each of my children had clear and different personalities before they were born, being calmer or more restless, more active or sleepy, and those traits follow them as children and teens now. The moment they were born didn’t change them into people—they were people already. So this experience is available to mothers of children, even those who don’t believe in Christianity like many in the Bush family profess to have.
Bush also thought the poor should have access to abortion: “What do I feel about abortion? Having decided that the first breath is when the soul enters the body, I believe in Federally funded abortion. Why should the rich be allowed to afford abortions and the poor not?”
Page notes that Bush’s feelings include a limit on abortions at 12 weeks, but that she didn’t feel this was a “presidential issue” and thought “Abortion is personal, between mother fathers and Dr.”
In language that would now be very anti-feminist, Bush also notes her possible solution: “Education is the answer. I believe that we must give people goals in life for them to work for—Teach them the price you must pay for being promiscuous.” Finally, she also included this subject, “Needs lots more thought.” Whether she thought more about this later and wrote those thoughts down, we will have to wait to learn for the rest of her papers to become public, in 2053.
Bush’s thoughts on this were likely deeply tied to the difficult and painful experience of losing a child. However, her thoughts in no way mirror Christian teaching or the experience of many mothers with their unborn children’s personalities.
The unborn hear, they are formed and planned by God, and can have saving faith. All of this means they have souls. Since it’s the very lack of soul that Bush hinged her conclusion on, her ideas form a flawed and misguided apologetic for abortion. Holly Scheer is a writer and editor.

TV Star Rachel Riley Points Out Dangers To Left Of Letting Anti-Semitism Fester,thefederalist.com,Erielle Davidson,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/tv-star-rachel-riley-points-dangers-left-letting-anti-semitism-fester/,"By Erielle Davidson April 8, 2019
Last Wednesday, British GQ released an interview with television personality Rachel Riley. Riley, regarded in the United Kingdom as “television’s best-known mathematician,” has quickly been pulled to the forefront of British politics as one of the U.K.’s most vocal critics of Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour Party’s alleged culture of anti-Semitism.
Riley’s interview was particularly poignant given the tremendous amount of harassment the television star has been subjected after daring to criticize Labour’s growing anti-Semitism problem, which many supporters of Labour allege to be a fabricated smear. Some episodes have been chronicled here and here. The incidents range from Corbyn’s appearance at the funeral honoring anti-Semitic terrorists to a litany of unsavory social media activity from various Labour members of Parliament (MPs).
In response to the downward trend, almost a dozen Labour MPs defected as a result of what they call Labour’s “repeated fail[ure] to address hatred of Jewish people within its ranks.” As one leading defector, Luciana Berger, put it , it’s not quite that Corbyn is anti-Semitic, it is rather that he has “been responsible for sharing platforms with anti-Semites and saying things that are highly offensive and anti-Semitic.” In doing the latter, arguably one inevitably becomes the former.
It is in the midst this environment that Riley, a mathematician by trade, has become an ally of those seeking to expose the Labour Party’s pernicious culture. Her interview spans a variety of topics, from Labour blunders to feminism, and her frank assessment of Corbynism offers a stiff wake-up call to those on the American left still confident that the electorate will accept anti-Semitic rhetoric.
Conducted by Alastair Campbell, a journalist and former spokesman for Tony Blair, the interview traces Riley’s recent foray into the political arena, where she has transformed into an accidental hero of the anti-Corbyn movement. Riley Is the Moderate Critic Labour Needs
Formerly apolitical and self-labeled “in the middle,” Riley strikes viewers as a levelheaded third-party observer of what could only be described as political chaos. Her disgust towards the unfolding anti-Semitism crisis in Corbyn’s Labour Party is genuine, only made more sincere by the fact that, for most of her professional life, she has remained largely on the sidelines of U.K. politics.
She does not support Brexit. She loves the Obamas. Indeed, with a light chuckle, she confesses that she has voted for three different parties in her lifetime.
When Campbell asks where she believes anti-Semitism comes from, Riley’s initial response is marked by a sincere innocence: “I didn’t think it was around anymore.” To someone fairly removed from the Jewish community, this response might be reasonable, although it is worth acknowledging that anti-Semitic hate incidents have steadily been rising in the U.K. Riley’s mother is Jewish, and Riley identifies as an atheist, although she admits that her recent commentary on anti-Semitism has resulted in her forging stronger ties to the Jewish community.
What makes Riley’s interview most remarkable is that she captures the problem of Corbyn with incisive precision, of which even the most seasoned political journalists seem brazenly ignorant. The central issue with Corbyn is not whether he hates Jews (although that is staggeringly relevant) but rather, whether he willingly allows pervasive anti-Semitism to fester within his own party:
I couldn’t give a monkey’s if he [Corbyn] is an anti-Semite or not himself because the environment he supports, the environment he’s encouraging the stuff that people are doing in his name, is vile. So whether or not he says he’s an anti-Semite, he’s allowing this to happen, he’s condoning it, he’s taught people … that it’s a smear … So I couldn’t care less if he’s got friends who are Jewish or he doesn’t think that he’s an anti-Semite. It means nothing to me because he’s fostering an environment that is really hostile to Jews. Does Corbyn Have ‘Empathy’ for Palestine?
Riley goes on to criticize Corbyn’s exploitation of the Palestinian cause, suggesting it is entirely possible the leader is championing Palestinian issues to forward his potentially anti-Jewish agenda. She concedes that she originally thought Corbyn’s anti-Semitic behavior came from “misplaced anger” stemming from “empathy” for the Palestinian cause. But Riley admits she believes it to be genuine anti-Semitism “driving [Corbyn’s] obsession with Israel” and that “the Palestinian cause happens to help that.”
She points directly to the fact that Corbyn is indifferent to human rights issues outside of Israel, noting that Corbyn is “very selective about when he decides to choose human rights to support which fit his world view or ideology.”
Riley’s understanding of Corbyn should be a warning sign for American Democrats who have relied heavily on the notion that their left-leaning electorate will remain largely silent in the face of ethnic hatred, as long as it is directed at Jews. Riley’s admission that she would vote Tory (conservative) in the next election on the basis of the Labour Party’s anti-Semitism offers a sharp lesson to the American left, who will face this future if they do not take steps to sharply condemn the Jewish hatred that has become the calling cards of their progressive ranks.
For now, Riley’s approach offers a blueprint for those who care deeply about a social problem but feel stifled by their apolitical backgrounds. As Riley says, “politics is supposed to be about making your society, your community, better,” emphasizing that “you don’t need to go into politics to make a difference.” Indeed, as Riley has done, you simply need to speak up.

We Hide The Truth About Abortion Because It Condemns Us All,thefederalist.com,Noelle Mering,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/hide-truth-abortion-condemns-us/,"April 8, 2019 By Noelle Mering
There’s a powerful scene in “Breaking Bad” at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting where Jesse Pinkman, plagued with guilt over having murdered a man (but unable to admit it) “confesses” to having heartlessly killed a dog instead. When one woman in the group expresses shock and disgust, she is quickly quieted by the group leader and told not to judge.
The leader’s words, while well-meaning, are abrasively inadequate in the face of Jesse’s sorrow. Jesse responds, “If you just do stuff and nothing happens, what’s it all mean? What’s the point? Oh right, this whole thing is just about self-acceptance?… So, I should stop judging and accept? So no matter what I do, hooray for me because I’m a great guy?”
We are a culture awash in self-acceptance. But human nature being what it is, we are also a people awash in guilt. We betray, we use other people, we tell lies to ourselves and to others, we are selfish and egotistical. Without a cultural vocabulary to put this guilt in its proper context, our only recourse is to deny that it’s there. This is seldom more apparent than in the way we speak of—and try not to speak of—abortion.
With the abortion tally close to 60 million at this point, almost no one can say he or she has not been in proximate or remote connection to one. Countless people go through life with the guilt of having been complicit in some way, either by accompanying, encouraging, abandoning, or undergoing an abortion.
The reason gang initiations, especially murderous ones, happen is because complicity is a powerful tool. You are in this tribe now, united in the blood of guilt. Complicity distorts our reason, perverts our objectivity, and leaves us with misplaced, irrational loyalties. It also makes us recoil when others state obvious truths. There’s nothing more offensive than hearing the truth we are trying to silence in ourselves.
We don’t want to face abortion. We generally ignore the March for Life despite it growing larger and younger. When the movie “Unplanned” came out, it was given an R rating and Twitter suspended its account. Other outlets simply refused to advertise it.
It is a hard and horrifying movie to watch, not because it is excessive, but because abortion is hard and horrifying. We know there is more there than “products of conception,” and that what is at stake is of greater consequence than the mere timing of our motherhood. But because we are all so complicit we have to pretend it is not what it is.
One striking scene in the movie is in the recovery room. Rows of young women in pink hospital gowns sit hollowed out, drugged, and despondent while a teenager next to them hemorrhages, close to death. We are like those poor young women—oblivious to the reality around us, barely able to acknowledge our own pain much less that of our neighbor.
Before she became awakened to the humanity of the unborn, “Unplanned” heroine Abby Johnson was complicit in tens of thousands of abortions, two her own. But no one who knows the truth about abortion looks at Johnson and sees her guilt, because her courage is so bright. She found the way out, not just out of the abortion industry, but out of her own guilt.
Confronted with his despair, Pinkman also sensed there would be only one way out if there was to be a way at all. It isn’t the thin compassion of generic self-acceptance, a teaspoon in the face of a flood. Nor is it despair. Instead, it’s the courage to look at wrongdoing plainly, acknowledge it, confess it, beg forgiveness, and shine a light so that others might see their way out as well.
It is painful to hear a hard truth that we’re trying to silence in ourselves. It’s much more painful to sustain the lie.

Eric Swalwell Claims Kids Live In A Bullet-Riddled Dystopia. The Opposite Is True,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/09/kids-are-safer-healthier-than-ever/,"By David Harsanyi April 9, 2019
“First, we must address the single greatest threat to young Americans’ lives: gun violence,” Rep. Eric Swalwell explained in an essay laying out the reasons for his vanity presidential run. “It is astonishing and unacceptable that we have let school massacres become part of daily life.”
In the real world, guns aren’t even in the vicinity of being the “single greatest threat” in the lives of young people. And school massacres are a rare event that the vast majority of American children will, luckily, never experience—other than those moments when adults subject them to another traumatizing and useless shooting drill or politicians tell them they are in constant mortal danger.
Kids, in fact, are safer and healthier in contemporary America than they’ve ever been in our history. Almost all the data offered by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other studies regarding the lives of children is trending in a positive direction.
Putting shootings in context isn’t the same as dismissing them. It’s undeniable that horrifying mass shootings have a bigger impression on the American psyche than the random firearm crimes that actually drive the homicide rate. There’s an inherent evil in the act of a mass shooting that is incomprehensible for any normal person to process. That’s no excuse for the cynical exploitation of these events.
There’s also no doubt that it’s difficult to debate the problem in good faith, mostly because people keep changing the definition of “mass shooting” to serve their political bias. But even if we take the most liberal definition of the phrase, mass shootings are “ one of the rarest mortality risks imaginable, ” as Cato’s Alan Reynolds has pointed out .
From 1982 to early 2018, mass shootings accounted for around 23 deaths per year. Not kids; all deaths. An American has a far higher chance of drowning in a swimming pool (3,500 per year) or perishing on a bike (over 700) or being punched, knifed, or kicked to death (over 1,800.) To put it in perspective: right now, there are around 42 million young people between the ages of 10 and 19 in the country.
If you want to talk about a greatest threat to American mortality, you should be talking about the 250,000 people—or 10 percent of all deaths—in the United States that can likely be attributed to medical mistakes, according to a recent Johns Hopkins study .
If kids should be petrified about anything, it’s getting into a car with parents who are taking them to a hospital for routine surgery. If parents should be scared of anything, it’s the mental health of their kids. Child suicide rates have been slightly rising over the past few years. Yet, more young people from the ages of 15-24 (the CDC has this age group as a data set, which doesn’t really tell the full story because deaths skew towards the young adults rather than the teens) die from “unintentional poisoning”—or drug overdoses—than gun homicides or suicides.
Now, a lot of people like to conflate suicide deaths with gun homicides for political purposes. There have been a number of efforts trying to convince you that the suicide rate, not particularly high in the United States, is a product of gun culture. Yet many nations with far higher reported suicide rates—South Korea, Japan, Hungary, Finland—also have strict firearm restrictions. If guns were the driving factor, why did firearm-related suicides and homicides precipitously drop from the 1990s to the mid-2010s, exactly when gun ownership exploded ?
All deaths among 10- to 19-year-olds, accidental or not, have declined almost 50 percent between 1999 and 2013. The rate ticked up slightly from 2013 to 2016, mirroring a national trend for adults. The majority of the increase in deaths for 17- to 19-year-olds was driven by car crashes, poisoning, and drowning.
Even schools are safer now than they were in the ’90s, and school shootings are less common than they used to be, according to researchers at Northeastern.
None of this is to say that every death isn’t a tragedy or that we shouldn’t come up with reasonable methods to try and curb criminality. The problem is that American politicians, in an effort to gain power, like to act as if we live in a dystopian world of murder and mayhem when really the opposite is true.
Swalwell isn’t a serious candidate, but in many ways he’s the embodiment of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s leftist position that people should be more concerned with what is “morally right” than “factually correct.” His intent is to scare Americans so he can push a ban on guns.
“I’m the only candidate calling for a mandatory national ban and buyback of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons,” Swalwell writes. “It’s bold and will cost money, but it is constitutional and it rightly treats gun violence as a life-or-death matter. Our children deserve better than an attempt to reduce or contain gun violence. Our goal must be to end it.”
“Military-style semiautomatic assault weapons” is a neologism without any meaning. The vast majority of citizens do not have access to anything resembling a “military-style assault weapon.” One imagines that the semiautomatic assault weapons Swalwell is referring to are the AR-15s, which are rarely used in crimes and never by the military.
Not only would it be an infringement on a constitutional right to ban— the Heller decision found that the Second Amendment protected weapons “in common use by law-abiding citizens;” the AR-15, the most popular rifle in America, clearly meets this criteria—it would do little to nothing to stop homicides. In 2017, the last year of FBI data , there were 7,105 Americans murdered by handguns and 374 by all rifles (only a fraction of which were AR-15s.) More people were killed by fists.
The relative safety most Americans enjoy in their everyday lives happens to be an inconvenient reality in politics. That is why one of the most controversial things you can tell people these days is: Hey, things aren’t that bad. David Harsanyi is a Senior Editor at The Federalist.

Nancy Pelosi Changes Her Opinion Depending On Who The President Is,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/nancy-pelosi-changes-opinion-presidents-powers-depending-president/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 10, 2019
At their swearing in, members of Congress take an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Few members would openly admit to violating that oath. Nancy Pelosi just did.
In filing a lawsuit against Donald Trump’s border emergency late last week, the House speaker claimed that “the House will once again defend our democracy and our Constitution, this time in the courts.” But the facts demonstrate that the last time the House defended the Constitution in the courts, Pelosi actively worked to undermine that defense of constitutional principles.
Having clearly been on both sides of the issue , Pelosi violated her constitutional duty when she said the House had no business going to court to defend its “power of the purse”—or she violated her duty last week, when she sent the House to court to do just that. Whichever side of the argument one favors, she abrogated her pledge of fidelity to constitutional first principles—as opposed to the raw exercise of political power. Lawsuits, Then and Now
The complaint Pelosi filed last week claims that, in using the National Emergencies Act to redirect funds towards border security, President Trump violated both underlying statutes and Congress’ constitutional duty to appropriate funds. Unfortunately, however, as I pointed out at the time of the border declaration, it did not represent the first time the executive has violated both statutes and Congress’ appropriations power.
The text of Obamacare did not contain an appropriation for cost-sharing subsidies, which offset discounts on co-pays and deductibles provided to low-income individuals. The Obama administration requested funds for those subsidies, just as Trump requested funds for border security. In both cases, Congress turned down those requests—and in both cases, the executive concocted legal arguments to spend the funds anyway.
But when the House of Representatives sued in 2014 seeking to block President Obama’s unconstitutional appropriation of funds, did Pelosi—who claimed last week to “defend our democracy and our Constitution”—support the complaint? Quite the contrary. In fact, she filed two legal briefs in court objecting to the House’s suit, and claiming that Obamacare implied an appropriation for the cost-sharing subsidies. Abrogating Congress’ Institutional Prerogatives
But put the specific facts of the two cases aside. It seems a stretch for this observer, but assume for a moment that one can squint hard enough and find an appropriation for the cost-sharing subsidies in Obamacare, but not a legal justification for President Trump’s border security declaration. Would Pelosi’s statements, if not totally consistent, at least contain enough of a good-faith argument not to represent a violation of her constitutional duty?
In a word, no. In the Obamacare lawsuit, she not only attacked House Republicans’ claims regarding the merits of their case, she attacked the House’s right to bring the claim against the executive in court.
When it comes to whether the House has suffered an injury allowing it to file suit, compare this language in the House’s lawsuit against Trump: “The House has been injured, and will continue to be injured, by defendants’ unlawful actions, which, among other things, usurp the House’s legislative authority,” with Pelosi’s claims in her brief regarding the Obamacare lawsuit:
Legislators’ allegations that a member of the executive branch has not complied with a statutory requirement do not establish the sort of “concrete and particularized” injury sufficient to satisfy Article III’s standing requirements….
[Permitting the House’s suit] would disturb long-settled and well-established practices by which the political branches mediate interpretive disputes about the meaning of federal law, and it would encourage political factions within Congress to advance political agendas by embroiling the courts in innumerable political disputes that are appropriately resolved using those long-established practices….Allowing suit in this case undermines, rather than advances, [Members’ institutional] interests—inevitably subjecting Congress to judicial second-guessing never contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution and compounding opportunities for legislative obstruction in ways that could greatly increase congressional dysfunction.
Also compare Pelosi’s language when talking about remedies available to the House with regards to Trump: “The House has no adequate or available administrative remedy, and/or any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile,” with her claims that House Republicans had all sorts of options available to them to stop President Obama’s unconstitutional payments, short of going to court:
Concluding that there is standing in this case is…completely unnecessary given alternative and more appropriate tools available to legislators to object to executive branch actions that they view as inconsistent with governing law….
To start, legislators may always challenge executive action by enacting corrective legislation that either prohibits the disputed executive action or clarifies the limits or conditions on such action….Further, Congress has other means to challenge disputed interpretive policies, including many that do not require the concurrence of both houses. For example, Congress can hold oversight hearings, initiate legislative proceedings, engage in investigations, and, of course, appeal to the public.
One really cannot parse it any other way: Pelosi took diametrically opposing viewpoints on the House’s ability to sue the executive in the Obamacare and border security lawsuits. Or, to put it more bluntly, she put partisan allegiances—to Obama, and against Trump—ahead of her oath of office to uphold the Constitution. Put Principle over Politics
I find Trump’s border security declaration troubling for the same reason I found the Obamacare payments troubling: they usurp Congress’ rightful constitutional authority. I took some solace in knowing that several congressional Republicans—not enough, but several—voted against the emergency declaration, while many others who voted with the president nevertheless expressed strong misgivings about the move, as well they should.
Compare that to congressional Democrats, not a single one of whom aired so much as a peep about Barack Obama “stealing from appropriated funds,” to use Pelosi’s own words regarding the Obamacare lawsuit. Would that more elected officials—both Republicans and Democrats—put constitutional first principles above partisan affiliations and political gain.

Mike Pence Doesn’t Hate Gay People,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/mike-pence-doesnt-hate-gay-people/,"By David Marcus April 10, 2019
Since ascending to the vice presidency, and even before that, Mike Pence has become the avatar of alleged anti-LGBT bias in the United States. It is a mantle that he neither deserves nor has courted. This week, Pete Buttigieg was the latest to thrust this defamation on Pence. Buttigieg says that it was his creator who made him gay, and if Pence has a problem with that he has a problem with Buttigieg’s creator. Hint: Pence doesn’t have a problem with anyone’s creator.
So let’s see what Pence had to say about Mayor Pete back in 2015, when basically nobody knew who he even was. Why is @PeteButtigieg such a jerk to @vp ?
This is Pence in 2015. https://t.co/GqlacqJyMW pic.twitter.com/pcAsg1LaWL
— Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) April 9, 2019
Not exactly fire and brimstone.
The roots of this allegation against the vice president seem to be twofold. One, he signed into law Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in 2015 and two, he is a devout Christian. With the latter comes the fact that Pence believes marriage is only something that should happen between a man and a woman. Its important to remember that notwithstanding a recent Supreme Court ruling, that was a position held by the Democratic nominee for president as recently as a 2008.
As to the RFRA, that, too, is modeled on a law signed by the previous Democratic president Bill Clinton. Essentially, it states that when the government seeks to limit religious freedom, it must do so in the narrowest way possible. Achieving the goal of the state, such as equal access to flower shops for gay couples, in the way that least forces the hand of citizens who object to gay marriage. None of this makes Pence a bigot, so why is constantly portrayed as one?
Part of the problem here is the growing religious illiteracy among Americans. They know that Pence, like many practicing Christians, views homosexual activity as a sin, but they don’t really know what that means. Yes, two men having sex is by most Christian denominations viewed as a sin. But so is adultery, so is sex before marriage, in some cases so is sex within marriage not intended solely for procreation. Frankly, as a Catholic, it’s hard to even wake up in the morning without committing some old sin or other.
In order to understand how Christians view the concept of sin, it is useful to look at another controversial Mike Pence practice. He will not have dinner alone with a woman who is not his wife. Though widely scoffed at, it is worth looking at why Pence has made this decision. It is precisely because he knows and acknowledges that he himself is a sinner and capable of sin. It is his own fallen nature and that of all of us that he protecting himself against.
And while we are on the subject of religion, it is useful to point out the aspects of modern progressivism that resemble nothing so much as a new religion. Progressivism asserts metaphysical claims—such as the idea that men can wish themselves into being women—and demands this pixie dust be accepted as fact. And for those who refuse to believe in this fiction, or in gay marriage, or that the world is ending in 12 years due to climate change, the punishment is the classic religious one of shame.
What is particularly perverse about the progressive religion is that it isn’t even one that people opt into. It is foisted upon everyone—well, almost everyone. As my colleague Libby Emmons pointed out in a recent article , when white feminists in the UK objected to trans ideology being taught to elementary school kids, they were mocked, called bigots, and shamed, but when Muslims in the UK rejected this notion, the program stopped and their religious beliefs were honored.
As always for progressives, if you can claim identity in an oppressed class, the basic rules don’t apply. But if you’re basically just a white person with no identifiers to grant you amnesty, you are assumed to be a member of the progressive religion and subject to its shaming rules.
Mike Pence is not oppressed. He is white, straight, cis, male, able bodied and vice president of the United States. Maybe worst of all, he is a practicing and faithful Christian. But he doesn’t hate gay people. He doesn’t think gay people shouldn’t serve their country and communities. He holds his gay fellow citizens in high esteem, even if he views their sexual practices sinful.
There is a reason that religions create rules around sexuality, and why most forms of sex are considered sinful. In the Christian context, the rules were mainly created to support family stability. That doesn’t mean that they haven’t been used to oppress women or sexual minorities, but those are not the purpose of religious rules.
Having abandoned almost all of them now, we have a society with extreme sexual dysfunction; millennials aren’t having sex, porn is everywhere, and we can barely replace our own population while environmentalists tell us having kids is bad. It’s worth considering whether Mike Pence holding on to some of the old rules might just make a bit a sense. In any event, the man is not a bigot, nor are the vast majority of Christians. This is a slur against the vice president which really should stop.

Why The Media Is At War With Saudi Arabia,thefederalist.com,David Reaboi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/media-war-saudi-arabia/,"By David Reaboi April 10, 2019
Most news consumers understand that media, in general, plays favorites. They cheer on and protect Designated Heroes, and with seemingly boundless energy relish every opportunity to assail Designated Villains.
We’ve long known, from polling and other quantifiable metrics , that journalists have very pronounced political biases. Even as journalists often indignantly tout the objectivity of their work product and defend the credibility of others in their profession, the sorry results stand for themselves.
It’s no longer controversial—other than in the most surreal, eye-rolling conversations with committed left-wing partisans—to say the American media leans overwhelmingly left and has a strong preference for Democrats rather than Republicans. The Designated Heroes and Villains
Many in the media sees themselves less as factfinders chronicling and relaying information about current events, and more like participants in a morality play, maybe with starring roles. The media’s foreign villains are the enemies of the political left. Today that means relentless attacks on conservative or nationalist movements in Hungary, Brazil, Poland, Israel, and the Brexit effort in the United Kingdom.
Each of these share crucial similarities with the coalition that elected Donald Trump in 2016, taking a stand against leftist transnational mores and the attack on sovereignty that limitless immigration represents. Each movement, too, broadly supports a strong, conservative America. While the particulars in each case differ, that’s more than enough to make them the media’s Designated Villains.
What the public knows about these places and the leaders who govern them is almost exclusively a reflection on what they hear in the media. This, of course, makes journalists and editors remarkably powerful shapers of public opinion on American foreign relations—and, in a time when their pretense of objectivity is abandoned so wantonly, they can be remarkably dangerous to our national security. Anti-Islamist Muslim States in the Crosshairs
It was inevitable that, as Islamic countries in the Middle East more confidently embraced a new, pro-American nationalism, they would become the latest Designated Villains. Muslim states that embrace political Islam and anti-Americanism, like Turkey, Qatar and Iran, are seen as relatively sympathetic warriors against a western global hegemon, with all the usual alleged vices of imperialism, capitalism, Islamophobia, and so on.
On the other hand, American-allied states like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) draw these journalists’ ire as they more forcefully take a stand against political Islam in general, and the Muslim Brotherhood in particular. All three Arab countries have, in recent years, banned the Brotherhood. Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called the group an “incubator for all terrorists.”
The UAE even has gone as far as recognizing the Brotherhood roots of U.S.-based Islamist groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations and Islamic Relief and designating them under their anti-terrorism provisions on the sound basis that they constitute the Brotherhood’s powerful propaganda mechanism.
As all Islamist are keenly aware, these are significantly more aggressive steps against the Brotherhood than the United States or any non-Muslim country has taken—or, for that matter, has even contemplated—and form the basis of a near-hysterical hatred Islamist activists and politicians hold for these countries globally.
No country is hated more by Islamists and the left today than Saudi Arabia, the richest and most powerful of the Arab anti-Islamist states—at least, as evidenced by the sheer number of relentless tweets about the country from the Brotherhood’s favorite new nember of Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar . The latest narrative from the pro-Islamist left is that, for their opposition to Islamists, Saudi Arabia and bin Salman are leading purveyors of anti-Muslim bigotry. “Arab Regimes are the world’s most powerful Islamophobes,” write Ola Salem and Hassan Hassan in Foreign Policy.
Late in October 2018, the campaign went into high gear. The avalanche of anti-Saudi media coverage in the mainstream press reached a crescendo in the wake of the killing of Brotherhood-sympathetic Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi late last year, and has been building ever since.
For the media’s partisans, President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia in 2017—and Jared Kushner’s reportedly close relationship with the young anti-Islamist reformer Bin Salman (MBS)—went a long way in setting the Kingdom as the next target for the hyper-partisan media. Like Israel’s Bibi Netanyahu, MBS is so hated by the press, he might as well be a Republican.
Following the murder of Khashoggi, especially, the media found a Designated Villain in Saudi Arabia and its crown prince. It drove a massive public relations effort to ostracize and punish Saudi Arabia economically, politically, and (with regard to undermining its defensive war in neighboring Yemen against Iran-backed Houthi insurgents) militarily.
Reporters contacted companies and entertainers doing business in Saudi Arabia, and demanded they cease and condemn Saudi actions. Lobbyists with contracts with the Kingdom were harassed by, among others, journalists at The Daily Beast , who threatened them with media exposure and shaming for legally working to make the Saudis’ case to the American public. The Media’s Love Affair with Pro-Islamist Qatar
Throughout its recent war against Saudi Arabia, the media has been egged on by its Islamist regional rival, Qatar, which realized that its goals could be advanced by breaking apart the longstanding U.S.-Saudi alliance.
Qatar’s ability to influence Beltway and media opinion in this country is a deep subject that deserves its own close examination. (I’m featured in a new film about this subject called “ Blood Money ,” and have written on the issue extensively .) Because of its promotion of the Muslim Brotherhood and its alliance with Iran, more and more Americans are coming to understand that Qatar is a malign force—not just in the Middle East but in this country, as well. Qatar’s vast wealth can alter policy by carefully manipulating narratives and perceptions using weaponized information in the United States.
Despite being a relatively unstable country—where a whopping 88 percent of the population is comprised of foreign laborers—Qatar’s vast wealth can alter policy by carefully manipulating narratives and perceptions using weaponized information in the United States.
Most of their most effective spending, though, isn’t on well-heeled advertising and public relations firms like Ogilvy . Qatar has funded think tanks and media outlets that get them a much bigger bang-for-the buck. In that way, they’re able to shape the information battlefield. Rather than simply replying to a story, owning or partnering with media outlets allows Qatar to create an environment favorable to their interests.
In a messaging decision that has had profound strategic consequences, the tiny Gulf emirate has been deftly speaking the left’s language. Qatar was able to appeal to partisan journalists by tailoring their propaganda and messaging to find a receptive audience. By echoing issues of concern to the political left—like Islamophobia, anti-capitalism, white supremacy, and the like—Qatari media outlets, lobbyists, and agents of influence have been able to amass a great deal of goodwill from this very powerful community with giant megaphones.
This is deliberate tactic in information warfare. While it is sophisticated and difficult to pull off with message discipline, it has often been used before. Russia’s English-language state media offers several flavors of pro-regime messaging, each framed in a different way. For example, Russia Today (RT) served a predominantly left-wing audience, while the website Sputnik primarily targeted those on the right. Both outlets could promote pro-Russia narratives from different directions.
In just the same way, the narratives Qatar’s state-run al Jazeera-English network promote dovetail perfectly with a social justice-focused audience in the United States. Al Jazeera commentator Mehdi Hasan even rails against widespread “white supremacy” in America and Trump’s alleged Islamophobia nightly on CNN, earning him and his network tremendous credibility and support from its left-wing viewers. The Cyber-Espionage Front
In Qatar’s war against Saudi Arabia in the United States, the tiny emirate had the help of a phalanx of grossly well-funded lobbyists. After the 2016 election, several figures from Trumpworld unfortunately went to work for Qatar and have been the locus of most of the anti-Saudi activity in media and in Congress. Republican lobbyists like Stonington Strategies’ Nick Muzin and Avenue Strategies’ Stuart Jolly and Barry Bennett (at a jaw-dropping rate of $500,000 per month ) work in the shadows to relentlessly attack Qatar’s enemies. Qatar was accused of hacking nearly a thousand people globally, including prominent American opponents of its Islamist politics, soccer players, Bollywood stars, think tank experts, and journalists.
Last year, Qatar was accused of hacking nearly a thousand people globally, including prominent American opponents of its Islamist politics, soccer players , Bollywood stars , think tank experts, and journalists . A recent lawsuit by one of the victims of Qatari cyber-espionage, the outspoken regime critic Elliott Broidy, alleges that American lobbyists for Qatar, including Muzin, used Mercury Public Affairs’ media and public relations expert Greg Howard to disseminate Broidy’s confidential information in an attempt to destroy his reputation.
As the lawsuit winds its way through the courts, the plaintiff’s case seems to get stronger. New FARA filings show the lobbyists working with reporters Mark Mazetti and Dean Baquet of The New York Times, who later wrote articles using Broidy’s hacked documents.
Perhaps to deflect from this massive Qatari hacking scandal, both the emiratis and the Saudis have recently been accused of waging shadowy wars of cyber-espionage against their enemies, as well. Unsurprisingly, the media has generated dozens of articles and investigated deep-dive articles on these scandals, yet there’s been scant media attention paid to Broidy’s claims and those of others involved in Qatar’s cyber-espionage scheme.
In the most famous case, Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has, since February, been accusing Saudi Arabia, without evidence, of hacking his phone and procuring embarrassing personal text messages with his paramour, Laura Sanchez. Even as subsequent examination revealed that Sanchez’s estranged brother Michael was responsible for obtaining Bezos’s text messages—and he has admitted to doing so—Bezos’ relentless campaign against Saudi Arabia hasn’t abated.
Jordan Schachtel at Conservative Review has covered this story extensively , pointing out how the media has uncritically accepted Bezos’ assertions of Saudi culpability. Tucker Carlson’s opening monologue on February 8 clipped together an amusing string of left-leaning journalists debasing themselves by echoing Bezos’ allegations.
Of course, some of this media sycophancy has to do with Bezos’ ownership of the Washington Post, the flagship purveyor of anti-Saudi messaging since the death of their onetime columnist Khashoggi. Also, certainly, flattery of the world’s richest man is something to be expected, if not respected. From RussiaGate to SaudiGate?
Does Bezos believe his conspiracy theory about Saudi hacking? For that matter, does he believe the Russia conspiracy theories his Washington Post has been peddling for three years?
As RussiaGate fizzles with the release of the Robert Mueller report and the lack of collusion-related indictments of anyone from the Trump team, all but the most committed conspiracy theorists and collusion obsessives are beginning to wake from their Cyrillic nightmares. But the narrative of a perfidious president in league with a foreign power seems to provide too much dopamine for opponents of the president to abandon. Already, some professional Twitter trolls have begun fixating on Saudi Arabia as a possible next furious locus of the president’s alleged seditious treachery.
Without discounting the vehemence of the left-wing media’s attacks on Russia, though, that country never became one of the press’s real Designated Villains. For all of Rachel Maddow’s fulminating against the former Soviet Union and its leadership, talking up Russia’s wickedness was just a bank-shot with which to attack Trump, his family, and his associates. Vladimir Putin had become a partisan Democrat target merely as a cudgel with which to strike at the president. Barack Obama’s foreign policy embraced Russia and, if not for the 2016 election, there would be no calls to substantially reevaluate America’s relationship with that country.
As we have seen, though, the way the media has treated Saudi Arabia is different. Over the last several months, there is a clear and palpable desire among the left-wing press and Democrat politicians to break not just the multi-generational U.S.-Saudi relationship, but to replace its leadership structure and interfere with its line of succession .
For these obsessives, the villain and the narrative are always the same; it’s the details that keep changing. Already, some professional Twitter trolls like Bill Kristol and Ed Krassenstein have begun fixating on Saudi Arabia as a possible next furious locus of the president’s alleged seditious treachery. “He might not be a Russian agent,” they might say, with increasing desperation, “but he’s a pawn of the Saudis.” David Reaboi is a national security and political warfare consultant who lives in Dallas, Texas.

Top FBI Lawyer Testified Rosenstein Discussed Removing Trump From Office,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/top-fbi-lawyer-testified-rosenstein-discussed-removing-trump-office/,"April 10, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
James Baker, the former top lawyer of the FBI, testified to members of Congress last fall that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and other FBI officials discussed wearing a wire in meetings with President Trump and removing him from office, according to a transcript of Baker’s testimony released on Tuesday.
In a joint committee on October 3, 2018, Baker was questioned in a closed-door interview on his knowledge of the Christopher Steele dossier, classified information leaked to the media, and invoking the 25th Amendment against President Trump.
Baker’s testimony confirmed what former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe previously said about national security officials strategizing to remove President Trump from office. Baker said Rosenstein made a serious suggestion to wear a wire when near the president in order to collect evidence that the president obstructed the investigation on Russian collusion. Baker also said he suspected Rosenstein was acting in response to the firing of James Comey, and that he felt he had been “used” by the president in his justification for firing Comey. Baker also testified it was common knowledge that there was a high-level conversation about Rod Rosenstein wearing a wire against the president of the United States. Roseinstein has refused to testify before Congress since that wire conversation was revealed. pic.twitter.com/qucIi28Wd0
— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) April 9, 2019
Baker said he was told that at the time “there were two members of the Cabinet who were willing to go down this road already,” regarding conversations about invoking the 25th Amendment.
Baker testified that he met with a lawyer for Perkins Coie, the law firm hired by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign to do opposition research on Donald Trump, named Michael Sussmann. He said Sussmann did not provide him information about the dossier, but about other information related to the Trump-Russia investigation that Sussmann believed the FBI should have. Baker said he passed Sussmann’s information on to other FBI officials.
Perkins Coie was the law firm responsible for funneling money to Fusian GPS, who hired British spy Christopher Steele. When asked if he verified that the source of this information from Sussman was being funded by Clinton and the DNC before turning it over to the FBI, Baker said “it did not seem inappropriate” to him. Baker testified that prior to entering Clinton/DNC opposition research from the Clinton/DNC attorney into FBI evidence, he never asked or disclosed the source (or his motivation) of the so-called evidence. You have to wonder how much of this stovepiped nonsense was used in FISAs. pic.twitter.com/RBEs9rSBTY
— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) April 9, 2019
When asked about his relationship with his “long-time friend” and journalist David Corn, chief of the Washington bureau for the far-left outlet Mother Jones, Baker said Corn gave him a “significant portion of the dossier” which he in turn gave to Bill Priestap, the head of FBI Counterintelligence.
“What I remember most clearly is that at some point in time David had part of what is now referred to as the Steele dossier and he talked to me about that and wanted to provide that to the FBI. And so, even though he was my friend, I was also an FBI official. He knew that. And so he wanted to somehow get that into the hands of the FBI…” Baker said. “I don’t remember specifically the date of these conversations, but I know that David was anxious to get this into the hands of FBI.”
Baker said he didn’t remember if Corn told him where he got the dossier from, but that he assumed it came from Fusion GPS’s Glenn Simpson.
“Sitting here today, I don’t remember him telling me that, where he got it,” he said. “My understanding at the time was that Simpson was going around Washington giving this out to a lot of different people and trying to elevate its profile.”
Lastly, Baker said when the application for a FISA warrant against Carter Page came across his desk for approval, he did not read the supporting evidence used for the application.
“I have participated in one way or another in the review of 10,000 FISA applications, and I don’t think I ever read the Woods file contemporaneously with reading the application,” Baker explained.
When pressed by Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan on this point, and whether Baker knew the dossier was funded by the DNC before or after the FISA application was taken to court, Baker said he couldn’t remember:
I know that I didn’t know all the facts with respect to the providence of this thing at the time of the FISA application…
There were other things in that application that to me were alarming, as well. I am not going to sit here and say that there wouldn’t have been probable cause or that there would have been probable cause without the dossier. I would have to go back and look at it again, but there were other activities of Mr. Page that were alarming to me that I thought certainly merited an investigation.
Rep. Doug Collins, who released the transcript on Tuesday, said he “will continue to work to release as many transcripts as possible, including the entirety of Mr. Baker’s interview with the Judiciary Committee. The American people deserve the truth.”

I am intrigued by and actually support the concept of Medicare For All, as put forth by many Democrat members of Congress. However, I’m curious as to exactly how this noble concept would be paid for—not by the federal government, but by the new beneficiaries, many of whom would be low-income.
Specifically, I attempted a comparison of my family’s past and present costs of Medicare to those of a hypothetical three-person household, particularly one living at or below the poverty level, which is $20,420. I considered this hypothetical family to have one member who works full-time, one who works part-time, and the third a dependent, all covered by Medicare For All, per my experience with the costs associated with Medicare.
At the time my wife and I started collecting our “earned” Social Security and Medicare benefits, after both having worked for more than four decades, I received a notice from the Social Security Administration summarizing our contributions to both programs, which I vaguely recall being about $400,000 and $125,000, respectively. For Medicare, $125,000 represented “paid-in equity.”
This begs the question: “How and to what extent will the recipients of the new entitlement be required to make contributions prior to collecting benefits, which took us 40 years to amass?” If eligibility is immediate, will the equity contributions that were mandates for us become “pay-as-you-go,” or be reduced or forgiven altogether for the new beneficiaries?
That aside, the monthly cost of Medicare Parts A and B for 2019 is $135.50, or $1,626.00 per year, per person. Accordingly, coverage for a three-person household would be $4,878.00 per year—disregarding any possible higher costs that could stem from any prior work requirements. So my second question about Medicare For All is, “Will the new beneficiaries be required to pay these same costs as us current enrollees?” Or will they be reduced or forgiven?
Since Medicare Part B pays only about 80 percent of eligible health costs, it is prudent to have supplemental insurance to cover the 20 percent. These plans are provided by private insurers, but the elements of the various supplemental plans are the same, with the only difference being their cost.
For the purpose here, without getting into the specifics of the different plans, just assume that each insured person pays the $185 annual deductible then, say, $100 per month for the supplemental coverage. This means supplemental coverage for a three-person household would be $4,155.00 per year.
So another of my questions about Medicare For All is, “If new beneficiaries do not obtain supplemental insurance, and fail or are unable to pay the 20 percent not covered by Medicare, what happens?” Will these outstanding costs simply be forgiven?
Lastly, while the necessity of obtaining Medicare Part D coverage for prescription meds is arguable, based on the age and general health of each household member, drug costs for a three-person household could be as high as $3,000 per year, not including co-pays. For our purpose here, assume that only the head-of-household obtains coverage and pays $1,000 per year, not including any co-pays.
Not including any contributions that might be required prior to receiving benefits, the annual cost of Medicare For All for a three-person household would be $10,921 per year: $4,878 for Part B coverage; $4,155 for supplemental coverage; $1,000 for prescription drug coverage; and $888 for the 1.45 percent payroll deduction. This represents 54 percent of the $20,420 annual income earned by a poverty-level three-person household, leaving such households just $9,500.00 of disposable income on which to live.
C’mon, Dems. Get real! A three-person household at the poverty level can’t afford Medicare. Don’t continue to deceive us by calling your proposal Medicare For All, when what you’re really pushing is Medicaid For All! "
Mike Pence And Chick-Fil-A’s Supposed Hatred Towards Gay People Is A Complete Myth,thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/mike-pence-chick-fil-supposed-hatred-towards-gay-people-complete-myth/,"By Chad Felix Greene April 10, 2019
Many have argued that resentment and hostility in the LGBT movement was fully justified at one time. The religious right focused heavily on homosexuality and often disregarded how its messaging affected gay individuals. Many organizations and writing careers grew out of combating a narrative that felt unfair and hateful.
In many ways it was the advocacy of love, tolerance, and normalcy from much of gay media that successfully integrated gay people into society. But the progressive instinct to perpetually challenge the status quo and demand change by any means necessary, as well as its fixation on past sins, has taken the gay movement into the very depths of hatred and bigotry it long fought to remove from society.
Today we see unreasonable targeted hostility toward people of faith who seem more than willing to compromise for a peaceful society. It is more common for a Christian to be told her assumed religious beliefs are hateful than to see a Christian berating a gay person in public about his views on homosexuality.
The most recent Pew Research poll in 2017 found 35 percent of evangelicals support same-sex marriage . Clearly there is a significant and growing gap between how the LGBT left perceives the world and how Christians actually live in it. Two prominent examples of how this plays out in the media entertain Chick-fil-A as a champion of anti-LGBT legal and social advocacy, and Vice President Mike Pence as an anti-LGBT leader influencing national policy. ‘If You Really Love LGBTQ People,’ Boycott Chick-fil-A
Noah Michelson, the editorial director of HuffPost Personal, argued in his article, “ If You Really Love LGBTQ People, You Just Can’t Keep Eating Chick-fil-A ,” that queer people and their allies have an obligation to continue fighting Christian advocacy. “[W]hen a corporation is wafting its anti-queer stance directly under your nose, as Chick-fil-A has and continues to do, not giving them more money to use against us is a no-brainer.” He was responding to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey innocently boosting the restaurant after eating there. (Dorsey quickly apologized.)
In 2012, Chick-fil-A owner Dan Cathy advocated for traditional marriage and argued that marriage held biblical meaning and could not be so easily manipulated by society. He stated , “We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles.”
He later discussed the effects of potentially isolating segments of the population from his restaurant by saying, “I think the time of truths and principles are captured and codified in God’s word and I’m just personally committed to that,” he said. “I know others feel very different from that and I respect their opinion and I hope that they would be respectful of mine.”
This declaration of respectful tolerance did not move Michelson, who argued that the organization donated millions to “anti-LGBT” groups in 2009 . The list of organizations includes the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Focus on the Family, as well as $1,000 to the now-defunct Exodus International.
Of course, in 2009, President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held the identical view on marriage, as did a significant majority of the American population . In 2012, while Hillary remained squarely on the side of Chick-fil-A, the drag queen group DWV released a parody song titled “ Chow Down at Chick-fil-A” (NSFW), an anthem to encourage gays to protest the restaurant by eating there. Chick-fil-A has never been known to discriminate against LGBT customers or employees and never sought any action towards the group or YouTube for the video’s false accusations.
In March of this year, Chick-fil-A’s continued support for various Christian organizations was once again denounced, this time via a Vox headline, “ Chick-fil-A’s charitable foundation kept donating to anti-LGBTQ groups .” The article says “The Chick-fil-A Foundation donated more than $1.8 million to three groups with a history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in 2017, according to recently released tax filings analyzed by ThinkProgress.”
The three organizations in question are the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Paul Anderson Youth Home (a Christian organization helping troubled youth), and the Salvation Army. The three Christian organizations in no way discriminate against people based on their sexuality but do advocate a biblical view of homosexuality. This is a private and voluntary experience for everyone involved and none of the organizations protest, provoke, or instigate hostilities towards LGBT people or groups. Mike Pence Has No Record of Treating LGBT People Poorly
Naturally, Pence has been a target of anti-LGBT accusations for some time now, despite repeated debunking of the various claims against him. Most recently, openly gay Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg reflected on his experience coming to terms with his sexuality and his faith . He said, “That’s the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
The vice president was never involved in this conversation and did nothing to provoke the response from Buttigieg. In fact, in 2015, when Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out, then-Indiana governor Pence responded by saying , “I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. We have a great working relationship. I see him as a dedicated public servant, and a patriot.” Also in 2015, Pence tweeted , “If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore.”
Both Chick-fil-A and Pence demonstrate a growing trend in American Christianity to be vocally respectful of liberal social issues while privately embracing religious tradition and morality that directly affects their own lives. The controversy does not come from what Christians, as a group, do to LGBT people, but what LGBT people speculate Christians must collectively and individually think and feel about the LGBT movement as a whole.
Pence is remarkably tolerant in every sense of the word, separating his personal religious views from his personal and professional relationships in a way as to not impose on anyone else. He is the ideal example of Christians coexisting in a secular society, and he has been repeatedly kind , generous , polite , and welcoming to LGBT Americans in every scenario he encounters them.
There is not a single example of Pence in his professional leadership role being rude, disrespectful, or hostile towards a gay person in the years he has been vice president, governor, or a member of Congress. Remarkably, no one accuses him of doing so privately either. To demonstrate this, in response to Buttigieg’s recent statement, “Pence insiders said they are shocked since he has not said anything derogatory about ‘Mayor Pete’ or his marriage to Chasten Buttigieg.” No Malice Directed Toward LGBT People
In the same way, Chick-fil-A is an open and welcoming environment and no one, from customers to employees, is treated poorly for any reason. Their sole unforgivable sin is supporting charitable organizations that reflect their religious ideals and also happen to be conservative on the issues of secularism and sexuality.
The organization has gone out of its way to demonstrate no malicious intent whatsoever toward LGBT people. In 2017, Chick-fil-A said in a statement , “Since the Chick-fil-A Foundation was created in 2012, our giving has always focused on youth and education. We have never donated with the purpose of supporting a social or political agenda. There are 140,000 people—black, white; gay, straight; Christian, non-Christian—who represent Chick-fil-A. We are the sum of many experiences, but what we all have in common is a commitment to providing great food, genuine hospitality, and a welcoming environment to all of our guests.”
What we are seeing now is a profound intolerance to the most moderate social expression of Christian faith in our country. If anything, the hateful, bigoted Christian lives in the mind of the progressive as a mythical collection of ideas, and the more they seek to marginalize and shame the most mainstream views of Christians as extreme, the more hatred they create in their own communities.

"Joe Biden’s Remarks About ‘White Culture’ Are Dangerous, And Ignorant Beyond Belief",thefederalist.com,Paul Shakeshaft,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/common-law-white-joe-biden-claims/,"By Paul Shakeshaft April 10, 2019
Joe Biden is calling for a new jurisprudence. Equating common law—the system of law used in most English-speaking countries, including the United States—with “white culture,” Biden insists our inherently racist legal system must change.
Speaking at the Biden Courage Awards ceremony last week, the former vice president cited the “rule of thumb” as an example of common law’s inherent bias. From the context of his speech, Biden seems to understand as historical the cartoonist James Gillray’s meme of Sir Francis Buller allowing men to beat their wives with sticks no wider than their thumbs:
In the 1900s, so many women were dying at the hands of their husbands because they were chattel, just like the cattle or the sheep, that the court of Common Law decided they had to do something about the extent of the deaths. You know what they said? No man has a right to chastise his woman with a rod thicker than the circumference of his thumb. This is English jurisprudential culture, a white man’s culture. It’s got to change. It’s got to change.
Gillray published the cartoon Biden references, mocking the perceived draconian judgments issued from Sir Buller’s bench, in 1792. Since then, English speakers have absorbed the idea of the “rule of thumb” as a reference to canes. In fact, there has never been a common law doctrine allowing men to cane their wives, and no court in England or America has ever ruled that thumb-sized canes are ameliorators of more extreme methods of domestic violence.
To be fair to Biden, the rule-of-thumb inaccuracy is a powerful one, entering into legal as well as popular discourse. In 1867, a North Carolina court let off a man for whipping his wife with a switch narrower than the circumference of his thumb, citing an “old saying from the realm of England.” Far from being an example of established legal practice, however, North Carolina’s Supreme Court immediately overturned the lower court’s ridiculous decision, knowing no common law doctrine allowed such domestic violence.
Writing at the end of the 18th century, Sir William Blackstone, England’s preeminent legal scholar and the most highly regarded legal authority in American history, noted in his “Commentaries on the Laws of England” that “old law” did make small allowance for husbands to moderately correct their wives for misbehavior, since husbands were legally responsible for their wives’ conduct. However, this old law prohibited any such “domestic chastisements” from being violent.
Even such an allowance for non-violent correction became outdated by the “politer” reign of Charles II (1630-1685), and by the time of Blackstone’s writing, “a wife [had the] security of peace against her husband; or, in return, a husband against his wife.” Of course, the history of law is not the history of action; our society has seen men perpetrate gross abuse against women, and Biden should be commended for his efforts to combat domestic violence. But to argue that law excused or supported familial violence is erroneous. That Wasn’t Even the Biggest Issue With Biden’s Speech
Biden’s anachronism may be excused as rusty memory of tort law. To be sure, English common law is one of the least understood and most underestimated aspects of American jurisprudence, perhaps even for a presidential candidate. Putting these contingencies aside, however, much more damaging to the rule of law and societal harmony is Biden’s equation of our legal system with “white man’s culture.” Adopting such a posture signals decay of the rule of law in this country.
It is an irony almost beyond belief that white supremacists and left-wing intersectionalists now agree that key aspects of Western, or Anglophone, institutions are inherently “white.” Both falsely regard skin color or ethnicity as determinants of culture. Implied in Biden’s remarks is the insipid idea that white people—particularly men—have manipulated the law to serve their own irrational ends, all while using the language of fairness and objectivity to deceive their fellow citizens and disguise their real motives.
Even though men have exercised abusive power over women since time immemorial, the common law of England (maintained by post-Revolution America) made no allowance for husbands to murder or assault their wives at home. It is vital that citizens have trust in their legal institutions. Should common law come to be perceived as “white,” what reasons would anyone—from whatever ethnic background—have for acknowledging the authority of courts? None, because today we rightly reject the idea that skin color bestows authority on any particular group.
A healthy—and historically accurate—approach to the real racial problems with which America’s legal system grapples would draw on the strengths of the common law and not reject it wholesale. We ought to use history (real, not imagined) to help us in that task. Take, for example, the common law doctrine against slavery. Common Law Doctrine and Slavery
In 1569, an Englishman named Cartwright was charged with battery for beating his Russian slave. Rejecting the Englishman’s paltry defense excusing his behavior, the court ruled “That England was too pure an Air for Slaves to breathe in.” The slave was freed.
Some scholars suggest this line from Cartwright is a late misquotation of Lord Hardwicke’s statement in Shanley v. Harvey 200 years later, that “As soon as a man sets foot on English ground he is free.” Forgoing physical metaphors, Lord Mansfield, in the famous 1772 case of Somerset v Stewart , echoed the precedent cases in unadorned language, ruling that the enforcement of slavery on English soil was not “allowed or approved by the law of England.”
William Cowper, apparently familiar with the language of all the judgments, put the common law doctrine into verse this way:
Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs
Receive our air, that moment they are free;
They touch our country, and their shackles fall.
Unfortunately, it would take Parliament until 1807 to heed the remainder of Cowper’s plea and apply the common law principle against slavery to admiralty law, under which jurisdiction the sea-based trafficking in slaves fell:
And let it circulate through every vein
Of all your empire; that, where Britain’s power
Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.
To incalculable misery and shame, the American colonies used a sleight-of-hand tactic and applied admiralty law to these shores, thereby countenancing the use of slaves on land. But this was not the common law. In this area, Americans explicitly rejected the common law, trading the rule of law for white identity politics.
Historian Francis Newman noted in 1889 that: “All the colonies were subject to the common law of England, and if in Virginia and Jamaica there had been a judge as upright and able as Lord Mansfeld…it would seem that slavery might have been dissolved by a few judicial trials.” Americans knew full well what the law required, but politics triumphed over reason. As the Founding Father James Wilson admitted: “The reasons which we sometimes see assigned for the origin and continuance of slavery appear, when examined to the bottom, to be built upon a false foundation.”
Blackstone highlighted the role of reason in his summary the common law position on slavery this way :
Pure and proper slavery does not, nay, cannot, subsist in England…And indeed it is repugnant to reason, and the principles of natural law, that such a state should subsist anywhere…the law of England abhors, and will not endure the existence of, slavery within this nation; so that when an attempt was made to introduce it, by statute…the spirit of the nation could not brook this condition…. And now it is laid down, that a slave or negro, the instant he lands in England, becomes a freeman; that is, the law will protect him in the enjoyment of his person, and his property. Natural Law and Common Law
At its best, common law is the legal manifestation of moral principles discerned by practical reason. In other words, common law is the legal outworking of natural law. Natural law—the law of reason—is no more white than reason is.
Martin Luther King Jr. knew this when he relied upon natural law to reject Alabama’s white identity politics. “How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust?” he asked from a Birmingham jail . “A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law.”
At common law, cases involving human conflict are brought before a judge who applies common (that is, ubiquitous) mores of the society, discernment, and relevant legal precedent to the case at hand. The ultimate question in cases from personal injury to contract disputes, is entitled the “reasonable man standard.”
The question is, what would a reasonable man do in this situation? This question is the beginning of practical reason, as Aristotle discerned 2,300 years ago: phronēs is twofold, consisting of a true conception of the end to be achieved by action and correct deliberation about the means to achieve that end.
Common law is not “white” any more than reason is. With Dr. King, we must encourage Biden not to judge the law by the color of its skin but by the content of its reasonableness."
Will Democrats Ever Confirm A Republican SCOTUS Nominee Again?,thefederalist.com,Gabriel Lepinski,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/will-democrats-ever-confirm-a-republican-judicial-nominee-again/,"By Gabriel Lepinski April 10, 2019
As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pulls yet another lever to justifiably speed up the confirmations of President Trump’s judicial and executive branch nominees, conservatives are celebrating. With McConnell at the helm, conservatives will now fill long-vacant executive branch positions, in addition to securing at least two immensely qualified and originalist judges on the Supreme Court with the retirement of Anthony Kennedy, as well as a flurry of originalists on the appellate courts.
Given this near three-year track record of success, it is clear that one of the most ambitious gambles in our modern legislatures’ history — the refusal of giving Merrick Garland a hearing and subsequent nuking of the judicial filibuster — has paid off big for conservatives. However, the current situation has also put conservatives, and more importantly, the Senate, in a precarious position.
Inevitably Democrats will, at one point or another, control the chamber. In fact, it’s quite possible they could control it in the near future, with a tough 2020 map staring down Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, and McConnell. Undoubtedly, this would result in any Trump SCOTUS nominee being blocked by a simple majority of Democrats as retaliation for McConnell’s bold gambit on Garland.
Not only that, but when this happens, it’s more than likely the one-upmanship in judicial nomination gambits and subsequent confirmation votes will reach the Harry Reid v. McConnell escalation we saw in the Obama years. In fact, the idea of an executive branch or SCOTUS nominee being confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing party may well be dead.
This reality has conservatives who are no doubt thrilled with McConnell’s gamesmanship asking, in hindsight, how an alternate strategy could have created a longer-lasting victory. One such alternate strategy (that would have been equally as significant a gamble for McConnell) would have been for him to hold his caucus’s feet to the fire on a vote to confirm Garland. 2016 saw a handful of nail-biting Senate races, particularly in traditional swing states such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida.
However, let us examine the incumbents in question, who ultimately won reelection with an open Supreme Court seat on the line: Ron Johnson, Pat Toomey, Marco Rubio, and Richard Burr. Burr voted against justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor in times of far less political pressure, so we can assume a hypothetical no vote on Garland. Rubio routinely held up President Obama’s judicial picks by withholding blue slips, so much so it garnered coverage in Politico and other D.C. news outlets. Given that history, it is doubtful such a pivotal vote against Garland would be hard for McConnell to pry from Rubio.
Lastly, Johnson and Toomey have long been considered establishment types who were desperate to use the McConnell war chest in difficult races, which both won narrowly. It is difficult to see a scenario where they would have voted for Garland’s confirmation knowing they desperately needed McConnell’s dollars to help boost them across the finish line.
Even if swing votes such as Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins had bucked McConnell, he still would have had the necessary 51 votes to vote down Garland. The idea of going through hearings that McConnell and Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley could have dragged on strategically for as long as they saw fit—or at least until they were positive that they had the 51 votes needed to block Garland—is plausible, and would have put Republicans in a far more defensible position of voting Garland down based on his merits and jurisprudence.
In the eyes of moderates, this would have been seen as a far more acceptable stance than an outright refusal of a hearing for Garland, and would not have left conservatives in such a precarious position. Even absent the previous assumption, a simple filibustering of Garland would have been a real possibility for conservatives, as unlike the Cruz-Obamacare filibuster, Democrats would have never been able to muster 60 votes between their caucus and a few stray Republicans that would have been necessary to break a filibuster on Garland.
All in all, despite the obvious success of McConnell’s bold move, many long-game conservatives are musing over over the multiple ways Republicans could have stopped a liberal like Garland from filling the seat of a full-throated originalist without upping the ever-growing ante in the game of judicial nominations. Now, for better or worse, a generation of constitutional conservatives faces immense challenges the minute the Senate flips."
Barr Tells Congress Full Mueller Report Will Be Released In A Matter Of Days,thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/barr-tells-congress-full-mueller-report-will-released-matter-days/,"By Adam Mill April 10, 2019
A full, redacted version of Robert Mueller’s collusion report will be released to Congress within a week, Attorney General William Barr said in testimony before a House subcommittee April 9. He also said the Department of Justice’s inspector general would conclude its investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse in May or June, and that he is conducting a broader investigation of how the Trump-Russia collusion narrative started on the first place.
Barr told Congress that there were “no plans” to assert executive privilege and that the president told the attorney general to make the decisions regarding whether something should be redacted from the released Mueller report. He also said the attorney general will be taking input and suggestions from the special counsel on redactions.
Contrary to circulating rumors, “the thinking of the special counsel was not a mystery to the people at the Department of Justice prior to his submission of the report,” Barr said. He said he provided Mueller the opportunity to review Barr’s controversial March 24, 2019 letter to Congress, in which he outlined the conclusions of Mueller’s report, but that Mueller declined the opportunity review the draft or to provide input.
Barr further revealed he met with the special counsel team on March 5, 2019 and that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also attended. Barr said his department had an idea of what would be coming from the Mueller team and therefore had a matter of weeks to think through how it would draft the March 24 letter to Congress.
Barr repeatedly limited his responses about the report, indicating that he would make himself available to answer any questions from both the House and Senate judiciary committees after the redacted report is released. Barr told Congress that it could expect a redacted version of the full report “within a week.”
Barr was repeatedly grilled about the coming redaction of the Mueller report. He noted that every page of the Mueller report was marked sensitive and that nothing in the special counsel’s submission was “sanitized” for immediate release.
Barr identified four categories of redaction that the public could anticipate: (1) grand jury information, (2) information revealing sources and methods of the intelligence community, (3) information that might interfere with ongoing prosecutions and/or the presumption of a defendant’s innocence, and (4) information that could affect the privacy or reputational interests of peripheral players mentioned in the report.
In one exchange, Barr was asked whether the White House saw the Mueller report before Barr issued his March 24, 2019 letter or since then. Barr responded, “I’ve said what I’m going to say about the report,” effectively refusing to answer the question until after the full report is released to Congress.
The committee scheduled the hearing to question Barr over the Department of Justice budget for 2020. But, as widely anticipated, the committee members used the opportunity to press the attorney general on the Mueller collusion probe.
Barr was asked how the Department of Justice used the flimsy Christopher Steele dossier as a predicate for an application for a search warrant before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (referring to the Carter Page warrant and the three subsequent renewals). Barr reconfirmed that the Office of the Inspector General has an ongoing investigation of the FISA process in the Russia investigation and that the IG would complete this investigation in “May or June.”
It should be noted that Rosenstein, who oversaw the Mueller probe, also approved the final FISA extension that is the subject of the IG investigation. Barr said he was also personally reviewing the conduct of the Russia investigation in the summer of 2016. Barr anticipated referrals from House intelligence committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-California), but denied having yet seen the referrals.
Barr was asked about the recent New York Times report that members of the special counsel team were disappointed by his March 24 letter. Barr responded that he didn’t know what their concern was, but that he suspected they wanted more put out.
Barr said he did not attempt to summarize the special counsel’s report because to do so would simply trigger criticism of being under inclusive or over inclusive. He instead intended only to provide the “bottom line” conclusions and will otherwise let the report speak for itself. When asked why he didn’t adopt the summaries provided in the report, he responded that the summaries were all marked as sensitive—potentially containing grand jury material. Adam Mill is a pen name.

"For The Left To Get Religion, They’ll Have To Give Up Abortion And The Misuse Of Sex",thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/left-get-religion-theyll-give-abortion-misuse-sex/,"By Nathanael Blake April 10, 2019
Should the left get religion? Yes—a revival of the religious left would be good for America. Among white voters, church attendance has become a strong partisan indicator. Leftists are increasingly irreligious, and political divisions are taking on a spiritual aspect. This is bad for the church and for the state.
But could the left get religion? Kirsten Powers recently made the case for an “awakening of the Christian left.” I am a conservative, but I would agree that Christians can hold good-faith progressive views on political issues from environmental policy to gun control to tax rates. Despite our disagreements, I would be delighted if progressives were coming back to church rather than fleeing.
But to get religion, the left will have to change. Powers’ column, which was based on an interview with Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic presidential hopeful who is currently the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, illustrates how many on the Christian left leave Christianity behind to conform to the culture. Two issues that she picks out—abortion and sexual morality—illuminate this. Jesus Didn’t Explicitly Talk About a Lot of Things
On abortion, Powers reports that “Buttigieg criticized right-wing Christians for ‘saying so much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.’” She elaborates, complaining about “the religious right’s treatment of abortion as a litmus test for Christian faith, when in fact Jesus never mentioned the issue”—as if the lack of a record of Jesus prohibiting a specific category of unjust killing means it might be permissible. This is legalistic loophole-hunting. There are many horrible deeds that Jesus did not specifically prohibit.
Despite the diversity of our other political opinions, Christians should speak with a united voice in declaring that the government should not permit, let alone subsidize, the killing of developing humans in utero. Opposition to abortion should be a baseline for Christian involvement in politics, and progressive Christians who support bigger government in order to combat injustice should be loud supporters of the right to life.
Sadly, their voices and votes tend to disappear when it matters. According to Powers, Buttigieg’s favorite Bible verse is from Matthew: “Whatever you did for one of the least of these … you did for me.” However, “Mayor Pete” wants the government to allow the killing of the “least of these” until they are born, and the official position of the Democratic Party is taxpayer-funded abortion on demand until birth (and maybe even a little after). There is space for good faith disagreement on many political points, but no Christian philosophy of government can endorse America’s state-sanctioned massacre of the innocents.
As for the charge that “right-wing” Christians ignore what Jesus “said so much about,” it conflates what the church has to say to believers with what the church should say to the government. Contrary to what Powers and Buttigieg insinuate, declining to lobby for big government anti-poverty programs is not the same as indifference to the poor, or approval of greed. Jesus commanded us to care for the poor, he did not tell us the extent to which government should be used for that task, let alone provide detailed positions on topics like work requirements for welfare recipients.
Protecting innocent human life is among the first duties of government, whereas the size and scope of anti-poverty programs are open to honest disagreement. Caring for the poor is a moral imperative, while doing so effectively and justly is a realm of legitimate disputation.
Indeed, a Christian revival on the left would increase the amount of political disagreement between American Christians on many issues. Despite this friction, conservative Christians should welcome fellow believers who disagree with us on all sorts of political issues. However, we cannot compromise on abortion; even if we are all hypocrites, that does not excuse those on the left accepting the evil of abortion. Can We Detach Sexual Morality from the Rest of Christian Teachings?
Nor can we abandon orthodox Christian teachings on sexual morality. It may be fashionable to endorse, as Powers seems to, Buttigeig’s same-sex marriage, but Christians must not do so. The extent to which many Christian moral teachings should be supported by the government is disputable; that the church should uphold them is not.
Marriage is an image of Christ and his church. It is the relationship God instituted and blessed as the means of united the two halves of the human race and creating new persons. Thus, rejecting the orthodox Christian view of sexuality and marriage necessitates denying much more than a discrete doctrine or two. Sexual morals are not severable from the rest of Christian teaching.
Rejecting Christian sexual teaching is a challenge to the entire Christian view of human persons and our destiny in Christ, as well as to biblical authority and Christian tradition. This is why those who deny part of orthodox Christian sexual ethics often end up denying it all, and even abandon essential doctrines such as the divinity and the resurrection of Christ.
Of course, conservative Christians have our own problems with sexuality. The sexual sins the majority of us are tempted by and are guilty of have often been overlooked and excused. Too frequently, there has been little grace extended to those whose temptations are not like ours, even as we easily claimed forgiveness ourselves. Not enough care has been given to those upon whom Christian sexual morality may lay a heavier burden.
But the right response to this hypocrisy is not abandoning Christian sexual ethics in favor of a new iteration of the pagan sexual morality that Christianity vanquished . Rather, it is to repent and cultivate humility and compassion while still proclaiming Christian truths and human nature and sexuality.
Among these truths is that sexual liberation leads to exploitation as an ethos of indulgence favors the powerful and privileged at the expense of the weak and the marginalized. Most prominently, sexual liberation is premised on abortion, which is often required as a failsafe. It is no coincidence that to the extent progressive Christianity has accepted abortion and embraced the sexual revolution, it has withered and become enfolded into secular leftism, with Jesus admired as a sage or social worker, rather than worshiped as the savior.
Conservative Christians should recognize that there are many political issues on which we may have good faith-disagreements with our left-wing brothers and sisters. We should engage with them in a spirit of love, charity, and even compromise. But we cannot abandon innocent lives to the violence of abortion. Nor can we renounce teachings on marriage and sexuality that are rooted in creation and represent the union of Christ and his church. Nathanael Blake is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist.

"For All Its Flaws, ‘Shazam’ Beats ‘Captain Marvel.’ Here’s Why",thefederalist.com,Titus Techera,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/flaws-shazam-beats-captain-marvel-heres/,"By Titus Techera April 10, 2019
America has two Captain Marvels. One debuted last month but the original is hitting screens now, and it’s a better movie. “Captain Marvel” is a silly fantasy about individualism; “Shazam,” the new name of the original Captain Marvel, is about elevating family over individualism.
“Captain Marvel” is a sleek movie, appears very feminist (without actually being so), and was made under the supervision of the once-in-a-generation production genius, Kevin Feige, who runs Marvel and has not flopped since 2008. So the movie made a billion dollars, about a third of which came from America. Clearly, Feige runs a team that knows what fantasies we want to indulge and how to lie to us. But at the end of it, all he has to offer is the notion that if you believe in yourself, you can be a hero all on your own, without anyone, and especially without family, which is strikingly absent from the movie.
But it’s now clear we cannot become the celebrities we worship on the big screen. All our social crises are rooted in a dawning awareness that we’ve believed in fantasies for a long time, and that too many of them have failed. Our culture is lagging far behind our politics, because there’s still so much money in the beautiful lie that we are morally pure and just need more power to succeed. Like Captain Marvel herself, we just need to punch people really hard, and then we’ll win. Sure.
The story of “Shazam” is in many ways the opposite. In “Shazam,” individualism is a curse. It means being alone, abandoned, an orphan. That’s Billy Batson, who later becomes the hero Shazam. He believes his mother lost him in a crowd, when he was still very small. But she didn’t just lose him, she also abandoned him. He breaks out of every foster home trying to find her. Yet she cannot be bothered by him even when he does find her. You can see why this boy would want to become an invulnerable hero. It’s a fantasy we all have, and it’s really important for him.
At the same time, the story shows the only invulnerability we have in this world is a loving family. Because of his obstinate running away, Billy ends up in the only foster home in Philadelphia that might actually save him.
This foster family is a beautiful image of America: Loving parents who never punish, and many siblings of different races and sexes who may quarrel, each trying to find his individuality, but who love and even like each other. They say grace together before dinner. This is what it takes to grow out of the individualism that tells Billy he cannot trust anyone, love anyone, or live with anyone, keeping him trapped in reenactments of the way his mother and father abandoned him.
The movie discreetly suggests far more Americans are in Billy’s situation than would care to admit. There aren’t that many orphans among us, but there is a terrible loneliness and lack of trust, hence the fantasy about super-heroes: That’s what we believe it takes to make a difference, to get attention, to be anybody. Accordingly, Billy turns into Shazam and immediately proceeds to become a YouTube celebrity. Finally, people love him and he gets to have fun. Isn’t that what freedom is all about? We look for love in all the wrong places if we don’t have love at home.
But as soon as he becomes a celebrity, Billy acquires an enemy who wants to destroy him and take his power. Shazam is powered by morality, but his enemy gets his power from the seven deadly sins. That’s one of a few striking nods to Christianity in the movie—again, a rare thing in our superhero blockbusters. But if you think about how Superman is presented by Zack Snyder rather like Christ, you might begin to notice that DC movies are slightly more open to Christianity than Marvel movies. So Shazam has to save his family from the seven deadly sins and grow up.
So far, so good. Add to this the joyful acting by Zachary Levi, who captures the pleasure of power—the magic of being able to do things—and the notion of being a boy in a man’s body, and you have a hit. There are many other things to enjoy in the movie, including all sorts of surprises I won’t spoil, but which make this film far more like the delightful “Into The Spiderverse” than the banal, moralistic stuff the Marvel Cinematic Universe produces. Go see the movie — you will love it.
But that is not to say “Shazam” is a perfect movie. For a film where the villain is the seven deadly sins, it’s hard to notice that the foster family at the center of the story—both the two parents and their six children—is free from sin. These people are angels, the way we might present ourselves to make a good impression. They have absolutely no temptations. Sin is dangerous to mere bystanders in Philadelphia, but not to this perfect American family, not for a second, not even for dramatic effect. Billy himself has to learn to trust and to face his fears, but he’s never tempted by lust, wrath, or anything else.
This is the same problem in almost every superhero movie, the fantasy that a good guy punching a bad guy is how our world works. We are perfectly moral and we just need more power and then we’ll be happy.
“Shazam,” in a strangely moralistic moment that’s supposed be teachable, says to the villain: What good is power if you can’t share it with people? As though the problem were that some people want power only for themselves, but others are willing to share it. This is not to say that a thirst for power isn’t evil, but both family and America are about more than sharing power. And you cannot defeat evil by punching it.
In this movie, you can. The all-American family wins. Better family than loneliness, better love and trust than self-obsession, but we’re still stuck in a situation where we cannot admit we need each other precisely because there’ll never be enough power to defeat evil. There will always be fear, we will always have to face our mortality, and we will have to love each other even when we’re not winning.
Shazam never has to grow up because he has so much power. In reality, we don’t have that power—we’re not born winners—we have to deal with suffering and tragedy, not just find the right villain to punch. If we cannot admit there’s evil in our hearts too, not just in the hearts of people we hate, we’re still children.

World War II Was A Fight To Preserve Human Freedom,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/world-war-ii-fight-preserve-human-freedom/,"April 10, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
This summer will mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day thousands of men landed on the fog-covered beaches of Normandy to attack Nazi Germany’s army. What were these men fighting for? What was at stake for those fighting the deadly World War II? Scholar and professor Victor Davis Hanson answers these questions in a new free online course from Hillsdale College, “The Second World Wars.”
Sixty million people died in WWII: half soldiers, airmen, and sailors, the other half civilians. That’s three times as many casualties as in World War I. Technology and wealth made WWII a new kind of war: one that introduced not just new ways of killing people, but new ways to increase the volume of people killed.
Years before the war even started, both Germany and the Soviet Union were engaged in mass-produced efforts to kill their own people. The Soviet Union’s Joseph Stalin was starving his people to death, and Germany’s Adolph Hitler was creating factories to make killing people more efficient. Gassing Jews in trucks and shooting them both took too long, and upset the soldiers, so the Nazis took a more scientific approach to their genocide.
While it’s hard to comprehend what means could justify these horrific ends, it’s important to look at the motives of such tyrants. They did not kill because they simply loved cruelty, but because they sought perfection. They desired to eliminate what they saw as problems in society — the obvious example that Hitler’s answer to eliminating class oppression was to eliminate an entire class of people.
Ultimately what the Axis and Allies were fighting over was the meaning of human nature. Is the human soul free and entitled to self-government, or are humans collective beings shaped by history? If it’s the latter, then the person appointed to the top has all the power to shape history.
The Axis argued that humans are shaped by their race and class, so controlling those variants meant the ability to create their vision of a perfect society. This is this impetus of tyranny. In tyranny, the rules of the land are held in the interest of the ruler. This is what Winston Churchill was determined to fight against, as he declared in his statement in the House of Commons on May 13, 1940:
You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: victory; victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival. Let that be realized; no survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge and impulse of the ages, that mankind will move forward towards its goal.
Germany and Japan were fighting for total control of the world around them, via control of the people under them. The United States and the British Empire were fighting for human freedom, a product of human nature. Just as Churchill argued, if the allies had failed to defeat the spread of totalitarianism and communism, they would have failed to secure a flourishing future for all of mankind.

Attorney General Tells Senate: ‘Spying Did Occur’ Against Trump Campaign,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/attorney-general-tells-senate-spying-occur-trump-campaign/,"April 10, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
Attorney General William Barr told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday that he believes intelligence agencies spied on the Trump campaign during the 2016 Presidential election.
“For the same reason we’re worried about foreign influence in elections…spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).
“You’re not suggesting that spying occurred?” Shaheen asked.
“Yes. I think spying did occur,” Barr said.
Barr said he is not necessarily launching an investigation on the FBI, but that he wants to review the “genesis and the conduct” of the FBI’s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and whether any rules were violated.
“Congress is usually concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane and I want to make sure that happened,” he said.
In a New York Times story last May, FBI officials admitted to extensively surveilling Trump campaign affiliates, including Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and George Papadopoulos.
“The F.B.I. obtained phone records and other documents using national security letters—a secret type of subpoena—officials said. And at least one government informant met several times with Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, current and former officials said,” wrote the New York Times.
As Mollie Hemingway pointed out last year , the Times and other media enablers did their best to soften the news of the FBI’s misconduct. The Times wrote that prosecutors simply, “obtained court approval to eavesdrop on Mr. Page.”
The Washington Post even went so far as to say the FBI was only spying as a way to protect the Trump campaign. “Relying on a covert source rather than a more intrusive method of gathering information suggests that the FBI may have been acting cautiously—perhaps too cautiously—to protect the campaign, not undermine it,” wrote Asha Rangappa.
Barr said he also plans to review the criminal referrals that House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-CA) announced on Sunday he would be sending to Barr. Nunes said five of the referrals give names and specific crimes, including lying to Congress, misleading Congress, and leaking classified material.

AG Barr Suggests Multiple Intel Agencies Involved In Anti-Trump Spy Op,thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/barr-confirms-multiple-intel-agencies-implicated-in-anti-trump-spy-operation/,"By Mollie Hemingway April 10, 2019
“Spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Attorney General William Barr told a Senate committee on Wednesday morning. Barr’s comments came in the context of potential Justice Department reviews of the Trump-Russia investigation and how it began in 2016.
While it is important that the top law enforcement in the United States publicly acknowledged that the Obama administration and its intelligence agencies surveilled its domestic political opponents during the heat of a presidential election, it is what he said next that was most startling: that the CIA and other federal agencies in addition to the FBI may have been involved. “I’m not talking about the FBI necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly,” he said.
The FBI, which has incredibly friendly relations with the media, has taken the brunt of the public outcry against the anti-Trump operation. That project included the use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants, national security letters, human informants, and strategic leaking to craft a narrative of treasonous collusion with Russia to steal an election from Hillary Clinton. It even included leaks of classified records from former FBI director James Comey, which he said was done for the purpose of launching a special counsel investigation as retaliation for his firing.
There have always been indications that the operation went far beyond the FBI, however. For example, former CIA director John Brennan, now an MSNBC contributor, separately briefed Sen. Harry Reid, (D-Nev.) about the operation. Reid understood that move was undertaken so he could publicize the Russia investigation to influence the ongoing presidential election campaign .
Former director of national intelligence James Clapper, now a CNN contributor, admitted to discussions with media outlets about the investigation. The U.S. embassy in London was used contrary to established protocol to funnel hearsay that was used as a pretext to officially launch a wide-ranging investigation against the entire Trump orbit. Clinton-connected officials in the State Department were also used to disseminate unverified gossip and allegations about Trump throughout the federal government.
The use of covert individuals to surreptitiously obtain information on private American citizens and share it with the government is the most obvious publicly known indication that agencies beyond the FBI may have been intimately involved in the operation. It is clearly possible that every single instance of intelligence collection was done entirely by the FBI without any assistance from any other federal intelligence agency. However, that has not been determined by any investigative body.
The use of Stefan Halper, for example, a London-based American academic with longstanding ties to the FBI, CIA, and Defense Department, raises serious questions about whether CIA assets or resources were used against American citizens. Following Nixon-era domestic spying abuses by the U.S. intelligence community, oversight bodies restricted the authority of the CIA to spy on U.S. citizens on U.S. soil .
Numerous Trump affiliates were lured to meetings overseas that were then used as the basis for domestic intelligence collection. The formal launch of an enterprise investigation against the Trump campaign was opened following a report that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign advisor, had told a foreign diplomat in London about another overseas meeting during which he was told Russians had dirt on Clinton.
The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake is representative of the media’s award-winning complicity in furthering a baseless conspiracy theory of Russian collusion and concealing the troubling behavior of their most prized sources:
It is discrediting to Blake to cite Clapper, a man who famously lied to Congress about the mass surveillance of American citizens, as a trustworthy source of information on the government’s domestic spying operations. The media’s attempt to claim that the covert surveillance of and collection of information on American citizens tied to the Trump campaign does not constitute “spying” is as absurd today as it was when they first started attempting to claim that a year ago after it was revealed that the FBI had used an overseas intelligence asset in its anti-Trump operation.
The Times headline about the use of government agents to secretly gather evidence against the Trump campaign was — hand to God —“ F.B.I. Used Informant to Investigate Russia Ties to Campaign, Not to Spy, as Trump Claims .”
It’s also false to pretend that the surveillance only occurred against Carter Page and only after he left the campaign, referring to the year-long FISA warrant the FBI and DOJ used against the innocent American citizen using discredited Clinton-campaign research as a basis. That’s wrong on multiple counts. According to The New York Times’ government leakers :
The F.B.I. investigated four unidentified Trump campaign aides in those early months, congressional investigators revealed in February. The four men were Michael T. Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, current and former officials said…
The F.B.I. obtained phone records and other documents using national security letters — a secret type of subpoena — officials said. And at least one government informant met several times with Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, current and former officials said.
Furthermore, even Page’s FISA surveillance allowed U.S. authorities to surveil not just Page but those he was in contact with, including campaign officials, and to search electronic communications sent and received long before the FISA warrant application was initially approved.
The fact of the matter is that federal intelligence agencies spied on a rival political campaign. They illegally leaked information about that surveillance. They abused their authority to at best undermine the duly elected president and at worst to attempt a soft coup against him. They did so with the near-total cooperation of the American media establishment.
This is a scandal of epic proportions. It is one that threatens the foundations of constitutional government. It is a direct attack on American democracy.
If it is true, as the Washington Post asserts, that democracy dies in darkness, then every single improper deed done under the cloak of secrecy must be fully brought to light. The only way to restore the definitively lost credibility of the FBI and other intelligence agencies is through a thorough investigation of what happened, who was involved, and how they will be held accountable.

"In The Era Of Niches, Pop Culture Is Starting To Feel More Mysterious Than Ever",thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/era-niches-pop-culture-starting-feel-mysterious-ever/,"By Emily Jashinsky April 10, 2019
There was a time pop culture was more easily interpreted as something of a statement on the national mood, because the existence of fewer choices meant creators had to appeal to broader audiences. Of course there’s probably always been some measure of a disconnect between Hollywood and the Heartland, but at least in the past we had widely shared media experiences beyond the Super Bowl, meaning it was easier to know what people were watching and how it was affecting us.
This seems to be playing out in late-night television, where hosts are carving out sizable cultural niches that wouldn’t have drawn enough eyeballs in the days where viewership was measured in the double-digits, but works well enough now that audiences are splintered. I think it’s also true in music, where album sales mean less, listeners are trading radio for streaming services, and artists build huge followings on social media.
“Old Town Road” is the top song in the country right now; Billie Eilish has the top album. We still have decent metrics for measuring the popularity of music, but the waning importance of radio means listeners can scatter, and the gatekeepers have less control.
Does Eilish, for instance, enjoy the same level of celebrity someone of equal accomplishment would have had 15 years ago? I don’t know. There are Soundcloud stars, Instagram stars, YouTube stars, Twitter stars, TikTok stars. Some artists, like Eilish and Lil Nas X, transition from success on a platform like Soundcloud to broader reach. But like Vine, TikTok has its own celebrities. So do YouTube and Instagram. We’ll always have George Clooneys and Lady Gagas, but it almost feels like we might be lurching towards a future with fewer superstars and more stars.
We can still read the market a little more clearly in music, and on social media, but the enigma of streaming services illustrates these challenges well. The problem is this: At a time when we’re both more able and more willing to concentrate in niches, we also have fewer metrics to understand what’s actually happening in our culture.
Even Netflix’s self-reported numbers on “Birdbox” didn’t really tell us all that much without means of comparison, which is what makes television ratings worthwhile for culture critics as well as advertisers. In his recent review of “Santa Clarita Diet,” Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter reflected helpfully on this dynamic:
One of the amusements of Netflix’s mystery-driven algorithm is never quite being able to predict what below-the-radar offering is about to become a cultural touchstone — be it the latest star-free rom-com or tawdry true-crime documentary or Israeli domestic melodrama — and what A-list-driven, heavily promoted original is about to become culturally invisible.
I don’t know that Santa Clarita Diet is completely culturally invisible. I’m certain, or certainly hopeful, that it has a dedicated audience. It’s plausible that Santa Clarita Diet is actually a huge hit, because who would ever know with Netflix? I do know that the third Santa Clarita Diet season premiered this week and reviews are sparse (but also enthusiastic, which is what happens when a show reaches a point at which only the critics who like it are bothering to review). I also know that the ‘Awards’ page on the IMDb page for Santa Clarita Diet is limited to a lone nomination (though all praise to the WGA for recognizing series creator Victor Fresco’s hilarious second season finale).
“Maybe Santa Clarita Diet is one of Netflix’s stealth hits? … Santa Clarita Diet isn’t a stealth show,” Fienberg wrote. “It isn’t some quirky, auteur-driven indie meant to be cherished by a tiny, elitist audience of critics like me. Though sometimes even shows in that niche can become invisible.”
We have absolutely no idea. People could be watching “Santa Clarita Diet” in similar numbers to something like “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” or they could be completely ignoring it. The same goes for every show on Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix. We can see what people are chattering about on social media (hardly a representative sample), and where the companies are putting their money. But that’s it. Not only do true “cultural touchstones” seem to be fewer and farther in between in the streaming era, we also have fewer tools to determine what they actually are.
Of course, we still have ratings and box office sales and follower counts and charts that tell us what’s working. For now, at least. The democratization of media also has plenty of advantages. Rather than sitting through gentle political stylings of Jay Leno, liberal viewers can turn to Stephen Colbert, or Hasan Minhaj, or Samantha Bee, or Trevor Noah or even a podcast. Jimmy Fallon offers something different as well.
Conservative viewers with little interest in liberal comedy can catch up on “Last Man Standing.” Quirky shows that may have suffered the “Arrested Development” fate 15 years ago can build niches that make them worth investing in for streaming platforms.
But it also means there’s more incentive for the creators of pop culture to carve us up by our differences rather than find ways to bring us together. It means we’re sharing fewer cultural experiences beyond the process of logging onto Netflix or Spotify, after which the home screen is already customized. On top of all this, it means we’re more and more in the dark about what’s entertaining us, and why that matters. What does cultural impact look like in an era of proliferating niches, where the metrics are murky? Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist.

Boston Globe Op-Ed Urges Waiters To Tamper With Trump Official’s Food,thefederalist.com,Michele Blood,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/boston-globe-op-ed-urges-waiters-tamper-trump-officials-food/,"April 11, 2019 By Michele Blood
Luke O’Neil’s opinion article in Wednesday’s Boston Globe opens lamenting a missed opportunity to adulterate political foe Bill Kristol’s meal with urine and blood. He ends with a half-baked “joke,” telling waiters they would be “serving America” by tampering with soon-to-be-former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s food.
“As for the waiters out there, I’m not saying you should tamper with anyone’s food, as that could get you into trouble. You might lose your serving job,” O’Neil says, cleverly building in some plausible deniability. “But you’d be serving America. And you won’t have any regrets years later,” he concludes, leaving less-than-stable readers to interpret and act on this advice as they may.
Some might argue that O’Neil’s words were tongue-in-cheek: “He’s obviously not really suggesting waiters should poison her. It’s a joke!” “After all, he specifically said they shouldn’t tamper with anyone’s food.”
I would argue that O’Neil, a seasoned writer , communicated his intent quite clearly. He expressed regret over his own missed opportunity for fantasized revenge and suggested others finding themselves in a similar position would do well to strike while the iron is hot. And remember, bodily fluids aren’t just gross, they can carry diseases.
O’Neil took to Twitter on Wednesday afternoon to clarify his stance for his 36,000 followers.
“People who carry out policies of ethnic cleansing or cheerlead for disastrous wars leading to tens of thousands suffering or dead should not expect to be able to show their faces in public anymore thank you for understanding this basic premise,” said O’Neil in a tweeted response to conservative pundit Caleb Hull’s criticism.
After a flurry of criticism, late Wednesday the Globe appended an editor’s note to the top of the story that reads, “A version of this column as originally published did not meet Globe standards and has been changed. The Globe regrets the previous tone of the piece.” The lead and other parts of the article have changed significantly, including the concluding paragraphs in which he suggested waiters should adulterate Nielsen’s food. The opening word “pissing” was also changed to “defiling.” Update: . @bostonglobe has now stealth edited the opinion piece: pic.twitter.com/iEQOdEiaXj
— Eddie Zipperer (@EddieZipperer) April 10, 2019
Here’s the original concluding paragraph that has now been dialed down:
O’Neil’s hypothetical defenders might argue that the First Amendment protects his right to express his objection to the administration’s policies and to Nielsen’s enforcement of those policies. And they would be 100 percent correct. He most assuredly does have a right to express his opinion, and the Globe has the right—some would even say the responsibility—to print those objections.
Yet freedom of speech, of course, is not absolute. The quintessential example of unprotected speech involves yelling “fire” in a crowded theater. That sort of speech is not protected because it endangers others. Other speech may be protected from government censure by the First Amendment, too, but that doesn’t mean everything the First Amendment protects is wise or praiseworthy.
O’Neil’s statement encouraging readers to serve America and avoid regret by tampering with a government official’s food is vile, and deserves public censure. The Globe’s editors should never have published it. Clearly, it endangers Nielsen, who was verbally accosted in a restaurant last summer by protesters who disagreed with the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Who knows what O’Neil might motivate someone to put in a government official’s food.
The concern with O’Neil’s piece goes beyond his arguable incitement to possible threats against a sitting governmental official. The article as a whole, sandwiched by the personal introductory anecdote and the ending word-of-advice, suggests that it is entirely appropriate—even laudable—to express your political opinions through violence.
Ironically, the vehicle through which he expressed that disturbing opinion is speech. The introduction and conclusion to O’Neil’s article not only fails in the humor department, it fails in the ethical journalism department, as well. Are op-eds journalism? No. Do readers often conflate hard news and opinion? Undoubtedly.
Writers of O’Neil’s ilk would argue that their political foes suffer this confusion on a regular basis. In fact, earlier on Wednesday, O’Neil retweeted his article in New York Magazine ’s Intelligencer that bemoaned “close relationships that had been strained or ruined by family members who’d become obsessed with Fox News.” The article sports a screenshot of Fox News opinion host Sean Hannity.
Wednesday evening, O’Neil protected his tweets and publicly issued a non-apology apology for his commentary: “I would like to apologize for my commentary regarding the warden of the baby jail,” he tweeted. In other words, he appears to be doubling down on encouraging people to harass and physically endanger people whose politics they disagree with.
The bottom line is that stable, mentally healthy people do not poison others’ food. Nor do they encourage others to do so in widely read op-eds.

Why Single-Payer Wouldn’t Get Americans More Health Care,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/single-payer-wouldnt-get-americans-health-care/,"April 11, 2019 By Christopher Jacobs
In talking about his single-payer bill, which he reintroduced in the Senate on Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders often claims that “I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right and not a privilege.”
But his legislation would do no such thing. Understanding why demonstrates the inherent drawbacks of his government-centered approach to health policy.
Section 201(a) illustrates the catch in Sanders’ bill , and his philosophy. That section states that “individuals enrolled for benefits under this Act are entitled to have payment made…to an eligible provider” for a list of covered services. Note the wording: Sanders’ bill doesn’t guarantee access to care. Instead, it merely guarantees that people will have their care covered— if they can access it . But in government-run systems, finding access to care often proves no easy feat.
In our own country, low reimbursement rates in many state Medicaid programs can make finding doctors difficult. One 2011 study found that two-thirds of specialist physicians would not accept Medicaid patients, whereas only 11 percent of patients with private insurance could not obtain appointments. Patients with Medicaid also had to wait an average of three weeks longer for an appointment for the few doctors who would see them.
Medicaid suffers from so many access problems that one former director of a state program called a Medicaid card a “hunting license,” because it “gave you a chance to go find a doctor.” That’s the only “guarantee” the Sanders bill actually provides—the guarantee you can try to go find care, not a guarantee you can receive it.
But “access to a waiting list is not access to care.” So ruled four Canadian justices in a landmark 2005 ruling , Chaoulli v. Quebec . In that case, Canada’s Supreme Court overturned Quebec’s ban on private health insurance, finding that it “interfere[d] with life and security,” because “the government is failing to deliver health care in a reasonable manner.”
Indeed, delays and long waits for care plague Canada’s single-payer health system. One study found that approximately 3 percent of the nation’s population remained on waiting lists for care in 2018. From physician referral to the start of treatment, waiting times averaged five months—double that for orthopedic surgery cases.
Government-run health care systems traditionally attempt to contain costs by limiting the available supply of care. Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) follows the same approach as Canada’s single payer system. So patients wait for care there, also.
Consider what happened just last year, when the winter flu outbreak created a national “ crisis ”: The NHS had to cancel tens of thousands of operations, emergency rooms resembled “Third World” conditions, and ambulances waited for hours to unload patients—because hospitals had no place to put them.
The language in Sanders’ legislation demonstrates how, instead of making health care a “right,” single payer would instead increase demand for care—demand the system could not fulfill. To add insult to injury, the Sanders bill would ban private health insurance—the same type of ban Canada’s Supreme Court struck down—here to the United States, giving patients little way out of a clogged government health system.
Promises aside, Sanders’ “guarantee” of coverage would quickly turn into a guarantee that patients would wait, and wait, for care. The American people deserve better.

Democrats’ Denial Over The Lack Of Collusion Could Re-Elect Trump,thefederalist.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/democrats-denial-lack-russian-collusion-re-elect-trump/,"By Jonathan S. Tobin April 11, 2019
Attorney General William Barr’s testimony before Congress this week showed that two years of Democrat hopes that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would end the Donald Trump presidency won’t die easily. As Democrats peppered the legal veteran with questions seeking to portray him as obstructing their justified quest for proof that Mueller might have found some evidence that Trump is guilty of something, they were not so much undermining the country’s belief that it’s time to move on from this fantasy as a displaying self-destructive impulse that might ultimately undo their hopes to oust the president in 2020.
The Democratic Party absorbed a hard blow when the news broke about the Mueller investigation determining there was no collusion with Russia involving the president or his campaign. The prosecutor whom the Democratic faithful were sure would make the bad dream of 2016 go away failed them. After investing so much emotional energy in the notion that the Trump presidency would be proved illegitimate and even illegal, accepting the truth wasn’t easy.
Expecting members of Congress like House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff to apologize for their false accusations and fueling of conspiracy theories about Trump and Russia was not realistic. Nor was it ever likely that the media/entertainment wing of their party would walk back their considerable contributions to Democrat voters’ expectation of Trump’s inevitable doom at Mueller’s hands.
So it is hardly surprising that, in the weeks since Barr’s summary of Mueller’s conclusions was made public, the response from those who did the most to spread the assumption that Trump’s guilt was obvious has been neither contrite nor sober. Minimal Contrition Needed
After a day or two of confusion, Democrats found a fallback position. The failure to indict a single American citizen for colluding with the Russians in 2016 and the summary of Mueller’s conclusions made it clear that the conspiracy theory about Trump being a Russian asset or plotting with Moscow to steal the election from Hillary Clinton was a fantasy. But collusion theorists still had a last ditch to fall back into to defend their evaporating hopes.
The release of the full Mueller report was delayed due to the attorney general’s duty to redact classified information—confidential grand jury testimony and items relating to ongoing investigations, as well as material that might implicate or otherwise damage the reputations for peripheral third parties that were innocent of any wrongdoing in the case.
This is exactly what Democrats called for a generation ago when the special prosecutor’s office led by Kenneth Starr released the results of its investigation into President Bill Clinton’s sexual misconduct and related perjury. But to those trying to hold onto hope that Mueller could damage Trump, it has provided an opening, albeit a narrow one.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler demanded that Congress be given the entire report without redactions and even set an April 2 deadline for Barr to deliver it. Barr ignored the demand and now the committee has issued a subpoena for the material. The Redactions Are Indeed Necessary
The argument against giving Congress the full report without the redactions is as obvious as it is appropriate. Congress is an informational sieve. The chances that this material will be kept secret are approximately zero. Barr might as well publish every classified secret or page of grand jury testimony himself as give it to Nadler.
A redacted report would still deliver all relevant material to both the Congress and the public to explain how Mueller managed to spend two years investigating Trump without discovering anything that would lead to a single collusion-related indictment, let alone even coming to a conclusion about the preposterous charge that the president obstructed justice by exercising his constitutional right to fire an out-of-control FBI director. Yet it also leaves Democrats and their media/entertainment complex cheering section an opening to keep their conspiracy theories alive. They would do far better to ignore this impulse.
The demand for the full report has already led to charges from the likes of MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and writers like Esquire’s Charles Pierce that the longer Barr holds onto the report, the less they will trust what is released. That is true even though Mueller and his staff are working with Barr on the redactions.
Almost on cue, various anonymous sources who claimed to know those working on the Mueller probe were telling The New York Times and the Washington Post that some of the special counsel’s staff were unhappy with Barr’s summary even though their failure to indict anyone for collusion spoke even louder than his four pages about the collapse of the Russian conspiracy theory.
In due time, doubtless the late-night comedians and the “Saturday Night Live” cast will also take up this theme. The redactions will become like a pirate’s buried treasure or a lost Romanov heir that will haunt Democrats’ imaginations with greater power with each passing week that the left promotes the notion that Barr is holding back some nugget that will damage or even destroy the Trump presidency.
Nadler’s effort will be adjudicated in the courts, where the battle will, no doubt, drag on for months and perhaps well into the 2020 presidential campaign. But rather than an ongoing problem for Trump, it will be a blessing in disguise. The Mueller Report Can Still Answer Democrats’ Prayers
On a human level, it’s understandable that those who not only believed in the Trump collusion theory, but also thought it would ultimately solve the nation’s problems, refuse to give up their faith. The Republican’s victory in 2016 was so unexpected and shocking that for some it was easier to accept as having only been made possible by foul play rather than merely the result of 30 states’ voters deciding to choose Trump rather than Clinton.
Yet the willingness of responsible politicians and opinion influencers in media and entertainment to give credence to this particular conspiracy will do material harm to their hopes that Trump will be limited to one term in office. It may be that most Americans have long since made up their minds about Trump and nothing will budge them from positions of abhorrence or support. But now that the verdict on collusion is in, most Americans would prefer if the governing and chattering classes moved on.
So long as the anti-Trump resistance is focused on their faith that he is a criminal who must be frog-marched in handcuffs out of the White House rather than just a vulgar politician who has surprisingly embraced conservative political stands, Democrats will be distracted from the issues voters care most about. Rather than engaging the energy of Trump-haters, dragging out the search for evidence of a conspiracy that can never be proved will dispirit and discourage them, even if the exercise will serve as a kind of collective group therapy to soothe their still raw wounds from Trump’s triumph.
More to the point, the Mueller probe is now a source of strength for Trump. By questioning Trump’s innocence in collusion after Mueller failed to prove his guilt, Democrats are ensuring that this failure isn’t forgotten amid debates about health care, immigration, and other issues where they have arguments rather than unhinged conspiracy theories about treason to hurl at him.
If Trump critics want to put this debacle behind them, they must stop talking about Barr and Mueller. The alternative is to keep alive an issue that will fire up the GOP base and undermine Democrats’ credibility with voters who are unlikely to be willing to go on following them down the collusion rabbit hole.

The Latest Stats Reveal The Border Crisis Is Getting Worse,thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/latest-stats-reveal-border-crisis-getting-worse/,"By John Daniel Davidson April 11, 2019
The numbers released this week by U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirm what we should all know by now: the crisis at the southern border is real, and it’s getting worse. In a press release , CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert E. Perez referred to the situation as a “system-wide emergency in our processing and holding facilities,” which are beyond capacity because of the ongoing surge of noncitizen families and minors crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.
After the busiest February at the border since 2007, consider the figures for March. U.S. immigration authorities apprehended or turned back more than 103,000 people last month, up from about 76,000 in February, up from about 58,000 in January. According to Perez, U.S. Border Patrol has seen a 370 percent increase in the number of family units apprehended this year compared to the same period last year. In just the first six months of the fiscal year, CBP has apprehended and turned back more than 422,000 people—more than the total for all of 2017 and only 100,000 less than the total for 2018.
At this rate, the total number of migrants apprehended or turned back at ports of entry this year could well exceed 1 million. That hasn’t happened in more than a decade. And while it’s true that we’re a long way from the peak year of 1.6 million apprehensions in 2000, what’s happening now isn’t comparable to what happened back then . The Numbers Are Increasing Across All Categories
To understand why it’s not comparable, we have to dig into the statistics CBP released this week. Here’s the chart showing overall numbers of apprehensions and what the agency calls “inadmissibles,” which are those who show up at a port of entry seeking admission to the United States but whom officials determine are not eligible, or admissible. (This is always a much smaller number than apprehensions: in March, 10,885 inadmissibles compared to 92,607 apprehensions).
The dramatic red line swooping up there tells you things are worse this year than they have been since 2014, when a massive surge of unaccompanied minors and families on the border overwhelmed federal immigration agencies. Indeed, that’s the main reason comparisons to peak illegal immigration years are so unhelpful. Back in the early 2000s, when CBP was apprehending 1 million or more people a year, most of them were Mexican adults who were easily deported, usually the same day they were picked up.
That’s not what’s happening now. Look at the table below: U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 53,077 families in March, more than half the total of all apprehensions and inadmissibles for the month, and a dramatic increase from the previous five months.
Nearly all these families are from Central America, and unlike single adults from Mexico, they are claiming asylum after crossing the border, which means they can’t be easily deported or detained but are instead released with an order to appear before an immigration judge (a process that can take years because of a massive backlog in our immigration courts).
At the peak in 2000, the vast majority of apprehensions on the southwest border were of Mexican nationals, with less than 30,000 OTMs, or “other than Mexico.” Today, there are more non-Mexicans than Mexicans being apprehended: 244,322 last year, compared to 152,257 Mexicans. See the chart below by Pew Research Center showing this dramatic change over the past two decades.
But notice something else in the March figures. There were 30,555 single adults apprehended, a 30 percent increase from February and a 63 percent increase from January. Why the sudden uptick? One explanation is that the influx of families and minors turning themselves in has sapped Border Patrol resources, diverting huge numbers of agents from their primary job of patrolling the border and instead tasking them with transporting and processing asylum-seekers. The agency has also taken the extraordinary step of shutting down some inland checkpoints in order to deal with the surge of families and minors.
That has likely had the effect of increasing the number of adults trying to cross the border and evade detection. An increase in apprehensions usually means there are more people trying to cross, and now that word has gotten out that Border Agents are being diverted from checkpoints and line patrols, adults who want to slip into the U.S. undetected no doubt see a good opportunity. Often, single adults try to evade detection because they have a criminal history and will be deported if they’re caught, which is why they generally have to pay smugglers more, thousands more, to cross the border than families do. Congress Alone Can Fix This
So what do all these numbers mean for the broader immigration debate? Above all, the numbers show that the crisis isn’t going away on its own. By now, families across Central America know that if they can just get to the border with at least one child they can claim asylum, easily pass an initial “credible fear” test, and be admitted into the United States. Once released from federal custody and issued a temporary work permit while their asylum case wends its way through immigration court, they’re free to work, send money home, and, if they choose to, abscond.
There’s really nothing the Trump administration, acting only through executive authority, can do to stop any of this. Between federal asylum laws that make it difficult to adjudicate claims quickly, and court rulings that prevent federal authorities from detaining families and minors for more than 20 days, “catch and release” is the de facto policy. For all the attention it’s gotten in the media, Trump’s recent shake-up of DHS and ICE, like the government shutdown last year over funding for a border wall, is mostly a sideshow at this point.
The only thing that will end the border crisis is congressional action. Until lawmakers decide to reform our asylum system, establish statutory rules about the detention of families and minors, and appropriate more funding for detention facilities and immigration judges, this will continue. In fact, it will probably get much worse. John is a senior correspondent for The Federalist. Follow him on Twitter. Photo John Davidson"
6 Criminal Referrals DOJ Is Ignoring Because The Perps Are Anti-Trump,thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/6-criminal-referrals-the-doj-is-ignoring-because-the-perpetrators-are-democrats/,"By Adam Mill April 11, 2019
The term “justice” is defined as “the maintenance or administration of what is just especially by the impartial adjustments of conflicting claims or the assignment of merited rewards or punishments.” Our Department of Justice (DOJ), the institution that boldly claims this term in its title, will soon receive eight fresh criminal referrals from Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who still clings to the notion that the DOJ might enforce the law impartially.
It’s not hard to predict what the DOJ will do with these referrals: It will add them to the pile of phony investigations and refuse to answer any questions with an, “I’m sorry, but the DOJ doesn’t discuss cases under investigation .” As noted by Paul Sperry, the DOJ is slow-walking or no-walking its investigations of many lawless acts to undermine the Trump administration and interfere with the 2016 election.
It’s a scandal how the DOJ so clearly operates without a blindfold to check the politics of a wrongdoer before deciding to do something about misconduct. Let’s review recent history of criminal referrals to grade the Department of Justice’s impartiality. 1. Andrew McCabe
Congress referred McCabe for criminal prosecution on April 18, 2018. As noted by the DOJ’s own inspector general, “On August 31, 2017, the OIG opened an investigation of McCabe following [the FBI’s inspection division]’s referral … after [it] became concerned that McCabe may have lacked candor when questioned by … agents about his role in the disclosure to the [Wall Street Journal].”
The inspector general documented several instances of potentially criminal false statements by McCabe to FBI investigators. In spite of a completed DOJ inspector general’s report, however, McCabe remains , “under investigation” for two years since the original misconduct. McCabe is currently promoting a book critical of Trump. 2. Glenn Simpson
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) did not formally refer Glenn Simpson for criminal prosecution but has made a compelling case that a perjury investigation is warranted. Simpson testified to Congress that Fusion GPS had no client after the election for which his company continued anti-Trump research. This is a lie and a particularly obvious one.
Fusion GPS operations against Trump continued after the election and appear to be presently ongoing. As noted by Sperry, Fusion GPS now works for “The Democracy Integrity Project, or TDIP and ‘pumps out daily ‘research briefings’ to prominent Washington journalists, as well as congressional staffers, to keep the Russia ‘collusion’ narrative alive.” He also notes, “Simpson also appears to have been the source behind another discredited McClatchy story about Trump attorney Michael Cohen traveling to Prague during the campaign to hatch a plot with Kremlin officials to hack Clinton campaign emails.” 3. Christopher Steele
On February 5, 2018, senators Grassley and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) referred Christopher Steele for criminal prosecution for lying about his contacts with numerous media organization prior to the election. This is extremely relevant to Americans and Congress, as Steele worked for Hillary Clinton as he passed off his dummy intelligence report to media in an effort to influence public opinion against Trump.
Steele, of course, is the author and compiler of the infamous opposition research dossier that formed a pretext for U.S. intelligence agencies surveiling an opposition party presidential campaign. 4. Rod Rosenstein
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the Robert Mueller investigation, is suspected of being a party to an abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process leading to a court-issued warrant based upon suspect information.
Former U.S. Attorney Jo DiGenova claimed to have inside information that Rosenstein is being investigated for his role in the questionable FISA surveillance. We should be skeptical of this claim, as Rosenstein has functionally run all things related to Trump-Russia since he took over in 2017, and he’s unlikely to authorize an investigation into his own behavior. 5. James Comey
On April 18, 2018, members of Congress referred former FBI director James Comey for prosecution for leaking classified information and for lying about the decision to exonerate Hillary Clinton. Comey claimed the decision was made without DOJ input and not until after Clinton’s interview. Both of those claims do not appear to be true. 6. Hillary Clinton
In the same April 18, 2018, letter , the members of Congress referred Hillary Clinton for using campaign money to hire Fusion GPS to smear Donald Trump (without disclosing this use of campaign funds).
Sperry made this observation, “While some witnesses and their attorneys complain [the U.S. attorney assigned to investigate the Deep State misconduct] is not doing his job, some critics who once had high hopes for Huber now suspect he was never expected to. They say Huber’s appointment was always political, that the Justice Department had no interest in exposing its own corruption and named this longtime department official to mollify Republicans who clamored for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate FBI and Justice activities under the Obama administration.”
Rosenstein recently spoke on the principle of the “rule of law,” telling us “we should defend, cherish, and champion neutral legal principles and processes—in practice and not just on paper.” He added, “John MacArthur Maguire described law as a system of ‘wise restraints that make men free.’ The restraints preserve liberty because they are prescribed in advance, and they apply to everyone, without regard to rank or status ” (emphasis mine).
Coming from Rosenstein, the architect of so much unfairness, these high ideas sound like taunts to the public not within the velvet rope of the upper tier of our two-tiered justice system.

"If You Don't Like Gerrymandering, Complain To Lawmakers, Not Courts - The Federalist",thefederalist.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/dont-like-gerrymandering-complain-representatives-not-courts/,"By Thomas Wheatley April 11, 2019
Amid today’s partisan rancor, partisan gerrymandering—manipulating the boundaries of an electoral constituency to favor one party over another—has assumed a special place of public scorn.
An easy bogeyman for populists of all political stripes, gerrymandering has emerged as our political bête noire, derided by a reliable stream of sanctimonious bromides (usually something about “ politicians choosing their voters ”) and facile videos featuring simple shapes and colors. What’s more, gerrymandering has been supposedly correlated with voter suppression and called a “ national scandal ” by no less than The Terminator himself.
Fortunately, there is reason to celebrate—or so we are told. On March 26, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases out of Maryland and North Carolina concerning what plaintiffs believe are unconstitutionally gerrymandered congressional districts.
If you’re getting a sense of déjà vu, you’re not alone. It’s been less than a year since the court last had an opportunity to identify a workable legal standard when considering the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering. In June of last year, the justices vacated and remanded a Wisconsin case without ruling on the case’s merits. Prior to that, the court had taken a crack at partisan gerrymandering no fewer than four times, and in none of those cases did a majority of justices agree on a clear rule on what constitutes an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.
If the Supreme Court considers a question on five separate occasions and is consistently unable to produce a clear answer—or a clear legal standard—it is a strong indication the court has stepped outside its constitutional role and is trying to do something it isn’t meant to do. That lends credence to the argument that such cases are nonjusticiable, or constitutionally improper for a court to resolve.
As Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in 2004 in Vieth v. Jubelirer when confronted with supposedly “meandering and irregular” congressional districts in Pennsylvania, “Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.” (Frustratingly, Kennedy declined to join four other justices in declaring the question nonjusticiable, opting instead for an equivocal, never-say-never approach that has haunted to court to this day).
Some reject the conclusion that the question is nonjusticiable, often claiming that partisan gerrymandering should be treated no differently than racial gerrymandering. This comparison is apples to oranges. Where racial discrimination is presumptively invalid under a standard of strict scrutiny, the court has long held that “politics and political considerations are inseparable from districting and apportionment,” and that “districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences.”
Moreover, it is not clear what the constitutional harm is when a sovereign state draws district boundaries that disadvantage one party over another. Indeed, the proposition that a majority of voters in a state should be able to elect a majority of their congressional delegation is a pernicious pipe dream of constitutional lore that, in fact, was explicitly rejected by a majority of the justices in Vieth .
That makes sense. That a presidential candidate from one party, for example, can (and sometimes does) win an election without the popular vote does not mean the losing candidate’s party has an enforceable right under the Constitution to redraw state boundaries to be “fairer”—or, for that matter, even proportional to the final vote count at all (assuming, of course, that winning the presidency is a fair analogy for winning a majority of seats in a congressional delegation). Instead, like congressional district mapping, aggrieved voters in the losing candidate’s party would need to seek redress through their state legislatures and the U.S. Congress.
It may be true gerrymandering is bad for our republic. But the courts have no business resolving it. Rather, it is up to our lawmaking bodies to establish the “substantive principles of fairness” and the “clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards” Justice Kennedy described and lower courts can use. To be sure, that will ultimately require some heavy lifting by the voters in their communities and at the ballot box—heavy lifting that the Constitution demands.

Is Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange A Foreign Spy Or A News Publisher?,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/is-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-a-foreign-spy-or-a-news-publisher/,"By David Harsanyi April 11, 2019
Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, publisher of whistleblowers, and Vladimir Putin’s lackey , was arrested in London on behalf of the U.S. government for “computer related offences” after Ecuador withdrew its asylum protection. Assange, who had skipped on bail in the summer of 2012 when under investigation for sexual assault and rape in Sweden, took up residency in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for the next seven years.
Assange’s transparent cooperation with Russian intelligence in its efforts to undermine American interests and embarrass the United States is hardly in question. The notion Assange is a non-ideological warrior fighting to expose the “unvarnished truth” about all abusive governments—as The New York Times once claimed —is a myth .
That said, I’m also reflexively uncomfortable with the idea of the Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecuting publishers for disseminating classified documents. Without whistleblowers and illegal disclosures, governments would often get away with grievous abuses of power. Even if those leaks are politically motivated, and even if the release of those documents fail to offer proper context, in the long run, protecting journalistic institutions that pursue transparency is a net benefit for free society.
And let’s not kid ourselves, even if journalists don’t openly solicit stolen classified materials, they are implicitly hoping to get their hands on as much as possible. Everyone knows this. In 2017, Hollywood was still celebrating the uncompromising bravery of Washington Post journalists, who 50 years earlier had published the Pentagon Papers , which consisted of illegally stolen classified documents that exposed 30 years of American involvement in the Vietnam War.
Some mainstream journalists differentiate themselves from those who dump caches of raw documents into the public record by arguing that they, professionals, can synthesize information, offering context and judgement. Some of these journalists also spent the past two years (selectively) passing on illegal leaks to create a “collusion” narrative, so I beg to differ.
It’s also worth noting that many journalists had a very different take on WikiLeaks before Assange allegedly undermined Hillary Clinton’s chance in the 2016 presidential election by publishing John Podesta’s hacked DNC emails. WikiLeaks was often portrayed as a journalistic endeavor and worthy bulwark against government abuse.
“There are lots of things that governments have the right to keep secret,” then-New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller explained , when speaking about the “value” of WikiLeaks. ”It’s their job to keep it secret. It’s not the press’s job to do that.”
Keller isn’t wrong. But there’s a problem.
“If Assange can be prosecuted merely for publishing leaked classified documents,” a piece in The Atlantic argued last year, “every single media outlet is at risk of prosecution for doing the exact same thing.” This is a compelling reason to worry. However, one fact that’s often skipped over by Assange’s defenders is that he’s not merely being charged with transmitting classified information obtained from a whistleblower. According to the indictment (and there’s a chance of additional charges), Assange actively attempted to participate in espionage. He didn’t merely get his hands on information or solicit it. The Australian is charged with a computer hacking conspiracy, because he conspired to assist then-Bradley Manning, a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, with cracking codes that allowed the two to break into classified files.
These efforts led to the biggest leak in military history, resulting in thousands of classified logs covering the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq being dumped and shared with our enemies. Manning faced justice, and was sentenced to 35 years at Leavenworth before President Barack Obama commuted the sentence after seven. Why should Assange be spared the same justice?
If, for instance, Assange was being extradited to face charges for publishing Podesta’s hacked emails, it would be a clear to me that the government was violating free press protections. Whether this kind of behavior is ethically wrong or not, in some way or another, every major journalistic outfit in the United States has acted in a similar way.
BuzzFeed, for example, published a raw “dossier”—really a partisan campaign document—that included unsubstantiated rumors that were probably passed on by Kremlin sources to destabilize American elections (the point of all these intrusions by Putin). Knowingly or unknowingly, those who used the dossier were helping Russians perpetuate conspiracy theories that undermined faith in a U.S. election. Even if BuzzFeed is an activist organization, it still merely passing information along.
Now, it’s also likely true that Assange is only ostensibly being prosecuted for conspiracy and hacking, when in reality the DOJ simply wants to punish him for disseminating documents that were used in propaganda efforts against the United States, aided our enemies logistically, and embarrassed our establishment domestically. In the same way that mafia thugs were often brought down on tax evasion rather than murder, this is how the DOJ can get their man.
That might be so. The best way avoid this kind of predicament is by not colluding in actual spying. So while I’m sympathetic to the principled arguments being employed by Assange defenders, it’s unlikely they’re applicable in this case."
“fbi” – Google News: Stefanik Moves To Prevent Comey-Era Spy Abuses At FBI – The Federalist,thefederalist.com,mikenova,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/stefanik-moves-to-prevent-comey-era-spy-abuses-at-fbi/,"April 11, 2019 By Mollie Hemingway
Elise Stefanik, a Republican lawmaker who sits on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, introduced legislation Wednesday that would require the FBI director to promptly inform Congress when investigations of candidates for federal office are undertaken by federal law enforcement or intelligence authorities.
Two years ago, when then-FBI Director James Comey finally notified Congress that he’d opened up a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign the previous year, some members were deeply troubled. Not only was the FBI director not supposed to hide his counterintelligence work from a key group of congressional members who receive his briefings, he was supposed to notify them in particular about politically sensitive probes.
The legislation from Stefanik, a three-term representative from New York, addresses a loophole in current law that allowed Comey to unilaterally withhold that information from key congressional oversight bodies. In a March 2016 hearing, Comey admitted to Stefanik that he did not follow the typical protocols or procedures regarding notifying Congress about the opening of a counterintelligence investigation in part because he was not required to do so.
Pressed to explain why he waited nine months to brief the leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees, he admitted he was supposed to provide quarterly updates but had refused to do so regarding the Trump-Russia probe for the same reason many thought he should have done so. “I think our decision was, it was a matter of such sensitivity that we wouldn’t include it in the quarterly briefings,” he said.
Comey suggested in testimony that he did not make the decision to hide the information from Congress, placing the blame on the “head of our counterintelligence division.” But Bill Priestap, the former assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division, told a joint congressional committee it was Comey himself who made the decision to hide the existence of the anti-Trump spy operation from Congress.
“Mr. Comey was involved in those notifications. I was not,” Priestap told lawmakers. “I don’t instruct Mr. Comey, nor did I ever instruct him to do anything.” When Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked him point-blank “Who made the decision not to brief Congress in this particular instance?” Priestap said, “Mr. Comey.”
Stefanik’s legislation would formalize the requirement of quarterly updates on counterintelligence briefings. In addition, it would require the FBI director to “promptly notify” the committees if the agency was investigating any candidate for federal office, any candidate’s campaign, or any individual known to be affiliated with a campaign.
The Trump-Russia probe from the 2016 campaign touched off a massive scandal that included wiretaps of private citizens, weaponization of campaign-funded opposition research, the deployment of overseas intelligence assets against American citizens, and allegations that America’s top law enforcement and intelligence officials were attempting a soft coup of the duly-elected president of the United States. That probe, thanks to strategic leaks from intelligence officials, then folded into Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s sprawling two-year-long investigation. It resulted in zero charges related to collusion or conspiracy with Russia to steal the election from Hillary Clinton.
Attorney General William Barr acknowledged the spy operation before the Senate Wednesday, and said he is reviewing the origins of the probe.

‘Unplanned’ The Book Reveals Women Who Abort Are Not All Duped,thefederalist.com,Georgi Boorman,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/unplanned-book-reveals-women-abort-not-duped/,"By Georgi Boorman April 11, 2019
Whether or not you plan on seeing the pro-life film “Unplanned,” and regardless of whether you consider yourself pro-life or pro-choice, you should consider reading the book on which it is based.
Former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson’s biographical narrative about her conversion from pro-choice to pro-life is powerful, not just in illustrating how evidence can change the mind of even the most dedicated abortion devotee, but in its unique insight into the nature of front-line abortion clinic workers like herself and abortion seekers. The book is almost guaranteed to shift your perspective on one or both groups.
Some aspects of the abortion mindset she discusses are fairly easy to wrap your head around. For example, in many cases, women come in for an abortion with the mindset of “If I have this child,” as if a baby were still a potentiality. That is how Johnson described her own thought process regarding her two abortions. “What I saw,” she writes, “and by now was reinforcing in the minds of other young women as part of the Planned Parenthood organization, was that I was in a condition of pregnancy. ”
She confessed she suspected that keeping the pregnancy a secret from her parents was an attempt to “avoid it becoming ‘real’ for me” (p. 45). Like most women, she declined to see the ultrasound photos after the clinic workers determined how far along she was in her pregnancy. “My story. . . illustrates the complexity, the confusion, and frankly, the disconnect between behavior and values that permeates our culture,” she writes. “I spent many years counseling women whose thought patterns were not unlike my own.” Yes, the Abortion Industry Deceives Women
Women who choose abortion are not monolithic, although people on both sides of the proverbial (and literal) fence often treat them as such. It is considered orthodoxy among both pro-lifers and pro-choicers that women who face unplanned pregnancies are victims, though their victimhood is framed in different ways. While pro-choicers insist they are victims of difficult circumstances, and more so of their own power of reproduction, pro-lifers say women are victims of a predatory abortion industry that has filled their heads with propaganda.
I recently interviewed Johnson on my podcast , and she didn’t mince words on the length Planned Parenthood goes to narrow the scope of perceived choices for women in unplanned pregnancies. She told me no one was promoting adoption as an option before she brought in representatives from adoption agencies to train the staff on adoption counseling. “That was very looked down upon by my superiors,” she said.
Abby believes exploitation of both women and children is intrinsic to abortion: “Any time you are oppressing the rights of another person in order to uphold your own rights, that is one of the definitions of abortion. . .[abortion] can’t be separated from its exploitive nature.” It’s only logical to consider women who abort as victims of exploitation. But All Women Are Not Deceived
Yet that does not mean all women are manipulated to the same extent, or that they have been deprived of their free will by cultural mores or pro-choice sloganeering. The experiences Johnson recounts in the book reveal the diversity of women who find themselves in an abortion facility, and a diversity of choices made from within it.
Women who abort their children range from women who find out they are having twins and decide not to abort (not uncommon, according to Johnson), to a woman in her 36th week who offered her baby up for adoption, to much more heartbreaking accounts in which one would be hard-pressed not to consider the pregnant woman cold-hearted. Johnson recalls:
The first time I ever encountered a woman seeking a late-term abortion left me shaken. She, too, was petite, but with a big, full, pregnant belly. She looked like she could give birth at any time. I happened to be filling in at the front desk when she walked in.
‘I’d like to schedule an abortion, please.’
I did a double-take. Her tone of voice was as nonchalant as if she’d just ordered a Big Mac. I ushered her to the back where we could talk privately and asked her to talk to me about why she’d come in.
‘I just found out I’m pregnant and I’ve just got to get this thing out of me. I feel like I have an alien inside me.’ I was so taken aback I was speechless. I spent some time listening and asking questions, doing an intake interview, and trying to get a handle on the real story. Though I found her perspective shocking, she seemed fully cognizant of the facts. Yet somehow she truly seemed not to have realized she was pregnant until quite recently, and no matter how far along she was, she wanted that baby aborted.
. . .An ultrasound revealed this woman’s baby was twenty-three weeks. I explained to her that abortion was not an option for her at Planned Parenthood.
She would not be thwarted in her goal. ‘Then where can I get this thing taken out of me?’ (p. 96-97)
After describing the late-term abortion procedure to her in detail, Johnson remembers her reply. “Yeah, I know how it’s done. I don’t care. I’ve just got to have this abortion.”
She narrates another client case that left a distinct impression on her. Here, she details the scene as she seeks to escort a young woman into the office for her scheduled abortion:
As I approached the girl’s car, she got out on one side and the friend who had accompanied her got out on the other. Her mom was standing just outside the fence calling to her, obviously in real emotional pain. The rest of the family stood in a semicircle behind the mom. I stepped up beside the girl and put my hand on her back. ‘I’ll bring you around to the back entrance. It’ll be quicker that way.’
The girl didn’t answer. The mother’s voice, through her weeping, was filled with desperation. ‘You don’t have to do this,’ she called, her voice anguished. ‘We want to help you. We can support you. You can live at home. We’ll give you money – whatever it takes! Don’t do this.’ Her mother’s pleas were so heartbreaking that my heart was pounding with the tension.
And as I stood waiting, the back door of the car opened and a little girl got out – maybe two years old. It was the daughter of the who’d come in to have the abortion! And as she stepped up beside her mother, she saw her grandmother on the other side of the fence. ‘Hey, mamá!’ she called innocently.
The grandmother wept even harder. Hanging on to the fence now as if to support herself, she cried out, ‘The baby you’re carrying will be just as beautiful as the daughter you already have! Just think if you had decided to abort her – think of all the joy she has brought into our lives. Imagine a world without her! Please – you don’t have to do this!’
. . .I escorted her inside. ‘Are you alright? Do you need to talk about this first? Are you sure this is what you want to do? Because it sounds like you’d have a lot of support from your family if you were to keep the baby.’
I am not sure what I expected, but it wasn’t what I saw next. She shrugged it off. ‘Oh, that’s just my mom,’ she said. ‘That’s how she is. I’m fine.’ (p. 118-120)
The compassion Johnson feels for women in unplanned pregnancies or other difficult circumstances radiates through the whole book, even during her time at Planned Parenthood. In fact, it was her compassion that drove her, misguidedly, to continue working for Planned Parenthood for so long. It is a motivation she said other coworkers sincerely shared. Women Are Not Always Victims in Choosing Abortion
The patient members of the Coalition for Life on the other side of the fence, just outside the clinic parking lot, shared that compassion and desired to extend grace and help toward even the most firmly “abortion-minded” women. Johnson credits and praises God’s grace over and over throughout the pages of “Unplanned,” particularly in revealing to her the truth about abortion.
That is why Johnson’s stories of such clients should prompt readers to consider whether we’ve painted the abortion-minded with too broad a brush, whether we’ve adopted rhetoric that isn’t as accurate and precise as it should be, or limited their interpretation based on our assumptions. For instance, does “love them both” mean that women under no circumstances should ever be held accountable for illegal abortions? The common assumption that love and justice are mutually exclusive, and that women are only victims, leads many to that conclusion.
While “Unplanned” doesn’t deal with those questions head-on, it does challenge us to think outside our pro-life or pro-choice boxes and to think holistically about abortion-minded women, as well as the clinic workers who facilitate their abortions. The women waiting in the clinic lobby are more complicated than any snappy line that can fit on a poster board, and Abby is living proof that the workers who interact with abortion clients aren’t necessarily hard-hearted or bent on evil. In the book, she recalled telling her husband that if every Planned Parenthood clinic employee saw what she saw in the ultrasound-guided abortion, half would quit.
As with all big issues, it matters whether we establish our discourse on abortion with pie charts and slogans or with an empathetic grasp of the complexity of the set of actors in question. Each main camp on abortion pitches their policy positions as the most dignified and compassionate, as the most humanizing.
Yet humanizing those actors doesn’t mean shoving them all in a victimhood box and calling it compassion and mercy. Nor does it mean making one particular person with a convenient story the standard-bearer for a whole demographic.
Humanizing means learning about how real people conceive of their own choices, as shocking and repulsive or utterly heart-wrenching as they may be, or as small or big a percentage of a group they reflect. Those stories aren’t the basis for morality, as if our feelings could decide right from wrong, but they are part of the foundation of civil, truth-loving, and effective advocacy.
Don’t just take a page out of “Unplanned” that’s convenient to your preconceived ideas. Take all the inconvenient ones, too."
Trump Is Right: Puerto Rico Shouldn’t Get More Hurricane Subsidies,thefederalist.com,Ned Ryun,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/trump-right-puerto-rico-shouldnt-get-hurricane-subsidies/,"April 11, 2019 By Ned Ryun
In the last week, President Trump has been denounced for opposing more taxpayer funds for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Trump has put the blame squarely on the corrupt political leadership of Puerto Rico and highlighted that Puerto Rico has received more relief funding than Florida and Texas combined.
While there is some disagreement over the exact figure that Puerto Rico has received, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has reported $20 billion in hurricane recovery funds, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency has funded an additional $8 billion and the Small Business Administration has approved $2 billion in loans. Yet we are told Puerto Rico needs more of American taxpayers’ money.
Democrats are insisting that American taxpayers continue to further fund Puerto Rican leaders’ additional demands. The fact of the matter is, not one more dime in funding should be sent to Puerto Rico until it gets its political house in order, either of its own accord or by the Trump administration forcing systematic change. Putting more money into a broken system won’t fix anything. Most importantly, it will only continue to hurt our fellow citizens—the people of Puerto Rico.
The real problems facing the people of Puerto Rico have nothing to do with Trump, or the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. It has nothing to do with statehood or continuing its territorial status. It has nothing to do with caring or not caring. It is about rank corruption in which the people of Puerto Rico are the victims and the corrupt Puerto Rican political class are the villains.
For decades, Puerto Rico has been governed by a patronage system centered on the 78 mayors across the island, who are truly the real political power in Puerto Rico. Many of the mayors have been more than happy to cut deals that allow them to stay in power even if it means failing to actually do their jobs, like collecting property taxes, utility bills, and fees for basic services. Current estimates indicate there is a pool of $3 billion in uncollected property taxes.
According to a recent U.S. Treasury report, there are hundreds of thousands of properties on the island that are either unregistered or improperly defined because the Puerto Rican titling system hasn’t been updated in nearly 70 years. Even worse, there is a pool of billions of dollars, by some estimates in the neighborhood of $10 billion, in uncollected water bills, electric bills, and tourism tax dollars.
Who wins in this system? The politicians and the politically powerful who can cut a deal with elected officials.
But what’s a few billion among friends when it allows certain people to stay in power and their patrons to have bigger bank accounts? Everyone walks away happy — except, of course, the average citizen of Puerto Rico, who is then left with decaying infrastructure and fewer basic services because there is no tax revenue to fund these vital projects.
If Puerto Rico would fix its tax system, both with respect to property taxes and basic services, it would result in nearly a billion dollars in annual revenue. That’s a billion dollars annually that their fellow Americans would no longer need to send to prop up Puerto Rico.
Instead, the American taxpayers are expected to be an open checkbook with no strings attached to fund a broken and corrupt system. The answer is not to further abuse taxpayers by sending more federal dollars to Puerto Rico. The answer is “Puerto Rico, heal thyself.”
The press and the Democrats will never acknowledge that Trump is right. It would be nice, for once, to see every Republican in Washington DC support him, truly help the people of Puerto Rico, and protect American taxpayers.

Top Obama WH Lawyer Charged With Lying About Foreign Collusion,thefederalist.com,Sean Davis,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/obamas-top-white-house-lawyer-indicted-for-concealing-lying-about-foreign-collusion/,"April 11, 2019 By Sean Davis
A federal grand jury on Thursday charged Greg Craig with conspiring to hide his paid collusion with a foreign government and lying about that work to federal officials. Craig, a high-powered Beltway lawyer, served as President Barack Obama’s top White House lawyer during the former president’s first year in office.
According to the formal indictment of Craig , which the Department of Justice released Thursday afternoon, the Democrat superlawyer “did unlawfully, knowingly, and willfully falsify, conceal, and cover up” his work on behalf of the Ukrainian government.
“The purpose of the scheme was for CRAIG to avoid registration as an agent of Ukraine,” the indictment alleges. “Registration would require disclosure of the fact that” an unnamed Ukrainian had “paid CRAIG and the Law Firm more than $4 million[.]”
The indictment alleges that Craig cooked up a scheme to avoid registering as a foreign agent, as required by the federal Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), after he was hired to run interference on behalf of the controversial politically charged prosecution of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenka. In exchange for $4 million, Greg was expected to produce a report showing that the prosecution accorded with Western legal standards and was not tainted by corruption, the indictment alleges.
Instead of properly disclosing the amount of the payment and the terms of the contract, Craig allegedly drew up paperwork that falsely claimed his compensation would only be $12,000.
“The engagement letter omitted any mention of the amount of money CRAIG would be paid or the source of that money,” the indictment claims. “CRAIG’s letter did not disclose that he and the Law Firm would be paid more than $4 million for their services and that the money would be paid by the Private Ukrainian.”
Craig deliberately hid the true nature and compensation of his work for Ukraine in order to maximize the public relations value of the report he wrote for the Eastern European government, according to the indictment.
The FARA law requires disclosure and registration of work done on behalf of foreign governments or principals by anyone who “acts within the United States as a public relations counsel, publicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such foreign principal[.]” The law further defines a “public relations counsel” as “any person who engages directly or indirectly in informing, advising, or in any way representing a principal in any public relations matter pertaining to political or public interests, policies, or relations” on behalf of a foreign government or principal.
The indictment alleges that, in addition to concealing his foreign agent work from the government, Craig also lied to his law firm about it and falsely claimed that he had no contact with the media about the report he had prepared. Based on his statements, the law firm filed false statements about its public relations contacts to the Department of Justice.
Craig “knowingly and willfully caused to be made false statements of material fact in documents filed with and furnished to the Attorney General,” the indictment alleges. “[D]uring an interview conducted by the Special Counsel’s office, CRAIG repeated certain of the false and misleading statements he made to the FARA Unit concerning the timing and nature of his contacts with journalists about the Report.”
The case against Craig stemmed from the wide-ranging probe overseen by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The indictment even alleges that several of Craig’s false statements were made during interviews conducted by Mueller’s investigative team. While Mueller charged multiple Trump affiliates — such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn — with false statements charges, he chose not to charge a prominent Democrat attorney who worked in the Obama White House with any wrongdoing. It is not clear why Mueller prosecuted alleged violations by Trump associates but not of a former high-ranking Obama administration official.
Instead, the charges were announced by federal prosecutors within the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Craig is the first former Democrat official to be charged in connection with the Mueller probe.
If convicted, Craig could face up to ten years in prison. The full indictment can be read here . Sean Davis is the co-founder of The Federalist. "
Watch Blue Checkmarks Shower Twitter Love On Anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/watch-blue-checkmarks-shower-twitter-love-anti-semite-louis-farrakhan/,"April 11, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
For his remarks at rapper Nipsey Hussle’s funeral on Thursday, Louis Farrakhan, the virulent anti-Semite atop the Nation of Islam, earned a warm reception from a number of verified Twitter users.
Renewed controversy swirled around Farrakhan earlier this year, as leaders of the Women’s March were finally pressed to explain their prior associations with him. Although she tried to distance herself from Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, co-founder Tamika Mallory refused to condemn the Nation of Islam leader in January, even when confronted with a specific list of his repugnant statements by Meghan McCain on “The View.”
All the love blue checkmarks showed for Farrakhan on Thursday is a reminder that he’s not a random and powerless fringe actor, but someone who continues to enjoy support from plenty of prominent defenders, despite a long and indisputable record of naked bigotry. (For just a taste of his open racism and anti-Semitism, browse this list. )
I’ve also included several viral tweets from non-verified users, given how many people showed agreement with their sentiment. A handful of journalists and media outlets, including the New York Times, posted quotes from Farrakhan’s speech without even briefly alluding to his history. They’re included below as well. (And if you need some encouragement, here are some good tweets , although they certainly appeared to be outnumbered.)
I checked the feeds and linked stories of every reporter and outlet included below to see if they added any notes to their tweets about his racism. As of publishing time, none of them did. Minister Farrakhan don’t just come out for anybody you know!!!!

"Working Moms Need Your Encouragement, Not Your Judgment",thefederalist.com,Jennifer Babisak,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/working-moms-need-encouragement-not-judgment/,"By Jennifer Babisak April 11, 2019
Spilled milk didn’t cause me to cry, missing milk did. It was missing from our fridge because we couldn’t afford it that week, both bank accounts and plastic gallons having run dry.
The day the milk ran out, I made a conscious pivot away from my role as stay-at-home mom toward working mom. I amped up my part-time writing and teaching and accepted a generous scholarship that slapped a new label on my back: law student.
That label became the target of word arrows shot by conservative friends, family, podcasters, and pundits offering commentary like, “What are you doing?!” “Who’s watching your kids?” “My husband makes enough for me to stay home.” Naturally the women attacking my attempt to provide for my children are wealthy women. They struggle to understand the decisions of women looking at the underbelly of a shrinking middle class.
My critics are right in some regard. They recognize what progressive politicians and woke education lobbyists will not admit: children best spend their preschool years in the arms and home of a loving parent. Biology persuades that this parent should be the mother, but a loving father can also provide nurture and guidance far superior to that of the best preschool or daycare.
Nevertheless, criticizing mothers who cannot afford such an ideal childhood helps no one, and it hurts families who are trying to scrape by. Proclaiming a pro-life agenda in every political campaign and street corner while condemning both working women and social welfare is a hypocrite’s agenda, or one soaked in the naïveté of blue blood. Some Great Husbands Make Less than Others Do
My husband works in a public school. He serves high school students, often investing more time in them than their parents do. He works nearly 70 hours a week, although his pay doesn’t reflect that workload by any stretch of the imagination. He applies God-given gifts of knowledge and compassion toward this vocation, and he affects lives.
But his income is not enough to pay our bills. As each of our children grows, our grocery bill inches higher. Food prices soar, housing markets inflate, while teacher raises remain laughably inadequate. I didn’t marry a rich man.
But I married a man who generously pitches in, boasting kitchen wizardry superior to my own, scrubbing toilets, caring for our children, pushing me out the door to law school even though that action substantially increased his workload. Perhaps his talents have not led to a career of material wealth.
On the other hand, my gifts—legitimized through a few challenging years of school—hold potential for a higher salary than he can dream of in his current role. Shall we slavishly ignore both economics and our talents in devotion to the ideal of him as primary breadwinner?
Even men who dig their heels into the conviction that women should stay at home find themselves occasionally appreciating working moms. My midwife, Sam, shared that her “very religious” patients who believe a man should support his family criticized her for working while her toddler is in preschool. “However, I don’t think they wanted a manwife , so it was a conflict they accepted!” she says. Indeed, women are uniquely suited for some occupations, and they fulfill those roles to the benefit of many. Children Often Don’t Arrive On a Schedule
The Christians who worship the same God I do, who read the same blessed words about children, “Let the little children come to me,” “Blessed is the man whose quiver is full,” and “You are fearfully and wonderfully made” interpret them to mean that anything short of a spreadsheet-scheduled birth sequence is irresponsible. We have four children, who are blessing and joy beyond bounds. They were not welcomed on a precise schedule. There were tears, and not tears of joy, after some of those pregnancy tests. I thank God for each of these precious souls and will do all within my power to love and provide for them.
Women who abort their children are criticized and exploited for political reasons on both sides. Science, natural law, and the words of the Author of Life give me clear direction about notions of family planning “choice.” But sometimes conservatives don’t silence condemnation for women who choose life. My friend Regina was a single mother, working long hours in a newsroom to support her son. With Mother’s Day approaching, her sister told her, “You’re certainly not mother of the year!”
Whether too young, too old, too poor, too closely spaced, there’s plenty of criticism for women who choose life. Should we be blessed with another child after I turn 40, I can only imagine the scorn. Should that child have a disability that coincides with “advanced maternal age” (never mind the One who sets fertility’s window) I can only imagine the judgment. ‘Free’ Public Schools Aren’t Good for Our Kids
Conservatives love to complain about the public schools’ leftism, standardized testing, and negative influences. But only a few do anything about it, as 90 percent of the nation’s school children attend public schools. For people supposedly so set against socialism, most conservatives turn their children over to the state for eight hours a day, nine months a year, accompanied by a funny meme or two to mark their relief come end of summer.
I understand that decision, because the alternative is difficult. Homeschooling is mentally and financially taxing. Private school may be financially and logistically complicated. Pulling against the leash of the state is always difficult. Christians have criticized me for not accepting that leash, not throwing our children into public schools as salt and light. However, I want my children to be deeply and strongly rooted in their faith and trained in intelligent debate before I toss them into a moral war zone.
I homeschooled our children until our last child reached high school. He expressed a clear and compelling plea for school as a teen boy not wanting to spend his days in a house full of females. We enrolled him part-time (all we could afford) in a local classical school.
Both homeschooling and private school are hard on a single-income family, but the free school down the street can be harder on a child’s character. It’s a constant debate around our house—our son begging for full-time school, my husband reflecting on what he sees at work each day. To enroll the boy full-time in this beautiful program that sharpens his faith and his mind costs more, requiring me to work more.
Even moms working in private schools are not immune from criticism for their vocation. My friend Victoria returned to work as a private school teacher when her daughter was an infant because the family needed her income. Her mother-in-law sharply criticized that decision. The parents of her students have registered their disapproval in more subtle ways, criticizing working moms in front of Victoria.
“They will comment on a kid’s behavior and blame it on the fact that the kid has two working parents,” she says, “Or they will complain that another mom is too busy working to volunteer and be there for her child. I just shrug and say, ‘I’m a working mom.’ They usually get embarrassed, but the bias exists.” Remember, Women Have Always Brought Home Bacon
I know the challenge and monotony and delight of serving one’s children all day instead of a corporate boss. But I also know that comparing stay-at-home motherhood to working motherhood presents a false narrative of martyrdom. The ability to stay at home and focus on children, home, and crafty or intellectual pursuits is a gift. The ability to provide milk and bread for your family is gift too, but it throws an extra ball into the hands of an already exhausted juggler.
Nonetheless, women throughout history have worked. Lydia, the biblical dealer of purple cloth, wasn’t doing yoga by the river. Katie Luther, the wife of that reformer who changed the Western world, worked dawn to dusk with a boarding house, brewery, and farm while her husband ran for his life through Germany. The list of working women stretches through time, encouraging me that women have always put hand to plow when needed, while many also managed to raise wise and faithful children in the process.
The Giver of every good and perfect gift has given women great gifts of life and salvation, family and children. He gifts our daily bread—even milk—through provision by husband and neighbor and, sometimes, by the work of our own hands. So instead of a sharp word, why not lend a helping hand to women juggling the joy and challenges of embracing life? We could use your encouragement.

Stephen King’s ‘Pet Sematary’ Broods On Resurrection And Guilt,thefederalist.com,Ron Capshaw,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/stephen-kings-pet-sematary-broods-resurrection-guilt/,"April 11, 2019 By Ron Capshaw
Spoilers and horror themes ahead.
Like most successful horror writers, Stephen King has a strong stomach. Throughout his literary career, he has written about self-inflicted cannibalism, Satanic rapes, an ax chopping off a human leg, and anal rape with a tennis racket.
But the one matter he couldn’t stomach occurred in the novel “Pet Sematary.” By writing about the death of a child and its resurrection as a mean-spirited killer, King regretted the novel, feeling that he “went too far.” King only handed over the novel to fulfill his book contract.
The new cinematic adaption of the novel (the first adaption appeared in 1989 and was a feeble effort) doesn’t shy away from the child’s death. But unlike the novel where a very young boy died, directors Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer chose the older daughter to be the one resurrected into a hateful, remorseless killer.
“Sematary” has the finest actors thus far to star in a King adaption. Everyone in the film, from Jason Clarke (the agnostic father who escapes to rural Maine to get away from the rat race of the Boston medical community); Amy Seimetz (as Rachel, the wife who believes in a biblical afterlife); and a hulking and haunted John Lithgow (as the old resident who introduces Clarke to the life-giving Pet Sematary) are excellent.
But the one who steals the show is child actress Jete Laurence, who has the double duty of convincingly playing the sweet daughter Ellie one minute, then playing the child equivalent of a Manson girl. Without any CGI effects, which have become a staple of zombie movies, Laurence, with very little makeup, uses her eyes and voice to convey baleful, bottomless evil.
King has never been a “message” writer and, although a political liberal, has never hewed to political correctness (which may be why King has lasted so long). But the novel and the film, without slowing down the pace, touches on questions of the afterlife. They show that not all resurrections are like Christ’s. In life angelic, Ellie returns as demonic, psychologically torturing her family before trying to hack them to death.
Even the family cat, Church, returns not as his cuddly self but as a hissing monster. As with the scenes of the scalpel-wielding Ellie, Church gives the film its authentic chills. Yellow-eyed, fur matted, he exhibits hate and a burning desire to kill his human family.
The film’s other theme is that of guilt. Jason Clarke is haunted by his inability to save a decayed patient; and the patient appears, leading Clarke to Pet Sematary. His wife is haunted by the death of her spine-twisted sister, and blames her death on the one time Rachel didn’t go up to feed her. Her use of the dumbwaiter shaft to feed her dying sister comes back to haunt her. In one remarkable scene, the wife exhibits the same deformities as her sister while the sister uses the dumbwaiter shaft to scare Amy.
Like King, the filmmakers don’t belabor the point of the afterlife. On one hand, the film implies the dead should have been left alone for their souls to enter the afterlife. On the other, agnostics won’t be pleased that the dead can be brought back at all, or that demonic evil exists.
The filmmakers take liberties with the source material, especially the downbeat ending (which, incidentally, King approves of). They intuitively know that trying to please King’s often fanatical fan base does not spell big box office, since the fan base isn’t big enough to generate major revenue, and instead tailor the film for a less discriminating audience. In the process, they enhanced the horror.
The film is not perfect. At times it relies too much on “jump scares,” an unfortunate and clichéd tactic of most horror movies today. The film is at its most effective when Kolsch and Widmyer rely on a lurking atmosphere of horror.
The filmmakers should also be praised in their King-like ability to take things not considered horrific in a scary direction. Cats, children, and dumbwaiter shafts are used to chilling effect and will never be viewed the same way again."
Comey And McCabe Should Be Charged With An Illegal Conspiracy,thefederalist.com,H.A. Goodman,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/comey-mccabe-charged-conspiracy-defraud-americans/,"By H.A. Goodman April 12, 2019 Not long ago, CNN and MSNBC , along with everyone from The New York Times and Washington Post to Bloomberg and Brookings , cited 18 U.S. Code 371 as a legal statute President Trump had possibly violated. This conspiracy statute is broad and deals with two or more individuals who conspire “to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose.” After two years of a Mueller probe started by leaked memos from James Comey, and investigations fostered by a debunked dossier purchased by Hillary Clinton and Democrats, 18 U.S. Code 371 can ironically be used against those who investigated President Trump, without evidence he or anyone around him committed crimes associated with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack. As for the alleged hacking, The Daily Beast’s Kevin Paulson wrote “Both the DNC and the security firm Crowdstrike , hired to respond to the breach, have said repeatedly over the years that they gave the FBI a copy of all the DNC images back in 2016.” Since the U.S. government never analyzed DNC servers in order to confirm the accuracy of Crowdstrike’s copies, and the DNC hired Crowdstrike, there’s an obvious conflict of interest in trusting a firm outsourced by Democrats. Like the Steele dossier, Americans were forced to take the “word” of people linked to Democratic Party funding that Russia had something on Trump, and that only endless investigations would put the allegations to rest. With the Mueller probe done and no further indictments on the horizon, along with the fact no evidence was found of Trump colluding with Russia (hence, no further indictments), President Obama’s FBI officials now face a litany of criminal referrals from Rep. Devin Nunes and other Republicans. In addition to leaking classified memos and lying to Congress, conspiracy charges will be one aspect of the referrals Nunes sends to Attorney General William Barr. The Trump administration will now embark on a journey to discover how and why these McCarthy-era probes were started in the first place. Most importantly, what evidence was used to form the basis of investigations targeting Trump? How Did the Trump Investigation Take Hold? The answer to this question is a dossier purchased by Trump’s political rivals that Obama’s Justice Department warned the FBI about, long before the Mueller probe. This warning is highlighted in an article by John Solomon titled “ DOJ official warned Steele dossier was connected to Clinton, might be biased” : Ohr’s testimony now debunks that claim, making clear he started talking to FBI and DOJ officials well before the FISA warrant or election had occurred. …the FBI did have derogatory information on Steele: Ohr explicitly told the FBI that Steele was desperate to defeat the man he was investigating and was biased. And the FBI knew the motive of the client and did not have to speculate: Ohr told agents the Democratic nominee’s campaign was connected to the research designed to harm Trump’s election chances. Such omissions are, by definition, an abuse of the FISA system. Don’t take my word for it. Fired FBI Director James Comey acknowledged it himself when he testified last month that the FISA court relies on an honor system, in which the FBI is expected to divulge exculpatory evidence to the judges. ‘We certainly consider it our obligation, because of our trust relationship with federal judges, to present evidence that would paint a materially different picture of what we’re presenting,’ Comey testified on Dec. 7, 2018. ‘You want to present to the judge reviewing your application a complete picture of the evidence, both its flaws and its strengths.’ Comey claims he didn’t know about Ohr’s contacts with Steele, even though his top deputy, McCabe, got the first contact. But none of that absolves his FBI, or the DOJ for that matter, from failing to divulge essential and exculpatory information from Ohr to the FISA court. Lying to a FISA court is a crime, as is deliberately misleading FISA judges. Former FBI director James Comey, former deputy director Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok, a former counterintelligence agent, initiated investigations into the Trump campaign without the existence of a crime linked to Trump, using gossip and hearsay in the form of a dossier to obtain a FISA warrant. There was also a conversation between George Papadopoulos and an Australian ambassador linked to the Clinton Foundation , as well as a Trump Jr. meeting with a Russian attorney Loretta Lynch allowed into the country with a special visa. Yet neither of these events resulted in any indictments of Trump or Trump Jr. Suspicion Alone Sparked This Huge Witch Hunt How is it that FBI officials justified an investigation based purely on suspicion? While Democratic Sen. Mark Warner calls the notion that Obama spied on Trump a “long-debunked spying conspiracy theory,” it’s doubtful he and other Democrats would have accepted Bush or Trump obtaining a salacious dossier and then using it to investigate President Obama or Hillary Clinton. There was no reason to use a dossier purchased by Trump’s political rivals, nor was there any reason to use the hearsay from a London Barr (Alexander Downer’s account of the Papadopoulos conversation) without any evidence of a link between Trump and the alleged DNC hack. Comey, Strzok, and McCabe almost certainly conspired to utilize a compilation of salacious and unverified allegations as evidence to begin a probe, especially since the Department of Justice had already warned the FBI about endless issues pertaining to the dossier. We already know Strzok wanted to stop Trump from becoming president, as reported in a New York Times piece by Michael S. Schmidt titled “ Top Agent Said F.B.I. Would Stop Trump From Becoming President” : New texts released Thursday by the Justice Department’s inspector general show that the F.B.I. agent overseeing the investigation into President Trump’s campaign pledged to stop Mr. Trump from becoming president. ‘[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right?’ asked a top F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page, in one text. ‘Right?!’ Peter Strzok, the agent overseeing the F.B.I.’s investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, answered, ‘No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.’ The exchange, in August 2016, came shortly after the investigation into Russian tampering with the election began. Could you imagine the media outrage if Clinton were indicted in 2016 and Strzok had texted “We’ll stop” Clinton? Strzok’s text messages are sufficient evidence to prove intent of a conspiracy, along with the constant media leaks that resulted in McCabe and FBI counsel James Baker coming under criminal investigation. Finally, in addition to the incriminating texts between Strzok and Lisa Page, as well as the fact Bruce Ohr notified the FBI about why the agency shouldn’t use the Steele dossier to obtain a FISA warrant, Comey committed a crime by leaking classified memos to initiate the Mueller probe. According to a press release , at least one memo Comey leaked was classified: After a review of the seven memoranda created by former Director Comey, it is now clear that four are marked classified at various levels of sensitivity. Former Director Comey reportedly provided copies of four memos to Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman. If true, that would mean at least one disclosed memo contained information now-marked classified. See a pattern? FBI officials leaking information for political purposes while using a dossier purchased by Clinton should never have been the hallmarks of a two-year investigation into a duly elected president. Now that endless probes have resulted in zero evidence Trump colluded with Vladimir Putin to hack the DNC or purchase Facebook ads, Americans need the truth about the origins of the Mueller probe. Without Trump declassifying further documents, the public record alone is enough to charge Comey, Strzok, and McCabe under existing conspiracy statutes for conducting sprawling investigations and utilizing government agencies purely for political outcomes.

Rebooted “Hellboy” Is Damned By Hollywood Hypocrisy And Bad Casting,thefederalist.com,James Dawson,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/rebooted-hellboy-damned-hollywood-hypocrisy-bad-casting/,"By James Dawson April 12, 2019
Oh, hell no! In another diversity-derangement departure from a movie’s source material, the badly rebooted and needlessly vulgar “Hellboy” miscasts dreadlocked African-American/Maori actress Sasha Lane as the hero’s girlfriend Alice Monaghan, who was a fair and freckled Irish redhead in the comics. Political Correctness Pandering Plagues the Film
While that kind of political-correctness pandering would be offensive simply on a #FictionalCharacterLivesMatter basis, what makes it even more insulting here is that Alice is not a mere interchangeable background extra within the Hellboy canon. In what many fans regard as Hellboy creator Mike Mignola’s single best story in the character’s 25-year comics history (“The Corpse”), Irish Alice was abducted as a baby in Ireland by fairies who replaced her with a changeling. In Hellboy’s efforts to rescue her from the local “little folk,” he encounters a fairy king from Irish mythology. When Hellboy meets Alice again as an adult in a later story, she reveals that she has had many more encounters with the region’s fairies while growing up. She eventually is chosen by the Irish fairy queen to take her crown and be caretaker of the refuge where fairies have fled to escape our world.
In other words, the movie’s indefensible decision to change Alice’s regional and ethnic heritage makes about as much sense as if a white actor were cast to star in Marvel’s “Black Panther.” Sure, the filmmakers could use the tortured excuse that T’Challa’s Wakandan family tree included immigrant and mixed marriage branches, but the switch still would look ridiculous.
What makes Alice’s race change even more awkward is that white actor Ed Skrein made news last year by withdrawing from the role of Major Ben Daimio in “Hellboy,” after the production was accused of “whitewashing” that Japanese-American comics character. A statement from the producers and studios involved said, “It was not our intent to be insensitive to issues of authenticity and ethnicity, and we will look to recast the part with an actor more consistent with the character in the source material.” Skrein was replaced by Daniel Dae Kim, who actually was born in South Korea and not Japan. That “all Asians are Asian” fix wouldn’t seem sufficient to resolve the issue for anyone who was initially and easily offended, and may even have added “close enough” insult to “who cares” injury. The Plot Falls Short
Identity politics aside, the movie is an unsatisfying amalgam of several comics stories, and may be even more frustrating for fans than 2004’s “Hellboy” and 2008’s “Hellboy II: The Golden Army.” Both of those installments were directed and written by Guillermo del Toro, who took painful liberties that made the franchise come off like a cross between “Ghostbusters” and “Men in Black.” His worst mistake was turning Hellboy into a government-denied secret who fought monsters while remaining in hiding. (In the comics, Hellboy is featured on the cover of Life magazine at age three, granted honorary human status by the UN, and is well known as an agent of the also-not-secret Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.) His second worst blunder was making firebrand fellow agent Liz Sherman Hellboy’s girlfriend, who reveals she is pregnant with twins at the end of the second movie.
New “Hellboy” director Neil Marshall (who helmed 2005’s excellent horror flick “The Descent” and episodes of “Game of Thrones”) has jettisoned every supporting character from those movies except Hellboy’s surrogate father Professor Bruttenholm (now played by Ian McShane), who adopted Hellboy when he was brought to Earth as a child in 1944 during a botched Nazi magic ritual. David Harbour (“Stranger Things”) plays the adult Hellboy, a supernaturally strong half-demon whose broken-off horns have left stumps on his forehead and whose huge “right hand of doom” is made of stone.
The good news is that this Hellboy is not kept under wraps and is free to appear in public now, where people know who he is. The bad news is that Harbour doesn’t look or act nearly as well in the role as Ron Perlman did. Harbour’s Hellboy is hairier, lummox-like, and often appears perplexed or just plain dumb.
This Hellboy also comes off as immature, petulant, and childish, which is completely at odds with his deadpan and often thoughtful working-stiff persona in print. What makes his surly-teen attitude completely inappropriate here is that much of the cobbled-together Andrew Cosby screenplay is badly derived from the two excellent Hellboy comics arcs “The Wild Hunt” and “The Storm and The Fury.” In those comics, the character is somberly resigned to the inevitability of his own death and bitter about his destiny to become the Beast of the Apocalypse. The stories have an elegant air of melancholy seriousness and painful self-assessment that is utterly lacking onscreen.
For example, in the comic, Hellboy has an invisibility charm that would let him bypass a trio of giants. He is ashamed later that an undeniable bloodlust makes him slaughter them instead. In the movie, there’s no invisibility charm, and Hellboy simply kills the giants in an almost slapstick display of self-defense. Big difference. Characters Would Be Better With More Restraint
McShane’s crass and hammy Professor Bruttenholm is also a poor substitute for now-deceased John Hurt’s more restrained and faithful portrayal of the character in the earlier movies. Also, the character is long dead in the comics by the time these events take place, so he shouldn’t even be here. (Major Daimio also is not part of these stories in the comics.)
McShane’s performance is representative of the movie as a whole, which often is so loud, contrived and broadly played that it veers into embarrassing too-much-nonsense camp. Also, the movie’s R rating apparently was regarded as license to employ variations of the F word with tiresome frequency, and to spill outrageous quantities of blood. Derisive audience laughter at the screening I attended was annoying, but not unexpected.
The movie’s Big Bad is plague-bringing witch Nimue, a.k.a. The Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich). The screenplay’s most embarrassingly wrong addition to her story comes when she is seen in dismembered pieces on a sofa watching TV, operating the remote with her disembodied arm. If Mignola were dead, that scene alone might be enough to make him spin in his grave.
(To be fair, in a pronouncement that qualifies as one of life’s great mysteries, Mignola has said the screenplay has “taken pieces of so many of my stories and fit them together in a way that really works.” Considering that even the ending of the combined stories is changed, and by far for the worse, that statement is simply baffling.)
Lane’s Alice, aside from looking all wrong and swearing constantly, has been transformed into a psychic medium who channels spirits by vomiting out the upper bodies of the deceased mounted on what look like thick, snaky intestines. Amazingly, this looks even sillier than it sounds.
A pig-monster named Gruagach (voiced by Stephen Graham), a genuinely tragic figure from the comics who bears a grudge against Hellboy and allies himself with Nimue, has been reduced to a blusteringly foulmouthed and almost comic foil.
The real tragedy here is that a lot of the monstrous creatures, special effects, and overall production design look good enough that the same technical crew probably could have pulled off a respectfully faithful adaptation of Mignola’s work with class, if the screenwriter and director hadn’t desecrated the source material by altering so much of its tone. What they did to “Hellboy” is a damn shame. James Dawson has written more than 1,000 movie reviews and feature articles for various print publications and websites. His work has appeared in places ranging from The Los Angeles Times to Penthouse Forum to a Marvel Comics ""Silver Surfer"" anthology. His personal website is iDawson.com."
Will The Democratic Party Faithful Ever Notice Their Leaders Are Crazy?,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/will-democratic-party-faithful-ever-notice-leaders-crazy/,"By Warren Henry April 12, 2019
After almost two weeks of critical media coverage of Joe Biden’s handsy history, poll after poll indicates most Democrats do not care. The latest Quinnipiac poll—of California, no less—has the yet-to-announce Biden easily leading Bernie Sanders and favorite daughter Kamala Harris. This poll also has Harris performing better among white liberals than nonwhite voters .
These findings are mostly news to the progressive elites at the top of Democratic politics and the establishment media. The data suggesting the Democratic Party is an upstairs/downstairs coalition in which a small faction of disproportionately white progressives dominate a more diverse rank-and-file has been piling up in studies by More in Common, Pew, and Gallup . In recent days, some in the media have finally begun to notice.
At The New York Times, resident propellerheads Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy find that “[t]oday’s Democratic Party is increasingly perceived as dominated by its ‘woke’ left wing. But the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate.” They add: “The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online.”
Cohn and Quealy report that approximately a quarter of Democrats are progressive ideologues; only a tenth might identify as democratic socialists. “The rest of the party is easy to miss,” they write. “Not only is it less active on social media, but it is also under-represented in the well-educated, urban enclaves where journalists roam.”
Similarly, Third Way —a group representing centrist Democrats—has released a poll finding a similar chasm between the woke mob on social media and other Democrats: “On the question of whether Democrats want a candidate who will appeal to a broad range of voters or move left to energize progressives and liberals, voters who do not post on Twitter prefer broad appeal by 57 points, while active Tweeters prefer broad appeal by a much narrower 27 points.”
CNN data guru Harry Enten observes, contra the conventional wisdom, moderates and conservatives still make up roughly half of Democratic voters, while only 19 to 25 percent consider themselves “very liberal.” Moreover, “Millennials and Generation Z voters (roughly those younger than 40)… made up just about 29% of all Democratic voters in the 2018 midterm, per Catalist [a firm that maintains a voter database for Democratic and progressive causes].” Voters over fifty constituted 56 percent of Democratic voters in 2018.
Enten further reports that while Democrats are becoming more likely to have a college degree, almost 60 percent of those who voted in 2018 did not. He adds that “[e]ven among white Democrats… Catalist calculates the percentage of 2018 Democratic voters without a college degree at about 54%, compared to 46% who had a college degree.”
Enten’s analysis tracks that of Ruy Teixeira , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress best known for having co-authored “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” which convinced so many on the left that demographics was destiny. Early this year, Teixiera and his colleagues found that “2016 voters were 44 percent white non-college and just 30 percent white college-educated…This suggests the exit polls were not just wrong but massively wrong, especially in the context of Rust Belt swing states, where errors were even larger and the political implications of misunderstanding graver.”
Teixiera later expanded on the implications of the exit poll distortions: “This is especially worrisome because white non-college voters remain a larger group than white college voters in almost all states — and are far larger in the Rust Belt states that gave the Democrats so much trouble in 2016: Iowa is 62 percent white non-college versus 31 percent white college; Michigan is 54 percent white non-college versus 28 percent white college; Ohio splits 55 percent to 29 percent; Pennsylvania 51 percent to 31 percent; and Wisconsin 58 percent to 32 percent.”
The woke are not only dismissive of white working-class voters, but also (ironically) of the black voters who may be crucial to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. As Enten observed in another analysis, “black voters make up about the same part of the Democratic Party as two parts that a lot of analysts like to hype for their growing power (college-educated white voters and very liberal voters).” Black voters also often act as a bloc, a key to Barack Obama edging out Hillary Clinton in 2008, and to Clinton defeating Bernie Sanders in 2016.
Both Enten and Dan McLaughlin have emphasized the degree to which Southern states will dominate the Democratic primaries after Iowa and New Hampshire. This is where, as Cohn and Quealy map it, “the rest of the party” lives and votes. The calendar will boost the clout of more moderate, establishmentarian Democrats, both black and white.
Despite the mounting evidence, it remains easy to find pundits peddling the narrative that Democrats cannot wait to vote for a socialist or an identity politician to be their standard-bearer in 2020. On a recent edition of NBC’s “Meet The Press ,” Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman of Politico were pushing the line that Biden was in trouble (he isn’t), while progressive think tanker Heather McGhee did not think “Biden represents the kind of change particularly that younger voters, who are the biggest bloc in 2020 [they likely aren’t], need to see.”

In fairness, the Democrats are a few percent more leftward and a few percent more credentialed than in past cycles, due largely to younger Democrats growing into adult voting behavior. But it’s still closer to your parents’ Democratic Party than the woke on social media and cable news believe. The woke may be in for a rude awakening.

"We Can’t Reshape Libya In Our Own Image, And We Shouldn’t Try",thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/intervening-in-libya-would-be-a-foolish-mistake-and-it-would-cost-lives/,"By Sumantra Maitra April 12, 2019
Why is Libya so lawless? The BBC asks the same question in a recent article . The answer needn’t be more than a single sentence: Ask Hillary Clinton.
At the time of writing this article, the United States and other allied countries are being forced to evacuate their citizens and troops as a warlord marches to Libya’s internationally recognized capital. All this after a liberal humanitarian intervention in 2011, hundreds of thousands of dollars of aid, a slave trading and human trafficking hub, and mass migration to Europe.
Now, once more, people are sounding calls to intervene in Libya to stop any war, both in the United States and in the United Kingdom . Bleeding heart liberal interventionists, loathe to provide $5 billion to guard the southern U.S. borders against an overwhelming number of unvetted noncitizens fraudulently abusing U.S. asylum, are taking up old tactics of humanitarian concerns to promote another open-ended war spending billions more in Libya to supposedly bring about a liberal democracy. Nothing, needless to say, could be more damaging to that already dangerous scenario, and conservatives in the Trump administration would do well to avoid this “do something!” trap. Realists Know This Won’t Work
Before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, there was a weeklong meeting in the Politburo . It was a time immediately after the high-flying ’70s, when the West was battered by Vietnam and economic downturns. Moscow was at the peak of its post-war power, with most of Africa, Asia, and Latin America as clients.
A few military advisors, however, were skeptical. Hard-nosed realists argued against Soviet troops on the ground, mentioning that Afghanistan is a semi-feudal country and there wouldn’t be any short-term intervention. However, ideologues in the Politburo, with their success in African civil wars against colonial Europeans, managed to convince Brezhnev that “there is no land in the planet, which is not worthy of flying the red flag.” The rest—Soviet imperial overstretch, economic collapse, and eventual disintegration—is, as they say, history.
Fast-forward 40 years, the same arguments were there unopposed during planned interventions in Libya in 2011. Some prudent conservatives opposed it . Conservatism dictates order over chaos, and conservatism understands that different regions have different cultures, and history that shapes those cultures, and not every land is suitable for a foreign-imposed immediate liberal democracy, which took roots in the West due to hundreds of years of cultural dialogue and tradition.
Earlier realists like Henry Kissinger, James Baker, and Jeanne Kirkpatrick understood this simple realpolitik. But post-Cold War western foreign policy was shaped in the early ’90s triumphalism. With the fire of Arab Spring still fresh, liberals decided no lands on the planet are not fit for a dose of James Madison.
The realpolitik argument , on the other hand, was simple. Muammar Gadhafi was a brutal tyrant, but he was also a brutal authority, in a land that has historically never been united without brutality since the times of Rome and Carthage. In a land as sparsely populated as Libya, and with more than 140 rival tribes, toppling an authoritarian would pry open one of the last vestiges of authority in the entire north African coastline, and turn the region to chaos.
To his partial credit, President Obama initially dithered over the liberal calls and appeals to emotions—and was skeptical of Britain and especially France toppling Gadhafi. Nevertheless, the urge to “do something,” constantly egged on by an activist media, and with Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice, and Samantha Power around, was too much to resist.
The result is that there is no central authority in Libya (which is more tribalistic than ever), and the land is a fertile ground for human traffickers acting hand in hand with activist nongovernmental organizations to bring about hundreds of thousands of military-age men from Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa to Europe, which is leading to terror attacks, crimes, failing social security systems, and a rise in political radicalism. In short, everything that happened in 2016 happened because Hillary went and saw, and Gadhafi died, to rephrase her own words . The Post-Mortem on the Libyan Fiasco
The British House of Commons’ report on the Libyan fiasco, the only proper full investigation done after the intervention by a bipartisan committee, was quite possibly the most scathing thing ever written, in the most polite and British way possible, of course. One sentence of many that stuck out:
The possibility that militant extremist groups would attempt to benefit from the rebellion should not have been the preserve of hindsight. Libyan connections with transnational militant extremist groups were known before 2011, because many Libyans had participated in the Iraq insurgency and in Afghanistan with al-Qaeda.
The fact that the intervention had no purpose other than liberal hubris was clear as well: “intervention in Libya was reactive and did not comprise action in pursuit of a strategic objective. This meant that a limited intervention to protect civilians drifted into a policy of regime change by military means.”
Put simply, we went into Libya without knowing what we were doing, where we had zero interests. We helped Islamists, who took advantage of our liberal sentiments, and toppled a brutal (but secular) dictator, and opened the floodgates of chaos on an important coastal zone. Sounds familiar?
History repeats as a farce, and there’s a simple reason for it. Most humans are emotional and optimistic; they feel compelled to think this time will be different. Conservatism is, however, shaped by a realistic and informed understanding of human nature and history. It might not be predicated on fiery oratory or rhetoric, but calm realism, restraint and prudence. A deep skepticism of ambition and capability is the baseline of conservative philosophy.
An attempt to shape the entire world in our mirror image is Utopian liberal internationalism. There’s nothing conservative about radical Wilsonianism, and it is no different than radical Trotskyism.
History judges people regardless of the conventional wisdom of the times. It is in that spirit that we should do nothing in Libya. There’s no strategic interest for us in spending billions of dollars and pounds in Libya. The only interest the West has in Libya is to have stability, order, and equilibrium, regardless of who provides it (and how brutal those methods are). Realpolitik therefore dictates that the West should be ready to cut a deal with whomever gets in power in Tripoli.

President Trump has announced that he may nominate Herman Cain to the seven-person Federal Reserve Board. Although Cain hasn’t been officially nominated yet, many on the left and some on the right have voiced their objections.
A Washington Post op-ed calls Cain’s potential nomination a “ reckless ” move. Is Cain the best candidate for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors? I will let the U.S. Senate decide at Cain’s confirmation hearing, should that happen. But the firestorm of condemnations of Cain aren’t all justified.
Criticism of Cain can be summarized into three main points. I’ll discuss them below. 1. Herman Cain Doesn’t Understand Economics
Catherine Rampell, a columnist for the Washington Post , wrote last week “Nein, nein, nein. That should be the Senate response if President Trump actually nominates his friend Herman Cain.” While she acknowledges that Trump’s past Fed nominees are “competent, well-qualified professionals,” she clearly looks down on Cain, referring to him as a “former pizza magnate turned failed Republican presidential candidate.”
It’s true that Cain is neither an economist nor a banker, the two professions that traditionally have dominated Federal Reserve officials. But Cain’s life is a quintessential American economic success story, the kind that Joe Biden can only wish he could plagiarize.
A native of Atlanta, Georgia, Cain was born into a poor family. His mother worked as a maid and his father was once a chauffeur. From this humble background, Cain went to college, got a master’s degree in computer science from Purdue University, and worked his way up from analyst to chief executive in corporate America. One of his business accomplishments was the turnaround of the Godfather’s Pizza chain in 14 months when he was its president and CEO.
But there is more. In 1992, Cain became one of the board of directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and was the board’s chairman from 1995 to 1996. In 2012, he sought the Republican presidential nomination with an 9-9-9 economic plan: 9 percent business flat tax, 9 percent personal flat tax, 9 percent sales tax. He was a long shot, but he won the Florida Straw Poll in 2011, beating seasoned politicians like Mitt Romney.
Cain has a better grasp of economics and policies than Paul Krugman, a well-known economist, Nobel economics laureate, and New York Times columnist. One of Krugman’s infamous blunders was when he predicted the day after 2016’s election that Trump would bring a global recession and the U.S. stock market would never recover. The U.S. stock market has risen to a record level under President Trump and American workers are enjoying the best job market ever with a record low unemployment rate in a booming economy.
Krugman has been wrong on many other significant topics , including the fiscal policies in Demark , the trade war with China and on bitcoin . Of course, Krugman was one of the first to criticize Cain’s nomination in a tweet . 2. The Gold Standard Is a Ridiculous Idea
Many Americans are not familiar with gold standard today, so it is easier for political pundits and even some economists to dismiss the gold standard as a fringe idea. But in 1800s, almost all the nations in the world adopted the gold standard, which “guaranteed that the government would redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold.” The beauty of the gold standard is that because there is a limited supply of gold, it serves as a natural constraint on government spending and inflation.
Investment strategist Mark Luschini says the gold standard “forces the U.S. to live within its means…Think of it as a person with a debit card rather than a credit card. The debit card holder can only spend what he or she has in the bank.” Clear evidence—for example, here and here —shows that under the gold standard, the U.S. economy was relatively healthy, stable, and productive.
The United States was on the gold standard for 179 years until August 15, 1971, when President Nixon ordered the Fed not to redeem U.S. dollars with gold, essentially ending the gold standard in the United States (note to those who claimed that the Federal Reserve has always been independent). Since then, the U.S. dollar has been running on a fiat money system because its value is not linked to any real asset. Consequently, monetary disorders followed. Four decades after we abandoned the gold standard, the U.S. dollar has lost more than 96 percent of its value and our national debt stands at close to $22 trillion .
It’s true today most mainstream economists oppose restoring the gold standard. But even Bloomberg admits their opposition doesn’t mean Cain and other proponents of the gold standard are wrong. The criticism against the gold standard mainly rests on the notion that it will limit the Federal Reserve’s ability to manage the economy through manipulating the money supply and interest rates, especially in times of financial crisis. Yet even economists who are against the gold standard acknowledge that the Fed has made plenty of mistakes too .
The United States probably will never go back to the gold standard for other practical reasons as well: we don’t have enough gold reserves to pay off our debt; and if we are the only country that uses the gold standard in this integrated global economy, other nations that have trade surpluses with us will demand gold in payment, which will drain our gold supply. While all these arguments against the gold standards sound reasonable, Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, says it is wrong to assume someone who supports the gold standard is either crazy or ignorant.
Many smart people favor the gold standard besides Cain, including Steven Moore, another Trump Federal Reserve nominee, and former congressman Ron Paul. In 2012, the Republican Party platform called for the creation of a gold commission to evaluate restoring the gold standard. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, whom even many on the left respect as a mainstream economist, admitted ”if the gold standard were in place today we would not have reached the situation in which we now find ourselves.” 3. Cain Would Politicize the Federal Reserve
Cain is an unapologetic and outspoken conservative. When he was the leader of the National Restaurants Association, he criticized Hillary Clinton’s health care nationalization plan. He frequently disagreed with former President Obama. One of his well-known criticism was “Hope and change is not a solution. Hope and change is not a job.”
Therefore, many on the left charge that should Cain, and Moore, become Federal Reserve Board members, they would ruin the “independence “ of the Fed because they are both Trump loyalists who would politicize future monetary decisions. The very set up of the Fed from the beginning means it has always been under political influence.
It’s a valid concern that we don’t want our central bank to become an overly partisan institution. Our country is already very much politically divided. Having a central bank that can remain above the political fray and make decisions based on what’s best for the country, not by which direction the political wind blows, is a good thing.
At the same time, it is naive to think the Fed has always been truly “independent.” According to economist Peter Earle , the very set up of the Fed from the beginning means it has always been under political influence, including the facts that: Fed officials are appointed by the executive branch and confirmed by Congress; and private meetings between the Fed chairman and presidents are a long-standing fixture of economic policy coordination and implementation.
In his piece for the American Institute for Economic Research, Earle documented many instances throughout the U.S. history that, from Lyndon Johnson to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, almost every president tried to exert influence on the Federal Reserve’s monetary decisions: “Presidents attempting to influence the Fed did not start with, and will not end with, the current Chief Executive.”
Acknowledging past presidential influence on the Fed doesn’t mean Fed officials should not strive for as much independent thinking as they can. Cain can help make his own case by either dissolving or at least dissociating himself from America Fighting Back, a pro-Trump group he set up. He also needs to tone down his political rhetoric and start demonstrating his understanding of economic policies by talking about real economic issues.
Cain is an unconventional choice for the Federal Reserve. But we shouldn’t be surprised, because President Trump is nothing if not unconventional. Should President Trump go ahead nominating Cain for the top job in the Fed, the U.S. Senate should give Cain a fair hearing rather than being dissuaded by some of these unfair criticisms.

"Meet ‘Surveillance Capitalism,’ Our Terrifying New Economic Order",thefederalist.com,Paul Rowan Brian,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/meet-surveillance-capitalism-our-terrifying-new-economic-order/,"Meet ‘Surveillance Capitalism,’ Our Terrifying New Economic Order Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff's new book, 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For A Human Future at the New Frontier of Power,' warns that Silicon Valley is amassing your data so artificial intelligence can subvert your rights, freedoms, and even conscious thought. By Paul Rowan Brian April 12, 2019
Advanced technology isn’t just getting out of control, it’s being used as a means of control—big time. That’s the key message of Shoshana Zuboff’s new book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For A Human Future at the New Frontier of Power , where the Harvard professor emerita and business analyst argues that Big Tech is determined to fully commodify, control, and co-opt human experiences to provide raw behavioral data that sustains its massive profits and power.
Put simply, Zuboff contends that surveillance capitalism is the constant tracking, analysis, and attempted modification of human behavior for the profit of tech giants who trade in what she terms “behavioral futures markets,” places where knowing what people are very likely to do tomorrow or next year is of enormous value to those trying to sell a product or service.
Surveillance capitalism renders human behavior by tracking, measuring, and analyzing from your smartphone to your smart home—from browsing the internet to private messages or emails with a colleague. This relatively new, dominant force intrudes through cookies and privacy permissions that in most cases must be accepted for a service to work properly or at all, including, for example, many smart home security systems.
Zuboff distinguishes surveillance capitalism at the outset from information capitalism. Whereas information capitalism makes money from information you provide, surveillance capitalism disguises itself in intimidating terms of service agreements and actually nudges your behavior so that you do what it wants in various ways, perpetuating a feedback loop of predatory control and emotional espionage enabled through advanced machine learning and algorithmic programming.
“Global revenue for AI products and services is expected to increase 56- fold, from $644 million in 2016 to $36 billion in 2025,”she notes, so we should probably be talking about this quite a lot as a society. A New Economic Order
According to Zuboff, surveillance capitalism is “a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material” and “a parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral modification.”
Zuboff argues that the main problem with surveillance capitalism is that it makes us mere objects whose every life experience and intimate detail must be analyzed and predicted for the benefit—and potential influence—of others. As Zuboff writes, “the essence of the exploitation here is the rendering of our lives as behavioral data for the sake of others’ improved control of us.”
Although Zuboff claims in the book that technology and its discoveries do not have to be malign if data were not inappropriately shared and used, she says that surveillance capitalists basically see the technology as justifying its use in manipulating docile populations.
“Despite all the futuristic sophistication of digital innovation, the message of the surveillance capitalist companies barely differs from the themes once glorified in the motto of the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair: ‘Science Finds—Industry Applies—Man Conforms,’” Zuboff writes.
Provocatively, Zuboff contends that just as industrial capitalism devastated the environment in the nineteenth and twentieth century, surveillance capitalism now directly threatens human nature and relation, twisting our inner self into a weak, squashed bug that can be listlessly herded where companies (or governments) want us to be.
Surveillance capitalism’s aim, according to Zuboff, is to force a new collectivist order on humanity founded on the certainty of AI systems and to steadily take away people’s rights, freedoms, and even conscious thought, by limiting the choice architecture around us and conceptually shepherding people into increasingly tightly controlled avenues of mentation, decision, and action.
Rather than searching on Google or posting on Facebook, people do not realize they are being searched and reacted to—not only for their interests, emotions, and beliefs, but also for their subtle but highly valuable outputs of “data exhaust” such as hesitation in clicking, ways of phrasing questions, time of searches, predictive emotional patterns, ways of reacting to content and much, much more—all information that lets advertisers target people on a highly pinpointed level and lets behaviorists psychometrically isolate an individual’s “type” and potential reactions to situations or products with incredibly high degrees of accuracy.
“ Wired magazine’s founding editor, Kevin Kelly, once suggested that although it seems like Google is committed to developing its artificial intelligence capabilities to improve Search, it’s more likely that Google develops Search as a means of continuously training its evolving AI capabilities. This is the essence of the machine intelligence project. As the ultimate tapeworm, the machine’s intelligence depends upon how much data it eats,” Zuboff writes. ‘Sanitized Tyranny’
Zuboff states at the outset that she is not solely focused on one corporation but rather on the phenomenon of the “reality business” itself. However, the book largely centers on Google, which she considers to have founded surveillance capitalism in the early 2000s, and on Facebook, Amazon, Verizon, and other corporations’ follow-up attempts to become the next Google and capture more data about more people and sell it at an even higher price in a cycle of “muted, sanitized tyranny” that makes Smith’s and Hayek’s capitalism look like baby food. At least, Zuboff argues, Hayek and Smith extolled a system where workers needed to get at least enough spending money to feed a consumer economy for the products they were making.
Zuboff draws a distinction between totalitarianism and its desire to possess and remake humanity into a collective unit of the state ideology, and surveillance capitalism’s “instrumentarianism,” which she describes as a determination to achieve total certainty and predictive power over human affairs from a standpoint of commercial exploitation built on moral and ideological indifference. Whereas totalitarianism derives its power from “Hierarchical Administration of Terror,” instrumentarianism gets its juice from having “Ownership of the Means of Behavioral Modification.”
The surveillance capitalism system is “radically indifferent” to our fate or wellbeing. According to Zuboff, it is amoral and lacks an ideological position apart from its raw appetite for data and control, although this would seem to contradict her repeated statements that the surveillance capitalist system wishes to sell us products and services. (Dead people don’t typically buy products or services, nor do systems generally perpetuate profit incentives if they, for example, cease to be market-based).
The book is formed around the question a mill manager asked Zuboff years ago: “Are we all going to be working for a smart machine, or will we have smart people around the machine?”
Through discovery of behavioral surplus, or the behavior of users in terms of speed of clicking, patterns, emotional trends, and other intricately cross-correlated data, Google gained a huge edge, which Zuboff calls “surveillance assets.” These assets Google gained to analyze behavior, thought, and patterns of action, “are critical raw materials in the pursuit of surveillance revenues” which are then translated “into surveillance capital” as part of a “surveillance economy” that was propelled forward partly by “surveillance exceptionalism” in the post-9/11 world. If you get the feeling that Zuboff is rather fond of using the word “surveillance” in this book, you would not be wrong. Real Life vs. The Internet
Those who worry about people glued to their smartphones or sitting at home all day are missing the big picture, according to Zuboff. The real future imagined by our tech overlords is one in which, essentially, real life is the internet.
“The aim here is a grand synthesis: the collation and fusion of every sort of sensor data from every channel and device to develop a ‘virtual sensor environment’ in which ‘crawlers will constantly traverse data. . . calculating state and estimating other parameters derived from the data’ collected from everywhere from office interiors to entire cities.”
Big Tech is much further down the road in terms of sophistication of data collection than many people may realize—not only in the odd ways it snoops on people’s private correspondence and daily decision-making but in how it utilizes that information for vastly profitable predictive advertising and in its all-encompassing “connected” vision of the future. What some sci-fi movies have shown, but many may still not grasp, is that the internet or home-helping robots aren’t the future we’re looking at.
As the former executive chairman of Google Eric Schmidt put it at Davos in 2015, “The internet will disappear. There will be so many IP addresses . . . so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with, that you won’t even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room and the room is dynamic.”
Although headlines misunderstood Schmidt’s statement, what he was saying was deeply profound, and built on the ideas of computer scientist Mark Weiser, who wrote in an influential 1991 paper that “the most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” He described a new way of thinking “that allows the computers themselves to vanish into the background. . . . Machines that fit the human environment instead of forcing humans to enter theirs will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.”
In other words, as we can already see with “smart cities,” the powers that be envision a future of complete integration and interactivity, with information flowing at all times and everyone linked up to the information grid.
“Surveillance capitalists understood that their future wealth would depend upon new supply routes that extend to real life on the roads, among the trees, throughout the cities. Extension wants your bloodstream and your bed, your breakfast conversation, your commute, your run, your refrigerator, your parking space, your living room,” Zuboff writes. Digital Colonialism
Zuboff further compares surveillance capitalism to colonial abuse of power, writing that “these twenty-first-century invaders do not ask permission; they forge ahead, papering the scorched earth with faux-legitimation practices:
Instead of cynically conveyed monarchical edicts, they offer cynically conveyed terms-of-service agreements whose stipulations are just as obscured and incomprehensible. They build their fortifications, fiercely defending their claimed territories, while gathering strength for the next incursion. Eventually, they build their towns in intricate ecosystems of commerce, politics, and culture that declare the legitimacy and inevitability of all that they have accomplished.
And like the indigenous people on a beach in South America when the Spanish first arrived, we are not so much being overpowered by force as by the extent of what is simply unprecedented :
Ours is not simply a case of being ambushed and outgunned. We were caught off guard because there was no way that we could have imagined these acts of invasion and dispossession, any more than the first unsuspecting Taíno cacique could have foreseen the rivers of blood that would flow from his inaugural gesture of hospitality toward the hairy, grunting, sweating men, the adelantados who appeared out of thin air waving the banner of the Spanish monarchs and their pope as they trudged across the beach. A Fine Line Between Commercial and Political Incentives
So let’s summarize: Should you read this book? Yes. Does this book have shortcomings? Yes.
One shortcoming of this book is its primary focus on the intersection between technology and commerce. Although Zuboff touches on China in a sub-chapter called “The China Syndrome,” the book largely eschews the subject.
China is in the process of implementing an incredibly sophisticated surveillance and reward-punishment control grid on its citizens and is definitely worthy of discussing in depth, particularly as its enforcement efforts stem from the Chinese state, rather than private commercial motives. As Zuboff notes, “the system tracks ‘good’ and ‘bad’ behavior across a variety of financial and social activities, automatically assigning punishments and rewards to decisively shape behavior toward ‘building sincerity’ in economic, social, and political life.”
China’s system is all the more relevant given Google’s decision to return to China with its censored Dragonfly service. Google also announced they will be opening an AI research center in China where the non-existent privacy laws give them free reign to experiment.
The revelations of Google’s Dragonfly move were leaked by an employee who said, “I’m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people.” Zuboff writes that “In the Chinese context, the state will run the show and own it, not as a market project but as a political one, a machine solution that shapes a new society of automated behavior for guaranteed political and social outcomes: certainty without terror.”
It is hard to understand what Zuboff is referring to by “without terror,” considering that China is currently running concentration camps and re-education centers filled with communist brainwashing and torture for an estimated 1 million ethnic Uyghur Chinese Muslims on the basis of their ethnicity and faith. Granted, Surveillance Capitalism is focused on the United States and the start of private corporate information dominance, but Zuboff makes claims about the world as a whole and a move to an omniscient corporate control grid that would seem to necessitate bringing up the case of China, where it is not so much corporate power as government ideology and repression that rules. In fact, corporations get their taxes waived if they agree to be state-run.
It would be interesting to see Zuboff write a follow-up book more fully addressing the potential for authoritarian surveillance states to use advanced technology to control and oppress their population—including, potentially a future U.S. government. Let’s be honest: the Soviet Union would have paid everything they had for the chance to get hold of the kind of technology Zuboff is describing here, and Belarus , North Korea, and numerous other countries are already currently doing their best job to make Stalin and Co. look like surveillance amateurs.
Zuboff’s semi-dismissal of China’s fusion of surveillance with state power because it’s “not a democracy” is, frankly, short-sighted and a bit elitist, although she does acknowledge that “perhaps the most shocking element of the story is not the Chinese government’s agenda, but how similar it is to the path technology is taking elsewhere.”
Moreover, when Zuboff acknowledges that 9/11 greatly acceded the rise of surveillance capitalism and that “state and market institutions demonstrate a shared commitment to a relentless drive toward guaranteed outcomes,” why is the book as a whole focusing only on commercial incentives when governmental incentives of control, military dominance, and surveillance form a potentially greater rationale and motivation for the expansion of technological wizardry? More Suggestions, Less Rhetoric
Standing up to surveillance capitalism is difficult, and Zuboff’s book does a good job of demonstrating the all-encompassing reach of our new not-so-beneficent overlords. The book is very light on any suggestions, however, and if you’re looking for guidelines to stopping cookie tracking or limiting how your smartphone knows about you, look elsewhere.
Despite admitting that typical restraints and regulation do little and will be bypassed by Big Tech, and presenting a nightmarish vision of a dystopian future, Zuboff offers only vague hints that real “democracy” or a collective demand to be granted “a future of our own making” can put up a fight against the encroaching everything-web. In terms of other specifics, she also reserves some accolades for the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation that came into effect in May of last year.
For all the praise this book has been receiving in mainstream media, it needs to be said that the author repeats herself often and the book does not fulfill its titular purpose of telling us much of anything about the fight for a human future against surveillance capitalism. Instead it talks ad nauseum about the problem itself, ironically increasing precisely the kind of “inevitablism” about the creeping advance of technology that Zuboff slams throughout the book.
Although it is understood that Zuboff wishes to emphasize certain issues, there are many cases where long-winded explanations and reflections simply repeat precisely what was already said—at length—five times before in earlier chapters. While this may not impede researchers, academics, or intellectual types, it is a potential roadblock to lay readers who want to know what’s the deal with runaway technology. Instead, they will keep getting enmeshed in Zuboff’s lengthy, repetitive treatises parsing philosophical distinctions and economic theories.
Another thing this book could do without is some of the overdone language and rhetoric.
“It is the one idea to have emerged from the long story of human oppression that insists upon a people’s inalienable right to rule themselves. Democracy may be under siege, but we cannot allow its many injuries to deflect us from allegiance to its promise,” Zuboff writes, apparently channeling a Corey Booker-style barnburner . If one were to invent a drinking game for every time Zuboff uses words like “respect,” “democracy,” and “values” you’d be drunker than Boris Yeltsin at the dacha on the weekend.
And, frankly, you’d have to be drunk to not be occasionally annoyed at Zuboff’s heavily overwrought prose and vague, Boomer-esque exhortations for “young people” to “stand up” to Big Tech in some way, such as donning surveillance-blocking bandanas and supporting a university project that inhibits facial recognition technology with face masks and stylized dreadlocks (no joke).
It’s perfectly clear that what Zuboff is saying is very serious. So why restate it 100 times and use the flowery language of a discreditable strain of neoliberalism that makes most people cringe inside? Why talk about the Berlin Wall coming down in an emotional passage of attempted historical parallelism instead of suggesting actual ways to counteract surveillance capitalism? Withdrawing Consent
Another drawback is that by choosing to quote respectable and mainstream philosophers such as Hannah Arendt and Emile Durkheim, Zuboff also shies away from the controversial and uncomfortable discussions to be had about violent responses to technological dominance. Such violence, advocated by figures like domestic terrorist Ted Kaczysnki, not to mention the growing impetus on the fringes of the left and right toward eco-militancy and aggressively nihilistic responses to technological advancement, are not unimportant.
To be sure, Zuboff is not to be expected to provide a response to the fanciful idea that roving bands of green rebels will overthrow the massively powerful and interconnected technological structure of surveillance capitalism (“For the Green New Deal and AOC!” the renegades shout, hurling Molotov cocktails), but it does seem her book would be improved by addressing the despair and violence that some turn to when faced with the enormity of technological control, climate change, and post-industrial ennui.
Another uncomfortable and politically charged discussion Zuboff shies away from is the extent to which Big Tech is explicitly liberal and acts punitively toward social conservatives and religious people, especially Christians. This clashes with her thesis that Big Tech fundamentally doesn’t care what you think as long as it knows all and can sell your info to the highest bidder. Presumably, this is because Zuboff appears to have liberal sympathies — expressing support for abortion, for example, at one point in the book — and she otherwise champions a typically liberal defense of individualism and absolute freedom.
Discussing the anomie of modern life in our “Doomer” Age is at least part of tackling the puzzle of why we have allowed tech wizards to run our lives, provided Zuboff’s argument that control and manipulation are not inherent to technological advancement is correct. To be fair, she acknowledges that, “The consequences of this new logic of accumulation have already leaked and continue to leak beyond commercial practices into the fabric of our social relations, transforming our relationships to ourselves and to one another.”
The content is insightful and interesting, but is brought down by the overwrought, wordy, self-righteous presentation and the frequently italicized terms like this denoting a major new wordy concept that could actually be said much more simply and succinctly .
So let’s say it simply: Big Tech is out of control and it has too much control of us and our lives. We need concerted legislation and withdrawal of consent to start making a change and turn the tide, and we will leave it to another author—or perhaps Zuboff in the future—to offer us some of those specific policies and strategies for how to regain autonomy from the machines.

Did Ilhan Omar Help Benjamin Netanyahu Win Reelection?,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/ilhan-omar-help-benjamin-netanyahu-win-reelection/,"By David Marcus April 12, 2019
In all likelihood, very few Israelis probably know who Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar is. But a few weeks ago, in the lead-up to the Israeli election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the freshman congresswoman quite directly. At a American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, he told an audience to “take it from this Benjamin, its not all about the Benjamins.” It was a reference to Omar’s claim that American support for Israel is bought and paid for by Jews.
Netanyahu would go on to explain that “The reason…is not because they want our money. It’s because they share our values; It’s because America and Israel share a love of freedom and democracy. It’s because we cherish individual rights and the rule of law.”
The direct swipe at Omar was likely more intended for Jewish American audiences than those back in Israel, but it was a telling and important moment nonetheless. Something very profound has changed in regard to American-Israeli relations. Where there was once strong bipartisan support for Israel in the United States, there is now a Democratic Party loosening its ties to our greatest Middle Eastern ally. Omar, who appeared this week on the cover of Newsweek magazine, is the face of this change.
At the same time Omar has led Democrats away from support for Israel, the Republican Party under Donald Trump’s leadership has taken stunning steps to defend the Jewish state. It began with the United States moving its embassy to Jerusalem, a congressionally mandated action that presidents of both parties had promised but never acted on. The support has continued, most recently with American recognition that Israel rightfully controls the Golan Heights.
The Trump administration has been sending a very clear signal to the Palestinians that they can lose the stalemate that the Obama administration’s inaction created. The stalemate had been playing pretty well for the Palestinians. Support for their positions grew in Europe and the United Kingdom and, most importantly, in the United States, Democrats started to drift away from support for Netanyahu’s Israel.
The actions of the Trump administration are signaling to the Palestinians that they can’t just wait it out until the world comes around to their side. Instead, they will face meaningful diplomatic consequences as long as they refuse to negotiate and continue to attack Israel. That is the backdrop Trump created for the appearance of Omar and the newly anti-Israeli Democratic Party.
For many voters in Israel, this is clearly a disturbing development. The support of the United States is the most essential foreign alliance that the world’s only Jewish state has. If Netanyahu seems joined at the hip with Trump, this is why. Once again, for a record fifth time, the prime minister educated just outside Philadelphia was reelected on a platform of force, one that demands concessions to the Palestinians only be made if met with good faith and actions on their part.
However, Netanyahu’s victory and the Trump administration’s current power do not mean that Omar and the anti-Israel Democrats will ultimately lose this fight. That is why the next two years are vital for Israel, Palestinians, the wider Middle East, and the United States. A rumored deal involving the Saudis is apparently soon to be forthcoming at the behest of Jared Kushner, but will Palestinians be chastened by Trump’s aggressive actions and Netanyahu’s unprecedented victory? Or will they dig in, hoping that one of the Democratic candidates who refused to attend AIPAC’s gathering becomes America’s next commander in chief?
For now, that is the vital question. Israel’s voters have once again affirmed Netanyahu’s hard line and by extension the bold policies of the Trump administration. Will this bring the Palestinians to the table for good-faith negotiations, or will they continue to play a waiting game, hoping that Omar and the Justice Democrats can turn Americans against Israel?
Only time will tell, but just as Trump and Omar had their effects on the Israeli election, so may the Israeli and Palestinian situation have effects on our own. As the Russian collusion farce fades into memory, the actual context of the 2020 presidential election is coming into focus. Trump and Netanyahu have a unique opportunity to pursue a lasting peace.
Waiting in the wings is a new Democratic Party that has the knives out for Israel. The time to act is now. And for both the United States and Israel, everything hangs in the balance.

"Survey Shows DOJ Employees Lack Confidence In Their Leaders’ Integrity, Impartiality",thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/survey-shows-doj-employees-lack-confidence-leaders-integrity-impartiality/,"By Adam Mill April 12, 2019
Attorney General William Barr recently announced the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is about to conclude its investigation into 2016 FISA abuse and that he has begun reviewing the DOJ’s role in the genesis of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax.
“My question is, now that President Trump has been exonerated of collusion, is the Justice Department investigating how it came to be that your agency used a salacious and unverified dossier for [a search warrant application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]?” he asked during recent congressional testimony.
There’s little mystery here—the FBI paid informant Christopher Steele (among others ), two people subcontracting for the Clinton campaign ( here and here ), and promoted the hoax to the FBI help Clinton in her bid to defeat Trump in the election. We can also recall complaints of the DOJ targeting criminal prosecution based upon politics, the lawless actions of the deputy attorney general, and a general politicization of the application of the law. Barr has a dumpster fire on his hands. Inspector General Already Underlining DOJ Problems
Even before the anticipated OIG report on the DOJ’s malfeasance in the 2016 election, however, the OIG has already cataloged many unpunished acts by deep state actors bent on undermining the 2016 election. It found :
The FBI’s media policy, which strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, appeared to be widely ignored during the pre-election period that we reviewed. We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. We found that the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts influenced FBI officials on consequential investigative decisions.
The OIG also found that at the same time senior FBI officials were supposedly investigating Hillary Clinton for violating rules against using private email for government business, it identified a number of “instances in which senior FBI officials who had leadership and supervisory responsibilities over the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s use of private email used their own private email accounts for official government business.” Could there ever have been any doubt about the outcome of the Clinton email investigation when senior FBI officials ignored the same rules?
The OIG also noted that DOJ had a problem with failing to use merit to grant promotions and raises. It questioned the DOJ’s observance of whistleblower protection laws. The OIG found “5 instances of retaliation against whistleblowers. In each instance, the managers failed to recognize and adhere to clear laws and policies that protect employees for disclosing evidence of misconduct to lawful recipients.”
DOJ’s culture of hiding and tolerating misconduct within its ranks has claimed real victims. The OIG noted, “Department officials sexually harassed several subordinates, and sexually assaulted one, over a period of at least 10 years.”
DOJ dysfunction is a well-known fact among its own employees. Every year, an employee survey of the agencies that make up the federal government is conducted. All employees are asked to participate, so it’s more than a random sample. The data include real answers from employees who work in the department, and provide a rare window into an agency that confirms the outward appearance of a powerful agency in the grips of moral crisis. What DOJ Employees Think About Their Employer
Fewer than one in five DOJ respondents to this survey strongly agree that their organization’s senior leaders maintain high standards of honesty and integrity. About 23 percent either disagree or strongly disagree with that statement.
A little more than 22 percent of responding DOJ employees report having a high level of respect for DOJ’s senior leaders, versus 21.6 percent who either disagree or strongly disagree with that statement. Around 13 percent of respondents report being “very satisfied” with the policies and practices of their senior leaders, compared to 25.1 percent reporting “dissatisfied or very dissatisfied.”
Only 26.6 percent of respondents strongly agree that they can “disclose a suspected violation of any law, rule or regulation without fear of reprisal.” A little more than 18 percent disagree or strongly disagree with that statement. Only 9.7 percent of respondents strongly agree with the statement, “Promotions in my work unit are based on merit.” And 36.6 percent disagree or strongly disagree with that statement.
Only 6.9 percent strongly agree that in their work unit, steps are taken to deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve. More than 43 percent either disagree or strongly disagree with that statement. Likewise, only 8.5 percent strongly agree that differences in performance are recognized in a meaningful way. More than 35 percent disagree or strongly disagree.
Nearly 12 percent of respondents strongly agree that awards in the employee’s work unit depend on how well employees perform their jobs. Roughly 33 percent disagree or strongly disagree. And 6.4 percent of respondents strongly agree that pay raises depend on how well employees perform their jobs. Meanwhile, 46.6 percent disagree or strongly disagree.
About 16 percent of respondents strongly agree that arbitrary action, personal favoritism, and coercion for partisan political purposes are not tolerated. Almost 28 percent disagree or strongly disagree with that statement and 23.1 percent said they had no opinion on the topic. Even adding the “agree” responses with the “strongly agree” responses, still fewer than half of respondents agreed.
Americans should consider the DOJ’s own lack of confidence in the integrity of their senior leadership to be a national crisis. The DOJ controls the FBI and federal prosecution. It has the power to destroy lives with the stroke of a pen. We just endured a special counsel that executed 500 search warrants, 2,800 subpoenas, and 500 interrogations of American citizens. Our Founders and Framers feared out of control national law enforcement and they would weep at DOJ’s contempt for its constitutional masters.
We should all demand the highest standards of integrity in the department or be prepared to submit to tyranny. Adam Mill is a pen name.

"What I Learned When I Enrolled In A Race, Gender, And Oppression Studies Class",thefederalist.com,Brad Polumbo,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/learned-enrolled-race-gender-oppression-studies-class/,"By Brad Polumbo April 12, 2019
Anyone who has spent time on a college campus has likely run into victimhood ideology. Yet while many campus conservatives are put off by the identity politics and liberalism-run-amok that have transformed many academic departments into adult daycares, they often don’t try to understand the ideology corrupting the modern academy.
So I did exactly that. During my final semester in college, I intentionally took a course focused on race, gender, and the history of oppression in the United States. Of course, this featured ample study of buzzwords like racism, privilege, and identity. The most jarring realization: liberal academics define “oppression” so loosely that their victimhood narrative can never end.
Many works of academic literature throughout political science, gender studies, sociology, and the like draw on a famous paper entitled the “Five Faces of Oppression,” which lays out a definition of oppression that has now become the gold-standard in grievance studies. The author, the late feminist professor Iris Marion Young, has been cited thousands of times by other academics and her work is taught in courses across the country.
This wouldn’t be so significant, if it weren’t for the fact that the definition of oppression Marion Young establishes is intellectually bankrupt. It provides a framework that could fool young people with ample opportunity in life into thinking that they are victims. Marion Young’s Criteria Hoodwink Young People
Marion Young lays out five criteria that can supposedly make a person or social group oppressed: exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural dominance, and violence. Each criterion is defined loosely enough to lend themselves to a kind of subjective self-victimization. This is convincing a generation of young people that their life trajectories are beyond their control.
Take Young’s “exploitation,” for example. She considers a person or group exploited if others use their labor without paying them fairly. Of course, it’s true that everyone deserves fair pay. But the definition of fair pay is entirely subjective, and we all often think that we deserve to be paid more.
Yet that can’t always happen: Lifting the minimum wage to $20 an hour might seem like the right way to help a struggling McDonald’s worker, but she’ll only be left feeling more oppressed when her hours get cut or her job gets automated because McDonald’s can’t make enough money to pay those wages. So it’s simply not sensible to call anyone whose pay is less than ideal “oppressed”—sometimes, that’s just a reality of life. We can’t call every unfortunate situation where people don’t get what they want oppression, or the term loses all meaning.
Marion Young also cites marginalization as another chief indicator of oppression, writing that when groups are viewed as second class or otherwise pushed to society’s margins, they ought to be viewed as oppressed. In theory, this makes sense. But how are we supposed to measure something like that? It seems to me there’s no real way to measure subjective or perceived social standing outside of the most blatant situations. So this feel-good philosophizing really just provides another pathway to victim status for anyone who claims to feel marginalized in one way or another.
The feminist scholar meanders on to the concept of powerlessness, where her academic musings on victimhood begin to sound eerily Marxist. She identifies one form of oppression as political powerlessness, where a supposedly all-powerful ruling class holds most of the sway in a society, leaving an oppressed mass made up of certain groups with little influence.
Unfortunately, this powerlessness is so loosely defined and subjectively situated that even the fact that we live in a democratic society does not assuage this narrative. In fact, others expanding on Marion Young’s ideas have used the fact that people choose not to vote as evidence of oppression. Too Many People Agreeing Makes for Oppression
The histrionics continue into a conversation about cultural domination, the notion that when a culture reflects a majority consensus or commonality, anyone in the out-group is inherently “otherized” and oppressed. For example, Young and her acolytes would consider gay people inherently oppressed merely because most people are heterosexual and that reality is reflected in our mass media.
As a gay person, I can tell you that’s it’s not always fun to be in the minority, and in some cases, it can be incredibly difficult. Yet it’s simply not true that anyone who is a minority in a given culture is automatically oppressed.
After all, is an American studying abroad in Japan for a semester “oppressed” in any meaningful way? Of course not, even though he’ll certainly be surrounded by an unfamiliar culture. This kind of thinking would theoretically allow any group that constitutes a numerical minority to claim oppression no matter how much progress is objectively made toward equality in society. After all, the sheer fact that a person’s demographic characteristics are a rarity in a given culture tells you nothing about the actual treatment he faces or her actual life situation.
For example, a gay person may not be oppressed—even if he’s surrounded by straight people and gay experiences aren’t reflected in mainstream culture—if he’s treated fairly and faces little discrimination in his actual life. So the idea that “cultural domination” is inherently a form of oppression just doesn’t make sense.
Finally, Young comes to what is likely her most sensible characteristic of oppression when she uses violence as a metric. And it’s indisputable that any person who is a victim of a violent hate crime has certainly experienced discrimination that shouldn’t be ignored. But her definition of “violence” extends to the subjective fear of violence, so that any member of a group that faces violence—even if they never have themselves—is considered oppressed. Fear of Violence vs. Actual Violence
Violence is surely a form of oppression, but this definition is far too loose. After all, this framework would theoretically view as a gay person like me as “oppressed” so long as there are still anti-gay hate crimes occurring out there somewhere, even if I’d never experienced any and led a relatively easy life.
It’s understandable that some groups, statistically more prone to face violence, might have concerns. But we should respond to those concerns with empowerment—like encouraging them to defend themselves through the Second Amendment—not by offering the cheap intellectual cop-out of victimhood ideology. After all, it’s unlikely that we’ll ever reach the point where there are zero bias crimes, so claiming oppression until we reach such an imaginary utopia is, frankly, foolish.
Young’s noxious narrative of oppression extends far beyond one academic paper. Her work has inspired a generation of academics who go on to peddle victimhood ideology at colleges across the country, and has no doubt reached hundreds of thousands if not millions of students.
The prevalence of such a loose narrative of victimhood is setting the stage for my generation’s failure. Of course injustices exist that need rectifying, but it’s an amazing time to be an American, with fantastic economic growth, record-low unemployment across many demographics, and an abundance of opportunity for those willing to chase it.
Unfortunately, the Oppression Olympics ideology rife within the modern academy corrodes young people’s outlook, convincing many of my peers that our life outcomes are largely out of our hands, beholden to the vague notion of oppressors in society at large. These theories tell them that nothing is their fault. This annihilation of agency is what’s really oppressing my generation. Brad Polumbo is a freelance writer.

"Don’t Bash Teachers, Show How The Right’s Ideas Will Lift Pay And Prestige",thefederalist.com,Auguste Meyrat,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/dont-bash-teachers-show-rights-ideas-will-lift-pay-prestige/,"By Auguste Meyrat April 12, 2019
Presidential candidate Kamala Harris (D-CA) recently proposed to raise the salaries of teachers across the nation by $13,500 . She cited the many recent teacher protests over inadequate wages and argued teachers’ experience and credentials should qualify them for higher pay.
While any teacher would welcome a hefty raise, Harris’s proposal is obvious pandering with no hope of success. The plan would cost at least $315 billion and completely override local and state authorities, plus it treats all teachers and their schools as a vast homogenous constituency to be bought off. Furthermore, it’s debatable whether this would really improve public education, seeing that the plan fails to set any expectations for educators to merit this raise.
On a deeper level, this proposal reveals the way Democrats view teachers. In their eyes, teachers are helpless victims in need of assistance from unions and government welfare. Rather than proud autonomous professionals hoping to make a difference in their communities and win recognition, they are seen as a mass of insecure weaklings fearing all forms of accountability and amenable to cheap rhetoric and large-scale bribery. The Right Often Isn’t Much More Appealing to Teachers
Unfortunately, the typical conservative rebuttal to Harris’s plan isn’t much better—and politically speaking, it’s much worse. The editors at National Review rightly call out Harris’s vote-buying and lack of realism, but then argue teachers do not deserve raises but the opposite. In essence, they claim the work of teachers is less valuable than that of pretty much any other job, and teacher certifications are no more credible than “the backs of cereal boxes.”
Only out-of-touch intellectuals who work at conservative think tanks would think it a good idea to antagonize 3.6 million educators and, by extension, the 56 million students in their charge. Considering these two views of teachers—one that characterizes them as victims in need of welfare, and the other that characterizes them as overpaid, undereducated, unproductive bureaucrats burdening communities—it’s easy to see why most teachers vote Democrat.
Besides the political damage this characterization inflicts, it also undermines the argument it’s supposed to help—that of school choice. If teachers are not paid fairly (whether too much or too little), it doesn’t necessary follow that giving parents vouchers to choose their child’s school will change anything. In fact, if teachers are as incompetent and inconsequential as these conservatives say they are, then it seems much more likely that teachers will see their salaries cut for the sake of efficiency and profitability.
After all, why would a school hire a teacher with credentials and experience when it could hire a graduate student who could do the same work for much less money? This has already been happening at the college level as adjunct professors continue to replace tenured faculty. Fortunately, there is an answer to this outcome that should better satisfy students, teachers, and school choice proponents: the conventional wisdom on K-12 education is wrong, and school choice really does have the potential to increase both teacher quality and pay. School Choice Will Help Boost Teacher Pay
Both liberals and conservatives tend to work from the oversimplified definition of teachers as mediocre professionals. The only real difference between the two is that liberals want to reward this mediocrity and conservatives want to punish it. However, teachers are so much more than this caricature, and those who have any familiarity with education understand this well.
In truth, there are five main facets to teaching: scholarship, instruction, management, relationships, and wisdom. The first two facets—scholarship and instruction—can be measured by checking certificates and degrees, years of experience, reviewing test scores, and doing class observations. The other three facets defy measurement, but have more to do with a teacher’s effectiveness than the first two.
Excellent teachers know their material and how to communicate that knowledge and give useful feedback, plus how to keep their classes orderly (which can be particularly hard at certain campuses), have a good rapport with their students (which, again, can also be hard depending on the students), and make the right decisions at the right times and plan accordingly.
Without the competition that comes with school choice, there is little incentive for teachers to be excellent. Rather, there is more incentive to be the opposite since excellent teachers raise expectations of other teachers and require more attention from administrators. Such was the case, for example, for celebrity calculus teacher Jaime Escalante, who, even after achieving the miracle of turning barrio thugs into advanced mathematicians, was eventually forced to resign because of jealous teachers and spineless administrators.
Nevertheless, school choice could still discourage excellent teaching if school boards value profit and marketing over delivering a quality product. Parents could expect many schools to try to draw in already-motivated students with flashy advertisements, gimmicky labels, and high test scores even if their school is really little more than a test-prep center with untrained adults passing out workbooks and playing on their phones while students teach themselves—which describes plenty of “successful” charter and private schools.
Ideally, school reformers would find a better model than the public sector that punishes excellence or the business world that misidentifies it. Instead, they should follow the world of sports, which takes into account both the tangible and intangible virtues of excellent athletes as well as their respective situations. Incentives Matter
Consider a basketball player like LeBron James. He is an excellent athlete who puts up amazing numbers every game, and those measurable statistics result from the unmeasurable things he does—his strength, endurance, agility, and finesse. He also was able to distinguish himself on both a terrible team, the Cleveland Cavaliers in the mid-00s, and a star-studded team, the Miami Heat in the early teens.
In many ways, LeBron James is the Jaime Escalante of basketball—though one could argue that Escalante achieved an even greater feat, doing far more with far less. Yet James earns more than $35 million a year while Escalante moved back to Bolivia and died of cancer in 2010.
There’s perhaps no greater tragedy than seeing an excellent teacher burn out and leave the profession, leave the campus that needs him most, or leave the classroom to become a bureaucrat in the higher echelons of a school district, but this is what public education encourages. It would be like James and all the other All-Stars leaving the court for coaching and management positions, abandoning their fans and hometown for a championship dynasty (something that, because of counterproductive salary caps , actually does happen for stars in the NBA), or quitting altogether.
It should be the opposite, and it can be the opposite. For those who scoff at the idea of compensating excellent teachers like excellent athletes, they should ponder Socrates’ famous declaration in Plato’s “ Apology ,” explaining why he deserved an enormous fortune instead of execution: “he [the athlete] only gives you the appearance of happiness, and I give you the reality.” True, the court still sentenced Socrates to death, but Socrates could rightly claim credit for doing infinitely more for his students and his society than any popular athlete in his time. Generously compensated and highly regarded, it is not unreasonable to think that great teachers today could achieve something similar.
If conservatives and school choice proponents made this their goal—that is, finding ways to increase teacher compensation and quality through competition and properly recognizing good teachers—they would be part of something far more consequential than deriding Harris and the millions of teachers she aims to please. In the sense that it would promote excellence, strengthen Western civilization, limit government involvement, and expand freedom for both teachers and students, it would also be far more conservative.

Trump Administration Plans To Bail Out Insurers To Hide Higher Drug Costs,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/trump-administration-plans-bail-insurers-hide-higher-drug-costs/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 12, 2019
The more things change, the more they stay the same. On a Friday, the Trump administration issued a little-noticed three paragraph statement that used seemingly innocuous language to outline a forthcoming bailout of health insurers—this one designed to avoid political controversy prior to the president’s re-election campaign.
Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) quite rightly criticized President Obama for wanting to bail out health insurers via a crony capitalist boondoggle. They should do the same now that Trump wants to waste billions more on a similar tactic that has all the stench of the typical Washington “Swamp.” Explaining the President’s Drug Pricing Proposal
The announcement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) involves the president’s efforts on drug pricing. As part of that campaign, the administration released a proposed rule —comments on which were due April 8—that would change the system of rebates handled by pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs).
At present, drug manufacturers pay rebates to PBMs in exchange for preferred placement on an insurer’s pharmacy formulary. PBMs then share (most of) these rebates with insurers, who pass them on to beneficiaries. But historically, PBMs have passed those rebates on via lower premiums , rather than via lower drug prices to consumers.
For instance, Drug X may have a $100 list price (the “sticker” price that Manufacturer Y publicly advertises), but Manufacturer Y will pay a PBM a $60 rebate to get Drug X on the PBM’s formulary list. It sounds like a great deal, one in which patients get the drug for less than half price—except that’s not how it works at present.
Instead, the PBM uses the $60 rebate to lower premiums for everyone covered by Insurer A. And the patient’s cost-sharing is based on the list price (i.e., $100) rather than the lower price net of rebates (i.e., $40). This current policy hurts people whose insurance requires them to pay co-insurance, or who have yet to meet their annual deductible—because in both cases, their cost-sharing will be based on the (higher) list price.
The proposed rule would require PBMs operating within Medicare and Medicaid to pass any rebates they receive directly through to customers at the point of sale. (Extending this proposed change to other forms of insurance would require Congress to pass legislation.) For the reasons explained above, the change would lower out-of-pocket costs for seniors—particularly for those with very high drug costs. But prohibiting PBMs from applying rebates to premiums means that the latter by definition will rise. The Policy and Political Problems
The administration’s proposed rule conceded that the proposed change could raise Medicare Part D premiums. The CMS Office of the Actuary estimated the rule would raise premiums anywhere from $3.20 to $5.64 per month. (Some administration officials have argued that premiums may stay flat, if greater pricing transparency prompts more competition among drug manufacturers.)
The rule presents intertwined practical and political problems. From a practical perspective, the administration wants the rule to take effect in 2020. But the comment period on the proposed rule just closed, and the review of those comments could last well beyond the June 3 date for plans to submit bids to offer Part D coverage next year.
The political implications seem obvious. The administration doesn’t want to anger seniors with Part D premium increases heading into the president’s re-election bid. And while the administration could have asked insurers to submit two sets of plan bids for 2020—one assuming the rebate rule goes into effect next year, and one assuming that it doesn’t—doing so would have made very explicit how much the change will raise premiums, handing Democrats a political cudgel on a hot-button issue. Here Comes the Bailout
That dynamic led to the Friday announcement from CMS:
If there is a change in the safe harbor rules effective in 2020, CMS will conduct a demonstration that would test an efficient transition for beneficiaries and plans to such a change in the Part D program. The demonstration would consist of a modification to the Part D risk corridors for plans for which a bid is submitted. For CY2020, under the demonstration, the government would bear or retain 95% of the deviation between the target amount, as defined in section 1860D-15(e)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and the actual incurred costs, as defined in section 1860D-15(e)(1) of the Act, beyond the first 0.5%. Participation in the two-year demonstration would be voluntary and plans choosing to participate would do so for both years. Under the demonstration, further guidance regarding the application process would be provided at a later date.
To translate the jargon: Risk corridors are a program in which the federal government subsidizes insurers who incur large losses, and in exchange insurers agree to give back any large gains. I explained how they worked in the Obamacare context here . However, unlike Obamacare—which had a risk corridor program that lasted only from 2014-2016—Congress created a permanent risk corridor program for Medicare Part D.
It all sounds well and good—until you look more closely at the announcement. CMS says it will “bear or retain 95% of the deviation…beyond the first 0.5%.” That’s not a government agency sharing risk—that’s a government agency assuming virtually all of the risk associated with the higher premium costs due to the rebate rule. In other words, a bailout. Déjà Vu All Over Again
The use of a supposed “demonstration project” to implement this bailout echoes back to the Obama administration. In November 2010, the Obama administration announced it would create a “demonstration project” regarding Medicare Advantage, and Republicans—rightfully—screamed bloody murder.
They had justifiable outrage, because the added spending from the project, which lasted from years 2012 through 2014, seemed purposefully designed to delay the effects of Obamacare’s cuts to Medicare Advantage. Put simply, the Obama administration didn’t want stories of angry seniors losing their coverage due to Obamacare during the president’s re-election campaign, so they used a “demonstration project” to buy everyone’s silence.
In response to requests from outraged Republicans, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted multiple reviews of the Medicare Advantage “demonstration project.” Not only did GAO note that the $8 billion cost of the project “dwarfs all other Medicare demonstrations…in its estimated budgetary impact and is larger in size and scope than many of them,” it also questioned “the agency’s legal authority to undertake the demonstration.” In other words, the Obama administration did not just undertake a massive insurer bailout, it undertook an illegal one as well.
The current administration has yet to release official details about what it proposes to study in its “demonstration project,” but, in some respects, those details matter little. The real points of inquiry are as follows: Whether buying off insurance companies and seniors will aid Trump’s re-election; and whether any enterprising journalists, fiscal conservatives, or other good government types will catch on, and raise enough objections to nix the bailout. Congress Should Stop the Insanity
On the latter count, Congress has multiple options open to it. It can obtain request audits and rulings from GAO regarding the legality of the “demonstration,” once those details become public. It can explore passing a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, which would nullify Friday afternoon’s memo.
It can also use its appropriations power to defund the “demonstration project,” preventing the waste of taxpayer funds on slush funds and giveaways to insurers. Best of all, they can do all three.
Republicans objected to crony capitalism under Democrats—Rubio famously helped block a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare’s risk corridor program back in 2014. Here’s hoping they will do the same thing when it comes to the latest illegal insurer bailout proposed by CMS.

Arthur Brooks Considers The Promise—And Peril—Of Loving Your Enemies,thefederalist.com,Sarah Weaver,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/arthur-brooks-considers-promise-peril-loving-enemies/,"By Sarah Weaver April 12, 2019
Every American concerned about our modern polarized moment would profit from an open-minded and critical reading of Arthur Brook’s latest book, Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt . Not everyone will agree with every problem, solution, reason, and view Brooks posits in his book—I didn’t—but everyone should take up Brooks’ challenge for Americans to “find common ground where it genuinely exists, improve our own arguments, and win over persuadable Americans by answering hostility with magnanimity, understanding, good humor, and love.”
Brooks, the outgoing president of the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute, urges us to embrace what we have in common, seek out viewpoints we oppose or find uncomfortable, embrace and encourage a free competition of ideas, shun the partisan, manufactured outrage of social media platforms, and seek out and become leaders who unite for the truth, rather than divide for votes, retweets, followers, etc. Most of all, he says, we should never, ever treat a human being with contempt. All this, without urging anyone to yield an inch on what he truly believes.
However, in Brooks’ noble effort to encourage us to “love our enemies,” he tends to overplay our unity, and underplay how deep and how real what divides us is. Our culture of contempt is not cured by realizing that we really agree on so much, but by realizing that despite how much we disagree on, we can still afford to treat every human being with dignity and respect. Even if we share no views, policies, or aims, we do share a common humanity and dignity, which, for our own good and for that of others, should inspire us to forego the common culture of contempt. Free Speech and Viewpoint Diversity
“Competition breeds excellence,” writes Brooks. “Shutting down the competition of ideas makes it harder to achieve our common moral grounds.” If we are going to cure our culture of contempt, Brooks argues we have to allow all ideas, whether we like them or not, to be confronted in the public square. “Walling ourselves off” merely intensifies our contempt for the “other.”
Indeed, it should be those who are the most intense in their own viewpoints, who believe they are the most right, who should wish every idea to be confronted on equal footing with theirs. It’s like a sports competition, Brooks says. No matter how much you love your team, you wouldn’t rest well in the thought that your team cheated to win the championship. You would desire the objective excellence of your team to be the cause of its winning. In the same way, in the marketplace of ideas, it is those ideas that have prevailed despite competition from other ideas that carry the most weight.
“We need Republicans and Democrats to argue fiercely over the best ways to combat poverty, reduce dependency, and give more Americans the opportunity to achieve the happiness of earned success,” he writes. In other words, avoiding contempt doesn’t mean avoiding our disagreements, it means confronting others’ head-on. Then, may the best man win.
It isn’t exactly a novel idea to anyone familiar with social media that Twitter is a unique venue for allowing the worst of humanity to manifest itself. Anonymous accounts—something Brooks addresses, urging Americans to neither post anonymously, nor engage with anonymous Twitter users—allow what may otherwise be decent human beings to conceal themselves behind a screen of namelessness.
When you debate, as Brooks put it, “TrumpLover2016” and “BernieBro2020,” anonymity makes it much harder to see the humanity in each other. Without having some sense of who the person is, it’s difficult to see how they might share the same objectives as you. Leadership and Unity
Throughout the book, Brooks never urges us to put aside our disagreements, or even deny they exist—although he does give Americans credit for being more unified than they really are (more on that later)—but urges us to both follow and become unifying leaders. In a climate that tells us to “Get in the gutter or go home,” the best leaders will avoid bullying and the contempt it creates.
“Authoritative leaders aren’t peacemakers. They aren’t conflict-averse. They just understand how to manage conflict in a way that is not destructive,” he writes. This applies to pundits, authors, politicians, and citizen leaders of all sorts. A leader confronts opposing viewpoints because while the viewpoint itself may be contemptible, that doesn’t always mean the person advocating it is similarly contemptible.
However, Brooks seems to underestimate the difficulty of the ability of even well-intentioned, capable leaders to unite us. Early on, Brooks offers this statement to describe how he thinks about politics in the first page of his book: “I like winter, you like summer; you’re a liberal, I’m a conservative.”
This doesn’t get things off to a great start. The book redeems itself elsewhere, and it’s worth recommending, but the idea that our disagreements just really aren’t that deep in the first place, that our political beliefs are insignificant, easily overlooked, even arbitrary, and that if we only stopped and took a breath, we’d see how much we really do agree on, is naively optimistic.
Brooks contends that, while we do disagree, we don’t really disagree on as much as we think we do. “Monty Python made this point hilariously in the movie Life of Brian , where the bitterest of enemies,” Brooks writes, “are two rival Jewish dissident groups: the Judean People’s Front and People’s Front of Judea.” If only.
Unfortunately, we do not have nearly as much in common as we used to. When the “shared objective” is so diametrically opposed, when one side’s view simply cannot exist in harmony with the other, then, “I like winter, you like summer,” isn’t an adequate analogy. With few exceptions, it is more accurately summed up as, “I like winter, you like summer; you want to end winter.”
There was a time liberals said, “You like your doctor, you can keep your doctor,” while maintaining that those who like government-funded health care can also have their government-funded health care. Now, mainstream Democrat candidates such as Kamala Harris advocate that we “get rid of all that,” in reference to private health insurance. In other words, “I like private health care, you like government-run healthcare. But you want to end my private health care.”
Indeed, there are issues, most notably late-term abortion and infanticide, where the disagreement is so strong that Brook’s assessment of our divide as an unremarkable difference in preference as to the weather is simply wrong. If a pro-life American ever hopes to win his pro-choice opponent over, treating him with contempt would be inadvisable. But it would also be inadvisable to downplay the deepness of what divides them. Stand Up for the Other Side
However, none of these differences means we have to resign ourselves to be as polarized as we are. As Brooks says, “Criticize those you disagree with without insulting them, questioning their motives, or weaponizing your values.”
Brooks encourages us to “Defend someone with whom you disagree, simply because he or she has a right to an opinion and the right to be heard. Take note that your heart will be on fire when you do it. That’s because it’s morally right, and your heart knows it.”
It’s a worthy bit of advice. Nothing convinces your opponent less than mindless insults. And nothing will open his mind to your view more than treating him without contempt. Find Sarah Weaver on Twitter @SarahHopeWeaver ."
How To Add A Christian Pilgrimage To Your Summer Vacation,thefederalist.com,Rebekah Curtis,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/add-christian-pilgrimage-summer-vacation/,"By Rebekah Curtis April 12, 2019
Christian pilgrimages have been difficult for the last 1,500 years. The oldest Christian locales have been appropriated by people who, unlike Christians, are allowed to appropriate things without being called imperialists and bigots.
But the church is where God plants it, and since disciples continue to be made of all nations, there are lots of Christian places all over this world. If you’re traveling in the United States this summer, why not add a Christian cultural stop to your itinerary? Here are some ideas. (And remember: one Christian’s oddity is another’s piety. Niceness isn’t a fruit of the Spirit, but kindness is.) The Big Ones
You’ve probably heard of these: Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C., Sight and Sound Theaters at Branson, Missouri, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania; the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter in northern Kentucky; Holy Land Experience in Orlando.
These are whole-day (or more) stops with a touristy feel. If you’re the kind of person who would look for a vacation stop like this, you’ll also enjoy explaining the things you didn’t agree with to your travel companions while you drive back to the hotel. The Middle Ones
The mid ones. Lots of cities have an impressive cathedral , basilica , or cathedral basilica. If your itinerary allows, take in some mosaics, colonnades, or anything they got now. These places are low on snacks, but the air conditioning is reliable. The Little Ones
The little ones are the real treasures. There’s St. Kateri Tekakwitha , rupturing the landscape of tiny Ridgway, Illinois like a rogue fault block mountain. There’s Holy Transfiguration Skete , with its golden dome piously peeking out of the pine and birch forest of Upper Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula, and its lordly Jampot bakery .
Several replica stave churches in the upper Midwest can save you a pricier trip to Norway. Get lots of bang for your buck on the southern end of the Texas Triangle, where you’ll find the astonishing Painted Churches in towns barely big enough to accommodate a case of hiccups.
Another great church route is the Benjamin F. Long IV Fresco Trail in western North Carolina, where you can find sacred frescoes born in the USA. Places like this might require you to pound on doors in the neighborhood for a look inside. It’s a proven method. Look for Church Architecture
Get to know an architect besides Frank Lloyd Wright. In the general vicinity of Arkansas, have the road to take you to Thorncrown Chapel or another of E. Fay Jones’ 15 churches. If you’re going more Okie than Arkie, look for some of Bruce Goff’s funky houses of worship.
Find a church designed by Ralph Adams Cram anywhere between Massachusetts and Nebraska (and one lonely specimen out in Tacoma). Harold E. Wagoner has installments all over the country in addition to his famous Coral Ridge Presbyterian. Erhard Brielmaier designed so many churches that you might want to check if he built the one you attend.
On the west end of the country, see one of the California missions , famous not for their architects, but for their lack of them. And you’re right, Mr. Lloyd Wright had a church worth seeing, and so did his kid . Religious Cultural Sites Abound
Stop by a college or seminary, a monastery or convent, a denominational epicenter , or a church historic site . You’ll likely find a museum , gallery , archive , or chapel where you’ll learn something. Instagram it to look very holy in an intellectual way. Try Some Weird Ones
Evangelicals exhibit it as a spiritual gift, and for Roman Catholics it’s a charism, but since they both have it you can tell that weirdness is an ecumenical mark of the church. Get in on the fun and hit a Christian weird spot, like Bible Mini-Golf in Lexington, Kentucky. T. H. Stemper church supply in Milwaukee is the American Science and Surplus of Catholicism; both places should be national franchises (and really, most church supply stores have a back room full of goofy stuff on clearance).
If the Creation Museum is too crowded for you, try the Museum of Creation in Southern Pines, North Carolina, which rejoices in God’s gift of taxidermy. Biblical gardens come in varying degrees of weirdness . And, Exodus notwithstanding, Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee decided to go with the Egyptian motif. Seeing isn’t believing , but you might want to take a look. Ever Heard of a Carillon?
Listen for a carillon . Since bell towers tend to belong to churches, chances are good that you’ll catch some sacred music selections you can’t hear anywhere else.
Carillon concerts are very family-friendly since they’re outside. Bring bubbles and victuals for your smaller humans, teach the bigger ones that there is stimulation apart from screens, and enjoy the listen. How do they practice those things, anyway? There’s Always Sunday Morning!
Go to church on Sunday morning, even though you’re on vacation. God doesn’t take a vacation from you. Rebekah Curtis is a housewife with a writing and indexing hobby.

"Google Marks Pro-Life Film 'Propaganda,' Labels Nazi Propaganda 'History'",thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/google-marks-pro-life-film-as-propaganda-but-labels-literal-nazi-propaganda-film-as-history/,"April 12, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
A Google search for the new movie, “Unplanned” returned results labeling the film “Drama/Propaganda,” while other films that are actual propaganda material do not receive the same designation. “Unplanned” is the story of a Planned Parenthood director who became pro-life after witnessing an abortion.
Kelsey Bolar, a Daily Signal writer and Federalist contributor, captured a screenshot of the search result below on Thursday. By Friday, the label had been removed.

A Google search for the 1935 Nazi propaganda film, “The Triumph of the Will,” returns results labeling it “History/War.” The director Leni Riefenstahl was called up by Adolf Hitler himself, commissioning her to make a film of the annual rally of the Nazi party.
A spokesperson for Google told Fox News that the search engine’s “Knowledge Graph” created the label based on web content describing “Unplanned” as propaganda.
“When we’re made aware of disputed facts in our Knowledge Graph, we work to fix the issues, as we’ve done in this case,” the spokesperson said.
Given this logic, Google’s “Knowledge Graph” was also apparently unable to find enough web content to be able to determine whether “Triumph of the Will” is a history movie, or Nazi propaganda film."
You Don’t Need A Cultural Appropriation Mob To Take Out Lucky Lee’s. The Market Will Do That On Its Own,thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/dont-need-cultural-appropriation-mob-take-lucky-lees-market-will/,"By Liz Wolfe April 12, 2019
This week, a new Chinese-American food restaurant opened in New York City. This would usually be an unremarkable occurrence in a city where new eateries open up regularly, but this one was different because the owner, Arielle Haspel, is a white woman who has been heavily scrutinized for her branding of her restaurant, Lucky Lee’s, calling typical Chinese food “too oily” and salty, claiming in a since-deleted Instagram post it makes people feel “bloated and icky.” Not a brilliant move.
A word about Haspel: she’s probably partially coming under fire due to her tone-deaf marketing strategies, but also due to the fact that she’s a fitstagram influencer wannabe type; a nutritionist focused on “clean eating.” The New York Times reports that Lucky Lee’s “entire menu is gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, corn-free, peanut-, cashew- and pistachio-free … We use non-GMO oil, and never refined sugar, MSG or food coloring.” This leads me to wonder how the food gets its flavor, but I digress.
The basic complaints against Haspel have to do with her obnoxious comments about Chinese food, which understandably frustrate many Chinese restaurant owners and Chinese-Americans who have an appreciation for their unique food history. There’s also a credible racial insensitivity undertone, more so than with other cultural appropriation food scandals. A Time magazine piece from 2016 touched on the Americanization of Chinese food, and how Chinese-American food adapted to fit Americans’ palates:
Regardless of its dubious authenticity, such adaptation of Chinese cooking to American palates was a key element in the proliferation and popularization of Chinese cuisine in the United States. Throughout the early 20th century, ‘Chinese’ dishes became sweeter, boneless, and more heavily deep-fried. Broccoli, a vegetable unheard of in China, started appearing on menus and fortune cookies , a sweet originally thought to be from Japan, finished off a ‘typical’ Chinese meal.
(For more on this, David Chang’s “Ugly Delicious” explores how American palates still aren’t interested in the range of texture in traditional Chinese food.)
Haspel is effectively trying to capitalize on Americans’ love for not-very-authentic Chinese food, while attempting to make bank on the clean eating trend and posh, wealthy schtick of knowing where your food comes from (not exclusive to New York , of course). This is extra ironic given that Chinese food became less “clean” to adapt to American preferences, the irony of which seems to be a bit lost on Haspel. This isn’t a capital offense, but it’s still a frustrating one.
Still, God bless the free market for allowing her to see a gap in food options for people with allergies, celiac disease, and the like, and choosing to fill it. If this is, in fact, a desired type of food for that group, Haspel will probably do quite well, and perhaps some of the ostensibly sensitive and well-intentioned social justice devotees who are getting mad at her should also consider that she’s catering toward people who have major medical problems.
People’s anger might also have to do with the fact that Haspel seems like she’s trying to pull wool over people’s eyes. She named the restaurant “Lucky Lee’s,” after her husband, Lee. As one blogger noted , “ Oh boy. Someone on IG had already posted this, but if her husband’s name was ‘Chad,’ would she have named this restaurant Lucky Chad’s?” Sub in “Justin” or “Shane,” and the thought experiment just keeps working. It seems a bit like Haspel has an eye for branding, but didn’t expect people to do quite so much sleuthing. How naive in the internet-scold day and age!
As a matter of principle, I don’t think there should be a hard and fast moratorium on white people cooking the food of cultures that they cannot claim. This will limit the range of good food, and needlessly limit people’s creative freedom. All that aside, piling on a single woman—when you might, in fact, be frustrated by the more complex legacy of how Chinese food has been treating in America—feels like a bit much.
Still, nuance gets lost when we’re talking about cultural appropriation and food: the end product might simply be less good, and a crappy representation of the food genre, if the person creating it has no clue what she’s doing and hardly cares to learn. Plus, it’s frustrating for those who have worked to show American audiences the nuances of their food culture.
Of course, maybe Haspel isn’t aiming for a Chinese audience at all. Maybe she’s going for the people who don “Rosé all day” shirts and looking for some gluten-free noms after Soulcycle (the most cringeworthy possible type of person, but whatever. They still need to eat).
The takeaway, though, should be that Haspel deserves a bit of criticism for rudeness, but not a full-on a–hole social media mob (in fact, very few people deserve mobs! They are bad for our souls). The market will decide whether her restaurant stays afloat or not ( early reviews suggest that the food isn’t good). It’s yet another excellent function of the glorious free market that giveth and taketh away. Liz Wolfe is managing editor at The Federalist, based in Austin, Texas. Follow her on Twitter."
‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ Trailer Debuts,thefederalist.com,Brad Jackson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/star-wars-rise-skywalker-trailer-debuts/,"By Brad Jackson April 12, 2019
Today, fans at Star Wars Celebration in Chicago (and all over the world) got their first sneak peak at the year’s most hotly anticipated movie: “Star Wars: Episode IX.” The final film in the original saga envisioned by George Lucas more than 40 years ago is titled “The Rise of Skywalker.”
Now honestly, as Star Wars movie titles go, “The Rise of Skywalker” is only slightly better than “Attack of the Clones” in my opinion, but it is fitting that the title features “Skywalker.” Episode IX’s title should also set theories abuzzing, because the obvious question is: which Skywalker is it referring to? If we’re talking about a rising Skywalker, it’s probably not referring to the now-deceased Luke, or the aged Leia. Is it a reference to Kylo Ren (technically a Skywalker) or perhaps a reference to the true parentage of Rey?
I’ve always thought that every Star Wars film is really a movie about Darth Vader, in one way or another. The prequel trilogy is all about how he became Darth Vader. See: Episode I poster.
The original trilogy was all about Luke’s struggle against Vader, his father.
And so far, the sequel trilogy has featured Kylo Ren trying to emulate Vader (his grandfather).
Even “Rogue One,” a non-Skywalker Saga film, included Vader in what was perhaps his best on screen moment.
So what else can we take away from “The Rise of Skywalker” teaser trailer? Here are a few key things that got me excited for J.J. Abrams take on the closing Skywalker film. That Rey Flip.
Rey flipping over what appears to be Kylo Ren’s TIE fighter in a battle in the desert is pretty awesome. During the panel at today’s Star Wars Celebration, host Stephen Colbert asked J.J. Abrams if Rey had any new force powers that would amaze us in this movie. He hesitated to answer, which likely means yes. Nothing will be as surprising as Luke’s projection to Crait in Episode VIII, but the Force is a big world of possibilities, and this cool flip over Kylo’s TIE fighter in the preview is a sign that this movie might feature some great stunts. Lando!
We’ve known for a while that Billy Dee Williams will be reprising his role as lovable scoundrel Lando Calrissian for this film, but actually seeing it on the big screen today was pretty exciting. When Lando, wearing a costume very reminiscent of Donald Glover’s take on the character, is shown sitting behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon beside Chewbacca, it brought a big smile to my face. Lando is back! The John Williams Score.
George Lucas once said that “the secret sauce” of Star Wars is John Williams’s brilliant music, and he’s absolutely right. This trailer’s soaring score immediately pulls you into the Star Wars universe, and is perfectly constructed to get you as excited as you were the very first time you first traveled to a galaxy far, far away. Luke the Force Ghost.
At the end of the much maligned “Last Jedi,” Luke Skywalker faded off into the Force, so there was a question about how much of him we would see in Episode IX. It seems from his narration, that we’ll get at least a little of Master Skywalker again, and perhaps more Yoda or even a little Obi Wan (notice he says “we’ve passed on all we know” not just “I’ve passed on all I know.”) The Death Star, Sort Of.
Toward the end of trailer, we see what appears to be the wreckage of the Death Star on the surface of a planet. Some of the original concept for “The Force Awakens” featured Rey and company visiting what remained of the Death Star on a planet in search of some clue. I think in order to use the leftover footage of Carrie Fisher here in Episode IX (since Lucasfilm and Abrams agreed they weren’t going to recreate the deceased Fisher digitally), we’re probably going to be embracing some discarded story elements from “The Force Awakens” including this trip to the Death Star remains. The real question it raises though, is which Death Star is this and on which planet are they? Start speculating now. Is it a post-apocalyptic Endor with all though cuddly Ewoks obliterated by space debris? Probably not. It’s more likely to be the surface of Yavin or one of its moons, from the original Star Wars film. Emperor Palpatine
Finally, the most interesting part of this entire trailer is what we here at the very end: Emperor Palpatine. That cracking laugh is unmistakeable, and just in case you were in doubt that it’s actually him, as soon as this trailer concluded its initial airing at Star Wars Celebration, Palpatine actor Ian McDermond himself appeared on stage and said (in his full Palpatine voice) “Roll it again!” The incorporation of Palpatine is most likely a response to J.J. having no big baddy to work with on this film since, ya know Rian Johnson killed off Snoke way too early in “Last Jedi.” The Emperor’s inclusion though is what could make this film very interesting and rewarding for long time Star Wars fans.
If you’re a serious Star Wars fan like me, you may have thought about one thing immediately after seeing this trailer: “Star Wars: Rebels.” Why would I think about a now concluded Star Wars cartoon series after seeing Disney’s latest blockbuster tease? Because of one critical episode of that show ( detailed here ).
In that pivotal episode near the end of the series, we saw that Star Wars has time travel (sort of) and it’s something the Emperor tried to harness to change the past, influence the future, and perhaps become immortal. His inclusion in the latest Star Wars movie may tell us that he in fact succeeded.
J.J. Abrams has a lot to live up to as he seeks to conclude one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. He’ll be only the second director to helm more than one Star Wars movie, the only other being George Lucas himself. There are some aspects of this movie we see in the trailer that seem pretty exciting, and there are some that don’t. One thing is certain though, now that the Wookiee is out of the bag, and the first details released: There will be no way to escape the Star Wars hype between now and its December debut.

More Evidence Twitter Skews The Media's Understanding Of Americans,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/13/evidence-twitter-skews-medias-understanding-americans-think/,"By Emily Jashinsky April 13, 2019
It’s a given that Twitter is a bubble . The size of that bubble is what’s worth reemphasizing, especially for the benefit of the media. According to a new Pew survey , only 22 percent of American adults say they ever use Twitter. That’s compared with 69 percent who say they use Facebook, and 37 percent who say they use Instagram.
It gets worse. Of that 22 percent, a full 58 percent say they use Twitter “less often” than once a day. Twenty-nine percent say “once a week,” 10 percent say “every few weeks,” and 18 percent say “less often.” Only 42 percent of the already small 22 percent are daily users. That number was 74 percent among Facebook users, 63 percent among Instagram users, and 61 percent among Snapchat users. (Similar to Twitter, only 24 percent of adults say they use Snapchat.) The Pew survey was conducted from Jan. 8-Feb. 7 among 1,502 adults.
Journalists love Twitter, and for some obvious reasons. But even if you’re conscious of the platform’s limited representative value, it’s difficult to avoid internalizing or perpetuating false narratives—both about actual news (see: Covington Catholic ) and the national mood (see: Joe Biden).
After the press spent days mulling the fate of Biden’s potential candidacy—on Twitter, airwaves, and in print—polling found Democratic voters were less concerned. According to a Politico-Morning Consult survey , “Half of Democrats polled said the allegations from women that Biden made them uncomfortable by invading their personal space will make no difference in their vote. Twenty-nine percent said the allegations would make them less likely to vote for Biden.”
“The responses from male and female Democrats were nearly identical,” Politico reported. “And very few voters see the allegations as truly disqualifying. Only 14 percent say the stories make them ‘much less likely’ to vote for Biden.”
The disconnect between Democrats on and off social media was probed by Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy in the New York Times this week:
The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online, according to data from the Hidden Tribes Project. This latter group has the numbers to decide the Democratic presidential nomination in favor of a relatively moderate establishment favorite, as it has often done in the past… The relative moderation of Democrats who are not sharing their political thoughts on social media, and therefore of Democrats as a whole, makes it less surprising that Virginia Democrats tolerated Mr. Northam’s yearbook page. It makes it easier to imagine how Joe Biden might not merely survive questions about whether he touched women in ways that made them feel uncomfortable, but might even emerge essentially unscathed.
It also helps explain why recent polls show that a majority of Democrats would rather see the party become more moderate than move leftward, even as progressives clamor for a Green New Deal or Medicare for all.
Journalists who spend a good deal of time on Twitter hear disproportionately from partisans, and it naturally infects their outlook on the 78 percent of people who don’t use the platform. As I argued here , the result is an overrepresentation of divisive stories lacking in news value.
If Twitter is buzzing about a video of high school kids interacting with Native American activists on the National Mall, journalists breathlessly confer it with news value and mine it for clicks. It’s easy to see how a video like the first Covington Catholic clip, which functioned as partisan clickbait, would generate debate on Twitter. But that some portion of 42 percent of 22 percent of adults who use Twitter daily are interested in a video does not indicate it’s worthy of national news coverage. Pausing to consider that question is an important step.
Of course, Twitter has other disadvantages , (and some advantages too). But the more we’re all aware of the platform’s shortcomings, and the more we act accordingly, the healthier our coverage will be. It’s one thing for someone without a media megaphone to make the mistake of allowing Twitter to distort his perception of the country; it’s another thing when your perception of the country shapes the media’s depiction of it.

Play Along: Make Your 'Game Of Thrones' Season Eight Predictions,thefederalist.com,The Federalist Staff,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/13/play-along-make-your-game-of-thrones-season-eight-predictions/,"April 13, 2019 By The Federalist Staff
After seven emotional, thrilling, and globally captivating seasons, we’ve finally reached the final chapter of “Game of Thrones.” Who will die? Who will survive? Are Cersei or Daenerys pregnant? Who, if anyone, will sit on the Iron Throne? Before Season 8 premieres this Sunday, make your predictions and share them with us.
To play along, download the form below, fill it out, and share your predictions with us on social media. Use the hashtag #GOTxFDRLST
Thanks to Reddit user Shadyholic for sharing this prediction sheet.
For clarity, a few words on choosing between “Lives,”“Dies,” and “Becomes a Wight”:
In the “Game of Thrones” universe the term “Wight” is a catch-all for anyone (human or beast) who has died and come back to life or experiences some version of reanimation. While wights are technically already dead, they can still die a subsequent, permanent death by many means.
Of the list of characters in this sheet, three characters are confirmed to already be wights: Jon Snow, The Night King, and Beric Dondarrian. Selecting “Dies” for any of these characters is to imply that you think they will die for real and not come back. Selecting “Becomes a wight” for these three would not make sense, as they became wights prior to season 8.
Selecting “Lives” for these characters would imply you believe they will continue their wight life OR that they die and get brought back to life yet again. There is no need to select “Dies” and “Becomes a Wight” for any character, as the latter implies the former. Only one selection should be made for each character.
In the words of Cersei, “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.” Here we go!"
Nobody In The GOP Is Inciting Violence Against Ilhan Omar,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/14/nobody-in-the-gop-is-inciting-violence-against-ilhan-omar/,"April 14, 2019 By David Marcus
Words have actual, distinct meanings. Somehow accepting this wisdom that is thousands of years old is something of a struggle in this, the 21st century. I’m not talking about the current confusion over what the words man and woman mean, or if “Western Civilization” describes an actual human phenomenon. Rather, I’m talking about the word “incitement,” and a dishonest campaign by Democrats to argue Republicans are guilty of it.
One thing common to the dictionary definitions of the word “incite” is intent. To incite is to encourage, it is to actively advocate for; it is not a speech or action that inadvertently or negligently causes violence. When Democrats claim, as many have this week, that Republicans are inciting violence towards Rep. Ilhan Omar in their reaction to her statements about 9/11, they are making a specific charge. That charge is “The GOP wants to encourage violence against Omar.”
I’ll be honest: I’m a bit nonplussed by Omar saying “Some people did something” in regard to 9/11. It’s not how I would put it, but I suspect I view the root causes of the attack differently than Omar does. Obviously Omar abhors the attack, but she likely sees its roots as having to do with colonialism in the Middle East. This, along with recently revealed comments in which she suggested a moral relevancy between al-Qaeda and the U.S. Army, suggest a certain type of worldview. And it’s not all that rare.
On college campuses all across America, there are professors who think the United States has been a harmful force — Central America, Vietnam, climate change, using a nuclear bomb, etc. They have their case. I think it’s foolish, but it’s not strange that Omar and other young Democrats in Congress don’t. It’s fairly standard leftist fare. It is also absolutely fair game for political attack.
The real danger in regard to Democrats accusing Republicans like Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Donald Trump, and outlets like the New York Post, of incitement to violence is that the charge is one of very few that can be used to erase First Amendment free speech protections. It’s no accident that this is the word being used. But it is an absurd accusation.
No Democrat will actually say that Crenshaw, Trump, or the New York Post editors desire harm to come to Omar, because obviously they don’t. And that takes incitement off the table. What they are saying, in classic progressive tones, is that Omar is a member of a vulnerable, marginalized minority, so attacks on her carry an extra threat of violence.
It is hard to know if this is true, but it might be. Omar has been the subject of death threats, including the arrest of one man. Perhaps Omar’s critics should take extra care in framing their attacks. But Omar is a public figure, a politician thrust into vast prominence and influence. She has to be fair game for direct criticism. And her identity cannot be allowed to transform a plain political attack into an incitement to violence.
Last year, many in the liberal press applauded the public abuse of Trump officials in restaurants. This was the people having their voice! Even Democratic members of Congress urged this kind of direct action. Can they really claim that public confrontation with politicians is less likely to lead to violence than criticism of a Muslim politician’s speech? If telling people to get in GOP officials’ faces isn’t incitement to violence — and it isn’t — then how can criticism of a congresswoman euphemizing the attacks of 9/11 possibly be?
My father has a piece of advice that he is perhaps overly fond of giving me. “Speak with particularity,” he says. It’s good advice. Frankly, my fear about Democrats’ misuse of “incite” is not that they do not know their error, but that they know it very well. My fear is that they intend to change what the word means, because there are no rules, and take away fundamental speech rights in the coming decades.
If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks Republicans are inciting violence by attacking Omar, can we doubt she would pursue hate speech laws that would police Americans’ speech in ways unimaginable two decades ago? The presidential candidates on the Democratic side are once again echoing her. It seems like they have gotten hooked on a progressive smack that is hard to beat. Well, hard for them to beat — maybe not for Trump.
Obviously Republicans can’t and won’t be cowed by these crazy claims that they are inciting violence. Let’s hope the Democrats come to understand how absurd it is as well.

Tiger Comes From Behind To Win Fifth Masters Title,thefederalist.com,Brad Jackson,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/14/tiger-comes-behind-win-fifth-masters-title/,"April 14, 2019 By Brad Jackson
Tiger Woods is a human highlight reel, a once in a generation athlete who changed his sport forever. It’s been a long time, though, since we’ve been able to say that Tiger Woods was a major champion.
Not since before the world was first enamored of Barack Obama has Tiger won at Augusta National Golf Club. It was way back in 2005, just after the first iPhone debuted, that Tiger last donned the famous green jacket among the striking azaleas at golf’s most storied course.
Sunday saw Tiger starting in the final group, but early in the morning, as the tournament moved all the tee times up several hours to escape surefire afternoon storms. He wasn’t leading, but was instead in a tie for second behind Francesco Molinari, who had been a consistent leader throughout the weekend.
Yet Molinari had never faced the pressure of leading on Sunday at The Masters. For Tiger, it’s old hat. Still, this wasn’t the Tiger of old, fist-pumping his way around the greens. The 43-year-old master playing amongst his Padawans, many of whom became professional golfers because they grew up watching him in the prime of his career, was more stoic and reserved than young Tiger ever was.
He has also become more relaxed, embracing his fellow golfers in a way he never did when he was winning nearly every tournament he played in the late ’90s and early 2000s. And it was a wonderful sight to behold.
Tiger and the Italian Molinari traded the lead throughout most of Sunday, but as the round drew to a close, it was Tiger who was sitting at the top of the leaderboard. Tiger kept himself from making many mistakes in his two under 70 and held off late charges from Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, and Xander Schauffele to win by one. People magazine.
For a man who thought just a few years ago that he might never play the game of golf again because of intense back pain, this is truly a comeback for the ages. Over the last decade he’s endured painful surgeries, front-page scandals, and stresses that only the country’s most popular athlete can face.
Many people who are much closer watchers of golf than I am thought Tiger might never come back to challenge Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major wins and six Green Jackets, but with Sunday’s win at Augusta, Tiger is just three away from Jack’s major mark, and only one Green Jacket shy of his Masters record.
Tiger has provided golf some of its greatest moments. After his 1997 win, he ran off the 18th green to embrace his ailing father, who, as Tiger said, “shouldn’t have even been there,” because he was recovering from a recent heart attack. This time, 22 years later, Tiger ran off the 18th green to embrace his son, Charlie, who wasn’t even alive the last time his father won a major tournament. As a parent myself, it was impossible not to get a little emotional watching the two hug like only a father and son can. From hugging his dad in 1997 to hugging his son in 2019.

Now we’ll see if Tiger can continue the momentum he’s built with fine play at recent tournaments, and his victory this week at The Masters. No one will dare count out the greatest golfer anymore. No doubt he has his eyes set on Jack’s final records, something he’s been eyeing since he was just a three-year-old golf phenom.

9 Reasons Tax Day Should Be A National Day Of Mourning,thefederalist.com,Laura Baxter,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/9-reasons-tax-day-should-be-a-national-day-of-mourning/,"By Laura Baxter April 15, 2019
I think April 15 should be declared a national day of mourning. Sure, government performs essential functions that private citizens can’t do alone. And sure, Jesus said, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.”
We live in a great country with a great heritage, and I don’t grudge resources that make it great. But that’s not what Tax Day is all about. 1. Withholding Blinds Us to the Real Cost of Taxes
April 15 is the deadline for Americans to “file” their taxes. Year after year, we provide a signed form summarizing income and approved expenses in order to calculate our tax bill. Yet the focus on filing—burdensome as it is—belies the fact that we are paying all year long.
For Americans who work as employees (as opposed to being self-employed), estimated taxes are withheld every paycheck. Apparently the feds don’t trust us to save up for yearly or even quarterly tax payments—perhaps with good reason. But more insidiously, withholding hides the true cost of taxes.
The money never hits our bank account! And who really reads his pay stubs? We don’t think of the money as ours, even though we earned it. Funny how the prospect of a refund makes us happy, as if the government is giving us a gift. In reality, we have been loaning the money to the government, interest-free. 2. The Tax System Is Far Too Complex
I took the recommended tax class in law school and I was astonished by the intricate detail in the tax code, including a vast array of carve-outs and exceptions. After law school, gluttons for punishment can even earn a special, advanced degree in tax. In my law practice, I have consulted with such attorneys on behalf of my clients. Amazingly, even the uber-educated can rarely provide a black-and-white answer. The tax system is mired in pages and pages of fine-print gray.
Because of my religious upbringing, I lean toward scrupulosity. Even though I am an attorney, I have an experienced accountant prepare my taxes. Yet I tremble to think that I may have inadvertently violated some arcane tax provision or that my accountant’s interpretation of an ambiguous law may differ from the interpretation of an IRS agent or that my documentation may be deemed insufficient if I’m audited years later. Not only does the complexity of the tax code generate an enormous paperwork burden, it puts all of us at risk of breaking the law. 3. The Tax System Favors Special Interests
We can easily imagine an income tax using one or more straight percentage rates, without deductions. Sen. Ted Cruz once suggested a system so simple, Americans could file taxes on a postcard. Why hasn’t that happened yet? Where did these complex carve-outs and exceptions come from?
Since the creation of the income tax, corporations and special interests have lobbied Congress for loopholes. Their millions invested in lobbying become billions in tax breaks. Our tax code has winners and losers, and the winners fight tooth and nail to keep their subsidies.
We rightly criticize tax concessions for multinational corporations. At the same time, those of us who are homeowners love our mortgage interest deductions—as do mortgage lenders, home builders, real estate agents, and home improvement stores. But if we are being honest, why should home owners get a tax advantage over renters? The tax code should focus on fair collection of revenue, not social engineering or, worse, buying votes. 4. The Tax System Is Easily Weaponized
Because of the tax code’s ever-expanding complexity and paperwork requirements, the IRS can pick almost anyone and find an irregularity (see point 2). You can’t audit everyone, so how do you choose? The temptation for tax authorities to play favorites—and target enemies—must be extremely strong. In 2013, the IRS admitted targeting conservative groups for heightened scrutiny and delayed approval of tax-exempt status. We can only imagine what goes on under the radar.
When Special Counsel Robert Mueller decided to investigate Paul Manafort, President Trump’s campaign advisor, he was ostensibly looking for evidence of collusion with Russia. Yet Manafort was indicted, not for collusion, but for tax fraud. We many never know how many other wealthy political consultants are gaming the tax system. But it’s a good bet that, without his Trump association, Manafort’s tax irregularities would have gone unnoticed. 5. Too Many Americans Are Free Riders
We have all heard the Democrat rallying cry: “The rich must pay their fair share !” I agree. It is unconscionable that wealthy individuals and corporations can finagle lower tax rates than middle-class Americans.
But at the same time, approximately 44 percent of Americans pay zero federal income taxes. In fact, the bottom 20 percent have negative tax rates, meaning they actually make money from refundable tax credits. This means many Americans have no “skin” in the income-tax game. Why should poor Americans care how our taxes are used, as long as none of their benefits are cut?
Instead, all Americans should be expected to contribute some modest amount to the funding of our government. Let’s share the pain together. 6. 42 Cents of Every Tax Dollar Go to a Pyramid Scheme
The tax system is not only broken on the revenue side. Let’s talk about how taxes are actually spent. Almost 20 percent of taxes—more than $667 billion in 2018—are redistributed in the form of direct Social Security checks to seniors, including wealthy seniors. Medical care for seniors—again, regardless of income level—swallows a similar amount of the federal pie. This means younger, poorer Americans are supporting older, wealthier Americans.
Reforming Social Security or Medicare is politically untouchable. No one wants to be accused of taking money away from grandma. In addition, grandma believes she earned those benefits by paying into the system. Unfortunately, Uncle Sam has not managed the Social Security trust fund wisely, and grandma voted for those spendthrift politicians. Instead, the trust fund loans out money for general federal spending. Social Security and Medicare trustees expect the trust funds (consisting largely of IOUs) to be depleted by 2034 .
Social Security and Medicare are nothing more than a pyramid scheme, with a dwindling number of workers supporting a growing number of seniors. Yet together they account for approximately 42 cents of each tax dollar. What could be more depressing than that? 7. Taxes Support an Unaccountable Bureaucracy
Tax Day is a legacy of the Progressive Era. The original progressives (like progressives today) had a dim view of constitutional constraints on government. Centralized, consolidated government was considered the best way to get stuff done. To fund their proposed expansion of government, the 16th Amendment gave the feds new power to tax individual incomes.
Modern progressives have continued the growth of the administrative state. Congress delegates its lawmaking power to largely unaccountable bureaucratic agencies, which then use their power to issue tens of thousands of regulations (which they then enforce, obliterating separation of powers). All of these agencies are funded by income taxes.
Even if we strenuously disagree with the policies of an administrative agency, even if we ourselves have been embroiled in conflict with that agency, we are still forced to fund it through income taxes. That’s something worth mourning. 8. Taxes Undermine the Reserved Rights of the States
Federal power was originally limited to areas appropriate for national government: defense, international relations, trade between states, and similar responsibilities. The Founders believed Americans’ day-to-day concerns should remain at the state level. This is spelled out clearly in Article I(8) of the Constitution, as well as the 9th and 10th Amendments in the Bill of Rights. According to Federalist 46, if the national government ever tried to exceed constitutional limits, the states would undoubtedly sound a general alarm!
All that changed with the 16th Amendment. The Progressives gained a new source of revenue, directly from the people, without going through the states. This allowed the national government to bribe the states into compliance. On average, state governments receive about a third of their budgets from federal grants. Today, state and local governments hire lobbyists and approach the federal government, hat in hand. This is not a position of strength for keeping federal power within constitutional limits. 9. The Majority of Taxes Encourage Dependency
The lion’s share of the federal budget (over $2.5 trillion in FY 2018) is spent on “mandatory” payments. These flow from agreements with the American people (including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) to provide benefits at a certain level. Approximately 15 percent of the annual budget goes to defense spending. While reasonable minds can argue over the details, defense as a budget category is a non-negotiable federal responsibility. The remaining 16 percent or so is spent on the alphabet soup of government bureaucracy (see point seven).
James Madison considered it an insult to “the free and gallant citizens of America” to suppose that we would ever reduce ourselves to “a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures” leading to the loss of our freedoms. Yet that is exactly what has happened. We blindly and tamely allow the federal government to create programs for our every desire.
We like all the payments, programs, and subsidies. Oh, we may resent money spent on other groups, but we just can’t give up the crumbs that are designated for us. As long as this situation remains, Americans will not be self-governing, but dependents on their government, just like the citizens of every other welfare state.
And that is why I find April 15 depressing every year. Laura practices employment law and teaches political science at her local university. The opinions stated in this article are her own. You can read more of her work at stirfrylaura.wordpress.com. "
Top 15 ‘Game Of Thrones’ Theories For The Final Season,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/top-15-game-thrones-theories-final-season/,"April 15, 2019
Some spoilers ahead from season eight, episode one.
After two exceedingly long years since the finale of season seven, the first episode of the six-part final season of “Game of Thrones” aired last night. Many of The Federalist’s writers, as well as millions of people around the globe, have had plenty of time to develop theories about what will happen as the beloved fantasy drama draws to a close.
Now that the last season is officially underway, here are some of the favorite theories floated by several Federalist writers. After just one episode with minimal foreshadowing, there are still many more questions than answers, but all of these theories, however unlikely, are still technically possible. Daenerys becomes pregnant with Jon Snow’s baby, but shortly after giving birth succumbs to the Targaryen crazy gene, and Jon Snow is forced to kill her. Jon is subsequently killed by one of the dragons. The baby will inherit the throne. After a decisive defeat of the Army of the Dead, the remaining allied armies of Daenerys and Winterfell go to King’s Landing to defeat Cersei Lannister. She will be nearly rescued but ultimately killed by her brother, Jaime, in one of the final scenes of the season after he finally accepts that she is truly evil. This will also satisfy Jamie’s nearly dead sense of honor. He will feel responsible for the sad state the kingdom is in and recognize his hand in allowing it to happen, as well as causing much of the decay when he threw Bran Stark out of a tower. Jon, Daenerys, Cersei, and Jamie are all killed. Sansa Stark, the current lady of Winterfell, is killed by some deus ex machina. Her sister Arya ends up as the temporary ruler of the Seven Kingdoms with Tyrion Lannister as her right hand, waiting for Daenerys and Jon’s baby to grow up and rightfully sit on the Iron Throne. Tyrion is a secret, illegitimate Targaryen who was fathered by the Mad King, Aerys Targaryen. This explains why he has almost nothing in common with his scheming family. Tyrion is also drawn to dragons and is never afraid to touch them. The dragons seem to like him too. The Iron Throne is torn down to make swords to kill the Army of the Dead. The series ends with no Iron Throne and all those who could claim it are dead. (Jamie has to kill Cersei because she refuses to relent). Jon Snow discovers his heritage but definitely doesn’t stop sleeping with Daenerys. Daenerys and Jon Snow will secure a complicated alliance that will see stability over the realm, but at least one of them will die. The most likely case is that neither will survive the season. Their relationship could produce a child, who would be seen as the last, legitimate claimant to the Iron Throne. Tyrion Lannister will serve as regent, and the show ends with all seven kingdoms well on their way to modern sociopolitical norms. The dragons will all die, because fantastical magical creatures will not have a place in the new world that will exist after the apocalypse that is about to occur. The Iron Bank will have to default on all its outstanding loans to various pretenders to the Iron Throne. This will cause a collapse in the Bravos economy that will see a new age of piracy and looting across Essos. Hopefully someone invents gunpowder soon—they’re going to need it. Bran is either going to die or sublimate into the world of the Three-Eyed Raven, unable to return to his human life. Before that happens, he’ll be instrumental in some way to defeating the Night King and by extension the White Walkers. Maybe he’ll transpose his dreamscape to when the Night King was made and inhabit him to sort of make him uniquely vulnerable while someone who’s close to Bran has to kill him after he has changed places with the Night King. This person could possibly be Jamie Lannister, who almost poetically redeems himself for injuring Bran in season one by killing him in the final season. Brienne of Tarth will get to lead the new King/Queen’s Guard. This would be most fitting if Sansa were to become regent, or even the rightful queen. Sansa would be a satisfying queen, as she has come on the longest journey from “dumb and useless” to “strong and competent.” Sansa finishing her growth quest by becoming the most competent and beloved ruler of Westeros in 300 years would be really neat. Now that Theon Greyjoy has rescued his sister, Yara, the immediate plan is to return her to the Iron Islands as the rightful ruler on the Salt Throne. Theon wants to fight with Daenerys and Jon Snow, but before either are able to achieve their goals they will be forced to defeat their awful uncle, Euron. This will likely be in some Viking-style pirate battle, where Theon likely sacrifices himself to save his sister, redeeming him for his previous cowardice. Syrio Forel, the “Dance Master” from the first season, is actually the same person as Jaqen H’Ghar, a leader of The Faceless Men and dedicated servant of the Many-Faced God. Syrio’s death was implied in season one but not shown. Meanwhile, despite his impact on Arya’s journey, Jaqen’s story was never officially tied up. Both men gave Arya very similar-sounding advice, seemingly supporting her in a form she needed most at the time she knew them. Davos either kills Melisandre or arrives with the intention of killing her as she is being killed by something else, like the manifestation of her hubris. Davos is a favored character, so his death would be disappointing, but would be an easy dramatic moment during the absolute chaos that will consume these final five episodes. Varys’s death is likely to come just before this as a final manifestation of Melisandre’s dark predictions in service of the supremely shady Lord of Light. Tyrion will live or die in the last few scenes. What would be worth betting on is whether he gets a big brain redemption. For supposedly being one of the most clever and strategic minds in the story, he got outplayed three separate times by his sister last season, more if you count his falling for her peace offering. Sansa confronts his stupidity right off the bat in the season eight premiere. He has to prove to everyone that his clever mind still works and cook up a good plan, but his challenge will be getting Daenerys to accept it after he has been so keen to forgive his siblings’ terror and blind to their true intentions. When all the bad people are finally dead, Arya and Gendry will go on a quest to the sea and explore worlds unknown. She’s done with Westeros and all its nonsense, and once her family is safe and their future is secured, it’s time for adventure. She and Gendry will fall in love. The Brotherhood Without Banners is completely wiped out with the exception of the Hound, who defeats his brother, The Mountain, shortly before Jamie kills Cersei. After everyone he knows is dead, The Hound considers suicide but is invited by Arya and Gendry to accompany them on their adventures, which he accepts. He feigns reluctance but is actually delighted to join his friends. Sam Tarly and Gilly live happily ever after with Little Sam. Sam comes to terms with his intelligence and ability to lead and discovers the way to permanently defeat the White Walkers. He’ll end up starting a college, not a maestery, a proper academic institution where people seek out new knowledge, not just read about forgotten lore. His contributions will help usher in a new era of science, medicine, and knowledge, possibly leading this world out of the Dark Ages.

9 Apocalyptic Lies Fed To Americans About The Republican Tax Bill,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/9-apocalyptic-lies-fed-to-americans-about-the-republican-tax-bill/,"9 Apocalyptic Lies Fed To Americans About The Republican Tax Bill admin 13 hours ago 3 minutes read
Monday is the first Tax Day under the new Republican tax bill passed in December 2017, and the results are not what Democrats and their media apparatus predicted. Many Americans are discovering that they are not only alive and well, but indeed paying less taxes.
As Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley pointed out in The New York Times , there is a disparity between what Americans thought they would be paying the IRS this year, and what they actually paid. This myth, “appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.”
What falsities did these liberal opponents tell the American people would happen pending the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? Here are a few of the most outrageous examples of fear-mongering. 1. 10,000 People Will Be Killed Every Year
Economist and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that “the conclusion would follow that the tax bill would result in 10,000 extra deaths per year.” On CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” he explained why he thought the bill was “very dangerous.”
“When people lose health insurance, they’re less likely to get preventive care, they’re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they’re more likely to die,” he said. 2. The Tax Bill Is ‘Akin To Rape’
Bruce Bartlett, a writer and former Treasury official, said the bill would not create a single job, that Republicans want the poor to pay more taxes to force them to work more, and that the bill is “really akin to rape.” 3. ‘Armageddon’ and the Worst Legislation Ever Considered By Congress
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who was minority leader at the time the bill was passed, said the tax reform bill was “the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.”
When a reporter asked her later about her hyperbolic descriptions, she replied , “No, it is the end of the world. The debate over health care is life and death. This is Armageddon.” 4. Grad Students Will Have to Quit Doctorate Programs
When graduate students were told their tuition waivers for working as teaching assistants and researchers would become taxable, they calculated that their taxes would increase by 61 percent.
As she started to do the math, tears welled up.
‘I would have to drop out,’ she said. ‘If this tax bill passes, I can’t support anyone, I can’t even support myself.’ 5. America Is Dead
At least, according to Kurt Eichenwald. America died tonight. Economic suicide adopted to feed the insatiable greed of donors, who have been refusing to dole out $ to GOP until they got their tax cuts. Voters fooled by propaganda and tribal hatred.
Millenials: move away if you can. USA is over. We killed it.
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 2, 2017 6. Republicans Want to Kick the Poor, Middle Class In the Face
Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell described the ways Republicans are using higher taxes to “plan to punish the poor and middle class.”
I used to think the Republican Party’s obsession with top-heavy tax cuts was about pleasing wealthy donors and maybe also fulfilling some misguided Randian fantasy. If the poor and middle class happened to be collateral damage, so be it.
But it’s starting to look like shafting the little guy has become a feature, not a bug, of the GOP’s budget-busting tax plan.
The left-leaning Tax Policy Center reported that 91 percent of middle-class taxpayers are getting a tax cut this year. 7. Most People Are Getting Bigger Paychecks. Here’s Why That’s Bad
Rick Newman at Yahoo Finance wrote about a looming “tax surprise” in 2018, without ever explaining why giving the government a smaller interest-free loan with every paycheck might be better than a fat refund.
The TCJA lowered the overall tax burden for about two-thirds of workers, leaving a majority with slightly larger paychecks. But a quirk could leave some taxpayers with an unhappy surprise as they file their 2018 returns this year, and find that the refund they were expecting is smaller than before. Some people accustomed to a refund could even end up owing money, instead. 8. New Yorkers Allege All Americans Will Suffer
The day before the tax bill was signed in December 2017, protesters staged a “die-in” on Wall Street, near the New York Stock Exchange. One protester laying on the ground held a sign in the shape of a gravestone that read, “RIP/tax scam helped the rich/not me.”
“If we don’t stop this, we, the young people, are not going to have a future,” the protester, Nova Felder, told City and State New York.
A number of New York community leaders participated in the protests, too. “All of us will suffer as a result of those who care more about corporations than they do about the people,” said New York City Public Advocate Letitia James. 9. An Endless, Global Recession
“We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,” wrote New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. “I suppose we could get lucky somehow. But on economics, as on everything else, a terrible thing has just happened.” "
Christian Adoption Agency Sues Michigan And HHS For Religious Discrimination,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/christian-adoption-agency-sues-michigan-and-hhs-for-religious-discrimination/,"April 15, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
Michigan foster families and St. Vincent Catholic Charities are suing the state of Michigan and Health and Human Services to allow the non-profit to continue its work placing the state’s foster children in forever homes. In March, the American Civil Liberties Union and Michigan attorney general signed a settlement for a 2017 lawsuit, barring Michigan from working with faith-based adoption agencies because of their religious beliefs about marriage.
Now, with the help of Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, St. Vincent is filing their own lawsuit in federal court. According to HHS, every year about 50,000 children in the United States are adopted through state child welfare systems, but about 20,000 additional children “age out” before being placed in a home.
Michigan, like many states, partners with private adoption and foster agencies to unite these children with loving families. In 2017, St. Vincent recruited more new adoptive families than nearly 90 percent of the other agencies in its area. State spokesperson Bob Wheaton told AP that, as of February, St. Vincent and Bethany Christian Services had completed 12 percent of the entire state’s foster care and adoption cases.
Michigan now holds that St. Vincent will be penalized if they decline to make written certifications about marriage that conflict with their religious beliefs, even though gay couples working with other agencies have been able to adopt children in St. Vincent’s care in the past. Halting the social work of St. Vincent will leave thousands of children in foster care limbo, and lead to a shortage of homes available for them.
“Faith-based agencies like St. Vincent consistently do the best work because of their faith, and we need more agencies like them helping children—not fewer,” said Becket President Mark Rienzi in a statement. “The actions by the Attorney General of Michigan do nothing but harm the thousands of at-risk children in desperate need of loving homes.”
The lawsuit suit is against both Michigan and HHS because the the Obama administration put a policy into place in its closing days, ruling that any groups publicly licensed and receiving money from HHS cannot discriminate on the basis of religion. This rule contradicts a Michigan law that protects taxpayer-funded, faith-based organizations from policies that discriminate against religious beliefs.
In January, the Trump administration’s HHS issued a waiver allowing faith-based foster care agencies in South Carolina to restrict placements to families that share their Christian beliefs. Melissa and Chad Buck, two of the foster parents suing alongside St. Vincent, adopted five children with special needs through St. Vincent Catholic Charities.
“My five children have a home and a future today thanks to St. Vincent, and my husband and I still rely on St. Vincent’s vital support in every step of our journey together as a family. We are hopeful that the courts will step in, do the right thing and allow faith-based agencies to continue to help vulnerable families like mine,” she said.
This is not the first time Michigan’s attorney general Dana Nessel has fought with Catholic adoption agencies. When this issue with state-funded, faith-based adoption agencies in Michigan was raised in 2015, Nessel was the attorney representing a lesbian couple with adopted children of their own. After Michigan lawmakers passed protections for religious adoption agencies, Nessel called the catholic charities “hate mongers” and declared their services “a disaster for the children and the state.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

The Silence Of The Bells: Notre Dame Cathedral In Ashes,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/silence-bells-notre-dame-ashes/,"By Ellie Bufkin April 16, 2019
Yesterday, the world watched in horror as raging fire consumed much of the 850-year-old Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral. In a stroke of mercy late on Monday evening in Paris, the fire officials declared that the main façade of the cathedral, containing the famed bell towers, would be spared.
Shortly thereafter it was revealed that even the central vault was largely still intact. The iconic spire, however, was completely destroyed, falling along with the majority of the roof into a pile of ashes.
Holy Week began yesterday, and many French and visiting Catholics watched as one of the most recognizable institutions of their faith was in danger of being annihilated after nearly 1,000 years on Earth. My colleague David Marcus wrote yesterday about Christ’s gift of mercy and grace, and the power of faith in God in the wake of this destruction.
In its 850 years, the cathedral has also become a symbol for much more. In its lifetime, it has seen the highest points and the darkest hours of France. It has become the visual symbol of the ability of Paris—and all of France—to survive revolution, cruel monarchs, wars, and country-wide occupation by Nazis. The 12 million annual visitors to Notre Dame serve as proof that it is much more than just a Medieval Gothic church. It is Paris.
It is perhaps the modern history of Notre-Dame that most clearly marks it as a symbol of Parisian strength and resolve. As it entered its 754th year in 1914, the Great War came to France and the famed bells of Notre Dame were silenced except for use as a citizen warning system.
The bells had been woven into the soundtrack of life in the City of Lights, and their silence did little to placate the anxiety during the war. On November 11, 1918, the bells rang out once more as the armistice was signed. People ran to the streets in jubilation. The cathedral had signaled the restoration of peace and prosperity in France.
Only a few decades later in 1940, as the dark cloud of Nazi Occupation settled in Paris, the bells of Notre Dame went silent once more. The symbol of life, of culture, of religious freedom, and of Paris itself was to be unheard for several years.
The French took early steps to protect the cathedral from Nazi looting, hiding large stained-glass pieces and many works of art. The occupation saw the life of French people deteriorate in an instant as families were torn apart, Jews were arrested and put on trains destined for concentration camps, and freedom was taken from every man, woman, and child.
The absence of the cathedral bells’ familiar chiming was coupled with more than four years of starvation, fear, and unrelenting Nazi rule. Following the 1944 arrival of the Allied army to France in the invasion of Normandy, Adolf Hitler placed Gen. Dietrich von Choltitz in charge of Paris with the order to destroy the city if the advancing Allies threatened to enter it.
Choltitz agreed to have the city wired for destruction by placing explosives in the most significant landmarks, including the Arc de Triumph, the Eiffel Tower, and the Notre Dame Cathedral. However, Choltitz knew the war was coming to an end and that he would not be on the winning side. He hoped the war would end somewhat peacefully, and he knew that the destruction of Paris, a city he loved, would mean his war would end in blood.
As the first of the Free French forces entered Paris under the command of Capt. Raymond Dronne, Parisians spread word quickly that liberation of their city was imminent. Messages were broadcast asking priests to once again ring the bells of their churches to signal to the Resistance and to the citizens that the Allies had arrived. Paris would be free. The bells of Notre Dame were the first to break the silence of persecution. They rang out in the sweetest song ever heard, joined by other bells from all over the city.
Choltitz called his superior, Gen. Speidel, and simply held the receiver of the phone to the window. The overwhelming sound of the bells did not require an explanation. Paris was no longer under Nazi control. Paris was free. Choltitz never gave the order to destroy the city.
The bells became an important symbol of the alliance between France and the United States once more, nearly 60 years later. On September 12, 2001, following the loss of almost 3,000 people in an unspeakable act of evil in the United States, the city of Paris closed the Metro so their citizens could pray. At Notre Dame, where many Parisians gathered, the bells began to toll in mourning.
The largest bell, Emmanuel, which had played the celebratory tones at the ends of both World Wars, was nearing 600 years of age and generally reserved for only a few annual holidays, state funerals, and visits from the pope. On September 12, however, for an entire hour Emmanuel and every other cathedral bell sang out in sorrow for the profound loss of life in America.
The cathedral of Notre Dame has been in Paris for most of a millennium. In just the last 105 years, it has become the symbol of life for the remarkable city. When times were grim, the cathedral’s survival served as a reminder that darkness is always followed by light. As the towers containing the iconic bells miraculously survived the fire, Parisians will soon hear them toll once more, and be reminded that the people of France have risen from the ashes many times, and now the cathedral will do the same.

Bernie Sanders Still Can't Explain How He's Paying For 'Medicare For All',thefederalist.com,Mark Hemingway,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/at-fox-town-hall-bernie-sanders-still-cant-explain-how-hes-paying-for-medicare-for-all/,"By Mark Hemingway April 16, 2019
Appearing at a Fox News town hall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on Monday, Vermont senator and socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders turned in a fiery and combative performance. One moment particularly seems to be generating a lot of excitement.
After an audience member asked about his “Medicare for all” health plan, which would require eliminating private health insurance, Fox host Bret Baier decided to poll the audience to ask if they would prefer Bernie’s plan to their existing health insurance. Here’s what happened: Bret Baier just polled the Bernie Town Hall audience who would be willing to switch to #MedicareForAll . It backfired spectacularly. pic.twitter.com/dQJ9gfQ137

This is a bit unfair to Baier, since it assumes he asked the question in bad faith, rather than knowingly asking the politically diverse crowd Fox assembled for the event their opinion on the matter. Further, it doesn’t really tell us much that a room half full of Democratic voters and Bernie supporters prefer some imaginary, aspirational future where the government pays for health care and there are minimal problems, as opposed to the warts-and-all reality of what we have now. (Certainly, it’s appealing enough that four other Democratic presidential candidates have chosen to co-sponsor his recently introduced “Medicare for all” legislation in the Senate .)
That’s especially true since Sanders hasn’t done a good job of explaining “Medicare for all,” to put it mildly. Asked about the specifics of his plan, Sanders employed the tried and true three-step explanation for how it works.
Step one, point out that the United States is the only “very highly developed” country without socialized health care and note that U.S. per capita health spending is much higher than that in these other countries. Make sure you do this without noting the problems inherent in the way these other countries ration lifesaving treatments (and even prevent you from leaving the country to seek potentially lifesaving treatment, presumably just to make some stupid nationalistic point about how great it is that everyone is trapped in the same system together). Also, under no circumstances note that these other countries often have vastly inferior medical technology and infrastructure– the average wait time for an MRI in Canada can be longer than five months , which is unthinkable here.
Step two, elide over all the details of how to implement a socialized system that addresses the size and diversity of American health care, which is radically different than the challenges faced by much smaller and more homogeneous European countries with supposedly superior care. Most importantly, also elide over the fact that the socialized health care system we have that’s supposedly so appealing, Medicare, is a money black hole with trillions in unfunded liabilities that is the single largest driver of our enormous debt that threatens to precipitate a republic-destroying financial crisis.
Step three, after having said nothing particularly illuminating or specific, bask in the glory of being a radical reformer that dares to imagine a future where greedy insurance companies are put out of business by a selfless and incorruptible federal government.
That was roughly the template Sanders followed during his Fox town hall, and from the video above you can see he scored debate points on health care. (Or at least, Vox , HuffPo and much of the left-of-center Twitterati seem to think so.)
But if you were listening, Sanders made some telling admissions. “You’re gonna pay more in taxes but your health care will be cheaper,” he said. For a long time now, Sanders has owed us an actually detailed explanation for how our health care is going to get cheaper under “Medicare for all,” and it hasn’t been forthcoming.
The Associated Press summed up a study done by the Mercatus Center last year this way, “Sen. Bernie Sanders’s ‘Medicare for all’ plan would boost government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, requiring historic tax hikes.” Of course, Bernie Bros would protest that the Mercatus Center is a libertarian think tank not predisposed to give Sanders’s plan a fair shake. But what about The New York Times?
When Sanders was running for president in 2016, New York Times domestic correspondent Margot Sanger-Katz kicked the tires on Sanders’s “Medicare for All” plan he proposed then and concluded, “ Bernie Sanders’s Health Plan Is More of a Tax Plan “:
[T]he plan … was full of details about the taxes that would be collected to finance it. The plan would charge a special income tax, called a premium, increase payroll taxes and raise a variety of taxes on high-income Americans, including income and capital gains taxes. Those are big, specific changes, worthy of detailed coverage. Missing, however, were more than a few sentences about how the proposal would change the health care system in the United States.
Further, “Medicare for all” doesn’t have much to do with Medicare as we know it:
But the program he describes isn’t an extension of the existing Medicare program, which provides health insurance for older people and the disabled. Medicare includes premiums, co-payments and deductibles, and excludes coverage for long-term care or dentistry. A lot of important details have been left out. Here are some things it doesn’t say: What would the new system pay doctors and hospitals for their services? How would it decide which medical treatments it should and shouldn’t cover? What strategies would it use to contain health care costs and keep the system affordable? Who would make the decisions, big and small, about how the program would work?
Finally, Sanders’s own campaign economist couldn’t explain to Sanger-Katz how his plan was supposed to work:
I spoke with Gerald Friedman, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who provided the campaign with estimates of the program’s cost. … Mr. Friedman calculates, for example, that the cost of physician services in a single-payer system could be lowered by 10.7 percent — his estimate of how much doctors currently spend on billing and administration staff that they would no longer need. I asked him how the payer would get to that number — would the government pay lower prices for treatments, or change which treatments it paid for, or switch doctors to a system in which they earn government salaries? He couldn’t say with certainty. ‘The pleasure of being an academic is I can just spell things out and leave the details to others,’ he said. ‘The details very quickly get very messy.’
Well, that’s quite an admission. But in the three years since Sanger-Katz tried to understand how Sanders’s plan worked, it seems everyone in Sanders’s orbit, himself included, has been leaving the details to others. After being embarrassed in the pages of The New York Times in 2016, apparently they learned nothing.
Astonishingly, when the AP reported on the Mercatus study last year, Sanders wasn’t even able to begin to refute the report’s conclusion that his plan was financially unsustainable. Why? “Sanders’ office has not done a cost analysis, a spokesman said.”
His recently proposed “Medicare for all” legislation doesn’t much improve on prior attempts to flesh out how health care will be administered in a cost-effective manner, even as it’s full of tax hike proposals such as 70 percent marginal tax rates on income over $10 million, 77 percent estate taxes on the rich, and taxes on big banks. Even the liberal outlet Vox once again admits the “plan has lots of details about what single-payer would cover. It has less information on how to pay for it.” Sanders can try to soak the rich all he wants, but it doesn’t mean much when credible estimates suggest “doubling all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.”
In the end, Sanders doesn’t have a health care plan, so much as a branding strategy for one. Medicare, despite its fiscal unsustainability, is very popular. So calling government-run health care “Medicare for all” is a stroke of genius, insofar as it makes the American public more receptive to socialist ideas. That’s why other Democratic candidates are happy to associate themselves with “Medicare for all” as a slogan, but appear to be distancing themselves from the actual policy.
Kamala Harris may be co-sponsoring Sanders’s legislation, but ultimately she “backs many incremental, go-slow plans that aren’t as radical and add up to something more like ‘Medicare for more’ or a strengthened version of Obamacare,” notes Politico . Similarly, another candidate and Senate co-sponsor, Elizabeth Warren, has taken a similarly less radical approach, saying she’s “ open to different paths ” to getting “Medicare for all.” In reality, her plan is more like the “ACA 2.0.”
In a lot of polls, Sanders is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. He cannot be allowed to offer a radical plan he freely admits will cause 180 million Americans to lose their existing health care coverage and not bother explaining how it works.
Yet he’s gotten away with it for three years. The press, as well as his competitors in the Democratic primary, need to grow a spine and demand some real answers here.

Mother Of Trans Child Critiques Bans On 'Conversion Therapy',thefederalist.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/feminist-pro-gay-mother-trans-child-critiques-bans-conversion-therapy/,"By Anonymous April 16, 2019
Something odd is happening in gender clinics. In 2017, the number of males receiving transgender surgery in the United States increased by 41 percent over the year before, while the number of females seeking such surgery increased by 289 percent.
At the Tavistock Clinic, Britain’s sole pediatric gender clinic, the number of boys referred over the past decade has increased by 1,150 percent , the number of girls by 4,400 percent. Why is the number of females seeking transgender treatments rising much more quickly than the number of males?
You can get some clues by looking at blogs and videos posted by detransitioned and desisted women. Detransitioners and desisters are people who thought they were transgender for a time and changed their minds. In their posts, some common themes regarding these women’s reasons for transitioning emerge, reasons that have nothing to do with being transgender. Some young women say they transitioned because of same-sex attraction. They had internalized so much homophobia, they became boys rather than accept themselves as lesbians. In Britain, five clinicians have resigned from the Tavistock clinic on principle in the last three years. One of their major concerns is the large numbers of gay children being transitioned because of homophobia. The children were facing either bullying at school or parents who did not accept them. One clinician said , “A lot of the girls would come in and say, ‘I’m not a lesbian. I fell in love with my best girl friend but then I went online and realized I’m not a lesbian, I’m a boy. Phew.’” Staff at the clinic joked ruefully that due to transition “there would be no gay people left.” Other women say they transitioned as a reaction to trauma, often the trauma of a sexual assault. One detransitioned woman said (minute 1:55) a sexual assault “absolutely contributed to just this feeling that I wanted to take my body off.” Women using transition as camouflage is not progressive. Progress occurs when women no longer feel a need to hide. One of the reasons my daughter gave for wanting to transition was because people listen to boys, and she wanted to be heard. Notice she did not say she had a deep internal sense that she was a boy. She wanted the kind of respect she believes only boys attain. Girls shouldn’t have to medically transition to get respect. The culture needs to change, not the girls. Some women felt they didn’t fit in with other girls and had no examples of gender-nonconforming women. One young woman said (3:47-4:38) “I was never … raised to believe that there was more than one way to be a girl…. I thought femininity and womanhood was like, being thin, being white, wearing skirts and wearing dresses and you know, playing dress up, playing with dolls … and liking boys…. And that was never my experience.… I thought, well then I must be a boy.” Due to internalized misogyny, women have often been convinced they need to modify their bodies. “Teen girls are taught to hate everything about themselves. None of us can win. Even the thinnest, most clear-skinned, prettiest of girls find an enemy in the mirror,” a desisted woman said . In response to culture telling them their bodies are not good enough, women from many generations and places have bound their feet; mutilated their genitals; wore corsets, girdles, and high heels; endured cosmetic surgeries; and starved themselves. What feminists see in gender-dysphoric girls binding their breasts, taking testosterone, and seeking mastectomies, hysterectomies, metoidioplasties, and phalloplasties is a new and more virulent form of internalized misogyny.
When my daughter came out as transgender, I wanted to find a therapist who could help her sort out what her gender dysphoria meant. Was she transgender, or was she ashamed of same-sex attraction, reacting to trauma, wanting respect, uncomfortable with feminine stereotypes, or had she internalized hate for women’s bodies?
I quickly discovered that it is nearly impossible to find therapists who do this kind of work. If a girl presents as transgender today, the vast majority of therapists will immediately affirm the girl’s declared gender identity and ask her what steps she would like to take toward transition.
I interviewed at least a dozen therapists in search of one who could help my daughter examine her feelings and motivations. I finally resorted to paying out-of-pocket for my daughter to talk online to a therapist who lives in another state. I know I am not alone. I belong to an online support group of nearly 1,500 parents of gender dysphoric youth. Finding therapists who provide standard mental health therapy rather than automatic affirmation is a frustration for most of us.
Twenty states are considering well-intentioned anti-conversion therapy bills in 2019, including my own state of Minnesota. The term conversion therapy used to apply only to attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation. Now the term is applied to attempts to change either a person’s sexual orientation or a person’s gender identity.
The goal of anti-conversion therapy bills is to ban mental health therapists from using conversion therapy with minors. I am afraid these bills will have a chilling effect on therapists’ ability to help girls who say they are transgender. Let me be very clear: I am discussing only the impact of anti-conversion therapy bills on youth who are identifying as transgender only. My arguments don’t apply to sexual orientation.
What the general public does not understand is that standard mental health therapy is now considered conversion therapy when practiced with gender-dysphoric youth.
This is how my daughter’s therapist describes her work : “The type of therapy I’m doing is … pretty standard….You’re doing a thorough assessment of a client long-term…You’re looking at their history back many years. You’re thinking about comorbidities, other types of psychological or mental health issues that might be … contributing to their discomfort, and you’re looking at the symptomology and trying to really thoroughly assess where this is coming from….For example, people who have a body image disorder or an eating disorder, the symptomology is going to look very, very similar.to what we describe as gender dysphoria. So the work I’m doing is really just a careful analysis of a person’s … presenting concerns” (7:45-8:45). Does this sound harmful? Does it sound like an attempt to change someone’s gender identity?
My daughter has appreciated the opportunity to think deeply about what her feelings mean and whether transition would be a helpful thing for her. Yet activists who believe in an affirmation-only approach are filing complaints to her therapist’s licensing board, claiming the therapist is practicing conversion therapy.
Why are transactivists so determined to prevent youth from receiving therapy that in any other context would be considered good and ethical practice? I think it is because transactivists believe they should be exempt from the rules the rest of us follow when we seek medical care.
I accept that I must get a diagnosis from a doctor before the doctor will give me a prescription or a referral. There are some elective treatments a doctor will give me without a diagnosis, such as cosmetic surgery. I accept that I must pay for elective procedures; my insurer will not.
By contrast, transwoman Andrea Long Chu wrote in a New York Times opinion article that a trans person should be able to get surgery based on “a simple demonstration of want” even if it will make the person feel worse. Long Chu asserts that when doctors use the alleviation of pain as the criteria for treatment, they are acting like “dictators” and “kings.”
In an essay for Jezebel.com, transactivist Harron Walker was enraged because a journalist dared to feature several detransitioners in a story about adolescent transition for The Atlantic . Walker fears that stories focusing on people who feel their transitions were a mistake might lead medical providers to reinstitute gatekeeping for hormone therapy, the same kind of gatekeeping the rest of us take for granted when we seek medical treatment.
I suspect Walker’s outrage is fueled by the fact that The Atlantic is a mainstream media outlet with a large circulation, a national readership, and a left-center bias . Coverage of detransitioners in mainstream media poses a threat to transactivists who want their treatments available on demand and covered by insurance.
To transactivists, girls who transition by mistake are expendable collateral damage whose existence must not be allowed to hinder trans people’s access to hormone therapy and surgeries. Thus, standard mental health therapy must be called conversion therapy, and it must be banned through legislation.
If standard mental health therapy is allowed, someone might notice that gatekeeping serves an important purpose. Someone might figure out that trans people are no better than the rest of us at diagnosing and treating their own illnesses. Many transgender people will say they are not ill and should not be treated as such. If they are not ill, then they are seeking elective treatments, and they should pay the full cost just like the rest of us.
In his Jezebel rant, Walker says a journalist writing about children who transitioned by mistake is using the kids “as a smokescreen” to hide anti-trans sentiment. My daughter is not a smokescreen. Neither are the thousands of young women like her struggling in a culture that does not value them. They are harmed, not helped, by immediate affirmation of gender identities that may have been adopted as a way to cope with other issues.
If you want to help girls, talk to your legislators. Tell them to require therapists to provide thorough assessments for gender-dysphoric minors and to identify and treat any comorbidities.
Ironically, one of the clinicians who resigned from the Tavistock clinic said of the clinic’s practices, “It feels like conversion therapy for gay children.” If you really want to ban efforts to convert young lesbians into straight people — that is, into straight transmen — tell legislators to remove gender identity from anti-conversion therapy bills. Girls need all of us to take a stand.
States currently considering conversion therapy bans include : Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.
States that have already banned conversion therapy include: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

The Moral Case For Israel Annexing The West Bank—And Beyond,thefederalist.com,Jason Hill,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/moral-case-israel-annexing-west-bank-beyond/,"By Jason Hill April 16, 2019
The April 2019 election victory for Benjamin Netanyahu will see him serve a record fifth term as Israeli prime minister and form a new right-wing coalition government. It also brings the promise of a commitment Netanyahu made to the nation during his campaign: That he would annex Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territories.
Vowing to extend sovereignty without distinguishing between settlement blocks and the isolated settlements, Netanyahu promised not to transfer any sovereignty to the Palestinians. His victory in the elections will, hopefully, see the enactment of Netanyahu’s promise.
Israel has the moral right to annex all of the West Bank (even Area C) for a plethora of reasons. Israel’s Mistake Was Allowing the Palestinian Pretense
Israel made an altruistic mistake toward the Palestinian people after the 1967 defensive war with Jordan. Rather than regard them as “war settlers” or refugees or, after legally occupying conquered territory, as “illegal occupants,” they made the Palestinian people their political and moral problem.
After victory, the “war settlers” could have been seen as enemies of the state: supporters of the Fatah (Palestine Liberation Organization) Charter, which basically calls for the end of Jewry in the region. Under a malevolent and illiberal regime, they would have been regarded and treated as such, not as Israel did treat them: as human beings with specific, inalienable rights.
Under a different set of political sensibilities, the Palestinian people would have been militarily removed from the area because, morally speaking, after the 1967 war, they never belonged there. The proper response from Israel should have been to immediately annex the land and make the people there the responsibility of their original political homeland: Jordan.
There can be no such thing as legitimate “Palestinian Territory” in a geographic region legally seized in a defensive war instigated by a foreign aggressor. The purpose of war is always to vanquish the enemy. The losers of the war cannot make demands on the victors that the victors themselves would not have been put in the position of meeting had the adversary or enemy not forced the victors into making it in the first place.
Israel was forced into a war, which it won. It was then expected to renounce and repudiate the consequences of its fairly won war by capitulating to the conditions of its vanquished enemy, which included, among other self-sacrificially undertaken goals, granting statehood, autonomy, right of return, and the ultimate elimination of Jewry from the region. The Palestinian Authority Is a Terrible Government
Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) have enjoyed joint rule by Israeli military government and the Palestinian Authority with around 98 percent of the Palestinians living in areas under jurisdiction of the PA. In such areas, the PA has destroyed the freedom Palestinians enjoyed under Israeli rule and their economy through kleptocracy, corruption, nepotism, and authoritarian forms of governance subject to none of the checks and balances that characterize Israel’s Knesset.
Jewish exceptionalism and the exceptionalist nature of Jewish civilization require an unconditional space for the continued evolution of their civilization. What’s good for Jewish civilization is good for humanity at large. Jewish civilization is an international treasure trove that must be protected.
Not all cultures are indeed equal. Some are abysmally inferior and regressive based on their comprehensive philosophy and fundamental principles—or lack thereof—that guide or fail to protect the inalienable rights of their citizens.
Given the voting patterns of Palestinians—towards Islamicism and terrorist organizations for the most part—that openly advocate and work for Israeli and Jewish destruction and annihilation, a strong argument can and ought to be made to strip Palestinians of their right to vote—period. The regional hostilities towards Israel in the Middle East are such that Israel must take those threats seriously. It must work for a coalition of forces to neutralize them. Israel Has Every Right to Defeat Terrorists
The Israeli left should abandon its agonistic handwringing over so-called Palestinian occupation and realize that applying Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, meaning the wholesale destruction of Hamas in Gaza—Hamas being a terrorist organization that can claim no rights as a group and no right to any square inch of land in the region—is an application of democratic law protecting the rights of the individuals who rightfully belong there.
Speaking of Gaza, although the strip was unilaterally relinquished, when one considers the reign of terror executed by the Hamas terrorists and the unadulterated illiberality of the movement itself, Israel has every moral right to wage a ruthless and unrelenting war against Hamas and to re-settle the land if it ever so desires.
America must also admit that it owes Israel political and financial reparations for America’s many decades of support of the PLO and the PA, which have pledged destruction to Israel, and have rejected all plausible peace offerings from Israel, preferring instead war and destruction.
This political and economic reparation would see the United States supplying Israel even more advanced military capabilities, and funding Israel’s military defense in any manner Israel deems necessary for its survival and unrivaled military status in the Middle East. Some may ask why this is necessary. The answer is two-fold.
Should a regional conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbors emerge, Israel will need to demonstrate extraordinary, excessive, and unprecedented military might in a manner that can act as a deterrent and, if necessary, to irrevocably destroy her offensive enemies.
Additional U.S. militarization of Israel is also moral in its execution. It sends a univocally clear message to the world that in any conflict between Israel and her adversaries, the United States stands willing and ready—along with her ally—to destroy any political agent that attacks the sovereignty of Israel. This is because Israel’s right to exist is non-negotiable and it has a right to unilaterally apply Israeli law over its nation-state. Why Palestinians Have No Moral Authority
Continued militarization of Israel comprises protracted support of our political and moral alter-ego in the Middle East. The decline of the Palestinian people is narrated by their willful ideological malfeasance. They have never come into their own as a people largely because they have never explicitly held a philosophy that can support freedom, the basic liberal principles of individual rights, and a free market economy.
Given Fatah and Hamas’s genocidal aspirations toward Israel and universal Jewry and, in the case of Hamas, of a global caliphate, a moral goal would be to reverse the potential sovereignty of every Palestinian movement in the region. It ought to force Jordan to re-revoke its citizenship status of the Palestinian majority in Jordan. A people that overwhelmingly approves of their terrorist leaders cannot be made to become citizens of any civilized country such as Israel.
The Palestinian terror war Fatah launched after the 2000 Camp David Peace Summit and unilaterally accepted by the Palestinian people places them in a precarious position. Whatever actions Israel or any of her allies take against them in a war against terror are their responsibility, and are moral. A people that overwhelmingly approves of their terrorist leaders cannot be made to become citizens of any civilized country such as Israel. No moral or political distinctions must be made between Fatah, Hamas, and the people who elect and or support them. No constituted people responsible for the election and appointment of terrorist actors can or should be entrusted with the responsibility of voting.
They constitute a national security threat to Israel because a core feature of their identity is a commitment to destroying Israel as a Jewish state. Therefore, only a policy of radical containment or expulsion remains a viable option. No state can obstruct the case for the achievement of its own justice and territorial safety by aiding and abetting its own destroyers. By making strategic alliances with ISIS, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations—should political expediency dictate such a move—we will witness the destruction of Jewish secularism in the region and religious militarization of the entire region.
One cannot admit anti-Semitics devoted to the destruction of Israel into the domain of Jewish civilization. There has to be some semblance of re-shaping the political sensibilities of those outside the historic process. If this is not possible, then we have to admit to their intrinsic humanity, but also, nevertheless, confess to their tragic status as political ballasts. Jason D.

"No, Joe Scarborough, Spying On Trump Wasn't Done 'By The Book'",thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/no-joe-scarborough-spying-on-trump-wasnt-done-by-the-book/,"By Mollie Hemingway April 16, 2019
When Attorney General William Barr acknowledged the Donald Trump campaign was spied on in 2016 by agencies investigating a dramatic conspiracy theory about alleged collusion with Russia, and said he’d like to review the matter, those who pushed the theory began to panic.
Some media figures attempted to deny that spying had occurred, even though it had been revealed in various and sundry ways. They conceded that overseas intelligence assets had been placed against the campaign, that wiretaps had been secured, and that national security letters had been drafted, but they claimed these examples of spying were not spying. That they’d regularly and repeatedly referred to them as spying in non-Trump contexts slowed them down not at all.
Some tried to pretend that the only example of spying was the surveillance of Carter Page, but that it didn’t count because he’d left the campaign before the surveillance began. There were a few problems, including that wiretaps can be used to secure information from months and years prior to the date it is obtained. Besides, Page had encounters with an overseas U.S. intelligence asset while he was still on the campaign. So had other campaign affiliates.
The media had previously reported that four Trump affiliates had been spied on secretly surveilled: Page, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Mike Flynn. It is unclear what other American citizens on the Trump campaign, if anyone, were spied on by their government.
Last Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” a quintet of pundits sputtered about Barr’s description . Barr specifically said he was not saying anything improper had definitively happened, just that it needed to be reviewed since spying on American citizens was such a serious thing.
“Spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated,” he said.
Barr referenced controversial spying on American citizens during the Vietnam War, which led to reforms in the laws governing such spying.
“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr said. “It’s big deal. The generation I grew up in, which was the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on the antiwar people and so forth by the government. And there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there’s an adequate basis before our law-enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance. I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated. But I think it’s important to look at that,” he said, adding that he felt an “obligation to make sure that government power was not abused.”
National affairs analyst John Heilemann said, inexplicably, there was “no evidence” for Barr’s claim. Host Joe Scarborough then pivoted to a completely different line of argument. He said that while there was no evidence of spying, such spying on political opponents is a totally normal and accepted practice.
“Everything was done by the book and there were procedural safeguards,” Scarborough said, before sputtering that Barr was “stupid” and “reckless and irresponsible.” He also said the well regarded attorney who soberly stated indisputable facts was “destroying his legacy here.”
While a thorough investigation will need to be performed to figure out how the FBI and other agencies got wrapped up in a conspiracy theory that they felt justified breaking norms and spying on political foes, it is not true that everything was “by the book.”
For example, FBI Director James Comey failed to notify Congress for nine months that an investigation into the Trump campaign had been opened, even though he was supposed to provide quarterly updates about particularly sensitive investigations. In fact, Rep. Elise Stefanik just introduced legislation to make it more difficult for FBI directors to thwart “the book” on these matters.
While at least four spy secret surveillance warrants were approved, a congressional investigation by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence described the verification effort before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) not as “by the book” but so inadequate it resembled a concerted effort to conceal information from the court : A salacious and unverified dossier formed an essential part of the application to secure a warrant against a Trump campaign affiliate named Carter Page. This application failed to reveal that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The application presented a Yahoo News article as corroboration for the dossier, when in fact it was sourced to the dossier’s author Christopher Steele. The wife of a high-ranking Justice Department official also worked on behalf of the Clinton campaign effort, and her husband Bruce Ohr funneled her research into the Department of Justice. Although he admitted that Steele “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president,” this and the Ohrs’ relationship with the Clinton campaign was concealed from the secret court that grants surveillance warrants. The dossier was “only minimally corroborated” and unverified, according to FBI officials.
A criminal referral from the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed that the dossier was unverified when it was used to secure the wiretaps.
A third example of the anti-Trump campaign not going “by the book” was the widespread use of leaks to further the investigation and the false narrative of treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the election. U.S. officials selectively leaked information to frequently give the impression that Trump was a threat to national security because of his illegal actions with Vladimir Putin.
Leaking classified information is illegal, although no one has been held responsible yet for the criminal leak against Flynn, which falsely suggested he was an agent of Putin. But even leaks of non-classified information can be extremely harmful to national security. High-level intelligence officials arranged a meeting with president-elect Trump to brief him on the now-discredited dossier in order to leak it to friendly reporters at CNN. This leak turbocharged the Trump-Russia conspiracy that devoured CNN and other media outlets. It was not done “by the book.”
Presumably some of the spying on the Trump campaign was done “by the book,” but that doesn’t include using false information as pretext to spy on Americans, attempting to extort elected officials through bogus investigations, refusing to charge ideological allies who committed crimes, lying to Congress, refusing to respond to congressional document requests, using intelligence and law enforcement as “insurance policies” against political enemies, widespread unmasking of political opponents and dissemination of their information, using foreign spies to produce evidence not permissible in court, circular introduction of “evidence” to government agents that is reintroduced through media leaks, and various other actions taken by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Scarborough would have you believe that these actions are completely typical and normal, that informants are placed against campaigns all the time. If that’s true, who else are they doing it against? Can Donald Trump’s officials open investigations against the many Democratic candidates without notifying Congress, using bogus opposition research to secure wiretaps? To quote an MSNBC morning host, “Is he that stupid?”
One more thing about the phrase “by the book.” I can’t be the only person to notice that the phrase is the same one used by Susan Rice in a curious email she sent to herself on the date Trump was inaugurated. The email was about a January 5 meeting between President Obama, former FBI director Comey, and former deputy attorney general Sally Yates regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
“President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities ‘by the book’. The President stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book.”
As senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina wrote more than a year ago , “It strikes us as odd that, among your activities in the final moments on the final day of the Obama administration, you would feel the need to send yourself such an unusual email purporting to document a conversation involving President Obama and his interactions with the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia investigation. In addition, despite your claim that President Obama repeatedly told Mr. Comey to proceed ‘by the book,’ substantial questions have arisen about whether officials at the FBI, as well as at the Justice Department and the State Department, actually did proceed ‘by the book.’”

"Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke Give Almost Nothing To Charity",thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/bernie-sanders-beto-orourke-give-almost-nothing-charity/,"By Liz Wolfe April 16, 2019
Last night, The Washington Post reported that Beto O’Rourke released his tax returns for the past ten years. Of course, the feel-good, inevitably government-expanding presidential contender should probably have been more hesitant to release his returns because it doesn’t take much sleuthing to figure out from them that the O’Rourkes made $370,412 in 2017 while giving a measly $1,166 of that income to charity. As The Post noted, this makes Beto’s charitable giving less than one-third of 1 percent of his household income.
Other candidates who claim conservatives are the true greedy ones and deserve to be smited for their fiscal sins don’t stack up much better. Bernie Sanders and his wife gave roughly 3 percent of their astonishingly large $566,000 income to charity in 2017. Interestingly, Sanders recently talked about his impressive sum of book earnings, and Reason’s Peter Suderman pointed out that the socialist is indeed a millionaire :
I think it’s genuinely great that Bernie Sanders is a millionaire, and that in becoming a millionaire, our nation’s most well-known democratic socialist politician has, however inadvertently, started defending one of the core tenets of capitalism—that if you come up with an idea for a product, make that product a reality in the world, and sell it to lots of willing buyers, it’s perfectly just and reasonable for you to earn a lot of money as a result.
He’s exactly right. None of these impressively wealthy Democratic presidential contenders should be scorned for making heaps, providing it’s from creating value that people want to benefit from.
Kamala Harris (and her husband) made nearly $2 million in 2018, giving 1.4 percent to charity (which totals out to about $27,000); Elizabeth Warren (and her husband) made just shy of $1 million (donating an improved 5.5 percent to charity in 2018). They should, however, be thoroughly criticized for demonizing millionaires and billionaires, branding them the no good, very bad, super icky ultra-wealthy, when they are some of the wealthiest people in America.
Of course, many super-wealthy people don’t think of themselves that way. A YouGov poll from earlier this year found that almost 90 percent of respondents who make $90,000 or more annually consider themselves neither rich nor poor. There’s nothing wrong with abundance, but it is odd that people would be not more self-aware about where they stand compared to the groups many routinely demonize.
Charitable giving should transcend political affiliation. It would be bad for our broader societal health if generosity were grossly weaponized to score political points, because then giving becomes more of a manipulative political ploy than it already is (to recipients, the intention behind giving probably doesn’t make a difference).
There’s something to be said for giving credit where due and recognizing when our political opponents do genuine good. Still, Arthur Brooks wrote on broader charitable giving habits in his 2015 book “The Conservative Heart,” noting:
Households headed by a ‘conservative’ give, on average, 30 percent more dollars to charity than households headed by a ‘liberal.’ This discrepancy is not an artifact of income differences. On the contrary, the average liberal family earns an average of 6 percent more per year than the average conservative family, yet still gives less away.
Later on, he notes that there’s a collective action problem as well:
Consider that the total that Americans give annually to human service organizations to assist the vulnerable comes to about $40 billion. Now suppose that we could spread that sum across the 46.5 million Americans receiving food assistance, with zero overhead and complete effectiveness. It would come to just $860 per person per year.
As much as it fits a convenient narrative, it’s awfully weaselly for liberals with political aspirations to claim conservatives are the stingy ones when those same liberals give miserly amounts of money to the people they purportedly care about.
The Betos and Bernies of the world would probably counter that by saying: 1) poverty is a collective action problem that can only be solved by taxing everybody (one person can only make a tiny dent, so why bother?), 2) the ultra- ultra -rich deserve to be taxed (like, the Koch brothers. Not normal millionaires! Extra big millionaires! Billionaires! Those ones! Trump!), or 3) really this wealth should be harnessed via taxes that way nobody can be exempt. The fact that some can accumulate so much means our system must be fixed (by them—supposedly disinterested third parties).
These points are varying degrees of wrong. 1) Lack of adequate provisions for the poor is absolutely a collective action problem. But it is also one that would probably be helped, on some level, with an extra $300,000 from the Sanders family if they would spare it.
2) If the ultra-rich were the only ones taxed, even if taxed at an insanely high rate, the additional revenue generated would not be enough to cover the hefty price tag of the various social programs that progressives want to institute. There simply aren’t anywhere close to enough Koch-level people in this country. We would also probably have a hard time safeguarding against capital flight, as any sane wealthy person would be wise to get his or her money out of the country as quick as possible.
3) The idea that progressive politicians, people who are emblematic of this very problem, would be God’s gift to man, able to fix poverty and wealth inequality despite being wealth-hoarders themselves is completely goofy. People like Sanders and O’Rourke would have more credibility if they didn’t engage in such hypocritical practices, condemning the big, bad rich people whose greed they want to harness for their own allegedly benevolent bidding.

"If You’re Getting a Huge Tax Refund, You’re Doing It Wrong",thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/youre-getting-huge-tax-refund-youre-wrong/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 16, 2019
Unless you’re a procrastinator, tax filing season officially ended Monday. That milestone means a likely reprise of the political battles from earlier this year about tax refunds and the effects of the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Early in the filing season, Democrats argued that smaller refunds for filers demonstrated the legislation’s ineffectiveness. (As of March 29, the Internal Revenue Service has processed $6 billion less in refunds than during last year’s filing season.) Republicans counter that, under the new law, most individuals will have smaller tax liabilities overall, meaning that individuals receiving smaller refunds this spring benefited from fatter paychecks throughout 2018.
By and large, Republicans have the better argument. Even the liberal Tax Policy Center concedes that most households will benefit from the tax legislation. Under their estimates , more than four in five tax filing units (80.4 percent) received a net tax cut, with fewer than one in twenty (4.8 percent) paying a net tax increase. (About 15 percent of households won’t see a major change, one way or the other.) As a result, most families with smaller refunds received larger net pay during the year, due to smaller tax withholding in their paychecks every month.
But the political back-and-forth misses the bigger point: Individuals who get a large refund at year-end from the Internal Revenue Service are in most cases not managing their money well. Why Give the Government an Interest-Free Loan?
Granted, the major changes to the tax law represent an anomaly. Some individuals could end up with a big refund this year out of an abundance of caution—they did not fully understand how the changes to the tax code would affect their financial situation, so did not want to reduce their monthly tax withholding.
But in most years and most cases, Americans’ use of their tax refunds, which averaged $2,727 last year , as a planned “bonus” check appears irrational. For instance, one survey released last month found that the largest percentage of Americans (27 percent) plan to use their refund to pay down debt.
Consider that for a moment: Individuals are using money they gave the federal government interest-free for several months, or even a year, to pay off debt for which they have been paying interest . For individuals with credit card debt charging 10 percent (or more) in interest, taking a refund in spring 2019 and not paying down their debt during 2018 through larger monthly paychecks cost them several hundred dollars in interest.
Other individuals who use their refunds for major purchases (9 percent), vacations (7 percent), or splurges (3 percent) may think that a low interest rate environment means they’re not losing that much money by taking a big refund each spring. While that belief held true for much of the past decade, it has less validity now.
Interest rates have risen ( albeit slowly ), such that savings accounts are now paying 2-2.5 percent interest. Compared to someone who uses his refund to pay for a tropical vacation, an individual who adjusts his withholding and saves the difference every month will earn enough money in interest to pay for an extra “free” dinner on his trip.
Likewise, individuals looking to place their refunds in an investment (9 percent) or retirement (7 percent) account lose the benefits of months’ worth of potential gains by doing so in a lump sum. Had they invested monthly by reducing their tax withholdings, they would have received dividends on the shares they purchased throughout 2018. Moreover, by investing every month, instead of in a lump sum when they get their tax refunds, individuals would receive the added benefit of dollar-cost averaging —buying small sums over time, rather than making one big bet, in ways that reduce an individual’s exposure to market volatility. Why Pay Fees to Get Your Own Money Back Faster?
Anticipation loans represent a particularly bad form of refund planning. Having given the federal government an interest-free loan for the entire year, individuals choosing the anticipation loan route will end up paying interest and fees to get back the money they lent the federal government for free .
To mitigate this bad planning (only slightly), H&R Block now offers refund anticipation loans without interest and fees. However, the loans come via electronic debit cards, which come with—surprise, surprise!— their own fees .
In a slightly different context, I noted previously the need for Americans to increase their personal savings. Using tax refunds as a form of forced savings reinforces my earlier point. Americans should work to save money throughout the year, not use tax refunds as their sole option to fund their retirement, or pay down debt.
On the one hand, taxpayers giving the federal government interest-free loans benefits me indirectly, by reduces the Treasury’s interest payments. But on the other, the refund phenomenon demonstrates our cultural profligacy—increasing my concern about the debts our nation continues to incur, with little plan to repay.

This Hate Crime Helps Show How To Know Real Ones From Hoaxes,thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/hate-crime-helps-show-know-real-ones-hoaxes/,"By Chad Felix Greene April 16, 2019
In national conversations about hate crimes, members of the media tend to rely on emotional rhetoric rather than rational evaluation of the facts. Despite aggravated assault making up 19.5 percent of hate crimes in 2017, the idea of random acts of hate-motivated violence inspires most of the fear and activism against hate crimes nationwide. Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons in 2017 in all categories, 79 percent were nonviolent.
To the public imagination, though, the concept of hate crimes conjures images of innocent people being targeted and brutally attacked merely for who they are. Despite many highly publicized incidents turning out to be hoaxes, hate crimes still drive a great deal of media attention. We have become accustomed to making arguments decrying the potential for true victims to be further victimized by lack of public trust in media and that real hate crimes do still happen. Here is an example of one of those true cases.
In July 2018, around 3:30 a.m., 24-year-old Brandon M. Wiley told the police that a 39-year-old gay man propositioned him and grabbed him in a sexual manner. In response, he beat the man, then later posted bloody pictures of himself on social media bragging about the assault.
The victim of the assault was found by police after a security guard witnessed the assault and suffered “multiple serious facial injuries, including a broken nose and fractured orbital sockets.” In April 2019, Wiley pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and police confirmed with video and witnesses that the victim had not molested him. Hate crime charges have been added, and Wiley is scheduled for sentencing in June . What Makes This Hate Crime Plausible?
Multiple factors of this story illustrate the anatomy of a true hate crime. The first, and most important factor, was a neutral third party. A security guard just happened to pass by when the assault happened and was able to see specific details. Witnesses are one of the most important pieces of evidence as they allow more than one perspective to the crime. Hoax hate crimes often lack eyewitnesses or, if one is present, such witnesses have a bias towards the victim and may not be an objective source of truth.
In addition to eyewitnesses, the most affecting source of evidence comes from video or audio recordings of the event. In this case, security cameras caught the entire interaction between the two individuals. This allowed the police a straightforward view into the factual events. Security footage may not reveal verbal evidence, but in this case the attacker claimed the victim first assaulted him by grabbing his crotch. This was quickly disproven by the video evidence.
Police found the victim lying on the ground where the assault occurred, and he was taken to the hospital. Immediately going to the hospital is a powerful indicator of legitimate injury also, as it does not allow for staging or exaggeration of events.
Again, the victim had multiple witnesses to his injuries and was evaluated by medical professionals rather than taking a bloody selfie and posting it on social media or waiting until later to go to the hospital. The police were informed by a third party, in this case the security guard, and allowed the facts to be objectively recorded without outside influence. The first person to interact with the victim post-attack was the police officer, which significantly strengthens the case.
One of the most revealing aspects of this case is the pride the attacker took in his actions. He posted pictures of himself immediately afterwards, positioning himself as the victim and bragging about severely beating the man. He clearly intended for the public to know his motivations and felt justified in his actions.
A widely overlooked aspect in the narrative about a hateful population intentionally targeting minorities for violence is that we rarely see attackers bragging about their actions. It would seem reasonable that if people truly despise LGBT people to such an extent that they feel compelled to physically attack them in public, there would be more public celebration of such attacks. Perpetrator Motives and Victim Reaction
A Texas study of hate crimes found that most reported hate crimes never identify a suspect and many are dismissed due to little or no evidence. It seems that the media assumes perpetrators of hate crimes simply wish to attack individuals of hated groups for the satisfaction alone rather than as a (perceived) political or social message.
In this case, the victim did admit to the police to propositioning the attacker . While a wildly inappropriate response, it is at least a reason that explains the attack. Too often we are simply asked to believe random citizens roam the streets looking for members of marginalized groups to assault for the sheer joy of the act.
Another unique property of this crime is that it took several months to collect sufficient evidence to properly prosecute the attacker with local reports updating the case. Too often, hate crimes receive a large, public announcement and rarely involve resolution or follow-up. This case was reported locally and in several LGBT news sources, but never achieved nationwide attention or outrage. This allowed the police and prosecution to gather evidence and build a case.
One overlooked quality of this case that significantly distinguishes it from most reported hate crimes is that the victim is not publicly named. Typically, an alleged victim immediately turns to social media or the press and tells his or her story before any investigation can be conducted.
In this case, even though he was viciously beaten over a minor infraction, he chose not to take this route. He was attacked, went to the hospital, gave an honest police report, and allowed justice to be properly served as he healed and rebuilt his life. While he deserves public sympathy for the attack, he did not seek fame or money. This says a great deal about the legitimacy of the incident. Would Extra Laws Really Deter Hate Crimes? Not Likely
This was a hate crime because the attacker reacted to the proposition with extreme violence and bragged about attacking the victim, a gay man. The gay man took a chance in a moment of weakness late at night in a bar, and did not deserve to be viciously beaten. But an important question is: what law would have prevented this attack?
Although a terrible situation and unfortunate experience of engaging with the wrong person in the wrong scenario, the assault on its own was already illegal. Although a hate crime charge increases sentencing, is this going to influence Wiley’s future choices or his views on gay men or his own sexuality, which inspired the assault to begin with? Will the hate crime charges prevent a similar irrational young man from doing the same?
One of the unfortunate rhetorical media reactions, especially in LGBT advocacy, is the outrage that the violent incident occurred in the first place. They insist the same could happen to all LGBT people nationwide, and that the incident is evidence of a larger pattern. But this situation is far more of an outlier than a pattern. In fact, it’s the bold honesty of the attacker about his motivations that makes this story stand out as shocking and disturbing. Our collective agreement that this is morally wrong should be evidence enough that no one supports violence against LGBT people.
It is equally as important to recognize legitimate hate crimes as it is to report on the abuse of public sympathy and compassion with high-profile hoaxes. We should recognize that, despite the unfair imbalance of hoaxes to legitimate crimes, the police take reports seriously and do everything in their power to get justice for victims.
Unfortunately, it takes a real hate crime with a satisfying resolution for us to appreciate just how safe and protected LGBT individuals are in our society. The police and our justice system should be thanked for this. Chad Felix Greene is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Tiger Woods Showed Us The Power Of Grit And Redemption,thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/tiger-woods-showed-us-power-grit-redemption/,"By Helen Raleigh April 17, 2019
Early Sunday afternoon, my husband was chatting with his 75-year-old father over the phone. Both are usually quiet men who believe it’s unmanly to wear one’s emotions on one’s sleeves. So their phone calls normally last less than five minutes. Yet last Sunday afternoon, they spent more than 30 minutes talking about Tiger Woods and recounting his play at the Masters golf tournament, hole by hole. The excitement in their voices was infectious.
I asked my husband later why he cheered for Woods all these years even though Woods hadn’t won any major for 11 years and hadn’t won the Masters for 14 years. My husband replied, “I don’t cheer for him but appreciate him. I watch sports for those few transcendent moments. Tiger is one of a handful of athletes to consistently provide those moments.”
In the mid ’90s when I immigrated to the United States, before I had a chance to pick up a golf club and hit my first shot, I’d already heard of Tiger Woods. The world of golf was divided into pre-Woods and post-Woods.
Pre-Woods, golf seemed to be a slow and boring game played mostly by slightly out of shape mid-aged or older men. Then when Woods came along, golf suddenly became a cool, fun, and athletic, challenging game. He was young and fit. He played golf with machine-like precision and collected one trophy after another, as if he simply checked off boxes on his way to Jack Nicklaus’ record of winning 18 majors.
Some called Woods a superhuman, a superhero, or even a robot. His youth and biracial background were relatable to average Joes, yet he had this air of aloofness that put a great emotional distance between him and all other mere mortals. Still, we liked him, admired him from afar, and were all certain that he was destined to greatness because he was unstoppable and invincible.
The ’90s was a hopeful time for many, including myself, a new immigrant with new experiences and, soon after, a new career and a new boyfriend. My life, while not as spectacular as Tiger’s, was moving in the right direction, too. The Late-2000s Turning Point
2008 was a terrible year and a turning point for a lot of us, including Woods. Our nation fell into a deep economic recession and many Americans lost jobs, houses, hopes, and their American dreams. It was also the last year Woods won a major and a beginning of a long, winless drought. Later some say it was the beginning of an end — an end of the era of greatness defined by Woods.
In 2009, our Thanksgiving break was interrupted by the revelation of Woods’ sex scandal . When the scandal broke, his daughter Sam was two and his son Charlie was a newborn. Sponsors like Accenture began to drop him, and his wife divorced him a year later.
A few years later, the world saw his terrible mug shot after the DUI charge. He didn’t seem cool and invincible any more. The bags under his eyes and his hallowed look showed us a deeply flawed mortal possessed by his own demons. He lost his touch and his game suffered.
Then his body kept failing him. There were repeated back surgeries. He could barely walk, and merely limped along. It was reported that, in 2017 at Augusta, he had to take a nerve blocker to make it upstairs to the Champions Dinner. His world ranking fell from 1 to 1,199. It seemed that his dream of beating Nicklaus’ record was only a dream. The whisper of a Tiger comeback or a Tiger redemption faded away in a few years after one humiliating loss after another.
His personal failings reminded us that we are all fallible. His physical failings reminded us how fragile our own bodies are and how little control we have. Like a funhouse mirror, his outsized fall forced us to stare back at a reality we didn’t want to face.
The world of golf hasn’t been the same without an invincible Tiger. Yes, there have been many good, young players like Jason Day and Jordan Spieth. But none of them could bring back the kind of mojo that Woods had. It’s hard to appreciate golf without Tiger. just like it’s hard to appreciate a Greek mythology without Hercules. Tiger’s Resurgence
Then everything changed last Sunday. After a 15-year gap, Woods won the Masters again, when everyone least expected it. Just like the video Nike put out, he “experienced every high and every low,” but never gave up chasing his crazy dream. After all the scandals, injuries, and failures, he came back in the most spectacular way on Palm Sunday. With this win, his ranking in the world climbed 1,193 spots to number six.
The beauty of Augusta is that it’s the only major golf tournament that takes place at the same golf course at the same time, year after year. But Tiger is a different player this time. He no longer walks around with an air of aloofness or invincibility. As sports reporter Jason Gay observed , Tiger is more “human” now, and there was a sense of humility. He put on a great performance, but it was the way he scooped up his son after the 18th hole that made our eyes moist and hearts melt. The display of raw emotion stirred something deep in our hearts too.
Frank Pallotta, a sports reporter for CNN, tweeted two photos: on the left, Tiger hugged his dad in 1997 when he won the Masters for the first time. As a young man he sought his famously demanding father’s approval. On the right, Tiger hugged his son, Charlie. As a father, it seems his biggest joy was to share this incredible moment with his children. Life comes full circle.
Last week was a good week in some ways. Two things that we previously considered impossible happened: first, scientists presented us with the first-ever photo of a black hole. Then, Woods won the Masters again after 15 years. The lesson from both? Don’t let naysayers define your life. Don’t settle for less. No matter how far behind you are, never give up. With persistence and focus, crazy dreams do come true.
We should also remember that this week is the holiest week for Christians. Wood’s redemption on Palm Sunday serves as a good reminder for all of us that no matter how far we fall—or how flawed we are—we can all be redeemed.

What To Expect From Democrats When Mueller’s Report Drops Thursday,thefederalist.com,Jason Beale,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/expect-democrats-muellers-report-drops-thursday/,"By Jason Beale April 17, 2019
You know the moment in a really suspenseful movie when That Thing happens and everyone in the theater simultaneously realizes that nothing will ever be the same?
Everything slows down. The camera focuses on a face, or an object. Birds suddenly take flight. Characters turn to each other, their expressions changing in slow motion from light-hearted to tense, sensing danger. Eyes widen. A single, high-pitched note pierces the scene.
Think Arya Stark watching from the crowd when her father Eddard is beheaded. The glass of water on the table in Jurassic Park, rippling to the beat of a dinosaur’s footsteps. Private Ryan’s mother doing the dishes, not noticing as we all watch that government vehicle coming up her driveway.
That Thing happened on March 24 when Attorney General William Barr released his summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election and any links or coordination with members of the Trump campaign. The summary reported the bottom-line findings of the Mueller team: no conspiracy or coordination, and no decision on obstruction of justice, although there was no finding of a crime.
As attorney general, it fell to Barr to make that decision, and he did. In consultation with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and DOJ prosecutors, Barr found that the evidence provided in the report was insufficient to warrant an obstruction charge.
In doing so, Barr brought the sword down on Eddard Stark’s neck, uncaged the Tyrannosaurus Rex, and drove that black sedan up to Mrs. Ryan’s front door. Everything stopped. In Washington and New York, thousands of Democratic politicians and media luminaries froze, as their worldview and credibility instantly shattered under the weight of Barr’s words. A single, piercing, foreboding note echoed across the country, from Washington to Los Angeles. Everything had changed, and nothing would ever be the same. Here’s Where It Diverges from a Movie Plot
In the movies, there has to be a denouement of some sort—an untying of the plot that brought us to this moment—to give meaning and substance to the story. It can’t end with a plot twist. The plot twist is just the beginning of an ending that could include anything from redemption to revenge to triumph.
Unfortunately, for all us this isn’t a movie, and there will be no proper denouement—at least not in the near term. After two years of shamelessly and enthusiastically hyping the notion that the president of the United States is a compromised agent of the Russian Federation—a process that involved dozens upon dozens of anonymously sourced falsehoods, falsely interpreted statements, demonstrably false characterizations of classified evidence, and false predication for official sanction to spy on fellow citizens—those who perpetrated those acts will do everything in their power to avoid this unexpected and unwelcome introduction of truth into their narrative.
Under any circumstances other than those that include a collusive media, the Democratic politicians and former intelligence officials who perpetrated this hoax would be the laughingstock of the world.
There’s a reason beer companies pay millions for 30-second ads, and millions more to advertising companies to draw from a variety of well-studied human influence techniques to craft their commercials: it’s worth the money. It sells. The strategy is simple—just make sure the message and the logo are out there as often and consistently as possible, and the return will validate the investment.
The same applies to cable news networks and national newspapers staffed and managed by left-leaning Democrats. The constant barrage of reflexive leftist messaging and 24/7 cover, support, and venue for Democratic talking points is literally priceless, from an advertising perspective.
There is no possible way to quantify the influence of legacy media in aiding and abetting the notion that President Trump was a compromised agent of Russia, but think about how much Budweiser pays for 30 seconds, then think about the cumulative messaging influence of Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon, Jim Sciutto, Jim Acosta, Joy Reid, Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O’Donnell, Malcolm Nance, Chris Hayes, Chris Matthews, Gloria Borger, April Ryan, Andrea Mitchell, Simone Sanders, Asha Rangappa, John Berman, Paul Begala, Max Boot, and Anderson Cooper.
Each of these people is as influential during his nightly five-minute to one-hour pro-collusion, anti-Trump advertisement as is the Trivago guy in convincing us to visit his site in his 30-second ad. It sells. The only difference is that you can probably trust the Trivago guy to accurately represent the capabilities of his travel site, because we have laws that guard against false advertising on a commercial level. Those laws don’t apply to cable news hosts and political punditry. The Next Ad Is About What’s Not In the Report
At some point on Thursday, Barr is going to release the redacted Mueller report to the public, and every Democrat in Congress is going to run to the nearest camera to declare the redacted information crucial to understanding Trump’s complicity in collusion and obstruction. There will be no acknowledgement of the direct quotes from the Mueller report reflecting what Barr put out in his summary, declaring no conspiracy or coordination.
There will be no acknowledgement, once the evidence of obstruction against Trump turns out to be 90 percent tweets and public statements, that there’s no “there” there. And there will be no acknowledgement that the Steele dossier and every subsequent anonymously sourced bombshell alleging collusion between Trump and Russia is thoroughly debunked in the Mueller report.
From Thursday onward, we’re going to be talking about redactions. If the report reads: “After dedicating two years to examining every allegation, interviewing every witness, reviewing every communication of everyone involved, and summoning the collective might of the entire U.S. intelligence apparatus to support our investigation, we found no evidence to support conspiracy or cooperation between Trump or his campaign and the Russians,” we would undoubtedly hear from Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, and all of cable news that the redaction invalidated the conclusion of no conspiracy or cooperation.
Take it as a matter of faith that Democrats and left-leaning media will completely reject the Mueller report, despite being able to read for themselves the same exculpatory sentences Barr included in his summary, and claim that the redactions either hid horrific and collusive behavior by Trump and his campaign associates, or left open the possibility that Barr improperly redacted impeachable behavior that didn’t reach the threshold of “beyond a reasonable doubt” but may well meet congressional standards for impeachment. Sowing Dissention Is All They Have Left
Left unstated will be the unimpeachable fact that Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic-controlled Congress have no intention of attempting to impeach the president. They simply want to keep the idea alive, keep people talking, keep people doubting, and sow discord and confusion into the body politic.
That is, quite literally, all they have left. And if you think they’ll consider for one moment the obvious desperation inherent in their predictable and dishonorable response to a report of investigative findings by a man they swore they’d fight to the death to protect, you’d be wrong. They simply want to keep the idea alive, keep people doubting, and sow discord and confusion into the body politic.
Consider the course of events since March 24, when Barr, a highly respected former attorney general, issued his summary. Pandemonium. After a brief period of recovery from the solar plexus punch that stole their air for a moment, the media and their Democratic congressional associates set about the task of delegitimizing the attorney general’s authority to decline prosecution on borderline cases.
They didn’t argue the facts of the case, as they had nothing other than the public allegations we’ve all heard on which to base their argument. Instead, they attacked Barr. They said he was “speaking to an audience of one”—an oldy but a goody—and “he was covering for his boss, Donald Trump.” The idea was to begin to plant into our psyche the notion that this has all been a big Trump/Barr conspiracy, that the legendary Mueller was too weak, or perhaps too patriotically subservient to the AG, to object to Barr’s abject mischaracterization of his conclusions.
I realize this is crystal clear to the vast majority who read this, but that’s simply a load of baloney. Mueller is not afraid of anybody, nor is he the kind of guy to sit idly by while a senior government official engages in conduct Mueller believes to be unethical or untoward. He’s no Jim Comey, and there will be no hastily scribbled “Barr made me feel all cold inside” notes turned into a book at the end of this saga.
If Mueller had a problem with what Barr wrote in his summary, he’d have made it clear to Barr first, then Congress, then the media. None of them heard a peep out of Mueller.
Democrats and the media have simply invested so much of their personal and professional credibility into Trump and his campaign conspiring with the Russians to win the election that there is a less-than-zero possibility they will acknowledge that they got it wrong. To the contrary, they will draw strength from each other to weather the storm. Democratic politicians will invent specious fantasies of what lies beneath the redactions, and the media will host them, encourage them, parrot them, and thank them for keeping hope alive. Don’t Call It Spying, Call It Surveillance
The problem with this strategy is that Barr doesn’t care what they think. He made that clear in his hearing in front of the Senate Appropriations Committee when he said that he believed the Obama administration “spied” on the Trump campaign, and that he planned to get to the bottom of whether that spying was lawfully predicated. Remember that Barr hasn’t said a word, thus far, that isn’t demonstrably true.
He will get to the bottom of it, and those most vocally opposed to his interest in determining the legality of the origins of the investigation—those salad days of foreign intelligence agency reporting, John Brennan meetings with Harry Reid about the Steele dossier, unlimited unmasking of NSA intercepts, et al.—those are the people and activities Barr will be most interested in reviewing.
Predictably, “progressives” who used to call themselves “liberals” lost their minds about his use of the word “spying.” It was as if Barr had expressed skepticism for “global warming,” unaware that the issue was actually “climate change.” They were incensed that Barr’s use of the word “spying” may give Americans the impression that government agencies under the Obama administration were actually “spying” on American citizens—a horrible, detestable notion—as opposed to what was actually happening.
What was happening was the complete surveillance coverage of every word they wrote, received, uttered, forwarded, or saved, including months prior to the order and everyone up to two hops away from their communication circle. “That’s not spying, Barr,” said Democrats. “The connotations of that word are troubling. That’s called surveillance, and we’re cool with that.” Taking Refuge in Complete Denial of the Truth
There will be no proper denouement of this particular movie because a proper denouement would require the media to acknowledge their almost universal failure, and the effect their political bias had on their erroneous reporting. It would require Democratic politicians like Schiff, Jerry Nadler, and Swalwell to admit that they were wrong and (in the movie) to dedicate themselves to working to regain the respect and trust of the man they wrongfully accused of treason to his country. That would be the movie ending. That’s not going to happen.
What’s going to happen is that the Mueller report will have enough information in it to convince a fair-minded observer of Trump’s innocence about collusion, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice, but the only conversation that will resonate on cable news media and in national newspapers Thursday will be the assumption-fueled speculation of what lies under the redactions. The unredacted, exculpatory facts will be downplayed or ignored, in favor of the sweet, sweet comfort of the unprovable, and thus easily manipulated, redactions. Remember that Mueller himself (and his team) is participating in the redaction process.
Remember this Thursday night, when all of the primetime cable news anchors are convincing you of their clever and discerning stance that there’s no way anyone can trust Barr to do anything but illegally cover for the president by indiscriminately redacting large portions of the Mueller report. Remember that Mueller himself (and his team) is participating in the redaction process. Remember that Barr hasn’t said a word, thus far, that isn’t demonstrably true. Remember that the report could include 399 pages of evidence proving Trump innocent of all charges and one redacted page, and the media and Democrats would team up to highlight the impeachment possibilities hiding underneath that one redacted page.
It’s a shame we have to do it like this. It’s a shame it’s so predictably callous and unserious. But it’s even more of a shame that people who marketed themselves as patriots are engaged in a game of hiding the truth and mischaracterizing evidence in service of their personal and political agendas.
We will see all of this in its full glory Thursday and beyond. Watch closely, because the only honest response to the Mueller report by both Democrats and media is, “We got it wrong.” It’s not often one can be so certain, in advance, of disappointment in one’s fellow man. Unfortunately, in this case, you can bank on it.

Democrats Are Using Ilhan Omar As An Excuse To Chill Speech,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/democrats-using-ilhan-omar-excuse-chill-speech/,"By David Harsanyi April 16, 2019
Democrats have spent the past two-plus years accusing the president of the United States and his allies of seditiously conspiring with our enemies to destroy “democracy.” For the most part this fairytale has been cynically deployed by politicians to undermine the legitimacy of a Republican presidency, yet millions of Americans now believe their votes were upended by a foreign power. There is no more serious charge against an elected official than treason.
Then again, for decades before the 2016 election, Democrats argued that Republicans were literally killing their fellow Americans when cutting taxes , murdering the sick when rejecting nationalized health care, and sentencing the poor to death when rejecting socialist schemes. Not to mention suppressing the minority vote when asking for ID, engaging in Nazi-like actions when enforcing existing border laws , and destroying the world when failing to embrace a takeover of the economy. And so on.
This overwrought rhetoric is embedded in the everyday arguments of the mainstream left, and its intensity is only growing.
The same liberals are now demanding that conservatives stop quoting and posting video of progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar belittling the 9/11 attacks because doing so puts her life in danger. That’s quite the deal they’ve cooked up for themselves. Nearly every presidential candidate and major Democratic leader has argued that Donald Trump’s criticism of Omar is out of line because of increased death threats against her. I do wonder how many death threats Trump or Mitch McConnell or Steve Scalise receives every week. I imagine it’s considerable.
But, as usual, most of the media took up the Democrats’ cause, trying to infantilize a 38-year-old woman. “Trump clearly unmoved over increased concerns raised by Dems over Omar’s safety,” noted The Washington Post’s CNN’s Manu Raju after Trump attacked Nancy Pelosi’s handling of the Minnesota representative. One wonders if Raju had similar apprehensions when he published a story with two alleged sources giving him the same exact incorrect information falsely accusing Donald Trump Jr. of conspiring with Russia?
Do reporters and columnists consider the safety of the Trump administration before writing critically about them? I hope not. Because free speech—political discourse and good faith political reporting included—shouldn’t be inhibited by prospective actions of third-party nuts. It is imperative, in fact, that we don’t let those nuts undercut our ability to freely express our political disagreements. If Americans pondered the actions of political terrorists every time they took a position, they would only be empowering criminals.
Not one of Trump’s critical comments about Omar called for violence in any way. He didn’t rationalize chasing Omar out of a restaurants or standing in front of her home with a bullhorn. The idea that politicians should have immunity from criticism is not something journalists, or anyone who values free expression, should give any credence. Yet, here we are.
Let’s remember one of the times we actually saw overt political violence was when progressive activist and Bernie Sanders campaign volunteer attempted to assassinate the entire Republican congressional delegation. As far as I can tell, no one in the media asked Sanders or any other Democrats to temper their political rhetoric about Republicans. If the reverse had occurred we would have been plunged into a national discussion about right-wing rhetoric. (Wait, what am I saying, Republicans are already asked to take responsibility for violent actions of people who have nothing to do with them!)
Attempting to chill speech isn’t a new tactic for Democrats, and certainly not when it comes to Omar. As an African-American Muslim woman, the congresswoman has reached the pinnacle of special status, and thus any criticism, even quoting her verbatim or playing a video of her yucking it up about terrorism, is categorized as racist. There are no specific guidelines for when it’s acceptable to be critical of the things an African-American Muslim woman politician says, though, for most people the answer is “never.”
Of course, the notion that someone’s color or ethnicity or religion offers them dispensation from political debate is one of the most destructive aspect of this debate.
Democrats chose to rally around Omar, celebrating her immigrant story and appearing with her on magazine covers. Now those Democrats are compelled to cover up and rationalize her comments (though we shouldn’t underestimate how popular some of her anti-Jewish tirades and ugly views of America are among progressives). There is no freshman-level Marxist gobbledygook or conspiracy theory that Omar won’t regurgitate, from claiming that the US was “founded by genocide” to claiming that American power is built through “neocolonialism” to embracing morally decrepit ideas about the Middle East and Jews.
Democrats first covered for her actions by watering down an already-useless resolution condemning her anti-Semitic comments with a bunch of vacuous censures of all bigotry. Even today, Democrats and their media allies continue to mislead about what Omar actually said. This week, Maggie Haberman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the New York Times, for example, described Omar as being in trouble over “comments on Israel.” Bernie Sanders offered the same falsehood in his Fox News town hall when he claimed “It is not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right wing government in Israel.” The comments Omar was in trouble for weren’t about Israel. Of course, her continuous attacks on our liberal allies and her defense of proto-terrorist states is one thing. But Omar was in trouble for smearing American Jews, not merely Israel .
Now, they’ve moved onto covering for her with “ fact checks ” and feigned indignation. It is clear to me that Omar was minimizing 9/11, as she does Islamic terrorism in general. It’s clear to me she is a defender of theocrats and an apologist for terror organizations like Hamas. You might disagree. You can view her comments and decide for yourself. Whatever the case, threats of violence against politicians are illegal and should be condemned by any decent person. In the end, though, whether Omar has increased threats against her or not, she is a public figure and deserves no special dispensation from debate. "
‘Stop Sanders’ Haven’t Noticed One Of Bernie’s Biggest Weaknesses,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/stop-sanders-democrats-havent-noticed-one-bernies-biggest-weaknesses-yet/,"By Warren Henry April 17, 2019
According to The New York Times , “mainstream Democrats are increasingly worried that their effort to defeat President Trump in 2020 could be complicated by [Bernie] Sanders, in a political scenario all too reminiscent of how Mr. Trump himself seized the Republican nomination in 2016.” Sanders pays lip service to the idea of unity, but has warned supporters he is also fighting establishment Democrats .
Bernie is embroiled in a bitter feud with Clinton loyalists at the Center for American Progress (CAP), which has been criticizing the socialist’s Medicare-for-All proposal behind the scenes. (There is little question where the Times stands in this battle; its hit piece uses CAP President Neera Tanden’s 78-year-old mother to attack her.)
The “Stop Sanders” Democrats will turn out to be as ineffectual as NeverTrump Republicans were in 2016 unless they find a line of attack that is not simply a grievance of the party’s establishment. Sanders supporters are about as likely to ditch Bernie over his millionaire status as Trump supporters were affected by the bankruptcies in his business past. Nor are they likely to care about the details of his single-payer health-care bill. But once Bernie’s opponents understand the roots of his success, they may find a potent issue staring them in the face.
There are two major reasons Sanders is near the Democrats’ center of gravity. First, his socialism (or “ social-ism “) largely expresses a vision Democrats have held for at least 50 years and often longer. Second, because his vision is old, it remains rooted in class , rather than the identity politics of the New New Left. For some, this second reason is a feature; for others, it is a bug.
The potential fault line for Sanders among Democrats may be his position on immigration: Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigns in Oskaloosa, IA: ""If you open the borders, there's a lot of poverty in this world, and you're going to have people from all over the world. And I don't think that's something that we can do at this point. Can't do it."" pic.twitter.com/INF9GopzIe

Bernie’s stance against open borders is not where many Democrats are now, especially young progressives and democratic socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Rep. @AOC : ""I think 'Abolish ICE' is a call to action on several levels. One is the literal interpretation of all abolishing ICE, which I support…I don't believe that an agency that systematically & repeatedly violates human rights — I don't think that agency can be reformed."" pic.twitter.com/YyOQCSA3lA

Granted, the woke are as over-hyped as the “Stop Sanders” types are likely to be. But the younger, woker set is likely to be a key component of Bernie’s coalition. Per HarrisX, Generation (aka age) is THE divide in the Dem primary right now. This is an average of the last few days… Bernie Sanders has got the young and Joe Biden has got the old.

Moreover, the open borders position is held more broadly among Democratic leadership. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly called a border wall “immoral.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called the wall “ medieval .”
It is obvious to anyone paying attention that Democrats’ newfound extremism against border security is a reaction to President Trump, who made it his signature issue in 2016. More than any other subject (excepting possibly “Russiagate”), Trump’s immigration policies embody the personal qualities Democrats loathe about Trump.
For Democrats, Trump’s determination to secure our border and crack down on illegal immigration represent his racism, nativism, Islamophobia, and general cruelty. His immigration policies outrage the party faithful, and none more than those marinating in left-wing identity politics.
Viewing the 2020 campaign from this perspective, the Democrats nominating Sanders would be not unlike Republicans nominating Mitt Romney in 2012. The GOP suffered steep losses in 2008, but roared back to reclaim Congress in 2010 based on widespread opposition to Obamacare. Having championed a mandate-based health system as governor of Massachusetts, Romney was effectively neutered on this key issue, dampening partisan enthusiasm for his candidacy. Nominating Sanders would require either a Romney-esque flip on immigration, or dispiriting the Democratic base on the issue that largely defines and fuels their opposition to Trump.
Sanders can try to spin his immigration position as a feature rather than a bug. Republicans tend to win on immigration when the question is whether America should have borders and enforce them. Democrats tend to gain when the issue becomes what to do about those who have already crossed into our country illegally ( e.g. , family separation, a path to citizenship, etc.)
By rejecting open borders, a Sanders-Trump debate would play out on more Democratic turf. Sanders might also argue that his position is a better fit to attract Obama-Trump voters in the Rust Belt and Midwestern states Hillary Clinton lost.
This will be a difficult sell, however, to Democrats who have elevated the notion of open borders to a moral principle. Again, the parallel to the right’s attitudes regarding Obamacare is instructive.
When each party base has lacked the power to enact legislation, it has been easy to embrace maximalist positions. Tea Party Republicans generally sought to repeal Obamacare without consensus about a replacement. Progressives and socialists want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement and tear down the wall we already have.
Only after a party gains effective control of the government do political realities intrude. It is a psychology that does not aid Sanders in winning the Democratic nomination, let alone a general election.
There is no guarantee the neoliberals and woke identitarians can deny Sanders the Democratic nomination by putting him in a vise on immigration. After all, Romney did win the GOP nod in 2012, despite his weakness on Obamacare. But Bernie’s opponents have failed to come up with a better idea so far.

"Notre Dame Isn’t Just A Symbol Of Civilization, It’s A Symbol Of Heaven",thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/notre-dame-isnt-just-symbol-western-civilization-symbol-heaven/,"By John Daniel Davidson April 17, 2019
I am fortunate to have visited Notre Dame de Paris before the fire. I went twice, seven years ago when my wife and I were living in the south of France. I was not yet a Catholic back then, and went to Notre Dame as a tourist. Even then, the immensity, grandeur, and transcendent beauty of the place made a deep impression on me. If man can imagine and build such a thing for God, I thought, what must God have in store for man?
I see now that Notre Dame was, for me, a small step—a push—toward the Catholic Church. It was a sign, a physical manifestation of an eternal truth that I had not yet been able to recognize in full, but that, standing amid the soaring Gothic columns of the cathedral, I intuited. On some level I knew that Notre Dame, the place itself, proclaimed the truth—about its patron the Blessed Virgin Mary, about heaven and hell and all creation, about man and God and His church.
The burning of Notre Dame has now brought us a new sign. Rod Dreher writes that it “symbolizes what we in the West have allowed to happen to our religious and cultural patrimony. What happened in Paris today has been happening across our civilization.”
Many others echoed this sentiment over the last 48 hours, and while fairly obvious, it is not wrong. What more powerful symbol of the decline of faith and religion could there be than Notre Dame engulfed in flames? For believers, the flames are clearly a call to repentance and conversion. As C.C. Pecknold rightly notes , “To truly rebuild Notre Dame will require becoming the kind of people who built her in the first place.” That we are not now that kind of people, there is no doubt. What Macron and Others Get Wrong About Rebuilding
Consider French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Tuesday that Notre Dame will be rebuilt within the next five years. Imagine the hubris it takes to look at a burned out Notre Dame, a cathedral that took centuries to build, and proclaim the day afterward that it will be rebuilt, even greater than before, in five years.
In this, Macron embodies the very worldview that makes the resurrection of Notre Dame, at least by secular westerners, impossible. The urge to proclaim that it will be rebuilt—even more splendorous than before!—in just five years is what you would expect from those who mistake the cathedral building, in all its splendor, for the truth that the cathedral points to.
It’s also partly what’s behind the reaction of pundits like Ben Shapiro, who described Notre Dame as a “monument to Western civilization,” later tweeting , “If we wish to uphold the beauty and profundity of the Notre Dame cathedral, that means re-familiarizing ourselves with the philosophy and religious principles that built it.”
But Notre Dame is not primarily a monument to Western civilization, it is a monument to the Holy Mother of God and the salvation of Jesus Christ, and it will take more than “re-familiarizing ourselves” with western philosophical and religious principles to revive the faith that erected it 800 years ago.
That is, it will take real faith in the resurrection of Jesus Christ—and real repentance for our rejection of that faith. Listening to the likes of Macron, one despairs. Whether he realized it or not, Macron was echoing the Jews in the second chapter of St. John’s gospel, when Jesus drove out the moneychangers from the temple:
So the Jews answered and said to Him, ‘What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?’ Jesus answered and said to them, ‘Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.’ Then the Jews said, ‘It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?’ But He was speaking of the temple of His body. A Call to Repentance and Conversion
The burning of Notre Dame is not a challenge to restore a jewel of Western civilization, or a call to reflect on the philosophical principles of our Judeo-Christian heritage, or even—as it will surely be construed—an opportunity to unite around our “shared heritage” or some such. Such platitudes will not do. At this late hour, the burning of Notre Dame is nothing less than a call to repentance and conversion.
That is not because if we repent and convert we will be spared the future flames and disasters of history, but because repentance and conversion are the only means by which we overcome the ultimate disaster, which is death and separation from God.
The West lost sight of that truth some time ago, and it might never regain it. As for Catholics and all Christians, we will suffer much more than the fire of Notre Dame in the years and generations to come. As then-theology professor Fr. Joseph Ratzinger said in 1969 about the future of the church:
From the crisis of today the Church of tomorrow will emerge—a Church that has lost much. She will become small and will have to start afresh more or less from the beginning. She will no longer be able to inhabit many of the edifices she built in prosperity. As the number of her adherents diminishes, so it will lose many of her social privileges. In contrast to an earlier age, it will be seen much more as a voluntary society, entered only by free decision. As a small society, it will make much bigger demands on the initiative of her individual members.
Notre Dame was once a symbol of heaven on earth. Today, it is a symbol of how far we have drifted from the divine vision it has proclaimed down the centuries—and how far we will have to go to recover it. "
Why One-Third Of Biologists Now Question Darwinism,thefederalist.com,Benjamin R. Dierker,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/one-third-biologists-now-question-darwinism/,"By Benjamin R. Dierker April 16, 2019
While Christians have long challenged Charles Darwin’s theory of undirected evolution, few appreciate the true extent of the challenge beyond the church. Current estimates are that approximately one-third of professional academic biologists who do not believe in intelligent design find Darwin’s theory is inadequate to describe all of the complexity in biology.
Ben Stein documented a crackdown within the academy on criticism of Darwin in his 2008 documentary “ Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed .” While this might explain why the public rarely hears of challenges to Neo-Darwinism, the documentary centered on intelligent design. But the growing discontent in academia is from secular naturalists.
Defining evolution is key. At the basic level of change over time , even Young Earth biblical creationists agree. At its most specific level of the common descent of all life on earth from a single ancestor via undirected mutation and natural selection , many legitimately question evolutionary theory as it stands. The word is often used interchangeably without distinction, but even when used technically in academic biologist circles, real skepticism exists about the theory. Demanding a New Theory
A controversial letter to Nature in 2014 signaled the mounting concern, however slow and cautious, among thoughtful professional biologists. Other works by atheist authors like “ What Darwin Got Wrong ” and “ Mind and Cosmos ” find “fatal flaws” in the theory and assert it is “almost certainly false.”
Another project, The Third Way , seeks to avoid a false choice between divine intervention (which it outright rejects) and the Neo-Darwinian model (which it finds unsupported in the face of modern molecular theory) while presenting evidence to improve evolution theory beyond Neo-Darwinism. Some even believe billions of years have not been adequate for Darwinian theory to accomplish current complexity, as the theory currently exists.
This dissatisfaction is a matter of public record, even if it lacks public attention, and despite the narrative running contrary. Indeed dedicated Neo-Darwinists often say “no serious scientists disagree” or “only creationists have problems.” These contentions are increasingly disproven.
The important note is that these are not ideologues or religious zealots, nor do they propose a god or biblical solution. Rather, they find problems with the explanatory value of Darwin’s theory in light of modern understanding of mutation, variation, DNA sequencing, and more. These expressions of doubt do not reject naturalism or evolution per se, but the rigor of the Neo-Darwinian model for explaining the development of life.
In fact, they want to help Darwin, not tear him down. That he needs help is news to the academy. A Voice in the Wilderness
Professor Kevin Laland, author of the Nature letter insisting on “urgent” rethinking of evolutionary theory, has been described by critics as offering an unneeded paradigm shift . He recognizes the pushback from the scientific establishment, but he and his colleagues forge a path forward nonetheless with rigorous work on their model of Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES).
This is an update to the mid-20th-century Modern Synthesis , which patched up Neo-Darwinian theory with then-modern information. Since then, understanding of complexity has grown such that Laland and others believe EES or another supplement is necessary to keep up. It is not a replacement or rejection of Neo-Darwinism, but can be deployed alongside it as a way to understand key processes of nature the theory neglects.
Laland explained, “The EES is a minority position, but not as small a minority as it is often portrayed. It is also gaining ground.” EES is not the only naturalist supplement or revision of Neo-Darwinism, but joins several other embattled factions in the academy, including The Third Way.
“As you may surmise, there is a lot of politics in these debates. Traditionalists have a track record of characterising more progressive researchers as a small group of extremists,” Leland added. Explaining why it is difficult to gain traction, he continued, “support for our position comes from academic fields on the periphery of evolutionary biology, such as evolutionary developmental biology, ecological developmental biology, paleontology, botany, and the human sciences, while traditionalists dominate evolutionary genetics.” A Growing Minority
After publishing in Nature, Laland received more than 1,000 emails in support from the academic community. This number is huge for a critique of such a longstanding accepted theory. In the five years since the Nature letter, support has also only grown.
The leading critics have been intelligent design supporters, who are looked down on by naturalists. But as each group adds to the scientific literature, certain critiques and findings inevitably bolster or redirect the research of the other.
The effects go at least one way. Following work and theories of Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Denton helped shape a generation of skeptics with his 1985 book “Evolution: A Theory in Crisis.” An evolutionist and agnostic, Denton has continued his criticism .
In the past decade, the works of professor Michael Behe, Steven Meyer, and others have given more life to the debate on the national stage. In “Darwin Devolves,” Behe points to the process of mutations to describe the inadequacy of an unguided materialist process to add information. Meyer explores the Cambrian explosion and the complexity of the cell to show the biodiversity and complexity we observe, and notes that natural processes have never been observed to produce such results.
Importantly, these two men, and many others, believe in the standard multibillion-year timeline for the Earth and make their findings based on deduction of natural evidence rather than starting from authority in scripture or elsewhere. The growth of the intelligent design community is noteworthy, but not as interesting as those who are apart from it, secular, and nonetheless find Darwinian evolution to contain serious flaws.
Behe explained that, “Based on conversations with my own colleagues at Lehigh [University], dozens of other biologists, and news stories in journals I would guesstimate that a third or more of biologists are quite skeptical that Darwin’s theory explains all of biology.” The growing literature speaks for itself.
Paul Nelson told Stein that, “One-on-one at a scientific meeting after the third or fourth beer, my experience has been that many evolutionary biologists will say ‘Yeah, this theory’s got a lot of problems.’” While anecdotal, this is echoed by many in academia, both within intelligent design, and more importantly outside of it.
While maintaining his field is not in crisis, and insisting on nuance, Leland notes, “I think the numbers issue depends strongly on subtle details of how you frame the question. A good proportion would probably agree that the causal bases of evolution are more complex than commonly portrayed in the textbooks.” Difficulties in Forming Alliances
Nuance and framing are important, and along with traditional pressures, make estimates of the Neo-Darwin critics incredibly difficult to conclude. One approach is to simply seek signatures on a simple scientific statement of skepticism . Several hundred PhDs have signed. However, the association with intelligent design and possible academic consequences keeps many from signing. Current Neo-Darwinism is far from the untouchable theory it is lauded to be.
While intelligent design gets a bad rap, such titans as Francis Crick and Richard Dawkins have espoused the same tenets. Still, many immediately and falsely link intelligent design with Christian divinity and stay far away.
The Third Way is highly exclusive to maintain purity and preempt criticism. Not only are religious believers excluded, but the platform is invite-only. The isolated clusters of scientists averse to associating with one another, or too set on their preferred nuance, lend credence to the traditionalist Neo-Darwin assertion that only a tiny fringe minority, if that, exists.
The plain truth from the literature, conferences, expert perception, and a bit of anecdote for color, is that current Neo-Darwinism is far from the untouchable theory it is lauded to be. Not only this, but it has serious and increasing skeptics and challengers from within the secular scientific community.
When adding in supporters of intelligent design, which is religion-neutral, the numbers begin to expand rapidly. While there are serious, scientific, and peer-reviewed studies from this group, it does not rock the boat as much as the secular material naturalists. The goal is not to abandon Darwin, but to retire him to make way for more coherent comprehensive theories.
This article has been slightly changed to clarify the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis. The original draft described it as a paradigm shift, which Laland says is inaccurate.

He holds a master's degree in public administration and a bachelor's degree in economics, both from Texas A&M University. He is a Christian and a Texan and loves to talk about both. "
Notre Dame's Ruin Is A Metaphor For The Western Church - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/notre-dames-ruin-metaphor-western-church/,"By Charles C. Camosy April 17, 2019
If one were going to choose the most important church in the world, the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris (with the possible exception of the St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome) would top the list. Built over the better part of two centuries, an era spanning nearly the entire Gothic period, the cathedral’s construction was funded by Christian benefactors from all around late-medieval France.
The fruit of their donations, a building named for Our Lady—who carried the God-man in her very self—continued for eight centuries. Countless people who entered the cathedral’s doors were led to a profound experience of the divine. Known as “the poor people’s book,” the building told salvation history through images and paintings for those millions who either could not read or did not have access to texts.
But we should not shrink from the hard truth about what Notre Dame de Paris became. Many millions more now have visited the building annually as a historical monument than who entered to commune with the transcendent. Notre Dame is, in many ways, much closer in the West’s cultural imagination to a Temple of Apollo than a home of the living God. It’s become a historical and beautiful curiosity that signals a time, now past, in which the people who went before us believed some, well, nutty stuff.
Indeed, the smoldering ruin of the cathedral now stands as a tragic metaphor for the church, not just in France, but in much of the developed West more generally. The structure or shell is still largely intact, but the building itself has been gutted.
Yes, there are still priests. There are still churches. There are still schools and hospitals. But the heart of the church—worn away over time by riches and consumerism, moral relativism and hyper-secularism—is no longer there.
While the burnt-out church is a metaphor for the role of Christianity in the developed West, the major media coverage of its burning was a performance. Although ostensibly a church—with significance primarily as a house of worship—the main media stories rely on the historical, artistic, and social significance of the cathedral for their gravity.
At the time I write this, for instance, the New York Times headlines on the story had exactly zero religious references. They did mention, of course, the building as “an iconic symbol of the beauty and history of Paris” and “a jewel of Medieval Gothic architecture.”
Yet, despite all of this darkness, what will likely come to be known as simply “the fire” may in fact be a sign of hope, particularly during this Holy Week in advance of Easter. In churches all over the world that will celebrate the Easter vigil on late Saturday night into early Sunday morning this week, for instance, roaring fires will be lit as a sign of God’s grace and power in the midst of a powerful darkness.
It’s a darkness that cannot shut out the light. From those fires many candles will be lit, including the Paschal candle, lit in many churches during special occasions like baptisms and funerals.
The fact that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire took places at the beginning of Holy Week is no accident. Christians know better. An Anglican bishop put it this way yesterday: Christians understand what fire means. It either burns in judgement or purges in healing and preparation for restoration, healing and resurrection. The difference between them is repentance. pic.twitter.com/sAA7rK27Hz

French President Emmanuel Macron has said that Notre Dame de Paris will be rebuilt. But what is it, precisely, that will be rebuilt? Will it essentially be a museum, a mere symbol or repository of the history and beauty of Paris and France? Or will it be something more? Will what comes from the ruins be an actual house of prayer?
Much depends on the response of Christians. St. John the Baptist realized repentance was necessary for those seeking a genuine experience of God. Whether Monday’s fire is one of judgement or one of healing, hope, and restoration will indeed depend on capacity for repentance.
The call for this may need to come from outside the developed West, infected as we are with the kind of social arrogance that makes calls for such repentance something close to absurd. The church is thriving in places like Africa and Asia , and it may take their evangelical zeal to help us see our hubris and need for repentance. Indeed, much of the money collected worldwide for the rebuilding of Notre Dame de Paris will likely come from energetic, faith-filled, exponentially growing numbers of Christians on these two continents.
For what will they be paying? Much like the funders of the original cathedral, they will put their resources into a building they hope will bring people closer to Christ. This holy week, there is more than the usual hope that such goals could actually be realized. In just a few days, Christians will commemorate the fact Jesus’ lifeless body remained in the tomb three days.
On Easter Sunday we will celebrate and even experience the power of God in the raising that body from the dead. For 2,000 years, Jesus’ body has been a metaphor for the church. Christians pray in a special way each Easter that the Body of Christ, the church, may be renewed and vivified through the power of God’s grace. The roaring fire built in the darkness of the Easter vigil is a powerful symbol of that hope even when things appear to be at their worst.
Despite the horrific fire, the altar and pulpit of Notre Dame de Paris survive. Its walls are unmoved. A cross still hangs majestically over the smoking debris. Could Notre Dame de Paris once again be a living, vibrant home for Christ’s body, the church?
Here is an unmistakable invitation to conclude this Lent with a spirit of repentance that will transform what appears to be a terrible defeat and unspeakable tragedy into the means by which a new, living spirit is imbued into what was little more than a lifeless relic of the past. Christians must make the most of the opportunity God has given us to turn what looks like a horrific defeat into a glorious victory.

How The Allied Powers Won The Fight For The Sky In World War II - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/allied-powers-won-fight-sky-world-war-ii/,"April 17, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
To achieve air supremacy in war means to be able to put your assets in the air with the ability to destroy your enemy’s cities, troops, and ability to fight back. In the online course, “The Second World Wars,” Professor Victor David Hanson discusses the technological advances in air power made by German, American, and Japanese forces throughout the course of World World II, and how one side slowly achieved air supremacy.
Before 1941, there was a clear pattern to the victories achieved by German forces. Germany invaded Poland, Denmark, Luxembourg, Holland, Norway, Belgium, France, and Yugoslavia. Each one of these victories was against an unprepared neighbor and a surprise attack. Germany shocked everyone with their sudden domination of European democracies, especially with their success with a new military tactic: blitzkrieg. The blitzkrieg method involved violently and quickly mobilizing forces in the air and on the ground, defeating opponents with series of short attacks.
What we know now is that Germany’s opponents, presumably stunned and alarmed by the attacks, never stopped to evaluate the limitations of Germany’s power, specifically in the air. Could they defeat an enemy in a battle that was not a surprise attack? Could their planes reach the United States? Britain? The answer was no.
The main difference between the Allied powers’ and the Axis powers’ approach to building out their fleet was that the Allies were focused on efficiency, cost, and durability, while the Germans and the Japanese focused on building the biggest and the best weapons. In the long run, the latter proved to create the more accurate and more maneuverable machine in battle, but lacked the support system, the trained pilots, and sheer number of planes in the sky.
Perhaps the biggest strategic mistake Germany made was that they never built a bomber with four engines. Their two-engine bombers — Junkers, Dorniers, and Heinkel models — were first-rate planes, but could not carry more than 5,000 pounds of explosives. A four-engine bomber could carry twice the amount of explosives and travel twice as far as a two-engine.
Meanwhile, the Allied powers were making quantum leaps in technology. Forty percent of the U.S. budget was invested in bombers, fighters, and transport planes. U.S. Army Air Forces developed the B-29 bomber, P-51 fighter, and the jet engine. Of course, their largest impact was participating in the Manhattan Project and the catastrophic atomic bombing on Japan.
As Hanson points out in his book , the Allied bombers took out a significant amount of Germany’s and Japanese’s resources:
German industry was bombed systematically by late 1942, and Japanese factories by late 1944 and 1945. For all the problems with the Allied bombing campaign, no one denied that, in its last months, heavy Allied bombers finally took a terrible toll on Axis aircraft production, transportation, and fuel supplies. The availability of fuel proved the greatest divide between Axis and Allied air power.
Eventually, the Allies bombed the Axis into submission, precluding a land invasion in Japan. Relying on sea power and air power allowed the United States and Britain to avoid the need to land in Europe, unlike the reliance on ground forces in World War I.
Air power did not eliminate fighting on the ground altogether, but it redefined the elements of speed, distance, and geography in military theater. Germany was a much more powerful enemy in WWII than in WWI, yet the Allied forces lost fewer men in the second war (only 2 to 3 percent of their entire military forces, to be exact). It took several years of fighting before Allied forces obtained complete air supremacy, but once they did, it was only a short time before Axis powers were in absolute ruin.

Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal Short Film Is Delusional,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-short-film-is-delusional/,"April 17, 2019 By David Marcus
In a new, seven minute animated video from The Intercept, narrated by and starring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) we are transported, via an NYC to DC bullet train, into the future. It is 2028, and what a world it is. On the downside, Hurricane Sheldon at some point left significant portions of Miami underwater, but on the bright side, former oil workers are planting mangroves under the direction of Native American elders. No, I’m not making this up. Climate change is here + we’ve got a deadline: 12 years left to cut emissions in half.
A #GreenNewDeal is our plan for a world and a future worth fighting for.
How did we get here?What is at stake?And where are we going?

The style of the video is a paintbrush quickly illustrating page after page of the glorious Green New Deal. In fact, we are told, after Democrats take back the Senate and White House in 2020, it will usher in the decade of the Green New Deal, transforming not only the climate, but also, in fact more importantly, the economy. In fact, we are told it will change everything. There will be guaranteed jobs, Medicare for All (promised to be the most popular program of all time), and all the gummy bears you can eat. Okay, I made the last part up.
At the top, we are given a survey course of climate change science over the last 40 years and introduced to the evil oil companies and corrupt politicians who worked to silence the brave scientists. This pretty much brings us to today. The Green New Deal has been proposed, but its too big, too fast, say the naysayers, clearly being chided. As mentioned above, the proponents of the Green New Deal succeed.
The biggest problem, we are told, after the government takes over half the economy is a labor shortage, which kind of makes the guaranteed jobs stuff not make a lot of sense, but whatever. Next we hear about the universal childcare initiative, presumably some situation where the government raises your kid. We find out that “caring for others is valuable, low carbon work.” Okay. Meanwhile every building in America is being retrofitted for renewable energy, a process that would likely expend more carbon than it reduces.
By the end, a young woman from Ocasio-Cortez’s district who apparently in the space of 10 years went from working for AmeriCorps, to becoming an engineer, and then a teacher, successfully runs for Congress in 2028. Guess whose seat she wins? Yep. So where does that leave Ocasio-Cortez? Senator maybe? Who are we kidding; this voiceover from the future is coming straight from the oval office.
I have to admit. This is a great piece of political propaganda. For Republicans. If I was advising a GOP candidate in a swing district, I’d tell them not to run any TV ads but just buy blocks of time to show this bizarre dystopian vision of a country that could not be less like our own. There is no individual ambition. There is no small business. There aren’t even any families. All is provided for by mother state. When you understand that this what the socialists in the Democratic Party really want, it’s actually quite chilling.
What is so great about this short film is how obviously clear it makes it that the Green New Deal is not about climate change. If it were, nuclear energy would play a prominent role. Why doesn’t it? Because nuclear energy doesn’t require the government to take over free markets willy nilly. And that is what the Green New Deal is really all about. This is a video that should be shown far and wide since it unwittingly exposes the folly that is the Green New Deal far better than any of its opponents could ever hope to.

Paul Hollander Explained Why Smart People Support Totalitarianism,thefederalist.com,Alexander Riley,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/paul-hollander-explained-smart-people-support-totalitarianism/,"By Alexander Riley April 18, 2019
One of the 20th century’s greatest scholarly critics of totalitarianism, Paul Hollander, passed away last week. Although the Soviet Union and the Eastern communist bloc fell apart more than a quarter-century ago, we still deeply need thinkers like Hollander, and his loss will be all the more felt because the totalitarians he spent a career analyzing have burrowed so successfully into the very fabric of American institutions and cultural life.
I first read what is arguably Hollander’s chef d’oeuvre , “Political Pilgrims,” as a graduate student in the ’90s. It struck me then (as it still does) as one of the handful of books written by an American sociologist that one can safely say will still be timely in a century. I read many of Hollander’s other books over the years, and he quickly became one of my intellectual heroes.
He was born in Hungary between the two world wars, during the rule of Admiral Horthy, and he witnessed the collapse of the country first into a brief and bloody fascist regime, then post-World War II, into the condition of a vassal state to the Soviet dictatorship. He escaped the country in the wake of the Soviet invasion to crush the 1956 uprising and came to the United States. In short order, he embarked upon the career path of intensively reflecting on the causes of the catastrophes he had seen up close in his country of birth.
I cannot hope to summarize the full breadth of Hollander’s work here, although I have made an effort to do that elsewhere . Perhaps the single most important question Hollander pondered was this: How is it that cultural elites—people whose livelihood depends on a high level of intellectual performance—can so easily and so frequently fall into a form of political identity that involves championing ideas and regimes that produce massive human suffering?
His conclusion was that it is typically the combination of utopian idealism, an unrealistic view of human nature, and a deep resentment at the relative deprivation these radical intellectuals tend to suffer vis-à-vis other elites with less educational (but more economic capital) that explains the phenomenon.
So great is their adherence to the wild-eyed political dreamworld that intoxicates them that such intellectuals will not be deterred by the failure of any particular utopian political project, or indeed by the collapse of the entire global narrative on communism as the human solution to suffering. Just as they moved from Stalin to Mao to Castro to Hugo Chavez, they will find other totalitarian models to venerate when all the communist options are gone, as they seemingly are today. Islamism, Post-Communism?
Paul predicted that after communism collapsed Islamism might well become the next big thing for such utopian intellectuals. Such individuals would find sympathetic the attack on modernity and Western civilization that Islamists mount.
The outrage of Western radical intellectuals at the Danish Mohammed cartoons or the suggestion of some that the staff of Charlie Hebdo got what they deserved demonstrate how right Paul was. His analysis also aids in comprehending the enthusiastic fawning among the intellectual class over far-leftist Muslim activists Linda Sarsour and Ilhan Omar, the sweet-faced Muslim congresswoman from Minnesota who recently referred to the 9/11 attacks in flippant language.
The novelist Michel Houellebecq provided a perfect literary example of the phenomenon Paul catalogued and theorized in his many books and articles. In his recent novel “Submission,” Houellebecq envisions the coming to power of an Islamist regime in France. A central thread in the narrative details how leftist French intellectuals such as the novel’s narrator are brought over to the new regime’s side.
The emergent Islamist leader, Ben Abbes, begins by endlessly flattering the intellectuals, telling them how admirable they are in their intellectual purity and abstraction, and how deserving they are of the material goods of which they are deprived, goods that are hoarded instead by the business class the resentment-filled left intellectuals despises with a visceral fury.
The Islamist regime gives them yet another seamless, simplistic, one-size-fits-all answer, abstract grand system that they can wield in their merciless way to resolve every moral, political, and scientific problem conceivable. Finally, Abbes provides them with a charismatic, strong leader, mouthing always the sweet discourses of “total justice,”“the welfare of the people,”and “the vanquishing of the oppressors,” however cynically.
This last is the most important, Houellebecq knows, and Hollander as well. The leftist utopian intellectuals, despite their flowery talk of egalitarianism and the anarchist need to challenge hierarchy, simply cannot leap quickly enough into line when a Lenin, or a Che Guevara, or a Ben Abbes alerts them that the time has come (at last!) to take up arms (however figuratively) in service of the Great Leader of the People.
It is almost as though intellectuals cannot help but fall under the spell of such men, not in spite of their commitments to abstract reason and independence of thought, but because those commitments are merely empty games they play only because they are denied other, more direct methods for self-assertion. In their deep heart of hearts, they want to be Ben Abbes. Since they cannot, the best they can do is to align themselves with him, and fawningly admire his power.
The list of such intellectuals who aligned themselves with the dictatorial, murderous thug regimes of the 20th century is long and distinguished. Hollander was one of the chief chroniclers and critics of this phenomenon. He is irreplaceable.

Netflix's 'Traitors' Is Hampered By An Ignorant Political Agenda,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/netflixs-traitors-hampered-ignorant-political-agenda/,"April 18, 2019
This review contains many spoilers for season one of “Traitors” on Netflix.
Netflix’s “Traitors” seems to have all the ingredients of a really great television show. It’s a period drama about spies with a dynamic cast and rich characters, the pacing is sharp, and talented writers are contributing to the effort. Unfortunately, “Traitors” made a catastrophic error in execution, taking an ill-researched political stance and building the entire story around it.
The first season unfolds over six episodes, all set to seemingly misfit folk music. It’s the end of World War II and the United Kingdom faces the daunting challenge of recovery in the aftermath of a war that left the victorious but shelled country in financial straits. Feef Symonds (Emma Appleton) is the bright, young, patriotic Brit who had dreamed of a life in the Special Operations Executive (SOE), and readily identifies as a conservative Tory.
Sadly, the end of the war squashed her dreams of danger and espionage in occupied France. Feef is also having an affair with an American soldier named Peter who is empathetic to her disappointment in not being able to serve her country. He introduces her to his mysterious boss, “Rowe” (Michael Stuhlbarg) who offers Feef an opportunity to fight the communists in the impending war with the Soviets by spying on the British government. She happily agrees.
Soon, however, Feef’s beloved Peter meets an untimely end and Feef is left to plod through her new life as a spy without guidance as Rowe is shown to be—wait for it—not quite what he seemed. His gusto for fighting commies seems to be fueled by a blinding obsession with capitalism, which has turned him into a psychopathic monster. Meanwhile, Feef has found love again in a star of the new Labour Party government, Hugh Fenton.
Hugh is initially disgusted by Feef’s conservative ideology and her lack of interest in the new, trendy socialist politics he adores, but softens towards her after they dance at a party. He continues to try to persuade her to join the ultra-liberal postwar generation, and it doesn’t take too much for her to start seeing cracks in her beloved capitalism.
As Rowe becomes more and more unhinged, willing to do anything and kill any person for his love of capitalism, clunky flashbacks show Fenton’s humble transition into socialism as he “saw the light.” By this point it becomes abundantly clear that the show is a disastrous effort to draw parallels between 1945 and 2019, with America cast as the villain in both.
Not only are the communists cast as something other than bad guys, they’re the misunderstood heroes. This is where the previously mysterious folk music begins to make sense. The style of music has long been tied to the socialist Industrial Workers of the World and was quite popular after World War II among communists in many nations.
The show goes completely off the rails near the end, with side characters developing stories about communism saving the world from racism and more evil Americans showing up to torture whomever they need to in the name of greed and power. The older, more conservative members of Parliament are even shown to laugh at the plight of 100,000 stranded Jewish refugees as they meet to discuss the future of Palestine. Only the young, idealistic socialists are shown to have passion for restoring the Jewish homeland.
The conclusion shows that darling Feef failed to learn her lesson, now recruited by her beloved home country to oversee acts of espionage in Israel in the name of protecting British oil interests. Her arc concludes as she clears the way for Operation Embarrassment, an actual declassified act of British spies meant to sabotage ships designated for the passage of Jewish refugees from Italy to Israel.
It certainly was not Britain’s finest hour, but it also not the act of genocide the show might have you believe. Of course, historical accuracy is not always necessary when creating fictional narratives, but suggesting, even vaguely, that the British killed Jewish refugees headed for Israel is fairly egregious.
“Traitors” was created and developed in the United Kingdom by Bathsheba Doran in her first series “created by” credit. Doran previously wrote for shows like “The Looming Tower,” “Masters of Sex,” and “Boardwalk Empire.”
In the show’s haste to make its point, the script faltered, producing a level of dialogue that didn’t rise to the level of high-end television for which Netflix originals have become known. While Feef was played aptly by the relatively unknown Appleton, other performances by older actors like Michael Stuhlbarg felt hallow and broad in their delivery.
Doran’s story in “Traitors” is totally mired by a compulsion to advance a political agenda rooted in ignorance and misunderstanding. What a terrible way to waste a period show about heroes and espionage. Ellie Bufkin is the co-host of the movie podcast ""Flix It"" and a senior contributor to The Federalist.

"Steny Hoyer Said Impeachment ‘Is Not Worthwhile,’ Left-Wingers Freaked",thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/steny-hoyer-said-impeachment-is-not-worthwhile-left-wingers-freaked/,"April 18, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) reacted to the release of the Robert Mueller report on Thursday by arguing impeachment of President Trump “is not worthwhile.” His two-sentence comment to CNN ignited a furor on the left, rankling those who predictably interpreted the report as further cause for impeachment efforts.
“Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,” Hoyer told Dana Bash. “Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgment.”
Hoyer’s apparent signal that Democratic leadership, like most of the rest of the country, is prepared to move on from the special counsel investigation didn’t sit well with a host of anti-Trump commentators. For a sampling of the backlash, see the tweets below. And expect the tension between Democratic leadership and the party’s progressive wing to escalate. This is unbelievably disappointing. Even if you don't ultimately pursue impeachment proceedings, why on Earth would you say this today?

"Mueller Passed The Prosecutorial Buck, Preferring To Slime Trump On Obstruction Rather Than Indict",thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/mueller-passed-prosecutorial-buck-preferring-slime-trump-obstruction-rather-indict/,"By Margot Cleveland April 18, 2019
After two years and spending an estimated $35 million , Robert Mueller issued a 448-page report that ignored the governing special counsel regulations. Those regulations required Mueller, at the conclusion of the special counsel’s work, to “provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.”
Yet, instead of issuing the mandated closing documentation, Mueller explained that his team “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment” of whether “to initiate or decline a prosecution.”
Attorney General William Barr spoke during today’s press conference of Mueller’s failure to perform this regulatorily required duty. When asked why he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein felt it necessary “to take it to the next step to conclude there was no crime,” Barr retorted:
The very prosecutorial function and all our powers as prosecutors, including the power to convene grand juries and compulsory process that’s involved there, is for one purpose and one purpose only. It’s to determine yes or no, was alleged conduct criminal or not criminal. That is our responsibility and that’s why we have the tools we have. And we don’t go through this process just to collect information and throw it out to the public. We collect this information. We use that compulsory process for the purpose of making that decision. And because the special counsel did not make that decision, we felt the department had to. That was a decision by me and the deputy attorney general. Yes.
Notwithstanding Mueller’s professed refusal to render judgment on whether to initiate or decline prosecution, Part 2 of the special counsel’s report served solely to indict President Trump in the court of public opinion by providing detailed factual conclusions that seemingly support obstruction of justice charges—at least based on the special counsel’s view of the law.
But Mueller’s view is decidedly wrong. Prior to his appointment, Barr decimated the obstruction of justice theory of criminal liability Mueller relies upon in the special counsel report.
Further, while Democrats and the media will put Barr’s view down to bias, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein agreed with those conclusions. Rosenstein, who supposedly floated the 25th Amendment as a basis to out the president, is anything but biased in favor of the president. Rosenstein appointed Mueller, and Rosenstein, who flanked Barr during the press conference, agreed with Barr’s conclusion that no crime had occurred.
Many believe lead special counsel prosecutor Andrew Weissmann instigated the non-indictment indictment of Trump in Mueller’s report. The modus operandi is just too perfect.
Recall that Weissmann led the Enron task force and served as the lead prosecutor in the Department of Justice’s case against Arthur Anderson. Weissmann secured a conviction against the former accounting giant, shuttered the firm, and left tens of thousands of innocent employees without jobs. Then , “three years later, the Supreme Court reversed the Andersen conviction in a unanimous decision, holding that Andersen’s conduct was not criminal, and it ‘was shocking how little criminal culpability the jury instructions required.’”
Weissmann’s attempts to convict Merrill Lynch executives of non-crimes were likewise swatted down in court. And then there was Weissmann’s questionable conduct during those trials, which emails indicate included threatening witnesses.
Even if Weissmann holds responsibility for pushing to include the obstruction of justice analysis, Mueller approved the final report that pontificated on Trump’s potential criminal conduct, while refusing to make a decision to initiate or decline charges. Ironically, in justifying his non-decision, Mueller claimed any other outcome would be unfair to the president. From the special counsel’s report:
We determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusations is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongfully accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator. The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor’s accusations of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequence that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice.
But Trump has no process now to clear his name from the taint of obstruction of justice created by Mueller’s report. So, after two years of battling unjust and untrue charges of collusion with Russia, Mueller has destined President Trump to spend the second half of his first term combating claims of obstruction of justice—claims which, even if they had a basis in fact, have no basis in law.

The Bombshell In The Mueller Report Is Russia’s Social Media Campaign,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/the-bombshell-in-the-mueller-report-is-russias-social-media-campaign/,"By David Marcus April 18, 2019
It’s over. The Mueller Report is upon us and it says what Attorney General William Barr said it would say. Nobody in the Trump campaign—in fact, no American citizen at all—colluded or conspired with the Russian government to impact the 2016 election. This is obviously good news for the country and a vindication for the president who has protested his innocence quite vociferously from the beginning.
But the findings of the report were not unalloyed good news. In one area, in particular, Mueller found deeply troubling activities from the Russians. The section on Russia’s informational campaign using social media to influence the election is damning and shocking. Much of the information it presents was already known, but seen summarized by Mueller, what they achieved was astounding.
Conducted by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian government-backed social media troll farm, the extent and reach of the operations is astounding. Collectively, the report says, “The IRA’s social media accounts reached 10s of millions of US persons.” It also controlled Facebook groups such as “United Muslims of America,” that had 300,000 followers when it was shut down in 2017.
In total the report says that at least 29 million and perhaps as many as 126 million people were reached by the propaganda campaigns. The danger of this is not merely that the propaganda might help determine the outcome of viewers’ voting decisions. What is far worse is that, on that scale, the Russians can make fringe, divisive positions and rhetoric appear to Americans to be, if not mainstream, at least vastly more prominent than they really are.
Even the news media was not immune to these efforts. The report outlines that on multiple occasions “U.S. media outlets also quoted tweets from IRA-controlled accounts and attributed them to the reactions of real U.S. persons.” It is very possible, if not likely that the real target of the IRA was not to sway an election, but rather to sow discord and distrust among Americans. And it looks like the news media was an unwitting accomplice.
Sometimes IRA social media operations even reached beyond the screen and into real life. Dozens of rallies, some of which had hundreds of attendees, were organized by the IRA. Their sinister scheme involved creating well-followed interest groups on Facebook (on either side of the political spectrum) and then announcing a live event. Group followers who showed interest were then contacted and made event coordinators. Unbeknownst to the coordinators, or the attendees, their rally was really a Russian propaganda put-up job.
All of this should shock Americans, especially since Russia is not the only country engaged in these kinds of social media informational attacks. I wrote in June of last year, after attending the National Security Seminar at the Army War College, that the military and defense department take these attacks incredibly seriously and that they are incredibly difficult to defend against. At the time I wrote:
“While an ultimate good, freedom of speech is also a dangerous hole in our ability to defend against the growing threat of propaganda operations. Our primary foreign adversaries—Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea—are all repressive regimes vastly more capable of defending against propaganda. If speech is being used to sow division and discord in those nations, they just squash it. They shut down websites, close newspapers, and even kill journalists. These are defensive options that thankfully our government cannot use.”
Since the government has little leverage, that leaves it to the social media companies themselves to police their content for foreign political interference, but as congressional testimony from the heads of Facebook and Twitter has shown, these companies have no earthly idea how to do it. When asked, they tend to mumble something about the potential of artificial intelligence to someday weed out bad actors.
The situation is not good and there do not seem to be any optimal solutions. In any sane political time we would see a bipartisan effort to create new approaches to defend against foreign social media informational attacks. But our current political divisions are making this impossible. Both sides share some blame for this.
Democrats, with their wild and irresponsible promises of collusion between Trump and Russia, set expectations so high that Trump being cleared of collusion makes the information campaign seem like small potatoes. Meanwhile, Trump and too many Republicans have downplayed the attacks as a mere excuse for why Hillary Clinton lost. Now that the Mueller report is out and Trump has been cleared, both sides should be able to move to the center and accept the true nature of Russian interference—but that won’t happen.
Instead, Democrats will continue to try to catch the great orange whale, this time with a harpoon of obstruction. Reasonable people may or may not be able to agree if obstruction took place but, even if it did, Trump has not been charged so the only recourse would be congressional investigation and potential impeachment. Meanwhile, the actual threat remains lost behind the sound and fury of allegations against the president.
Now is the time for good actors on both sides—Marco Rubio or Mitt Romney (who knows about the threat Russia poses, if you recall) on the right, and perhaps people like Joe Manchin or Chris Coons on the left—to bring attention to, and seek solutions to, the problem of Russian social media informational attacks.
But some of the responsibility also falls on us, the citizens of the United States. Know that the awful anonymous tweet you see might just be foreign propaganda. Don’t assume the worst about those with whom you disagree. Because that is exactly what Russia has been trying to make you do, and in far too many cases, they’ve been succeeding.

The Full Mueller Report Was Just Released. Read It Here,thefederalist.com,Sean Davis,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/full-mueller-report-just-released-read/,"April 18, 2019 By Sean Davis
The much anticipated final report from special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed in 2017 to investigate whether Donald Trump treasonously colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, was finally released on Thursday morning. You can download Volume I and Volume II of Mueller’s report here and here , respectively.
At a Thursday press conference ahead of the full Mueller report’s release, Barr said that Mueller’s investigation and report “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
“The Special Counsel found no collusion by any Americans” in the efforts of Russians to interfere in the 2016 election or hack the e-mail accounts of top Hillary Clinton aides or the Democratic National Committee, he added.
“[T]here was no evidence of Trump campaign ‘collusion’ with the Russian government’s hacking,” Barr said.
The attorney general also said Mueller’s investigation failed to establish that Trump obstructed justice.
“After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,” Barr said.
“[T]he White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims,” he said. “And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation.”
The release of Mueller’s report brings to a close a sprawling, multi-year and multi-million dollar investigation that in the end concluded the president did not illegally conspire with Russia or act as a secret agent of Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign. The release of the report followed years of frenzied speculation and conspiracy theory-mongering about Trump’s alleged Kremlin connections.
Much of the hysteria was fueled by a so-called dossier from retired foreign spy Christopher Steele, who was jointly funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The salacious and unverified allegations in Steele’s collection of dossiers against Trump were then used as a primary basis by the Obama administration to spy on Trump campaign affiliate Carter Page. Despite the fact that the dossier was used in 2016 to justify spying on private American citizens, none of its major allegations have been verified, while many of its central claims have been thoroughly debunked .
Barr testified before the Senate last week that he planned to investigate whether the 2016 spying operation against Trump and his presidential campaign was proper and lawful. He also said an ongoing investigation of the matter by the Department of Justice’s inspector general would likely be concluded in May or June of this year.
“I believe that the publicly released report will allow every American to understand the results of the Special Counsel’s investigation,” Barr concluded at his press conference on the full Mueller report.

"Austin, Texas ‘School Climate Survey’ Tells Students ‘Gender Is How A Person Feels’",thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/austin-texas-school-climate-survey-tells-students-gender-person-feels/,"By Joy Pullmann April 18, 2019
A survey given to all Austin Independent School District students in grades 3-11 this spring told children “Sex is what a person is born. Gender is how a person feels.” It then asked students to select whether they feel they are a “girl/woman,”“boy/man,” or “identify in some other way.” That was followed by a blank box for students to “describe how you identify.”
The Federalist obtained a copy of the survey through an open records request. The full survey is here , and a screenshot of the gender identity question below.
An AISD Student Climate Survey, which included the question this year, has been administered every year to students in grades 3-11 since the 2003-04 school year, district spokeswoman Samantha Alexander told me by email. Texas’s fifth-largest district supervises more than 83,000 children, according to federal data . Assuming an even distribution across grade levels, that means some 57,000 children took this survey this year.
The survey includes other response statements and questions such as “At my school, some students are treated unfairly because of who they are,”“At my school, there is respect for different cultures,” and “Do you ever feel unwelcome at school?” It is used “to examine factors contributing to student success beyond test scores,” Alexander wrote. Its primary authors were Lisa Schmitt and Karen Cornetto, said the district’s open records office, who are no longer listed on the district’s employee directory .
Yet “whether it’s comprehensive sex education or a survey, if you’re bringing stuff like that [sexuality] up you are potentially creating upset or conflict or just planting the idea” in young minds that may not be developmentally ready for it, said pediatrician and education researcher Karen Effrem in a phone interview about Austin’s survey. Research suggests that simply asking questions about specific behaviors, such as teen suicide or drug use, increases those behaviors.
The ill-defined subject matter of “school climate surveys” justifies asking any number of personal questions under the guise of assessing student feelings, and this practice is growing nationwide, not just in Austin. Many times, parents have no idea their children will be asked questions like this until after it happens, because they sign blanket approvals for such evaluations at the beginning of every school year. It’s Not Just Austin, It’s Everybody
School climate surveys like Austin’s received a boost from the Republican-re-engineered Every Student Succeeds Act, the most comprehensive federal law regarding K-12. It updated No Child Left Behind in 2015. The revamp included allowing states to show “accountability” to the federal government on non-objective criteria such as children’s “socioemotional learning” (SEL).
So ESSA expanded No Child Left Behind’s much-detested mandates for testing children on academics into encouraging evaluations of children’s non-academic behaviors and feelings. Such soft measures are known as the “fifth indicator ” in agreements between states and the federal government that keep federal subsidies flowing to K-12 schools. Special interest groups are using ESSA as a wedge to push schools into expanding school climate surveys.
Non-academic school climate questions on students’“mindset” and “motivations” were added to the National Assessment of Educational Progress starting in 2017, the most reliable indicator of U.S. K-12 achievement over time also known as the Nation’s Report Card. Its various subtests are administered every spring in every school district in the nation. The NAEP’s governing law clearly states that the tests may not “evaluate or assess personal or family beliefs,” but it appears that provision is being skirted.
NAEP’s 12th grade school climate survey, for example, asked , “How often do you talk about things you have studied in school with someone in your family?” It also asked students to describe beliefs about themselves such as how hard they work and whether they like various aspects about school, and who lives in their home (i.e., a stepparent, mom’s boyfriend, etc.). Its fourth grade climate survey asked nine-year-olds to identify themselves as members of a specific race or ethnicity, their perception of their work ethic, and happiness and interest in school.
The eighth grade climate survey attached to the 2018 civics exam asks students to reveal whether they have their own bedroom, a smartphone, and a family clothes dryer. It also asks students to write their ZIP codes, and whether 13-year-olds think “I have good ideas for programs and projects that would help solve problems in my community.” And it asks how often the children “Discuss current political events or issues with others (for example, people in my home or friends)” and “Read about current political events in the media.”
The NAEP 2019 pilot test in reading asked eighth graders whether “I felt awkward and out of place at school” and “I felt my teachers treated me fairly.” That probably describes almost every eighth grader ever. Probes Pushed By Special Interests, Federal Government
Schools are also beginning to monitor students’ emotions at the behest of school safety initiatives, both local and federal, including an approach known as Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports. “ESSA contains multiple provisions that affect early-childhood standards and curricula, and those provisions encourage and in some cases mandate inclusion of SEL,” says a 2019 Pioneer Institute report .
Special interest groups have been pushing for variations on the SEL idea for decades on the basis that schools can and should substitute for parents in shaping children’s character traits, social dispositions, and feelings. “One 2017 study by a pro-SEL organization estimated that K–12 public-school systems spend approximately $640 million each year on specific programming and practices designed to instill SEL,” the Pioneer report says. “Teachers also reported that they spend about eight percent of their time on SEL, which would translate into another $30 billion annual investment.”
The report notes that the nationwide growth in similar initiatives has been driven by federal involvement in education, codified earliest in President Bill Clinton’s Goals 2000 legislation in 1994, and deepening in every subsequent federal education law. Austin was a relatively early adopter of this education trend, and partners with the major SEL advocacy organization, CASEL (formerly the Collaborative to Advance Social and Emotional Learning), to increase its use in classrooms. CASEL receives federal funds.
One of CASEL’s board members leads a federally funded Common Core testing organization, called Smarter Balanced. Common Core itself contains requirements that schools assess students on nonacademic measures such as “cooperation” and “persistence.” Schools often incorporate these kinds of requirements by politicizing curriculum, such as this example the Pioneer report gives of Common Core-compliant curriculum in Utah: “students use their voices to advocate solutions to social problems that they care deeply about. They are involved in learning…social advocacy.” Unreliable Surveys Waste Tax Dollars and Kids’ Time
One of the major problems with relying on semi-psychological assessments like these school climate surveys is that they are extremely unreliable, said Effrem, the Pioneer report’s coauthor, in a phone interview.
“Even surveys and psychological screenings and things that are done by psychiatrists, highly trained psychiatrists, have enormously high false positive rates,” she said. “A lot of the self-report surveys are prone to bias and prone to the kids answering the way they think they should answer… So I don’t really care who does the survey, having them done at all and dealing with really controversial or subjective topics like feeling safe or gender identity, just isn’t a good idea.” Very little reliable evidence underlies what essentially amounts to experiments upon U.S. kids.
A meta-analysis study often cited by socioemotional monitoring proponents examined 213 studies on the topic spanning 270,034 students. It found the vast majority of so-called SEL research did not examine such programs’ effects on students’ academic achievement, “there is no standardized approach in measuring social and emotional skills,” and that ” Only a few studies tested and found a temporal relationship between [SEL] skill enhancement and other positive outcomes.”
Self-reported information, the dominant mode of information collection in psychological assessment, is well-known to be extremely unreliable. That is likely one of many factors contributing to the scientific replication crisis that acutely affects the field of psychology. In approximately the past five years, nearly every scientific domain has been up-ended by the discovery that thousands of research findings, even those that had reached the level of “settled science,” could not be reproduced when the studies were re-run.
Education research was also long known to be substandard , politicized , and biased even before the replication crisis was discovered. Thus, very little reliable evidence underlies what essentially amounts to experiments upon U.S. kids using U.S. tax dollars and precious moments that could instead be devoted to better instruction. Still the tax dollars, platitudes, and federal programs flow on, unchecked by reality. Schools as Referral Centers for Government Programs
It’s hard to escape the conclusion that none of this is really promoting the goals publicly proclaimed for such initiatives, such as helping children.
“School climate surveys are basically being used to justify more money for subjective social-emotional stuff, whether it’s software or teaching, professional development, whatever, and data collection that is profiling kids,” Effrem said. “If you do these school climate surveys and they then say ‘We have to be mentally screening these kids,’ it will lead to a rash, as experts have admitted, of kids being referred for psychiatric evaluation and treatment when they don’t need it.”
Conveniently, many public employees and mental health “experts'” job security is only increased by labeling more children with psychological problems, and possibly increasing psychological problems by exposing children to identity-destabilizing material such as the false idea that gender is merely a feeling untethered to any biological reality. Research and parents’ experiences with rapid-onset gender dysphoria in teens supports the theory that increased exposure to sexual politics increases children’s transgender identification.
And since federal taxpayers sponsor health care for one-third of the nation’s children, through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the more children labeled as having mental problems and referred for related government services, the more it appears the nation “needs” these programs. It’s a win-win for people with political agendas, and a lose-lose for parents, taxpayers, and children.

Why Only Cultural Reactionaries Would Rebuild Notre Dame,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/cultural-reactionaries-rebuild-notre-dame/,"By Sumantra Maitra April 18, 2019
The scenes of black smoke and the burning, collapsing spire of the Notre Dame Cathedral looked like a scene from the apocalypse—the collapse of civilization itself, like a Thomas Cole painting . It was the symbol of France as the central empire of Europe, le gloire of the greatest of powers to defend the frontiers of what used to be known as the Christendom for centuries. It was a testament of time that stood the Hundred Years’ War, one of the darkest revolutions in human history, Napoleonic hegemony, and both world wars, brought down by what essentially was human incompetence and indifference.
For years, Notre Dame was underfunded, a security risk, and ignored by the powers that be: petty humans who were more interested in their petty squabbles over who lords over which piece of land, what warning sign should be where over which beverage, which dating app one should use, and how many calories one should consume.
But there were also signs of hope. As our eyes in Europe were transfixed on the television screen, random masses of patriotic French men and women, of different skin color and origin but bound by a common sense of purpose, kneeled in front of the statuettes singing “Ave Maria ,” a visual that was not as much a sign of defiance, as after every single terror attack, but a symbol of grateful submission to the unknown.
Things can get a lot worse. The firefighters who heroically fought the inferno to save the Holy Crown—the burned but not destroyed husk of a structure from the 12th century that stood within the imposing hall—almost involuntarily bowing before a glowing cross, and the miraculously untouched Rosace. Nothing can explain what saved it, other than a sheer miracle.
Notre Dame means Our Lady. The Judeo-Christian values that shaped Western civilization and the Western canon are there in every molecule of air one breathes in Europe. It seeps through, and it was visible in front of Notre Dame in the masses of people praying and singing. When all sense of rationality fails during an unexpected catastrophe, faith, and a sense of community and belonging, are the only things that give us hope.
Ben Shapiro was correct in stating that if one needs to rebuild society, one needs to see what holds it together in the first place. The reactions to the Notre Dame fire were predictable. I refuse to give them any more publicity than they already are clamoring for, but there were tweets saying that the hysteria over this destruction of one of the greatest representations of human endurance was uncalled for, because people didn’t die, because there are other cathedrals, and because Flint doesn’t have clean water.
Most of these people, for those of you wondering, are born and brought up in the West, products of our times. What’s with all the wailing — like, chill dude!
It’s an abhorrent idea that art, beauty, architecture, religion, literature, cathedrals, and statues do not matter, but it is also wholly understandable. This is what individualism looks like; no one can see the greater good. Is this tragedy affecting me directly, or corroborating my deeply held political and philosophical beliefs? No, therefore mourning it is meaningless and ultimately irrelevant. There’s no common dream, hope, or loyalty to anything.
What good is a fresco drawn by Michelangelo, compared to 700 toilets that could have been built with the same money? After all, Notre Dame is the symbol of everything that modern education teaches us to hate; it is Euro-Christian, and therefore supposedly predicated on racism, sexism, and conservative social hierarchy.
This is the logical end game of Rawlsian liberalism, the rationalist utilitarian strain of thought that permeated society since the Enlightenment, only to be kept at bay by bouts of reaction. It sees nothing beyond temporal emoting of a narcissistic self. It worships no selfless sacrifice, no virtues, no duty. Everything is predicated on utility—and therefore economics.
In their odes to enlightenment, our modern saints of the Church of Humanist Liberalism often forget that there was no single phenomenon called the Enlightenment. In fact, timeless creations from Caravaggio to Chopin, Samuel Taylor Coleridge to George Chambers, are often the products of reaction. One might not remember Justin Bieber 200 years from now. One would still remember Lord Byron’s “The Curse of Minerva,” or Bach’s “St. Matthew’s Passion.”
“Anguish over the decline of civilization is the affliction of a reactionary,” Nicholas Davila wrote, “the democrat cannot lament the disappearance of something of which he is ignorant.” Civilization cannot last without unity of purpose, a common cause or sense of solidarity, and reverence for righteous hierarchy, that there are causes and feelings greater than individuals. Without order there is chaos, and nothing is a surefire recipe for disorder than unchecked hyper-individualism. We don’t realize what we have, but we will miss it when it is gone.
Why would your neighbor go to war for you—or for your country—if you cannot even agree that a cathedral that stood for more than 900 years is a testament of joint history and civilizational legacy, and not some misplaced eyesore reminder of the so-called “Dark Ages”? It’s ironic that what the liberal rationalists call the Dark Ages gave us Notre Dame and Westminster Abbey. What do we seek to conserve now and leave for our future generations to marvel at? Where’s the Colosseum of our age? Who will paint “ The Ninth Wave ” of our times?
The art, literature, and music of our time does not revere divinity or beauty anymore, due to relativism. Our supposedly enlightened class considers graffiti in South London to be equal (or better) art than “Orpheus and Eurydice” painted by Peter Paul Ruben. What will we be remembered as a civilization for, other than the individual brilliance of a handful of prodigious men and women of science?
I am far from being religious. But I live in the heart of the West, and if longing for classical Western canon makes me a reactionary, I’ll gladly accept that.
I didn’t get to see Notre Dame as it was, unfortunately, but my parents did. And I hope for the sake of humanity that France rebuilds it, with the help of the world, so I can visit at the first opportunity. For what is the purpose of civilization if not the creation and preservation of timeless beauty and transcendent grandeur for posterity?

Sports Writer Jeff Pearlman Compares Having More Than Two Kids To Tossing Garbage Into The Ocean,thefederalist.com,Georgi Boorman,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/sports-writer-jeff-pearlman-compares-two-kids-tossing-garbage-ocean/,"By Georgi Boorman April 18, 2019
Sports author and podcaster Jeff Pearlman casually floated the idea of population control on Twitter on Monday: “Just saw a Tweet from a guy I know, announcing how excited he and his wife are to be having child No. 6. Does there come a point when, in the name of earth’s survival and limited resources, we’re allowed to say, ‘Hmm. I dunno, man …'”
No, let’s not share in the joy of acquaintances who are blessing the world with another child. Let’s leverage our indubitable wisdom on climatology and public policy to proclaim “earth’s survival and limited resources” are at stake and question whether they are doing the responsible thing.
Oh, but he didn’t stop there. When a Twitter user named Lisa clapped back with, “As a mom of 6 kids, I’m gonna say no,” our erudite intellectual thoughtfully responded, “Serious Q, Lisa–why? Earth truly can’t sustain this. Not hypothetical, factual.” He then went on to say the estimable Jeff Pearlman-approved number of children to have is, “I dunno. 2?”
Lisa objected, leaning on demographers’ projections that the world population will peak before the end of the 21st century. “I think it’s a slippery slope to start telling people how many kids they can or can’t have. My body, my choice.”
But Chairman Pearlman of the People’s Republic of Know-It-Alls would not be swayed. “It bothers me when people tell me not to throw my garbage in the ocean. My garbage, my choice.” Population Control Leads to Horrible Policies
The fecundophobia of some members of the American elite has blossomed into full-blown hatred. Around this time last year, comedian Nikki Glaser tweeted “Don Jr. and his wife have FIVE kids. No one should be having five kids. Why are people still allowed to have 5 kids?”
In general, many people in the mainstream feel comfortable dehumanizing and devaluing babies and children, which is why tweets like Pearlman’s (which oddly equates people having as many kids as they want with people throwing garbage in the ocean whenever they want) and Glaser’s must be roundly refuted.
If calling out dangerous, immoral opinions on Twitter were ever cheap sport for pundits with time on their hands, it isn’t anymore. The fact that children born alive after abortions can literally, legally be treated as garbage in the state of New York now should not be lost on you. The fact that 232 Democrats in the House of Representatives have refused to even vote on ensuring all children born alive are treated as children, not garbage, should not be lost on you, either.
If there are a few voices at the back croaking weakly in protest, we can’t hear them over the fascist chants for government to regulate anything and everything in the name of the climate “crisis,” up to and including our own bodies (ironic, for the “my body my choice” crowd).
I wonder if aspiring Population Czar Pearlman realizes how many people have been violated and killed based on exactly the policy he’s referring to in the name of “sustainability.” Would you like to know how many people in India were forcibly sterilized out of fear of a population “bomb” that never existed ? Around 8 million men and women.
Would you like to know how many people are missing from the Chinese population due to their one-child policy (now a two-child policy)? An estimated 300 million. More than 20 million Chinese people were sterilized in 1983 alone. Families pregnant with an unauthorized child have been threatened with exorbitant fines they couldn’t possibly afford, thus forcing them to seek abortions or literally pay the price.
In 1990, when a small town protested after the Chinese government violently ripped 250 children from the wombs of their mothers, officials sent an army to occupy the territory. The villagers’ armed resistance triggered what is known as the Barren Massacre—the indiscriminate slaughter of hundreds by the People’s Liberation Army (another bitter pill of irony). We know that forced abortions and sterilizations are still occurring on 1 million mostly Uyghur captives held in internment camps in China, according to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Autonomy Onslaught, Here We Come
The radical environmentalists who ceaselessly lobby government for a turn at the levers of power have never been interested in preserving your autonomy. Every natural human right, including the right to procreation and the right to life itself, must bow down to Nature as god.
There has never been such a thing as effective mass population control without violating the rights of the individual, and there never will be. Solutions range from heavy taxation to biological warfare . Celebrated playwright George Bernard Shaw pleaded for a “ humane gas ” that would kill “instantly and painlessly” to cleanse the population of those who “cannot pull [their] own weight.” But even something as relatively anodyne as per-child taxation is a strike at the knees of all who would not submit to the desanctification of individual human life.
It’s no wonder we’re having to refute ignorant Twitterati who compare children to garbage when people as supposedly enlightened as bioethicists have claimed that “the life of a newborn baby is of less value than the life of a pig, a dog, or a chimpanzee.” I wonder if Pearlman and Peter Singer ever slouch in overstuffed armchairs, puffing cigar smoke and egotism into each other’s faces as they wax poetic about the golden days of eugenics and the blatant attempts to keep the poor and the “unfit” from breeding. You know, that heyday of the early 20th century when 60,000 Americans were sterilized ? Sports, social hygiene—interchangeable disciplines, really.
That’s where we’re really heading, aren’t we? Why would we indiscriminately limit children from every family when we could do so much good for the planet if we uprooted the “weeds” from the garden of society and kept them from breeding. Wait a minute, that sounds familiar.
Ah yes, we’ve heard that from population-control fanatic Margaret Sanger , founder of Planned Parenthood. In the born-alive debate, the left is already leaning almost exclusively on the false notion that all late-term abortions not directly related to maternal health are of fetuses “incompatible with life.” Unfit , you might say. “Lebensunwertes Leben .” It’s almost like some of them haven’t left that awful genetic supremacist ideology behind or something. The World Isn’t Ending, and Neither Should Families
All this death and oppression building like a violent storm on the horizon is supposedly justified by science, but it’s mostly echo chamber dogma put forth by people whose predictions pretty much always fail to come true. As David Harsanyi has pointed out, sea levels did not rise 20 feet in the 14 years since “An Inconvenient Truth” (nor did they even rise one foot), a billion people did not die of starvation due to overpopulation, and farming hasn’t collapsed due to increased temperatures. Instead, we are more prosperous than ever. Extreme poverty has been cut in half in the last two decades.
The real kicker is, American fertility is already below replacement rate and, in fact, sits at a 30-year low. If this trend continues, we won’t be able to sustain this nation’s massive welfare state because we won’t have enough workers to generate payouts to the old.
If we’re going to keep our sacrosanct entitlement system intact, then whose lives are authorized for neglect now? Whose lives will be devalued for the “greater good”? All those vulnerable senior citizens tucked away in long-term care facilities, who are already getting the message they’re better off dead.
You see, whether the fertility rate goes up or down, whether the overall temperature ticks up or down, the problem isn’t the flawed science so much as the perverted morality that promotes the abuse and murder of individuals in the name of some greater collective goal, for which the science seems all too often just a means to that end.
You don’t get to a point of suggesting population control and comparing babies to garbage just by believing the earth has a fever. You get there by denying that humans are made in the image of God and that their rights derive from Him, not the government.
That’s why refuting bad methodology and cautioning against tenuous conclusions, as important as they are, is not enough to stop the onslaught against the sanctity of human life. There will always be another excuse, another crisis. A crisis doesn’t determine our morality, our morality determines how we deal with a crisis. Maybe Pearlman should take a seat on the bench until he gets his head around this basic rule of civilized society."
Airbnb’s Anti-West Bank Policy Shows Why Laws Against BDS Matter,thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/airbnbs-anti-west-bank-policy-shows-laws-bds-matter/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein April 18, 2019
Want to fight The Man? If you’re too young to have fought for civil rights, you’ve got the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement (BDS).
BDSers wrap themselves in the cloak of justice, but their high-minded rhetoric quickly devolves into hate, because at bottom, stigmatizing democratic Israel isn’t hopeful. BDS is a high-stakes game of pressure that affects individual students , performing artists , and corporations, as the movement pursues a long game of destroying Israel . As Airbnb learned when they sided with the BDS bullies last year, it’s not necessarily a wise business decision. Airbnb’s Politicized Decision about West Bank
Last November, Airbnb made headlines when they announced that, after consulting with various experts, they would de-list approximately 200 properties in Jewish communities within Israel’s Judea and Samaria regions, better known stateside as the West Bank. The company’s rationale was that these locations “are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.”
On its face, this was an odd move for a business. An American for-profit corporation that serves private, paying customers went out of its way to take sides in one of the world’s most sensitive and emotional political disputes. In response, lawsuits were filed on behalf of affected hosts, would-be hosts, and travelers.
The San Francisco legal complaint made the case that Airbnb acted in response to pressure from the BDS movement and its allies — the groundwork for which the United Nations helped lay . Now, Airbnb denied supporting “the BDS movement, any boycott of Israel, or any boycott of Israeli companies” last November. However, that’s not how it looked to either supporters or detractors of that policy, all of whom read the situation as Airbnb taking sides in the BDS battle.
Airbnb reversed itself last week. So, the company will not de-list the relevant properties, and an Airbnb spokesman told The Federalist that associated profits will be directed to a still unnamed nonprofit organization that is not connected to either Israeli or Palestinian issues.
In a call with The Federalist, Rabbi Abraham Cooper , the associate dean and director of global social action agenda at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, observed, “Whatever Airbnb thought they were going to achieve by making this move, what they were doing was emboldening those who want to punish Israel for real and imaginary sins and singularly call it out time and again for isolation.”
That action led to strong, real-world reactions for the company. Beyond the lawsuits, Politico Pro noted that Airbnb “was also blacklisted by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet because the plan appeared to support a boycott on Israel.” This matters because Florida is both populous and a popular tourist destination. Florida also represents only one of the 27 states that currently have state laws enabling governments to avoid working with companies that boycott Israel.
Airbnb declined to comment on why they changed course—whether it was the threat of legal action, financial loss, state-level anti-BDS legislation, or simply a recognition that they’d erred—but the shift was likely fueled by some combination of those factors. This underscores the importance of fighting BDS on all fronts: legal, legislative, financial, and in the court of public opinion.
Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, who participated in the Delaware suit against Airbnb, emailed, “Other international companies need to learn the lessons from Airbnb’s mistake and understand that boycotting Israel and discriminating against Jews are unlawful acts which will ultimately result in dire legal consequences, public condemnations and embarrassment.”
Hopefully, Airbnb’s about-face will inspire other companies to think twice before bending to BDS, which Cooper describes as “a top tier concern of world Jewry.” But as far as deterrents go, this episode highlights the urgency of enacting anti-BDS laws not only at the state level, but also at the federal one. Legislation Can Help
The Senate passed anti-BDS legislation when they adopted Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s S. 1 in January. S. 1 bundled four Middle East-related bills. One of those four bills was the Combating BDS Act of 2019 , which allows state and local governments, as well as employee benefit plan staff, to avoid doing business with—that is, giving public dollars to—companies that boycott Israel.
By contrast, U.S House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has not been eager to pass the House’s companion bill, H.R. 336 , “Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act of 2019.” To catalyze forward motion, Reps. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) and David Kustoff (R-TN) initiated a parliamentary maneuver to force consideration of the bill last week. If this discharge petition garners 218 votes, Pelosi would have to introduce the bill. According to Politico Pro, “All 197 Republicans are sure to sign on, which means 21 Democratic signatures are needed.”
In another year, finding 21 Democrats willing to support pro-Israel legislation should have been a cakewalk. However, 2019 is not any old year. Given Democrats’ internal ferment over Israel, Pelosi does not want to touch this bill.
Of course, there’s nothing in the bill that should be controversial. Regardless, S. 1 became a political hot potato among Senate Democrats precisely because of its anti-BDS provision,. With an eye on Democratic primary voters, all of the Senate’s Democratic presidential aspirants, save Amy Klobuchar, voted against it.
BDS is not an issue that allows for splitting the baby. As Darshan-Leitner noted, “BDS is an anti-Semitic campaign which purports to care about human rights but whose real goal is to completely replace the Jewish State with a Palestinian one.” That’s the shell game, in a nutshell. So those who oppose BDS should oppose the movement vigorously.
For those at home who want to help repel BDS, here are two suggestions: First, if you live in one of the 23 states that currently lacks an anti-BDS law, ask your state representatives and governor to change that. Second, keep your eye on the House. Call your member of Congress and make sure he or she signs this discharge petition, especially if you’re represented by a self-identified pro-Israel Democrat. Now is the time for those representatives to prove it.
