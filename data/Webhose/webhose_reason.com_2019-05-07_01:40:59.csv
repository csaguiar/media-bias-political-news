I mean, Damore got fired from Google for holding a view of biology that probably 70% of Americans hold, but that didn't stop Google from getting rid of him as fast as they could to make the publicity go away."

I don't think that group heuristics are any deeper in our tribal bones than any other heuristics we commonly use. The interesting question - though it has a pretty obvious answer - is : how did those heuristics get into our bones in the first place ?
Self-assesment is one of humanitie's greatest powers, and we would do well to apply it to such.
It is easy to become arrogant and imagine that what we consciously analyse is all that is important. But it isn't - which is where the bones come in. Bones, like conscious analysis, are by no means infallible - particularly as we live in an environment that is significantly different from the ones in which our bones evolved. But a man who consistently scoffs at what his bones tell him is a fool. The same sort of fool as imagines that twenty minutes thought from his own head will come to a wise answer that has escaped all the other people who've been thinking about it for twenty years.
I like to align with virtue more than utility
A path with many blind alleys."

You can never read 1984 Part 3, Chapter 3 enough. O'Brien explains the Modern Left.

The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.
Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?'"
