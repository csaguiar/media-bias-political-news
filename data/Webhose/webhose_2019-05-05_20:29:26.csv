Kamala Harris Misses Vote on California Disaster Relief to Campaign for President | Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,putalito,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/05/kamala-harris-misses-vote-on-california-disaster-relief-to-campaign-for-president/#post-89,"Gavin Newsom's recent directive to stop capital punishments in California was designed to prop up Kamala Harris' candidacy for President. The big blemish on Harris' record is the fact that she refused to ask for the death penalty for a cop killing gangster, back when Newsom was Mayor and Harris was District Attorney. That's the reason he decided to abolish the death penalty- to help Kamala Harris look mainstream, and therefore more electable."

The original ban grandfathered magazines that were purchased prior to the year 2000. What kind of mags were available back then? No PMAGs, probably no 60 round drums, etc, which means that being in possession of a modern magazine was easily prosecutable. If the recently purchased mags are grandfathered as well, then it is no longer possible for the state to prove anything. Can anyone tell the difference between a PMAG that was purchased this week and one that was purchased a month or a year ago, or will be purchased a year from now? Nicely played, Judge Benitez. I wish more judges would follow your
example."
