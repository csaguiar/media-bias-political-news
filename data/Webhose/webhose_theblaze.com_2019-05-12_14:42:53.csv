Even CNN hits Michelle Obama for this 'un-woke' criticism of President Trump - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/michelle-obama-mocks-divorced-dads,"CNN anchor Dana Bash and her guest criticized former first lady Michelle Obama for a criticism she lobbed against President Donald Trump that also appeared to mock divorced fathers.
Obama was speaking in London, England, when she told the audience that the United States was comparable to a teenager who was from a broken home.
""We come from a broken family we're a teenager, where you know, we're a little unsettled, you know, having good parents you know, is tough, you know,"" Obama said.
""Sometimes you spend weekends with divorced dad and that feels like it's fun, but then you get sick,"" she explained. ""That's what America is going through, we're kinda living with a divorced dad.""
Bash and her guest CNN White House reporter Kate Bennett heavily criticized the former first lady for mocking divorced fathers as unserious parental figures.
""To make the analogy to divorced dads for someone like Michelle Obama is terrible unwoke to use a term that the kids use,"" Bash said.
""It's not the 1950s,"" she added. ""There are a lot of divorced dads.""
Bennett agreed and called it a ""really big misstep"" on the part of the former first lady.

"California teacher reveals ‘far, hard left’ abortion, sex ed policies of unions: ‘We are being used by very powerful organizations’ - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-teacher-reveals-far-hard-left-policies-of-unions-we-are-being-used-by-very-powerful-organizations,"Teachers' unions are attempting to indoctrinate young children into thinking that far-left ideals are the norm, according to a California school teacher.
Rebecca Friedrichs, a 28-year veteran of California public schools, also penned an op-ed for Fox News titled "" Pro-life teachers, your union dues fund abortion .""
What are the details? Speaking with co-host Ainsley Earhardt, Friedrichs explained how teacher unions are bringing liberal ideas in to the classroom.
Addressing Friedrichs' column, Earhardt said, ""You start off talking about a very touchy issue that people have a lot of opinions about. And you talk about abortion and then you talk about how, as a California teacher, these left-leaning groups are pushing their agendas on our kids. Tell us what's happening in California.""
Friedrichs said that the agenda isn't even left-leaning — they are ""far, hard left groups"" advocating for their causes.
""What's going on right now in California specifically is we passed a law requiring some very offensive sex-ed,"" Friedrichs said. ""You've had another guest on whose told you a little bit about that sex-ed: forcing teachers to tell little children that at age 12 they have the right to go get an abortion without their parents' knowledge or permission.""
""And the schools will help them get there and help them fund it,"" she added.
Earhardt asked, ""How is this getting into our schools? Who is funding this?""
Friedrichs explained that the teachers' unions are pushing the agenda into the schools.
""What's shocking is teachers have no idea,"" she revealed. ""People think teachers are these far-left people pushing this stuff. That is a lie. Teachers are these — most teachers are good, loving people and many of them are against abortion and are against sexualizing little children. But we are being used by very powerful organizations.""
""The teachers' unions collect about $5 billion a year tax-free from teachers, and they use that money to push their personal social, sexual, and political agenda into our schools,"" Friedrichs added.
She also asked that her fellow educators start a boycott against the unions and stop making payments to the unions.
""All teachers across the country, in fact, all government employees are now free to pay unions nothing,"" Friedrichs said. ""We are still unionized. We're still forced to accept their representation. They're still bullying us and steamrolling us, but we don't have to pay them any longer. And I hope and pray that teachers will stand together and stop paying them. And I'm hoping we can eventually get them out of our schools."" ""
What else? In her Sunday column, which was adapted from her 2018 book, ""Standing Up to Goliath,"" Friedrichs also explained that teachers' unions subsidize abortions and finance Planned Parenthood.
Friedrichs, who was the lead plaintiff in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association — a 2016 Supreme Court case on forced union dues — wrote, ""Years ago, as a California teacher, I was shocked to learn that state and national teachers' unions collude with Planned Parenthood. They use teacher dues money and resources — behind our backs and against our wills — to bring the abortion industry into our schools.""
""Many of our nation's public schools require teachers to instruct children as young as 12 on how and where to obtain birth control — including the morning-after pill and abortions — without parental knowledge or permission,"" she added. ""If teachers refuse to teach this, the law mandates 'experts' like Planned Parenthood take over the classroom.""
In her column, Friedrichs also points to the California Teachers' Association and the National Educational Association as examples of unions that donate to leftist causes and work with leftist groups such as the Women's March, the SPLC, and more.

Breaking: President Trump just issued the second veto of his presidency to block Congress,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-vetos-congress-on-yemen-war,"President Donald Trump issued the second veto of his administration to block a vote from Congress to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.
The Senate voted 54-46 in favor for the resolution while the House of Representatives voted 247-175.
The administration issued a scathing statement rejecting the resolution and accusing the Congress of trying to undermine his executive authority.
The statement described the congressional action as ""a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, with certain exceptions.""
""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities,"" the statement continued, ""endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.""
The president issued his first veto of legislation out of Congress in March when they voted to block his declaration of a national emergency on the border.
Congress is not likely to have the votes to override the president's veto, which would require 2/3rds support of each of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Democrats fume over White House threat to send illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-fume-over-white-house-threat-to-send-illegal-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities,"Democrats are speaking out about President Donald Trump's threat to bus illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities, and many are none too pleased. Still, some leaders insist they'll welcome anyone with open arms.
What are the details? Last week, the president announced on Twitter, ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong consideration to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only. The radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy — so this should make them very happy!""
Yet several Democrats are not, in fact, happy. Particularly in California — home to many longtime ""sanctuary cities"" — which has statewide laws in place to protect illegal immigrants from deportation.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) called the Trump administration's policy idea an ""outrageous abuse of power"" and characterized it as un-American. The president called Schaaf out on Twitter , saying it was ""so interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other sanctuary cities do not want our currently 'detained immigrants.'"" She responded by insisting her city ""welcomes all, no matter where you came from or how you got here.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) also pushed back against the Trump threat. According to the Los Angeles Times , Newsom ""insisted the federal government is already 'dumping people' in California by processing migrants legally seeking asylum at the border and releasing them into California before they have time to connect with their sponsors in the U.S.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D) office also weighed in, with spokeswoman Ashley Etienne saying in a statement, ""The extent of this Administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated. Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal,"" USA Today reported.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) accused Trump of ""trying to pit Americans against each other and make us less safe,"" with the proposal.
House Democrats are now formally investigating the administration's plan, with the chairmen of the Judiciary, Oversight, and Homeland Security Committees requesting pertinent documents and communications from the White House and Department of Homeland Security, ABC News reported.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told CNN Sunday, ""The president has no right to spend money appropriated by Congress for other purposes to ship immigrants all over the country.""
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) vowed to sue President Trump over the threat to ship illegal immigrants to his city, calling the administration's plan itself, ""just plain illegal.""
Anything else? In spite of the pushback, some sanctuary city leaders have appeared to call the president's bluff, insisting they're unfazed by the prospect of his proposal. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan (D) responded to the plan on "" Hardball with Chris Matthews "" Monday, saying, ""It's not a threat to us,"" and explained that her city and others across the country are ""ready to stand up"" and take folks in.
Durkan explained, ""Just over this weekend, I've received hundreds of emails from people in our area offering places of refuge and saying 'I'll take some in my own home; I'll take some in our church. I think people will step up.""
When pressed by Matthews as to whether her city could take in 50,000 of the approximately 1 million people seeking asylum in the U.S., Durkan responded, ""I don't think we'd take 50,000 in one go, but we've taken thousands of people in Seattle."""

Thing is, the owner of the Riverdale residence was armed, too — and WTOP-FM reported that just seconds after the door came down Wednesday afternoon, the homeowner shot the intruder.
What happened next? While the suspect ran off, the homeowner called 911 about 5:30 p.m. saying he shot a man who broke into his house, Prince George's County Police told WRC.
About 20 minutes later, Victory Mbeng entered a Lanham hospital with a gunshot wound and died of his injuries a short time later, the station added.
WRC also said friends of Mbeng dropped him off at the hospital and told his aunt, Bridget Manka, that he was the victim of a random drive-by shooting.

Anything else? Police told WRC the break-in was recorded on a video surveillance system and that the homeowner isn't facing charges so far."
Marine drags himself across finish line of Boston Marathon in honor of comrades who died next to him in combat,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/marine-drags-himself-across-finish-line-of-boston-marathon-in-honor-of-comrades-who-died-next-to-him-in-combat,"A Marine has gone viral after he dragged himself across the finish line at the Boston Marathon after both his legs ""just gave up.""
Here's what we know Micah Herndon is a 31-year-old Marine veteran who served in Afghanistan. While he was deployed there, two Marines he was serving with and a British journalist were killed by an improvised explosive device. One of these men was his best friend, Matthew Ballard.
""Survivor's guilt, it's real,"" he told the Washington Post . ""I definitely have it because I was the lead machine-gunner on that convoy and I didn't see that bomb that was buried. I live with that every day.""
Herndon said that he wanted to run the marathon to honor their memories.
But around mile 20 out of 26.2, Herndon's Achilles tendon began to hurt. He tried to power through and keep running, but by the time he reached mile 22, he was reduced to a ""low crawl.""
Volunteers at the race ran over to him, but he refused their help. He insisted on dragging himself down the homestretch and crossing the finish line before he would allow them to help him into a wheelchair.
""The pain that I was going through is nothing compared to the pain that they went through,"" he told WBZ-TV . He said that he kept saying the names of the three men who died over and over again to keep pushing himself. ""I just repeat: 'Ballard, Hamer, Juarez. Ballard, Hamer, Juarez.'""
Later that day, the Post reported, Herndon said that hoped to use his fleeting fame to raise awareness of the difficulties that veterans can face at home.
""If we can do something about it, that's all I care about,"" he said.

"Elderly female pro-life counselor allegedly attacked outside abortion clinic — and left with broken leg, bleeding head",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/elderly-female-pro-life-counselor-allegedly-attacked-outside-abortion-clinic,"An elderly female pro-life counselor allegedly was attacked last week by a younger woman outside the only remaining abortion clinic in Kentucky, leaving the victim with a broken leg that required surgery and a bleeding head, LifeSite News reported .
The outlet said Donna Durning — an almost daily sidewalk counselor for over 20 years — was outside the E.M.W. Women's Surgical Center in Louisville when a younger woman who'd been inside the clinic crossed Durning's path.
Durning told LifeSiteNews the younger woman, who appeared to be in her early twenties, was heading toward a waiting car when ""she turned and looked at me, and I gave her a sweet little card ... I said, 'Honey, this is for you; if you want to talk to somebody there's a phone number there.' She grabbed me by both shoulders and literally threw me to the ground.""
Witnesses recorded the license plate of the vehicle that drove away with the young woman inside, and other pro-life activists attended to Durning prior to an ambulance's arrival, the outlet reported.
Adele Darnowski, a friend of victim, told LifeSiteNews ""police who were in a car across the street immediately entered the [clinic]"" and allegedly acquired surveillance tapes.
Darnowski posted a photograph on Facebook of what she said was Durning's blood still on the sidewalk the following day, noting that ""seventeen mothers walked over it today to go in to have their abortions. Poor dears.""
&lt;br&gt; What did a pro-life attorney have to say? Local pro-life attorney Vince Heuser added to the outlet that he'll make sure Durning's attacker is prosecuted: ""Pro-lifers do try to turn the other cheek, but beating up an old lady is not to be tolerated in anyone.""
'Hotbed' of protests As the sole remaining abortion clinic in Kentucky, E.M.W. Women's Surgical Center is a ""hotbed of both pro-life witness and pro-abortion demonstrations,"" LifeSite News said, adding that BSideU for Life Pregnancy Center is next door to the abortion clinic.
Durning added to LifeSiteNews she's usually outside the abortion clinic from 6:30 a.m. to 9:15 a.m., but on Friday she stayed the whole day to help less-experienced pro-life activists from her parish participating in 40 Days for Life.
Darnowski told the outlet that the day after the alleged attack on Durning ""there was a huge amount of activity"" outside the clinic: ""Operation Save America was there but not getting arrested that day. Two [police] cars [were] across the street. One hundred and ten of us pro-lifers including the group from Helpers of God's Precious Infants [were] across the street, and the Catholics praying the rosary, three different Protestant pastors with their megaphones, 10 or so pro-aborts taking turns playing carnival music on a boombox. ... By 8:30 p.m., 17 women had gone in.""
Durning is expected to make a full recovery and is undergoing five days of rehabilitation at Louisville's Nazareth Home, LifeSite News said.
Here's a report on E.M.W. Women's Surgical Center that aired in 2017:
Far from the first time Pro-life activists have been getting physically attacked outside abortion clinics with what appears to be a greater degree of frequency of late.
A pro-life activist in January had blood dripping down his face after getting punched by a man outside a Texas abortion clinic. What was the victim's crime? Telling the attacker that ""Jesus loves you.""

Toronto police arrested a 26-year-old man last fall for assault after a pro-life woman was ""roundhouse-kicked"" on a street corner during a silent protest .
Image source: YouTube screenshot
A younger man was caught on video tossing an elderly pro-life demonstrator to the sidewalk in front of a San Francisco Planned Parenthood in March after the victim apparently tried to take back his banner. As the attacker kicked the victim, he's heard saying, ""Old man, stay on the ground!""

The next day, freelance journalist Yashar Ali noted on Twitter that ""Notre Dame will be well funded,"" and asked followers to join him in contributing to help rebuild the three black churches torched by an arsonist in Louisiana in recent weeks.
What are the details? Ali noted, ""In the past month, three historically black churches in Louisiana were destroyed by a racist arsonist. He has been charged with hate crimes, but these churches need your help.""
He then attached a link to a GoFundMe page supporting the reconstruction of the Baptist churches' ""sanctuaries, [and] for the purchase of all necessities lost in the fires, including pews, sound system, musical instruments, etc.""
Twitter followers from across the political spectrum jumped on board, with pledges coming from conservative pundit Ben Shapiro to CNN's Jake Tapper — raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a matter of hours as Ali kept up the momentum.
Anything else? Over a span of 10 days, the St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, and the nearby Mount Pleasant Baptist Church were all torched. A suspect was arrested last week, initially charged with arson; hate crime charges were tacked on the same suspect this week."

Snoop Dogg and other rappers are outraged at Laura Ingraham and want her fired — here's why,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rappers-outraged-at-laura-ingraham,"Popular rapper Snoop Dogg and other black entertainers expressed outrage over comments Fox News host Laura Ingraham made about the funeral of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved rapper and community leader in Los Angeles, California.
Ingraham pointed out that Hussle recorded an expletive-ridden protest song against President Donald Trump, and went on to ridicule at the lyrics of the song.
Hussle, whose real name is Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was shot and killed outside of his store in South Los Angeles in March. His massive funeral was attended by many celebrities and leaders of the African-American community in celebration of his artistic contributions and political activism.
Rapper ""The Game"" called Ingraham a ""disrespectful c***"" and called on his 10.3 million followers on Instagram to demand she be fired by putting pressure on her advertisers.
""I'm asking all of my followers, fans, friends & family to spread this video with demands of #LauraIngrahams termination immediately "" he commented.
Snoop Dogg added simply, ""I'm in.""
Video of Ingraham's comments were also circulated on Twitter.
Rapper T.I. posted a video of Ingraham's comments and excoriated her reaction on his Instagram account.
""This is Disgusting! You both are vile despicable, poor excuses for people,"" he commented . ""Neither of you WILL EVER know or experience the level of love, appreciation and respect that Nip has... EVEN IN DEATH!!! So let that sizzle in ya lil hateful,demonic spirits.""
Actress Nia Long commented on his post, saying, ""Both need to be fired. PERIOD!!""
A petition with more than 40,000 signatures is being circulated for the purpose of terminating Ingraham from Fox News over the comments she made.
Four people were shot during the funeral procession for Hussle through Watts, and one later died.

"Christian university says it will not cave to backlash from outraged students, still plans to host Vice President Pence for commencement",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-university-will-not-cave-to-students-outraged-over-pence-address,"Taylor University in Indiana will still host Vice President Mike Pence as its keynote speaker at the Christian university's commencement ceremony despite opposition from angry students and former students.
What happened? Last week, dueling petitions emerged concerning Pence's scheduled appearance: One demanded that the school revoke its invitation for the vice president to speak during the commencement ceremony, and the other was a counter-petition.
Alex Hoekstra, an alumnus of the university, created the initial petition demanding that Pence be removed as a commencement speaker and insisted that by allowing Pence to speak at the school would make the university ""complicit in the Trump-Pence administration's policies.""
Another former student added that she was so shaken by the announcement that she felt ""physically ill.""
""I have never been made to feel so physically ill by an email before. Taylor University, you should be ashamed of yourselves,"" Claire Hadley wrote in a Facebook post . ""I am physically shaking. The fact that the school who claims to love and support me, and each of it's [sic] students and alum, would invite such a vile individual to speak on the most important day of the year??""
A portion of the counter-petition read , ""By Pence speaking at this upcoming graduation, Taylor is by no means aligning themselves with the alleged controversial views of the Trump administration, they are simply giving a voice to all opinions and planes of thought.""
So what's the school saying now? In a statement, university spokesperson James Garringer said that Pence would still be slated to speak at the college despite the petitions and negative feedback.
Garringer told the Independent Journal Review , ""Since making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue. Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful, and meaningful dialogue.""
""We look forward to hosting the vice president next month,"" Garringer added."
Child traffickers are using our southern border and immigration laws to smuggle kids into the US for the sex trade. Here's what Congress can do to address it.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/child-traffickers-are-using-our-southern-border-and-immigration-laws-to-smuggle-kids-into-the-us,"A few weeks ago I was called to testify before a subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee. As a former Homeland Security Special Agent/Undercover Operator that worked child-trafficking cases for over a decade along the southern border with Mexico, I was there to testify about the sex-trafficking threat that awaits vulnerable migrant children being illegally brought into the United States. Shortly after I began my testimony, the chairwoman of the committee politely, but firmly, stated on the record that my testimony was irrelevant for this particular hearing, as, she opined, this hearing was about the U.S. government's policy of separating undocumented families at the border — not about child trafficking.
As it is against hearing procedure for witnesses to provide unsolicited comments to members of the committee, I had to sit there in silence, yet with full knowledge, that the chairwoman was wrong. Any discussion of migrant family separation and/or reunification policies at our southern border is wholly incomplete without discussing the reality — an increasing number of children are being trafficked across the border. Not only is it real, but it thrives within the very policies intended to keep migrant children safe and with their families. And yet, nobody seems to acknowledge this reality, as it grows and grows right under our very noses.
To understand this reality and ongoing threat, we must first acknowledge certain trends accompanying the massive, record-breaking influx of undocumented migrants seeking entry into the United States at our southern borders. No longer are we seeing mostly single adult males coming to find work (as we did in the 90's and 2000's), rather we are now finding adults bringing thousands and thousands of children.
Since 2017, ther e has been a 136 percent increase in the number of children being brought illegally into the country through our southern border . The sheer number of children identified is shocking. But the real disturbing part is this: thousands of these children end up not belonging in any way to the adult migrants claiming them. Since 2017, there has been a whopping 314 percent increase in adults coming illegally through our southern border bringing children they claim to be theirs, but are not . In the last 10 months alone, there have been more than 1,700 documented cases of this stranger fraud .
So, what is going on? To identify the cause, you first should know that human smuggling organizations control the routes leading up to and through the southern border. Simply put, nobody is getting through the southern border without paying these smugglers. So, it is the smugglers who are taking children and pairing them with undocumented migrants and instructing the migrants to pretend they are the parents as they cross into the United States. And the reason is simple: if a migrant attempts to enter the United States through the port of entry with a child, U.S. policy dictates that child and ""parent"" must be released from custody within 20 days of their apprehension. The policy, backed by court precedent, is intended to quickly reunite children with their families. But, there is a hidden evil in this good intentioned policy. For this policy incentivizes smugglers and traffickers to use and abuse child victims.
Let me take you into the criminal mind of sex traffickers. They know the United States represents perhaps the highest demand for child sex in the world. (The U.S. regularly ranks as the highest consumer of child rape videos in the world.) Naturally, traffickers would like to get these children into the lucrative, illicit American sex markets. They also know it is easier to kidnap children in developing countries, such as those in Central America, as the likelihood of being caught is low.
But how do these criminals smuggle them in? Unfortunately, U.S. policy has provided the answer. Simply walk the child into the United States, with an illegal adult claiming the child is their child, and both will be released into the United States within 20 days. Or, if you prefer, send the child alone or unaccompanied, and then send somebody (perhaps your trafficking partner already in the U.S.) to show up at the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) offices and claim the child.
""Hello, I'm Uncle George and 6-year-old Isabel, who is in your custody, is my niece.""
That's all the trafficker needs to say, and CBP has no choice but to turn the child over; for the laws of the land, backed by court precedent, have forced their hand. Sure, the sponsor must sign for the child (like you would for a library book), promise to care for the child, and promise to bring the child back on the assigned court date before an immigration judge for either a deportation or asylum hearing. But guess what? Sixty-six percent of the children are never brought back for court. They are gone. Vanished forever. And nobody ever knows who ""Uncle George"" really was. And they likely never will.
And that's how you use U.S. laws to complete a child trafficking event.
The best case for these children (which is still abhorrent) is that they will be recycled back into Mexico and used as pawns in the hands of smugglers to get their illegal migrant clients into the United States. These kids become a ""get-out-of-jail-free"" card for the migrants being smuggled in. The other option, while absolutely unthinkable, is also a real possibility. Trends confirm that these children could easily end up being sold for sex, and raped thousands and thousands of times in the United States. I have personally been a part of the liberation and rehabilitation of these migrant child sex slaves in America.
Compare the above story with this: My wife and I recently adopted two children from another country. It took the United States, along with my children's home country, well over a year to vet me and my wife to ensure we were safe and would provide a good home for our children. And yet, Congress does nothing to protect these migrant children. They sit idly by and allow those who stake claim on these vulnerable migrant children to have the upper hand over CBP, who only has 20 days or less to vet sponsors coming to take the children away forever. Why should my children be any different from these migrant children? Why should we protect one child any more than another? This policy is absurd, inhumane, and completely unacceptable.
I call on Congress to drop the politics and come together (both parties!) for the children and solve this crisis. I don't have all the long-term answers, but I plead with Congress to make two immediate changes to mitigate this grave threat to children:
No. 1: Congress should pass legislation that provides CBP with the tools to develop protocols to only release children over to the custody of their families or designated, responsible adults and properly vetted adults. This may include international investigations and judicial identity hearings to find the real families of the children; for the separation of child and parent may have occurred long before the child ever crossed into the United States. To be clear, I'm not suggesting children be separated at any time from their families, only that unaccompanied minors not be systematically delivered to unverified strangers. Congress should also mandate and fund the use of rapid DNA technology (technology I have personally utilized) which can confirm genetic connections in a couple of hours.
No. 2: Congress should immediately pass legislation to mandate and fund the transfer of immigration and asylum courts to our U.S. embassies in foreign countries, starting with those in Central America. Immigrants and asylum seekers from those countries will no longer need to enter the United States to be heard, rather they will use the local, and more convenient, courts in their own countries to do their legitimate business with the United States. Migrants will be granted more rapid access and passage to the United States without having to drag themselves and their children across thousands of miles of unforgiving dessert, through multiple, dangerous countries, where they have to wait in precarious border towns to have their petitions adjudicated. If imminent and credible threats are chasing these applicants in their own countries, Congress could consider taking measures for their protection during adjudication.
Most importantly, this policy would crush the incentive for smugglers and traffickers to kidnap children and use them as pawns for smuggling schemes, or worse, to be used as sex slaves. For these criminals will not have their “20-day"" loophole. If they bring a child to the Port of Entry they will be told to return to the embassy in their country and take their legitimate petition to the immigration official there. Since they have no legitimate claim, they will stop their scheme; they will leave the children alone.
Currently, there is a mass immigration crisis at the border and it is getting worse. While the problems and the solutions in their entirety are not simple, one part is simple, we must do everything we can to stop children from being harmed. If we are willing to sit back, take a deep breath, drop the politics, and focus on one thing—doing right by the children, we are well on our way to providing a comprehensive solution to this problem. We must have the courage to take this important first step to address this crisis. Certainly, the protection of children is something that everyone can agree on.

Report: Twitter no longer uses the Southern Poverty Law Center to police hate speech on the site,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-no-longer-uses-the-southern-poverty-law-center-to-police-hate-speech-on-the-site,"Twitter has apparently severed its relationship with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which the social media site previously partnered with to police hate speech, The Daily Caller reported.
The SPLC has been dealing with several significant scandals in recent months, including the firing of co-founder Morris Dees for unspecified misconduct and allegations of racial bias and harassment within the organization.
What happened? The SPLC was listed by Twitter as a ""safety partner"" to fight ""hateful conduct and harassment"" on the social media site. However, an anonymous Twitter source told The Daily Caller that Twitter quietly ended that collaboration.
""The SPLC is not a member of Twitter's Trust and Safety Council or a partner the company has worked with recently,"" the source said.
What about other major tech companies? The Daily Caller reached out to Facebook, Amazon and Google to ask about the status of those companies' relationships with the SPLC, but has not received clear responses from them. All three of those companies partnered with the SPLC in some capacity in recent years.
What's wrong with the SPLC? Despite it's notoriety within the social justice and media contexts, the SPLC has developed a reputation for classifying Christian organizations as hate groups no different than neo-Nazi or white supremacist groups.
And, while the SPLC purports to fight for justice in public, the SPLC has been revealed to harbor a culture of harassment, racial bias, and hostile work conditions, according to some current and former employees.
After firing co-founder Dees, the SPLC announced that it would hire a firm to conduct an audit of the organization's operating procedures and culture.
Internal emails from SPLC workers point out ""problems — which employees said spanned from sexual harassment to gender- and race-based discrimination"" that appear to be ""systemic and widespread."""

"Newly released messages show Kim Foxx bashed Jussie Smollett, discussed case despite public recusal",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kim-foxx-text-messages-jussie,"Was Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx actually recused from the Jussie Smollett criminal case after she publicly declared she was?
That's the question many are asking after her office released a trove of emails and text messages related to the case.
What are the details? The messages, released Tuesday, show that after Foxx announced her recusal from the case on Feb. 19 because she said she had been in contact with a relative of Smollett, Foxx continued to internally discuss the case with her top aides, according to WBBM-TV .
Text messages reveal what Foxx really thought of Smollett and showed that she was concerned how the optics of the case reflected on her office.
""Sooo…...I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases...16 counts on a class 4 [felony] becomes exhibit A,"" she wrote to Joe Magats, her top deputy, on March 8. ""Pedophile with 4 victims 10 counts. Washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16 [counts].""
The ""pedophile"" Foxx referred to is rapper R. Kelly, who has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.
""On a case eligible for deferred prosecution I think it's indicative of something we should be looking at generally. Just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should,"" Foxx went on to tell Magats.
WBBM obtained the messages through a Freedom of Information Act request.
Foxx's office shockingly announced last month that it was dropping all charges against Smollett. He had been charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police about being the victim of a hate crime. Instead, law enforcement said Smollett orchestrated a hoax.
In exchange for having his record cleaned, Smollett agreed to forfeit his $10,000 bail — which he posted after pleading not guilty to all charges — and perform a few hours of community service.
Still, the city of Chicago sued Smollett for an additional $130,000 last week to recoup the costs of the investigation into his alleged attack.
How did Foxx respond? Despite claiming last month that she did not officially, legally recuse herself from Smollet's case, instead only distancing herself from it out of an ""abundance of caution,"" Foxx on Tuesday defended her communications.
""After the indictment became public, I reached out to Joe to discuss reviewing office policies to assure consistencies in our charging and our use of appropriate charging authority,"" she said in a statement. ""I was elected to bring criminal justice reform and that includes intentionality, consistency, and discretion. I will continue to uphold these guiding principle."""
Christian school fires pastoral assistant for petitioning against transgender lessons at her young son's school,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-school-fires-employee-for-petitioning-against-transgender-lessons,"A Christian school in Britain fired a pastoral assistant who posted online her objections to the transgender lessons being taught at her son's Church of England school.
The Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, fired Kristie Higgs after she urged her Facebook followers to sign a petition against the government's relationships and sex education, which goes into effect in September 2020. The United Kingdom Department of Education's new guidelines dubbed ""No Outsiders"" would require children as young as 5 to receive LGBT lessons about relationships and gender reassignment.
On Tuesday, a disciplinary panel dismissed the 43-year-old mother, who worked at a separate school from the primary school her young son attended, after it found her guilty of ""gross misconduct"" and ""illegal discrimination,"" the Christian Legal Centre said in a press release .
What did she write on Facebook? Higgs wrote on her personal Facebook page that children are being brainwashed by educators. She asked other parents to sign the petition that she shared.
""Please sign this petition, they have already started to brainwash our innocent wonderfully created children and its [sic] happening in our local primary school now,"" she wrote, according to a press release the Christian Legal Centre sent to TheBlaze.
""Which means, for example, that children will be taught that all relationships are valid and 'normal,' so that same sex marriage is exactly the same as traditional marriage, and that gender is a matter of choice, not biology, so that it's up to them what sex they are,"" Higgs wrote.
""At the same time it means that expressing and teaching fundamental Christian beliefs, relating to the creation of men and women and marriage, will in practice become forbidden — because they conflict with the new morality and are seen as indoctrination into unacceptable religious bigotry,"" Higgs added.
In a separate post, the mother of two also voiced her objections to a pair of children's books at her son's school which feature LGBT stories. One story is about a boy who wants to wear a dress and the other is about a red crayon that learns it's really a blue crayon.
The panel determined Tuesday that Higgs' comments ""could bring the school into disrepute and damage the reputation of the school,"" according to the press release.
Higgs had worked at the secondary school for six years before her firing. Her employee record was unblemished up to her firing.
Was she fired because of her Christian beliefs? Higgs, who is challenging her firing, said she believes she was fired because of her Christian faith and beliefs. She is represented by the Christian Legal Centre.
""I have been punished for sharing concerns about Relationships and Sex Education. I hold these views because of my Christian beliefs, beliefs and views which are shared by hundreds of thousands of parents across the UK,"" she said in a statement via Christian Legal Centre. ""My number one concern has always been the effect that learning about sex and gender in school will have on children at such a young age.""
""As soon as the investigation into the posts began I was repeatedly told: 'this is nothing to do with your religion.' That was clearly a legal tactic and of course it has everything to do with my religion,"" she continued. ""I am determined to fight this case and to stand for Christians and all parents across the country who are being silenced for sharing and holding these views.""
The school claims it received a single email complaint about Higgs' comments. The complainant accused the woman of ""posting homophobic and prejudiced views.""
""We concluded that no action was taken because of your religion,"" the disciplinary panel said, according to the Christian Legal Centre. ""The disciplinary occurred for reasons other than your religion.""
""As an inclusive employer, Farmor's school recognizes and protects the statutory rights of its staff,"" the panel said. ""Such rights however are not absolute and we are concerned that you did not demonstrate an appropriate understanding of the school's requirement to respect and tolerate the views of others and to role model such behavior.""
The panel admitted that no damage had occurred to the school because of Higgs' Facebook posts.
""Regarding bringing the school into disrepute … we agree that there is no direct evidence that as a matter of fact that the reputation of the school has been damaged to date,"" the panel said in its decision.
What else? Muslim parents at a Birmingham school have also protested against the ""No Outsiders"" program, which some have called indoctrination.
""This is nothing but indoctrination of our children,"" Razina Mahmood, 40, told the Sun in an earlier interview. ""You are using our children as an experiment."""

Brooks serves as the president of the American Enterprise Institute, a nationally recognized think-tank based in Washington, D.C., where he leads a community of scholars and supporters that are committed to expanding liberty, increasing individual opportunity, and strengthening free enterprise for all Americans.
He and Glenn discussed the ""culture of contempt"" that is so prevalent in today's political climate. Brooks pointed out how both liberals and conservatives in America seem ""unable to separate today's contemptuous ideas from the person promoting them,"" and he stressed the importance of learning to ""disagree better.""
""It's healthy to disagree because it leads to new and better solutions,"" Brooks said. ""But the contempt we so often include in those disagreements isn't necessary at all. In fact, it's dangerous and it makes progress for our nation nearly impossible. People are not defined by the political values they endorse.""

Mom pulls over to breastfeed her 3-week-old baby — then nearly gets towed before being slapped with parking ticket,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-pulls-over-to-breastfeed-baby-gets-ticket,"Guillermina Rodriguez, a mother of four, was driving Thursday morning in congested midtown Manhattan traffic when her hungry 3-week-old baby began crying, WCBS-TV reported .
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
""It was immense amount of traffic,"" she told the station. ""It took me 45 minutes to an hour just to get from 42nd to 30th Street.""
Her first order of business was getting her baby fed — which in Rodriquez's case means breastfeeding.
And when she finally found an open spot, Rodriquez nabbed it. That it was for commercial vehicles only didn't seem like an earth shattering deal.
""Even though I saw it was a commercial area, I'm like, 'I'm not obstructing the traffic. I'm not blocking anybody. Let me just stay there, and I'll breastfeed the baby there,'"" Rodriquez told WCBS.
So she got into the back seat and began breastfeeding her baby — but the relative quiet didn't last long.
What happened next?
A few minutes after she began to breastfeed, she said a NYPD tow truck pulled in front of her vehicle.
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
""He's backing up to tow my truck, so as I am in this position breastfeeding now, I jump over to the front seat to honk so he can see, 'Don't tow my truck!'"" Rodriquez told the station.
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
Then a ticket agent emerged, walked to Rodriguez's vehicle, WCBS said — and likely wasn't prepared for what he saw.
""I'm actually breastfeeding on one side and pumping on the other, so both my breasts are out, and I turn, and I'm like, 'I'm breastfeeding the baby!'"" she recounted to the station with a laugh. ""He turned and looks, and he's like, 'Oh OK.'""
Except it wasn't completely ""OK"" — the official slapped a $115 ticket on Rodriquez's windshield before leaving, she told WCBS.
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
""I'm here breastfeeding,"" she's heard saying on video she recorded of the incident. ""He just gave me a ticket.""
What did police have to say?
The NYPD told the station that the traffic agent wrote the ticket before he saw Rodriguez breastfeeding and that his hands were tied since agents can't void tickets. WCBS added that authorities didn't offer a reason why the agent didn't first check the vehicle before readying to tow it.
'More sensitive' and 'more educated' ""I think they should've been more sensitive,"" Rodriquez told the station, adding that breastfeeding mothers should be exempted from fines.
""I think getting them a little more educated on that area would be helpful,"" she also told WCBS.
Rodriguez also told the station she plans on disputing her ticket — and hopes the judge is a parent.

Image source: KMSP-TV video screenshot
What happened? Officers tried to stop a stolen vehicle that was being driven recklessly and fleeing cops, speeding down side streets and alleyways, St. Paul Police Department spokesperson Mike Ernster told the station, adding that officers soon lost sight of the vehicle.
But police then learned of a crash involving the stolen vehicle, KMSP noted, and several vehicle occupants reportedly fled into the neighborhood.
As police were searching for vehicle's occupants, they heard gunfire — and soon found the driver of the stolen vehicle lying in the yard of a house, the station said. He'd been wounded by multiple gunshots, KMSP said.
Image source: KMSP-TV video screenshot
A man armed with a handgun identified himself as the homeowner and was found with the driver, the station said.
The 36-year-old homeowner cooperated with police and surrendered the gun, Ernster told KMSP, adding that the driver of the stolen vehicle was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
'No trespassing. Violators will be shot. Survivors will be shot again!' A sign in the window of the home where the shooting occurred reads, ""No trespassing. Violators will be shot. Survivors will be shot again!"" the station reported.
The stolen vehicle's other occupants haven't been located, KMSP said, adding that the driver was wanted in St. Paul for a separate auto theft.
In its video report of the incident, KMSP said it's not known if the homeowner has a permit for the gun, if the driver of the stolen vehicle was armed, or if the shooting was justified.
A woman claiming to be the mother of the stolen vehicle's driver said her son was ordered off the property, turned to comply, but was shot three times in the arm, rear end, and leg, the station added in its video report.

Campus police chief put on leave for 'liking' pro-Trump tweets,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/campus-police-chief-put-on-leave-for-liking-pro-trump-tweets,"The campus police chief for Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges was placed on administrative leave last week after school administrators caved to students protesting his recent appointment because he previously ""liked"" tweets supportive of President Donald Trump.
What are the details? Chief Daniel Hect was hired for the post at the all-women colleges in January, after serving in the same position at two Ohio universities during his 30 years in law enforcement. Following the hiring announcement, Mount Holyoke students dug into Hect's Twitter feed and discovered he had ""liked"" tweets that were ""almost exclusively in response to President Trump's tweets and included anti-immigration, pro-gun rights and racist sentiments,"" Smith College's newspaper, The Sophian , reported.
The chief's Twitter account has since been deleted, but according to The Sophian, he had the audacity to endorse messages from other users that stated, ""Stay the course Pres. Trump,"" and ""BUILD THAT WALL!!"" Hect reportedly also liked a few tweets from the NRA, one of which read, ""The National Rifle Association wishes you and your family a very Merry Christmas!"" and another stated, ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.""
According to The Daily Wire 's Kassy Dillon — whose alma mater is Mount Holyoke — ""other tweets were from President Trump discussing the border wall and the government shutdown."" The specific contents of those messages were not available.
Students were horrified. Hect agreed to a number of community forums and listening sessions to hear their concerns. During one discussion covered by the Mount Holyoke newspaper , Hect repeatedly expressed his ""sincere regret"" over his behavior on social media and denounced the president, saying:
Donald Trump's viewpoints do not represent our country very well. When [Trump] did something that I thought he did well, I wanted to like [his tweets in reference to those successes] in hopes to lead to more good behavior. I do not support President Trump. The hate that comes out of the White House is not okay. Hect's explanations and apologies fell flat.
After students continued to protest his appointment, Mount Holyoke President Sonya Stephens emailed students last Wednesday night to say, ""Over the past few weeks, members of our community have expressed concerns about the ability of Chief Daniel Hect to develop the level of trust required to engage in community policing. In light of this, Chief Hect, who leads campus police at Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, has been placed on administrative leave,"" the Washington Examiner reported.
Anything else? Michelle Dang, president of the Mount Holyoke College Republicans, responded to news of Hect's punishment by telling Campus Reform , ""I reckon this unfair treatment toward Chief Daniel, a well-respected military veteran who has never allowed his viewpoints to affect his service. I'm fearful for my own well-being here in Mount Holyoke. What if the same instance happens to me, will the college then pressure me to leave or put me on expulsion?"""
Beto O’Rourke was asked why he doesn’t donate much to charity. He responds that his ‘sacrifice’ is running for office,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/beto-orourke-sacrifices-by-running-for-office,"Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke and his wife don't give that much of their income to charity, but he says that's OK since he's spent so much of his life running for and holding public office.
Here's the background: Recent analysis of tax documents from 2020 Democratic presidential candidates puts O'Rourke at the bottom of the list of Democratic donors to charity. In fact, the O'Rourkes reported donating only $1,166 out of $370,412 in 2017. That's 0.3 percent .
When asked about the paltry percentage at a recent campaign event in Virginia, the Texas Democrat countered by saying that he gives in ways that can't be quantified on a tax return, like running for president.
""I've served in public office since 2005. I do my best to contribute to the success of my community, of my state and, now, of my country,"" the candidate said. ""There are ways that I do this that are measurable and there are ways that I do this are immeasurable.""
O'Rourke went on to add that ""There are charities that we donate to that we've recorded and itemized, others that we have donated to that we have not.""
But here's the kicker quote: ""But I will tell you, I'm doing everything that I can right now, spending this time with you — not with our kiddos, not back home in El Paso — because I want to sacrifice everything to make sure that we meet this moment of truth with everything we've got.""
This answer could very easily backfire on O'Rourke.
Just for reference, the idea of ""sacrificing everything"" is typically invoked when someone gives their life for a cause such as dying in combat or the line of duty as a first responder or when they've been made a martyr for their faith. It's not a phrase typically heard or expected when discussing the various inconveniences of going around the United States to campaign stops in a bid to take over the Oval Office."
William Barr declares that asylum seekers who enter the US illegally do not have to be released if they post bond,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-william-barr-rules-that-asylum-seekers-who-enter-the-u-s-illegally-do-not-have-to-be-released-if-they-post-bond,"Attorney General WIlliam Barr has ordered U.S. immigration officials to stop releasing asylum seekers on bond who crossed into the United States illegally before they requested asylum.
Here's what we know This new rule applies only to asylum seekers who have been determined to have a ""credible fear of prosecution or torture"" and are also facing expedited removal (which, Barr explained, happens when an applicant ""lack[s] entry documentation or seek[s] admission through fraud or misrepresentation"").
Formerly, according to the Department of Justice, asylum seekers who otherwise would have been subject to expedited removal would be be eligible for bond if they can prove that they have a ""credible fear."" In his reasoning for the new rule , Barr wrote ""I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States."" Without the ability to post bond (which Barr stated costs ""at least $1,500""), these illegal immigrants would have to wait in detention centers until their requests are processed. According to NBC News , this could take months or as much as a year.
There is an exception for immigrants with ""serious medical conditions,"" and asylum seekers who are being detained can still be granted parole. It will now be up to the Department of Homeland Security to decide whether or not to release these asylum seekers on a case by case basis.
It does not affect anyone who has claimed asylum at legal ports of entry and did not cross the border illegally.
Barr wrote that this new rule would not go into effect ""for 90 days so that DHS may conduct the necessary operation planning"" since it would require the department to house a ""sizable population of aliens"" who are currently ""eligible for bond.""
Approximately, 161,000 people claimed asylum last year."

Time names both Christine Blasey Ford and SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh to '100 Most Influential People' list — and some people aren't happy,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/time-names-blasey-ford-kavanaugh-to-most-influential-list,"Both Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh made Time's annual "" 100 Most Influential People "" list, and the reactions on the internet are split.
What are the details? On Wednesday, Time revealed its ""100 Most Influential People,"" either empowering or enraging many people with its choice to feature both Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.
Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in an incident that she claimed occurred while the two were in high school in the '80s. She testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, but ultimately, the committee found no evidence to support her allegations against Kavanaugh. The full Senate confirmed him to the Supreme Court in October.
Presidential candidate and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wrote Blasey Ford's guest contribution, which said:
Her story, spoken while holding back tears, shook Washington and the country. Her courage, in the face of those who wished to silence her, galvanized Americans. And her unfathomable sacrifice, out of a sense of civic duty, shined a spotlight on the way we treat survivors of sexual violence.
Christine Blasey Ford's ambition wasn't to become a household name or make it onto this list. She had a good life and a successful career—and risked everything to send a warning in a moment of grave consequence.
At her core, she is a teacher. And through her courage, she forced the country to reckon with an issue that has too often been ignored and kept in the dark. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wrote Kavanaugh's guest contribution, which read:
When Brett Kavanaugh was named the President's choice to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy, he was one of the most qualified Supreme Court nominees in modern history. He had a sterling academic record, impeccable legal credentials and a prolific record of thoughtful and impartial jurisprudence over more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
But when unhinged partisanship and special interests sought to distract the Senate from considering those qualifications, we saw other facets of Justice Kavanaugh's character shine forth as well. The country saw his resilience and commitment to public service. We saw his loyal devotion to family and friends. We saw his undeterred reverence for the law, for precedents and for our nation's highest traditions.
It is all these qualities combined that make Justice Kavanaugh exactly the kind of jurist whom the American people deserve on our Supreme Court. I look forward to many years of brilliant, distinguished public service. Blasey Ford was featured under the magazine's ""Icons"" list, while Kavanaugh was featured under the magazine's ""Leaders"" list. Others featured on the ""Icons"" list include former first lady Michelle Obama and activist and filmmaker Spike Lee. Others featured on the ""Leaders"" list include people like freshman lawmaker Sen. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and President Donald Trump.
Edward Felsenthal, Time's editor-in-chief, described in a Wednesday article how the magazine chose its 100.
""We all have teachers, some we know intimately, others who inspire from the page or the screen,"" Felsenthal wrote. ""This holds true even for the most accomplished people on earth. Our annual TIME 100 issue is filled with tributes from teachers to students; in many cases, the surprise is who is playing which role today.""
""In many ways, these connections — forged across and among industries — are the heart of the TIME 100, which now, in its 16th year, is far more than a list. It is a community of hundreds of global leaders, many of whom support and challenge one another. And at a time when so many of our problems require cross-disciplinary solutions, they are also uniquely positioned to effect change.""
What are people on social media saying about this? Social media users are — naturally — starkly divided on the two entries on the list.
One social media user tweeted , ""What was @TIME thinking? What were those meetings like? To put the courageous #ChristineBlaseyFord along Brett Kavanaugh and herald him as 'resilient'? Disgusting.""
Another added , ""I'm still furious over that charade of hearing—placing another credibly accused sex offender on the highest court was unconscionable. I will be voting with #ChristineBlaseyFord in mind for a very long time.""

Hypocrisy much? AOC once advocated for business tax breaks — when she stood to benefit,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-advocates-tax-breaks-business,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been a member of Congress for just three months, yet she has already made a name for herself as being one of the most progressive, anti-business, ""democratic socialist"" lawmakers in the nation.
She has even made political enemies in New York after Amazon announced it would not build a second headquarters in New York City, which would have brought at least 25,000 jobs and billions of dollars in revenue to the city,. After the decision, Ocasio-Cortez's announced that she was glad Amazon was leaving because she didn't approve of the tax breaks that were offered to the tech giant.
But Ocasio-Cortez hasn't always been so anti-business. In fact, just seven year ago Ocasio-Cortez advocated for tax breaks when they would have benefited her.
What are the details? Ocasio-Cortez, who is a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, an organization that openly advocates for the abolishment of capitalism , sought tax breaks in 2012 for her start-up publishing house, Brook Avenue Press.
Newly resurfaced comments highlighted by the Washington Examiner show that Ocasio-Cortez endorsed the Small Business Start-Up Support Art in 2012, a bill co-sponsored by then-Sen. John Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y).
The bill sought to ease the tax burden on new businesses by doubling the start-up cost tax deduction from $5,000 to $10,000.
What did Ocasio-Cortez say? In a press release from Gillibrand's office , Ocasio-Cortez voiced support for the tax breaks claiming they would fuel business growth.
""Plenty of entrepreneurs have started their businesses on a shoestring and any break they receive means more flexibility for further growth,"" she said. ""A tax break could mean part-time work for someone else or keeping a business' doors open long enough to turn a profit.""
""Young entrepreneurs are playing a special role in developing promising, creative enterprises for our future and a small break can open up their resources for hiring, creating a new product, or reinvesting in the local economy,"" Ocasio-Cortez went on to say.
Similarly, while speaking with DNA Info in 2012 , Ocasio-Cortez denounced first-year taxes on start-up businesses.
""You don't really make a profit in your first year,"" she said. ""To get taxed on top of that is a real whammy.""
The comments are an extreme departure from what she said last year when Amazon announced NYC as the location for its second headquarters.
Ocasio-Cortez has similarly denounced all tax cuts since rising to political prominence. In fact, she even advocates for the wealthiest Americans, those who make more than $10 million per year, to pay up to 70 percent in taxes.
Ironically, Ocasio-Cortez owed unpaid taxes on her business as of this year, according to the New York Post ."
Canada's illegal marijuana market thrives despite legalization - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/illegal-marijuana-market-is-thriving-in-canada-despite-legalization,"Canada's illegal marijuana market continues to thrive six months after the country legalized the drug.
The nation's top officials blame a shortage in the ""supply chain"" for keeping the black market strong six months after the nationwide legalization of recreational marijuana, Global Times reported.
""There are clearly still issues in the supply chain,"" Minister Bill Blair said, according to Global Times. Blair, who serves as a member of Parliament for Canada's Liberal party, is the spokesman for the nation's Cannabis Act.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau argued ahead of the move in October that legalizing pot across the country would put an end to the black market.
But long lines, high prices, and short supply have kept consumers returning to their illegal pot sources.
How much demand is there?
Brick and mortar stores and online retailers have opened up all over the country to meet the high demand for marijuana.
Fifteen percent of Canadians 15 and older reported using marijuana in the last three months of 2018, according to a national cannabis survey by Statistics Canada . Of those, half said they used the drug for non-medical reasons only. Medical marijuana has been allowed since 2001.
During the same period, illegal pot sales totaled an estimated $900 million (C$1.2 billion) while legal product sales came in at $230 million (C$307 million).
Drug dealers raked in about 79 percent of the country's total marijuana sales during the 4th quarter, according the survey.
In the previous quarter prior to legalization, illegal sales made up about 90 percent of the market.
What's the difference in cost? Buying cannabis legally costs about 33 percent more per gram than purchasing it illegally, according to a government report released last month.
Consumers paid about C$9.70 per gram on the legal market at the end of last year vs. C$6.51 on the black market, the report showed.
The government agency pointed to the shortage in grow time that suppliers had before the law took effect as a reason for the price increase.
Still, black market prices fell after legalization, according to Global Times.
What do shop owners say? Some pot shop owners say the shortage forces customers to go elsewhere.
""When I'm sold out, they're still gonna find a product somewhere,"" Trevor Tobin, who operates the High North marijuana store in Labrador, told the Guardian.
What do experts say? Some experts believe the black market will continue to operate as long as consumers can get it cheaper from illegal dealers.
""As long as that price differential exists, there will likely be a black market – because people will go to where they can get a deal,"" Rosalie Wynoch, a policy analyst at the CD Howe Institute, a conservative thinktank, told the Guardian . ""The government was aware that it wouldn't fully displace the black market on day one.""
What else? Edibles and cannabis infused drinks are expected to be rolled out on the Canadian market later this year."
‘American Psycho’ writer says ‘spoiled children’ liberals need to get over Trump presidency,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-psycho-writer-spoiled-children-liberals-need-to-get-over-trump-presidency,"Filmmaker and author Bret Easton Ellis says in a new book that people acting like ""spoiled children"" need to wake up and realize that President Donald Trump is their president, too.
What are the details? According to the Washington Examiner , which obtained a copy of Ellis' new book ""White,"" the author says that ""childlike fascism"" and ""demented narcissism"" of liberals helped put Trump in office.
The book was initially set to be titled ""White Privileged Male.""
In the book, Ellis also blasts the ""legacy media"" that covered the 2016 presidential election for biased coverage and says that the coverage also helped Trump win.
The Examiner's Toby Quote: : ""He places Trump's 2016 victory and what he sees as the Left's continued refusal to accept his legitimacy squarely in the context of millennials — those who reached adulthood around the start of the 21st century.""
Branding millennials ""Generation Wuss,"" Harnden pointed out, Ellis decries the generation's ""oversensitivity, their sense of entitlement, their insistence they were always right despite sometimes overwhelming proof to the contrary"" and ""their joint tendencies of overreaction and passive-aggressive possibility.""
Ellis also adds that such mentality can be placed on the shoulders of helicopter parents who smother their children, ""not really teaching them how to deal with life's hardships.""
""People might not like you, this person will not love you back, kids are really cruel, work sucks, it's hard to be good at something, your days will be made up of failure and disappointment, you're not talented, people suffer, people grow older, people die,"" Ellis writes.
Such parenting results in millennials being consumed by ""victim narratives"" as well as ""anxiety and neediness."" He also points out that deviating from the herd of groupthink will automatically brand you as ""racist"" or ""misogynist.""
""This is an age that judges everybody so harshly through the lens of identity politics that if you resist the threatening groupthink of 'progressive ideology,' which proposes universal inclusivity except for those who dare to ask any questions, you're somehow f***ed,"" writes Ellis. ""Everyone has to be the same, and have the same reactions to any given work of art, or movement or idea, and if you refuse to join the chorus of approval you will be tagged a racist or a misogynist.""
Ellis adds that he, too, believed that Trump would defeat former presidential candidate and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and closely followed the way the media began covering the candidates' respective campaigns.
""Legacy institutions like The New York Times and CNN [were not] tracking what seemed to me a shifting reality,"" he writes. ""The media became so freaked out that they abandoned the hallmarks of neutrality and perspective.""
""Trump was the poster-boy antithesis of the proud moral superiority of the Left as defined forever by Clinton's 'basket of deplorables' comment, as well as by Michelle Obama's breathlessly condescending 'When they go low, we go high,' both of which were Quote: d approvingly in the legacy media,"" he writes.
The way the legacy media covered the election, he believes, pushed many people to ""turn Donald Trump into the biggest underdog in American political history.""
Ellis notes that he's not on any particular part of the political spectrum and didn't vote for either candidate during the 2016 presidential election.
""I hadn't voted for anyone, not only because I lived in rest-assured California, but also because during the campaign I'd realized I wasn't a conservative or a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican, and I didn't buy into what either party was selling,"" he writes. ""I'd also thought Bernie Sanders' platform was impractical to the point of absurdity.""
Ellis also reveals that his boyfriend became increasingly irritated with him as he slipped into political apathy.
""When my traumatized boyfriend criticized me for not being angrier about the election (five months after it had happened) I shot back that I didn't want to talk about Trump anymore,"" he writes. ""I didn't care. He was elected president. Get over it.""
He goes on to compare those continuously crying about Clinton's defeat were, according to the Examiner, reminiscent of the ""complaints of spoiled children at a birthday party when they didn't win the relay race, and who wanted the race rerun with different rules, while stomping their feet, arms crossed, pinched faces crimson and wet with tears.""
Ellis also says that he'd gotten to a point where he's simply stare at such people ""while a tiny voice in the back of [his] head started sighing, 'You are the biggest f***ing baby I've ever f***ing heard in my entire f***ing life and please you've got to f***ing calm the f*** down.""
""I get it, I get it,"" he writes. ""You don't like f***ing Trump, but for f***'s sake, enough already for f***'s sake.""
The filmmaker and writer also, the Examiner reported, points to one incident in particular that he says highlights behaviors indicative of fascism: when White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant because of her affiliation with the Trump administration.
""The shunning of others who don't like you had moved past protest and resistance into childlike fascism,"" he writes. ""The different viewpoints were judged as immoral, racist, and misogynist.""
""[M]aybe when you're roiling in childish rage, the first thing you lose is judgment, and then comes common sense,"" he writes. ""And finally you lose your mind and along with that, your freedom."""
Watch: AOC narrates hilariously pie-in-the-sky video to promote her Green New Deal,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-aoc-narrates-hilariously-pie-in-the-sky-video-to-promote-her-green-new-deal,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has partnered with The Intercept to release an animated short film promoting her widely panned Green New Deal, in which she narrates her vision of America's future under the bold plan.
How does the future look to AOC?
The video is set from the future, and begins with an image of Ocasio-Cortez riding a bullet train from New York to D.C., gray streaks in her hair, and windmills in the landscape. She tells the story as if looking back on how America accomplishes greatness through the initiatives she has proposed.
After giving a brief history on the threat of climate change, the Congresswoman's utopic scenario includes Democrats taking the Senate and presidency in 2020, ""and launch[ing] the Decade of the Green New Deal, a flurry of legislation that kicked off our social and ecological transformation to save the planet.""
She also lauded the passage of ""Medicare for All, the most popular social program in American history,"" and ""the Federal Jobs Guarantee, a public option including dignified, living wages for work.""
""Funnily enough,"" Rep. Ocasio-Cortez says, ""the biggest problem in those early years was a labor shortage. We were building a national smart grid, retrofitting every building in America, and putting trains like this one all across the country. We needed more workers.""
The Congresswoman creatively weaves in scenarios where former oil workers ""took apart old pipelines and got to work planting mangroves with the same salary and benefits"" through unions, and how ""indigenous communities offered generational expertise"" in ""healing the land.""
Ocasio-Cortez also fanaticizes over a new Universal Childcare initiative, publicly funded election campaigns, and parts of Miami being forever under water after a hurricane.
Anything else?
The Democrat from New York is requesting the film be watched and shared widely, as time is of the essence."
Manhunt ends after Florida student 'fascinated' with Columbine and who made 'credible threats' during her 'pilgrimage' to Colorado is found dead,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-student-columbine-threat-found-dead,"A massive manhunt for an 18-year-old Florida woman, who was ""fascinated"" with the Columbine High School massacre and had made ""credible threats"" that led to the closure of several Colorado school districts, CNN reported , has ended.
Sol Pais was found with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Sheriff Jeff Shrader of Jefferson County, Colorado, said Wednesday.
The teenager made the threats during her ""pilgrimage"" to Colorado, according to special agent Dean Phillips of the Denver FBI office, CNN said.
What's the story? Pais purchased a plane ticket and flew from Florida to Colorado on Monday night, just days ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine shooting that left 13 dead on April 20, 1999, police said.
Pais' parents contacted Surfside Police Department Monday night and reported their daughter missing, the Miami Herald reported.
The teenager, who was a senior at Miami Beach Senior High School, was last seen wearing camouflage pants, black boots, and a black T-shirt, officials said.
Authorities in Miami contacted Colorado officials, which prompted the massive manhunt.
Immediately after she arrived in Colorado, Pais purchased a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, according to the FBI.
Dean Phillips, the special agent in charge of the Denver FBI office, said Pais had made ""credible threats"" following her arrival in the area, CNN reported.
The FBI's Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force reportedly described the teenager as ""infatuated with [the] Columbine school shooting"" in a bulletin on Tuesday. Pais was considered ""armed and dangerous,"" authorities said.
Nearly 20 school districts in the region canceled classes while authorities tried to locate her. After she purchased the firearm, Pais was last seen in the foothills west of Denver, according to authorities.
Phillips did not identify any specific threats against any school or district during a press conference Wednesday after the woman's body was found."
Beto O'Rourke likens Green New Deal to World War II — when America sacrificed and 'made this world safe for democracy',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/beto-likens-green-new-deal-to-world-war-ii,"Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke on Tuesday likened the Green New Deal touted by Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to the massive challenges of World War II when America ""made this world safe for democracy.""
'Existential challenge' Speaking on a stairwell to adoring students at the University of Virginia, O'Rourke said the Green New Deal ""calls to mind another time in this country's past when we faced an existential challenge. In that case it was to our way of life, to the Western democracies, to our allies in Europe, to our fellow Americans.""
He continued:
In the midst of the Great Depression, this country was willing to sacrifice — men and women, all over the United States — to make sure that we defeated Germany, and that we won that war. And for the next 75 years, we made this world safe for democracy. The Green New Deal calls that service and sacrifice and scale — scale of commitment — to mind when it talks about the challenges we face today. Ocasio-Cortez said similar things In January, Ocasio-Cortez made similar statements in front of an audience at a New York City church, saying ""millennials and Gen-Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up, and we're like, 'The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change, and ... your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?'""
She also said, ""And like, this is the war, this is our World War II.""

President Trump is preparing a rebuttal to the Mueller report,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/trump-is-reportedly-preparing-a-rebuttal-to-the-mueller-report,"The White House is reportedly planning a rebuttal to the Mueller report once it comes out on Thursday.
When will the report be released? In late March , Special Counsel Robert Mueller had informed Attorney General WIlliam Barr that he had reached the end of a nearly two-year-long investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller had been appointed in 2017 by then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after former-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself.
According to a summary released by Barr , ""[t]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""
But Barr also Quote: : d Mueller's report as saying ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""
Barr promised to release the full report to the American public in April, along with color-coded redactions . Each color would explain why that information had been hidden.
The report will be released on Thursday.
What happened now? According to a Fox News report from Wednesday, President Donald Trump's legal team is working on a rebuttal to the Mueller report, to defend against any accusations that Trump and his administration obstructed the investigation in any way.
""They assumed all along that there was going to be a finding of no collusion, so the rebuttal is about obstruction,"" Fox's unnamed source said. ""They are preparing a rebuttal to presumed allegations which will be refuted.""
Trump has long complained that Mueller's investigation is a ""witch hunt"" that was pushed by his political enemies.
Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani confirmed on Tuesday that the White House would be issuing a response, but did not go into detail about what that response might cover."
Watch: Qatari sociologist films tutorial demonstrating 'how Islam teaches how to beat your wife',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-qatari-sociologist-films-tutorial-demonstrating-how-islam-teaches-how-to-beat-your-wife,"Qatari sociologist Abd Al-Aziz Al-Khazra purportedly created a video demonstrating ""how to beat one's wife"" in accordance with Islam, and posted it to YouTube on March 29. Thanks to an English translation of excerpts by The Middle East Media Research Institute, Al-Khazra's teachings remain available for all to see (as of this writing), as they have been for weeks.
What are the details? In the clips provided by MEMRI on April 3, Al-Khazra explains to viewers that it is not necessary for a man to beat his wife, but if he does, ""he gives her a disciplinary beating out of love,"" reiterating, ""He loves her.""
""Now, let's see how Islam teaches how to beat your wife,"" the instructor says, and uses a young boy posing as ""the wife"" in his tutorial for proper technique.
""How should a husband beat his wife?"" Al-Khazra asks, rhetorically. ""First, he must 'admonish her' — in other words, he should advise her. Then, he should refrain from sharing a bed with her. If all of this doesn't help, we start the beating as a last resort.""
Facing the boy, whom he tells, ""Wait, don't move,"" Al-Khazra continues, ""The husband must make his wife feel his strength.""
Moving on to the actual demonstration, Al-Khazra asks the smiling boy, ""Why aren't you listening to me?! How many times do I have to tell you?! How many times do I have to tell you so you'll listen?! Didn't I tell you not to leave the house without my permission?!""
The instructor turns back to the camera at that point, saying, ""You see how? A little bit of rebuke...""
Then comes the physical part. Al-Khazra continues to berate his volunteer while showing the acceptable level of wife-beating by swatting the boy's arms. ""See how the beating is done?"" he asks his audience, telling them, ""The beating is light, brothers.""
By this time, the boy is chuckling as the instructor shakes him by the shoulders, reiterating again, ""You see, brothers? This is beating in Islam.""
Al-Khazra went on to explain that beatings should be painless, ""not leave bruises or cause bleeding,"" noting that he was showing ""the true gentle beating in Islam.""
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span class=""redactor-invisible-space""&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

Rep. Tlaib: ‘I’m more Palestinian in the halls of Congress than I am anywhere … in the world’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/tlaib-palestinian-in-halls-of-congress,"Video has surfaced of newly enshrined Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) proudly proclaiming that she feels more Palestinian in the U.S. Congress than anywhere in the world.
""Honestly, I've never felt more Palestinian than I ever felt in Congress,"" the Michigan congresswoman said in a speech earlier this week to the far-left Michigan Coalition for Human Rights. ""Even in Palestine when I'm visiting my grandmother, I'm more Amrikiin, American, to the Palestinians. But I'm more Palestinian in the halls of Congress than I am anywhere in the country, in the world. And that just tells you just the fact that they weren't ready for us. They really weren't.""
Speech by Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, Michigan Coalition for Human Rights, April 14, 2019 www.youtube.com
Tlaib proudly celebrated her Palestinian heritage, but when it comes to her Jewish colleagues and supporters of Israel, she rejects their right to do so, often using language that amounts to advancing anti-Semitic dog whistles and conspiracy theories. She has accused her colleagues in Congress who support Israel of having dual loyalties , a popular anti-Semitic canard that claims Jews are not sufficiently loyal to the United States.
Most of the Michigan congresswoman's tenure in the U.S. Congress has been highlighted by two primary issues: her advocacy for Palestinian priorities and her regular, but failed, attempts to build a coalition around impeaching President Trump.
On her first day in office, the ""Palestinian-American"" who was born in Detroit set a hostile tone toward the Jewish state when she wiped Israel off of her office map. Additionally, she has voiced support for the BDS movement, which seeks Israel's destruction.
Rep. Tlaib has maintained interesting allies in attempting to prioritize Palestinian causes in Congress. She is regularly photographed with the leaders of Islamist organizations and individual supporters of terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah , which, like Tlaib, seek Israel's destruction. And just last week, Tlaib hosted another terrorist-affiliated activist on Capitol Hill, the Daily Caller's Molly Prince reported Wednesday.
In March, Tlaib attempted to play the victim card when she claimed that someone who left a Post-It note asking her to ""stop the Jew hatred"" was "" bullying "" her.
Tlaib is a loyal ally to the Hamas-tied Council on American Islamic Relations. When she is not in Washington, D.C., Rep. Tlaib is usually jet-setting throughout the country on CAIR's nationwide fundraising circuit. It appears to be something of a quid pro quo, as the Michigan congresswoman received massive donations from individuals associated with CAIR and other Islamist organizations.
Tlaib introduced a congressional resolution in late March ""inquiring whether the House of Representatives should impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America."" The timing could not be worse, as the resolution was introduced just after Special Counsel Robert Mueller exonerated President Trump of unproven conspiracies — which were spawned by the Hillary Clinton campaign — that he conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election."
Pompeo: US will now allow citizens to sue Cuban government over lost property,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pompeo-allows-u-s-citizens-to-sue-cuban-government-over-lost-property,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that U.S. citizens will now be able to sue the Cuban government for property that had been confiscated.
Here's what we know Since the 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, Americans have been banned from suing the Cuban government for property that was confiscated by the Cuban government. This includes Cuban Americans who had their property stolen before fleeing to America.
Pompeo told the press on Wednesday that the Trump administration believed the time to repeal this law was long overdue:
[J]ust as we did in regard to moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the true capital of Israel, or designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for what it is, a terrorist organization, the Trump administration recognizes reality. We see clearly that the regime's repression of its own people and its unrepentant exportation of tyranny in the region has only gotten worse because dictators perceive appeasement as weakness, not strength. Pompeo accused former-President Barack Obama of playing ""footsy with the Castros' junta."" He said that these policies ""did not deter the regime from continuing to harass and oppress the heroic Ladies in White, a group of women dedicated to peacefully protesting the regime's human rights abuses."" He also listed off injustices committed by the Castro regime, including ""2,800 arbitrary arrests in 2018 alone"" and ""the country's recent sham constitutional referendum.""
Pompeo said that by ending the 1996 restriction, the administration was ""holding the Cuban Government accountable for seizing American assets"" and ""helping those whom the regime has robbed get compensation for their rightful property,"" as well as ""advancing human rights and democracy on behalf of the Cuban people.""
The new guidelines go into effect on May 2nd. Pompeo said that Congress had already been notified about the changes.
According to the Associated Press , there are currently around 6,000 of these claims that have been certified by the Department of Justice, and another 200,000 uncertified claims."
"Church issues apology after video emerges featuring pastor encouraging kids to hit, spit on, and knife him to show Jesus’ love",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/church-issues-apology-after-video-emerges-featuring-pastor-encouraging-kdis-to-hit-spit-on-and-use-knife-on-him-to-show-jesus-love,"An Ohio church is under fire after a video from one of its youth group events surfaced, showing the children spitting on, slapping, and using a knife on a pastor at his invitation.
The associate pastor, Jaddeus Dempsey, said that the exercise was part of a larger lesson on teaching the kids ""how much Jesus loved them.""
What are the details of the video The incident took place on Monday afternoon when Dempsey requested that kids at an after-school youth program at Impact City Church in Pataskala, Ohio, line up to perform various acts of disrespect and violence on him.
One of the people in attendance at the event filmed the incident, and the video made it to social media, where it made major waves.
In the video, Dempsey can be seen encouraging kids to spit in his face, then request that they slap him in the face, and finally, Dempsey can be seen encouraging some of the students to cut him on the back with a kitchen knife.
As the kids hoot, holler, and laugh, more and more line up to deliver spit and slaps to Dempsey's face.

Proposed Texas law would give grandparents a legal right to see their grandchildren,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/proposed-texas-law-would-give-grandparents-a-legal-right-to-see-their-grandchildren,"Proposed changes to a law in Texas would make it easier for grandparents to get visitation rights to their grandchildren, even if the child's parents disapprove.
Here's what we know The proposed changes would get rid of the current requirement that grandparents have an expert witness present testimony to back up their request for access, and a separate requirement that provides an exception only if the child's parent was dead, in jail, or legally declared to be incompetent.
Supporters of the bill defended it as being only about access, not about guardianship of a child. Texas resident Stephanie Wright told the Longview News-Journal Longview News-Journal that this bill would help them see their grandson, after daughter-in-law decided that they couldn't see him anymore ""for no reason."" Their son and daughter-in-law are describted as bieng ""estranged."" Wright said that the expert witnesses required by the current law could cost between $10,000 and $20,000.
But critics argue that there were cases where parents refuse access to grandchildren for valid reasons, and that this law would infringe on parental rights. Representatives of a Texas homeschool group reportedly particularly took issue with the term ""possession of or access to"" a grandchild.
According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram , opponents of the bill say that it would allow ""estranged in-laws"" to see their grandchildren, regardless of the parents' concerns.
Grandparents would still have to prove that it is in the child's best interest for them to see their grandchild, but with the exceptions removed the law is open ended enough that it would likely be difficult for parents to prove that this was not the case.
The bill is currently pending in the commitee."
Salmonella outbreak linked to raw tuna after people are sickened across 7 states,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cdc-salmonella-warning-raw-tuna,"U.S. health officials have issued a warning that a salmonella outbreak affecting 13 people across seven states was linked to raw, frozen tuna supplied by Jensen Tuna. Two of the sickened people were hospitalized due to their illnesses.
Louisiana-based Jensen Tuna voluntarily recalled packages of the frozen ground fish that may be contaminated with the bacteria that causes symptoms including diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps. Symptoms typically appear within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food.
Illnesses connected to the fish were reported between Jan. 8 to March 20, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control .
The company sold the frozen ground tuna fish packaged in one-pound bags and 20-pound boxes to wholesalers in Connecticut, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, New York, and Washington under lot numbers z266, z271, and z272, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
""Jensen Tuna distributed product to all the states where ill people were reported, but recalled product might have been redistributed to additional states,"" the CDC warned in a press release.
Jensen Tuna imported the ground fish from JK Fish of Vietnam.
What should restaurants do? Restaurants and retailers are advised to check with their suppliers to make sure they haven't purchased the possibly contaminated fish.
""If restaurants and retailers do not know if the frozen ground tuna they have is recalled, contact the distributor,"" the CDC said. ""When in doubt, don't sell or serve it.""
What about consumers? Before consuming sushi made with raw tuna or ""spicy tuna,"" consumers should ask the restaurant or grocery store if the fish was supplied by Jensen Tuna.
""If you are not sure if the tuna has been recalled, do not eat it,"" the CDC advised.
What else? There have been no deaths linked to the tuna reported. Most people recover from the illness in about four to seven days.
People who think they may have contracted salmonella after eating raw tuna should contact their health care provider.
The investigation is ongoing."
Hermain Cain says he won't bow out of consideration for Fed Reserve Board,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/herman-cain-will-not-bow-out-of-bid-for-fed-reserve-board,"Retired Godfather's Pizza CEO and former Kansas City Federal Reserve Chairman Herman Cain says he's not backing away from being vetted for consideration to serve on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, swatting away rumors that he would bow out due to insufficient GOP support.
What are the details? Cain sat down with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, telling the outlet he is ""very committed"" to seeing the process through, as the White House mulls his formal nomination as one of President Donald Trump's picks.
Last week, ABC News reported Cain was ""expected to withdraw,"" citing ""multiple sources familiar with the matter."" The outlet noted that a handful of Republican senators have publicly opposed Cain's appointment, meaning he likely won't have the votes for confirmation given the assumption he won't have the support of any Democrats.
According to multiple outlets , White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow gave Cain ""an out"" this week, when he said, ""I think at the end of the day it would probably be up to Herman Cain if he wants to stay in [the vetting] process or not.""
Cain agreed with that assessment, telling the Journal, ""What Kudlow was doing was giving me an out, and I appreciate that, but I don't want an out. I don't want an out.""
He went on to say he didn't think that meant the administration was wavering in its support of him as a candidate. ""You know that the president is a fighter, and Kudlow is a fighter,"" Cain added. ""They might be getting a lot of blowback from some folks, I don't know. But I don't think they're getting uncomfortable with it.""
Anything else? Mr. Cain ran for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2012, before dropping out amid sexual assault allegations."
Tim Ballard: Here's how much Congress actually cares about children at the border,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-radio/child-sex-trafficking-border,"On Wednesday's radio program, Glenn Beck sat down with Tim Ballard , who is CEO of Operation Underground Railroad , a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing an end to child sex trafficking. As a former special agent for the Department of Homeland Security's Crimes Against Children task force, Tim has fought firsthand against the evils of child trafficking for decades.
Tim talked about his recent testimony before the United States Congress and how they refused to listen to his common sense solutions to stop sex traffickers from smuggling of children across the US - Mexico border.
""What's happening is just overwhelmingly evil,"" Glenn said. ""You went to Congress prepared to give them two solutions. They didn't want to hear it. So, you never were allowed to even present these?""
""I was not allowed to, no,"" Tim said.
""It was clearly a political thing,"" he added. ""I've been open about the fact that barriers — we're not supposed to say the word 'walls' — but barriers of any kind clearly force traffic to ports of entry. And my No. 1 concern is children. I know how many children are smuggled or trafficked through wall-less or barrier-less parts of the border, so let's force the trafficker to go to where police or customs officials are, and they are trained to look for children. It's a very simple concept.""
He called for ""the good people on both sides"" of the political aisle to set politics aside and agree that saving these children is more important.
""Do we hate one person more than we love rescuing children?"" Tim asked. ""It's very discouraging.""

Former US Rep. Michele Bachmann: 'I have never seen a more biblical president than I have seen in Donald Trump',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-former-us-rep-michele-bachmann-i-have-never-seen-a-more-biblical-president-than-i-have-seen-in-donald-trump,"Former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) — an outspoken Christian who frequently infuriated liberals but also caught the ire of the likes of Glenn Beck and Fox News' Neil Cavuto while she was in office — said over the weekend she's ""never seen a more biblical president than I have seen in Donald Trump.""
Bachmann — who chose last year not to run for the U.S. Senate after retiring from her House seat in 2014 — made her Trump comments during an interview with ""Understanding the Times,"" a conservative Christian radio program for which she's a frequent guest.
What did Bachmann say?
After praising Trump's economic policies, deregulation efforts, and support of the pro-life cause and religious freedom, Bachmann said the president's move to allow persecuted Christians from other countries into America ""flipped on its head"" the policies of former President Barack Obama.
""We could go on what the president has done with standing for righteousness in so many areas,"" she added.
Transgenders in the military Bachmann also said Obama ""demanded and commanded that our military services had to literally go out and recruit people who are transgender to come into the military. Well, it costs about a quarter of a million dollars to do sex-reassignment surgery. Why would you recruit people who would come in and have sex-reassignment surgery and be on the sidelines? It made no sense, so Donald Trump got rid of that mandate and that requirement.""
Indeed, Trump's ban on transgenders in the U.S. military took effect last week, turning back Obama's policy , which itself was a reversal of a longstanding policy against transgenders in the armed forces.
'Highly biblical' Bachmann added that Trump ""has stood up where most Republicans wouldn't dare to stand up. Donald Trump has had the courage and the fortitude, and I will say to your listeners in my lifetime I have never seen a more biblical president than I have seen in Donald Trump.""
Calling Trump ""highly biblical,"" Bachmann also said ""we will in all likelihood never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetimes. So we need to be not only praying for him; we need to support him, in my opinion, in every possible way that we can.""
The relevant portion of Bachmann's interview begins after the 28-minute mark:
What else has Bachmann said about Trump? A few months before Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election, Bachmann said ""God raised up"" Trump to face off with Hillary Clinton .
""I don't think God sits things out. He's a sovereign God. Donald Trump became our nominee,"" she said at the time to the Christian Broadcasting Network.
Bachmann also cited Scripture in relation to her point: ""Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know, but I do know that the Bible is true and that Daniel teaches the most high God, which is one of God's names, is the one who lifts up who he will and takes down who he will.""
And six months into Trump's presidency, Bachmann remarked that he's a ""man of prayer, and a man who loves to receive prayer. He is a man who, I do believe, understands who the God of the Bible is, and he wants to lift up the God of the Bible here in the United States."""
12 year-old wakes up to find strange man undressing in her room — but her parents were armed,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/burglary-kentucky-and-shooting,"A 12 year-old girl got the fright of her life when she saw a strange man appear in her bedroom after breaking into her house, and drop his pants. Luckily for her, her mother's boyfriend was armed.
The harrowing story happened in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday morning at about 7 in the morning.
Tina Burton, the girl's mother, told WDRB what happened next.
""She was really smart,"" Burton said.
""She hid under the cover, turned her light down, turned her volume down on her phone to text me,"" she explained. ""When she peeked under the cover to see where he was at, she got up and ran away. She went to the back room. And I think that was really brave and smart of her.""
Burton and her boyfriend Ali Bracey said they confronted the man and yelled at him to leave their home.
He refused.
""He turned around and growled at me,"" said Bracey. ""And when he growled me, I dunno I attacked him.""
Bracey says he hit the man with a broom and punched him, and yelled to Burton to ""get something.""
""Next thing I know, he got shot!"" he said.
38 year-old Donald Oliver Jr. was shot 6 times and was later arrested by police. He has an extensive crime record and appeared in court in a wheelchair due to his injuries, which were not life threatening.
He has been charged with burglary, assault, and possession of a controlled substance. During the altercation he dropped a bag of what appeared to be heroin.
The family had only just moved to their new home two weeks before the incident. There were two other daughters in the home at the same time.
Bracey says his neighbors are supportive of what he did.
""Everyone has actually commended me on what I did. There hasn't been any real backlash other than the family,"" he said, referring to the family of the suspect. ""But everyone in the neighborhood has commended me on what I did.""

France to launch contest to determine design of new spire for damaged Notre Dame Cathedral,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/france-to-launch-contest-to-determine-design-of-new-spire-for-damaged-notre-dame-cathedral,"The French government will be launching a contest to design a new spire for the Notre Dame Cathedral after the old one was destroyed in a fire.
What happened? On Monday , the Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire. While much of the building's stone structure survived, the wooden roof and spire were destroyed and the rest of the building suffered serious damage. While an investigation is still ongoing, French authorities have said that they believe the fire was accidental.
Since the fire, billionaires and companies from around the world have pledge hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the cathedral's reconstruction.
What contest? On Wednesday , the French government announced that it would be holding a competition to redesign the roof of the building.
French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said he thought the contest could give Notre Dame ""a spire suited to the techniques and challenges of our time."" He also suggested that the contest could result in the building being reconstructed without a spire at all. ""The international competition will allow us to ask the question of whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc,"" he said, according to Reuters . He called the undertaking ""a historical responsibility.""
While the foundation for the cathedral was laid in 1163 , the spire was added during a restoration in the mid-1800s by Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc .
French President Emmanuel Macron said that he wanted to see the church rebuilt within five years ""more beautiful than before."" However, the cathedral's own rector said that the church would likely be closed to the public for up to six years due to a segment that "" has been very weakened ,"" so the actual timetable could be longer than that."
White House lawyers have discussed Mueller's findings with the Justice Department 'numerous' times: report - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-lawyers-have-discussed-muellers-findings-with-the-justice-department-numerous-times-report,"White House lawyers have reportedly had ""numerous"" discussions with Justice Department officials about the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, The New York Times reported.
Reports of these conversations surfaced shortly after reports that President Donald Trump was preparing a rebuttal to presumed findings in the report related to obstruction of justice. The redacted Mueller report is set to be released Thursday, with Attorney General William Barr having scheduled a press conference after the release to discuss it.
From The New York Times:
Justice Department officials have had numerous conversations with White House lawyers about the conclusions made by Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, in recent days, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The talks have aided the president's legal team as it prepares a rebuttal to the report and strategizes for the coming public war over its findings. What should we expect after the report is released? Was Barr's letter accurate? The first thing most observers will be looking for from the approximately 400-page report is whether the content of the report matches up with what Barr wrote in his four-page letter to Congress after the attorney general had reviewed it along with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
While Mueller did not draw an explicit conclusion about potential obstruction of justice, Barr wrote that he and Rosenstein determined, based on Mueller's evidence, that there was not cause to charge President Trump with obstruction. Mueller did clear the president of accusations that his campaign colluded with Russia.
Anonymous reports published by The New York Times claimed that Mueller team members believe the report to be more damaging to the president than Barr portrayed.
Who said what to who? The Times also reported that the pending release of Mueller's report has created some anxiety among people in the Trump administration who fear they could face retaliation for what they told Mueller's team for the investigation:
The report might make clear which of Mr. Trump's current and former advisers spoke to the special counsel, how much they said and how much damage they did to the president — providing a kind of road map for retaliation."

Kim called the development of the weapon ""an event of very weighty significance,"" according to the Korean Central News Agency.
The KCNA reported that Un supervised the firing of the weapon.
""After watching the power of the new-type tactical guided weapon, [Kim] pointed out that our national defense scientists and workers in the field of the munitions industry performed another great work in increasing the country's defense capabilities,"" they said.
President Donald Trump has had two meetings with the North Korean leader but neither have produced a substantive agreement on the goal of ""denuclearization"" of the regime.
The president has touted the talks, saying that they produced a peace that no other president had been able to complete.
""North Korea. That's moving along,"" the president said at an event in Minnesota on Monday.
""You know, when I came in there were missiles going on all over the place,"" he explained, ""there was nuclear testing. Mountains were being moved over a little bit. Mountains. They said boy that's terrible what's happening over there. They thought it was earthquakes, I said that's not an earthquake. That's called nuclear testing.""
""Right now it's moving along just perfectly,"" he said of the negotiations with Kim. ""We have a good relationship. The sanctions are on. We got our hostages back. We got our remains are coming back. And there's a lot of constructive things going on.""

Pres. Trump hits Fox News over number of Bernie Sanders supporters at town hall - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/pres-trump-slams-fox-news-over-number-of-bernie-sanders-supporters-at-town-hall,"President Donald Trump took a shot at Fox News, a network that he has had a positive relationship with, over the way it handled a recent town hall event with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Several videos from the event received widespread attention because they demonstrated a significant number of Sanders supporters in attendance and cheering for proposals like Medicare for All.
President Trump took issue with an allegedly high number of his supporters outside the studio while the Sanders fans were allowed in.
""Many Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the @FoxNews Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders,"" Sanders said. ""Big complaints about not being let in-stuffed with Bernie supporters. What's with @FoxNews?""
Sanders' town hall on Fox News earned extremely high ratings, dominating competing programming on other networks and outpacing town hall ratings for other 2020 candidates. From The Daily Beast :
According to early Nielsen data, more than 2.5 million viewers tuned in to hear Sanders, a self-described ""democratic socialist,"" make his case on Fox News during the 6:30 pm hour, prior to primetime. That total viewership bested CNN's Bernie Sanders town hall event from back in February, and it doubled MSNBC's during the same time period on Monday evening, and nearly tripled CNN's.
The prior town hall rating record for the 2020 cycle was a CNN-hosted event with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), which drew 1.95 million total viewers. Despite the Democratic National Committee refusing to have any Democratic debates on Fox News , Democratic candidates are showing interest in crossing over and speaking to a more conservative audience during the primary. Sanders' success will likely only add to that.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will hold a Fox News town hall next month. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is reportedly negotiating to go on Fox News, as is Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.). Beto O'Rourke has also expressed interest .

""He should let the full report speak for itself,"" the statement read.
""The Attorney General should cancel the press conference and provide the full report to Congress, as we have requested,"" they continued. ""With the Special Counsel's fact-gathering work concluded, it is now Congress' responsibility to assess the findings and evidence and proceed accordingly.""
Democratic pundits have been angrily denouncing the plan from Barr to give a media briefing about a document that has not been released yet.

Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Barr has been criticizing since releasing a summary of the Mueller report that said it did not exonerate the president but could not find sufficient evidence to support claims of collusion with the Russian government in the 2016 election.
Nadler had tweeted his misgivings about Barr's plans earlier on Wednesday.
""I'm deeply troubled by reports that the WH is being briefed on the Mueller report AHEAD of its release,"" he tweeted.

Fox News reported that Lamparello was carrying two cans of gas, two bottles of lighter fluid, and two butane lighters when he was stopped.
NYPD reportedly maintained a ""heavy presence"" around the cathedral even after Lamparello's arrest.

Sam also criticizes the LGBT community, among others, for not helping him after his life had spiraled out of control.
He faced a firestorm of public outcry and scrutiny when he was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in 2014, and cameras showed him kissing his then-fiance in celebration.
After playing for the Rams and being released, he was picked up by the Dallas Cowboys but was released without playing one down for the organization.
Sam says he began to abuse drugs and alcohol and lost control of his life.
When he found himself in a one-bedroom apartment in Dallas by the Fall of 2016, he reached out to the LGBT community who had championed him before, as well as other sports organizations and businesses.
Despite the previous support they had shown him, ""no one would give me a job,"" he said .
""Where was the support that I got for coming out?"" Sam added. ""I felt like I was used by everyone.""
He was partying, working out and hooked on cocaine. ""I felt lost and worthless,"" he said.
Sam has since stopped abusing hard drugs after an ayahuasca retreat in Peru. He is working to heal his broken relationship with his family.

University forced to cancel conference on prison reform after transgender activists issue threats,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/university-cancels-conference-due-to-threats-from-transgender-activists,"Open University in Milton Keynes, England, canceled a prison reform conference after transgender activism lobby groups issued threats against the event.
What are the details? The school and the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies co-organized the conference, which was set to take place in May.
More than 100 people had purchased tickets for the event, which was set to span two days.
According to the Telegraph , the school told attendees that the conference was called off in March after trans activist groups said that the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies was transphobic for its stance on segregating the housing of trans female prisoners and biologically female prisoners.
A source told the outlet, ""The Open University faced quite a significant pressure from transgender activists. They received a number of emails where some of the language was extraordinarily overheated.""
The source added, ""They were effectively being threatened with demonstrations and disruptive activity, possibly in the conference hall itself, and some kind of picket line or protest outside the conference.""
In a statement, the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies said, ""We are saddened to announce that the conference, Prison Abolition in the U.K., planned for 23 and 24 May, has been cancelled.""
""Unfortunately, one of our conference partners has, in recent weeks, been subjected to concerted pressure by those intent on disrupting the conference,"" the statement added. ""In the circumstances, they felt they had no option but to pull out.""
A spokesperson for the university said that the decision was made over concerns that the discussion ""was moving away from its main, originally intended, focus — to debate past, present, and future of prison abolition.""
What else? In March, England's first transgender prison wing opened for men identifying as women after reports of vicious sexual assaults forced the government change policies for trans inmates.
""Prisoner safety is our biggest concern and any decisions we take will seek to best manage the risks posed by each offender,"" a statement from a British Ministry of Justice spokesperson said. ""The wider management of transgender offenders is a highly sensitive issue which poses unique and complex challenges and we are determined to get it right. That's why we are reviewing the way we manage all transgender offenders.""
The government handed down a suggested directive calling for a majority of trans inmates to be incarcerated in prisons according to their preferred gender identity in 2016 after a male inmate identifying as a female raped two fellow female prisoners while incarcerated.

The shooting at Columbine shocked the nation to its core. Survivors Craig Scott and Evan Todd — two former students who were in the library of the school that fateful day — appear alongside other survivors in PureFlix.com's ""After Columbine"" series , revealing what they saw and experienced during and after the traumatic event.

""I went to the library to study for a test during my lunch period, and I was there with two friends,"" Scott said of his morning on April 20. ""I heard popping noises coming from outside the school.""
At first, Scott and Todd thought the sounds were part of a senior prank, but when a teacher frantically entered the library and told students to hide, they knew something else was happening.
The shooters soon entered the library, where much of the violence took place. Scott recalled being terrified in the midst of the unimaginable event.

Police say the suspect abducted and sexually assaulted the 15-year-old girl.
What are the details? Police pulled Juan Carlos Morales-Pedraza, reportedly in his mid-30s, over for a moving violation while driving westbound on I-80, WOIO-TV reported. One trooper told WTOL-TV something just ""didn't feel right"" about the situation.
Ohio State Highway Patrol say neither Morales-Pedraza nor the teen spoke English or had identification on them, but troopers were able to determine both were of El Salvadorian descent and brought a translator to the scene.
Police feared — and later confirmed — the suspect had sexually assaulted the girl. Once they were able to positively identify the teen, they found she was reported missing from Paterson, N.J. Investigators say Morales-Pedraza was transporting the girl to Chicago.
WTOL reported that the girl was a human-trafficking victim. She was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Anything else? According to state officials, Morales-Pedraza was living in the United States illegally and re-entered after previously being deported, the New York Post reported.
The suspect has been charged with abduction with sexual motivation and an immigration detainer, but the OSHP said further charges are pending."

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) put out a statement on Thursday asking that Special Counsel Robert Mueller testify before both houses of Congress ""as soon as possible.""
Here's what we know Mueller was investigating the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The full report, with redactions, is scheduled to be released on Thursday.
A four-page summary provided by Attorney General William Barr stated that ""[t]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" It also said that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Pelosi and Schumer accused Barr of trying to cover for the president.
In a joint statement , the two congressional leaders said:
Attorney General Barr's regrettably partisan handling of the Mueller report, including his slanted March 24th summary letter, his irresponsible testimony before Congress last week, and his indefensible plan to spin the report in a press conference later this morning — hours before he allows the public or Congress to see it — have resulted in a crisis of confidence in his independence and impartiality. We believe the only way to begin restoring public trust in the handling of the Special Counsel's investigation is for Special Counsel Mueller himself to provide public testimony in the House and Senate as soon as possible. The American people deserve to hear the truth. The White House is preparing its own response to the Mueller report, which will reportedly defend against accusations of obstruction that it expects to be levied against President Donald Trump. Barr held a press conference on Thursday shortly before the report became public."

""I think that we are going to see a number of protests. Anti-abortion protesters are going to show up at events throughout this primary, I have no doubt,"" Zerlina Maxwell said Wednesday on MSNBC Live. ""And so I think it's a test for Democrats, including Mayor Pete, about how they can handle that type of direct adversity.""
'If Jesus is so great, why aren't you nicer?' Maxwell then tore into Christians who openly oppose progressive ideals in support of LGBTQ rights and same-sex marriage.
""I was raise by two pastors, so while I am a progressive feminist, I've often debated folks who are citing the Bible and shouting out 'Sodom and Gomorrah,' that's something they always say,"" she continued. ""And I would always push back and say, 'Listen, if Jesus is so great, why aren't you nicer? Why aren't you kinder? Why aren't you more fair and kind to your neighbor and to your fellow human beings?' Jesus needs new PR. I mean, I always had that line when I growing up.""
Maxwell then praised Buttigieg as the ideal Christian.
""Because, honestly, I think what Mayor Pete is doing, is he's demonstrating how to actually be a Christian, to embrace people, to be more compassionate,"" she added. ""And I think that's an example that crosses partisan boundaries actually.""
Here's the clip:
What happened at the Buttigieg event? A pair of protesters at the Tuesday event in Fort Dodge, Iowa, shouted about Sodom and Gomorrah during Buttigieg's speech, the Hill reported . The biblical book of Genesis says God called out those cities due to ""grievous"" sins and destroyed them; traditionally Sodom and Gomorrah have been associated with homosexual acts .
However, the crowd of 1,650 people at Buttigieg's event shouted down the protesters and chanted his name, the Hill added.
""The good news is the condition of my soul is in the hands of God, but the Iowa caucuses are up to you,"" Buttigieg said after the first protester was removed, the outlet reported.
""Remember the beauty of our democracy,"" he said after the second protester was removed, the Hill noted. ""Everyone here gets the exact same voice and vote. Feels like the numbers are on our side.""
Anything else?
Buttigieg made huge headlines earlier this month when he targeted Vice President Mike Pence, who is opposed to gay marriage .
""If you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me,"" Buttigieg — who is married — said after referencing Pence. ""Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.""

Here's what was in the newly released Mueller report - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/heres-what-was-in-the-newly-released-mueller-report,"On Thursday, the Department of Justice released Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 400-page report , which had been more than two years in the making. Here are some of the highlights. The report seems to largely back up Attorney General William Barr's summary.
Mueller DID NOT find any prosecutable criminal activity between those on the Trump campaign and Russia According to the report:
[W]hile the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges....Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. He DID find evidence of people near the Trump campaign lying to the Department of Justice and to Congress The report did find that ""several individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign lied to the Office [of the Special Counsel], and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference."" Mueller specifically called out Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, campaign operative George Papadopoulos, former-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, and former-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort for lying during the investigation. This information had already been publicly known.
While Cohen, Manafort, and Papadopoulos all ended up facing jail time, they did so either because they lied under oath or because of past actions they had taken before they joined the Trump campaign.
But what about the obstruction of justice accusations? While the first part detailed the investigation into the possibility of collusion, the second part of the report looked into accusations that President Donald Trump had obstructed the investigation. Mueller listed numerous examples, including the firing of James Comey and the president's attempts to have former-Attorney General Jeff Sessions take over the investigation despite recusing himself.
After pointing out examples of Trump opposing the investigation, Mueller said that his office had ""determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgement"" and so ""did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct."" He added that ""if we had confidence after a thorough investigation that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement.""
He concluded with a line that had already been quoted in Barr's summary, which stated that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""
Trump had tried to get Mueller fired on more than one occasion The report says that when Mueller was first appointed, Trump told his advisors that it could be ""the end of his presidency.""
Mueller described an instance in June 2017 in which Trump tried to get White House Counsel Don McGahn to tell Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein [Sessions was still in office at the time but had recused himself from overseeing the investigation] that Mueller needed to be fired. According to the report, ""McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre."" The Saturday Night Massacre happened when former-President Richard Nixon's attorney general and deputy attorney general both resigned rather than comply with an order from the president to fire Watergate investigator Archibald Cox.
And McGahn wasn't the only one who refused such an order. The report said that the president had similarly asked Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, to pass on a message to Sessions telling him to limit the investigation. According to Mueller: ""Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.""

Surge in homeless people seeking shelter at San Francisco Airport raises security concerns,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/surge-in-homeless-at-san-francisco-airport,"A surge in homeless people seeking refuge inside San Francisco International Airport has raised security concerns and has officials searching for solutions to the problem.
Police contacts with homeless people have tripled over the past two years, according to public records obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle . In February, authorities received about 40 calls per day regarding homeless at the airport compared to about 12 a day in March 2017.
A former airport employee told KTVU-TV that she wouldn't walk around the airport alone during the early morning hours because she often encountered homeless individuals.
The problem at the airport is an additional layer to the homeless crisis affecting the Bay Area.
How do they end up at the airport? The majority arrive at the terminal in the middle of the night by train, according to officials.
The Bay Area Rapid Transit requires people to get off the train when it goes out of service for the night.
""Bottom line, this particular arrival at night is an area of focus as a disproportionate number of riders on trains are homeless,"" SFO spokesman Doug Yakel told the Chronicle. ""We've been working with BART to examine where trains terminate for the night, and we've also requested that BART sweep trains for homeless before they arrive at SFO.""
Armando Sandoval, police crisis intervention team coordinator for BART, said he isn't surprised by the problem.
""I think it's typical of migrating homeless. It could be buses, trains or subway trains,"" Sandoval told the newspaper. ""They spend time on the trains and forget where they are and end up at the end-of-the-line locations.""
What else is being done? Airport officials are considering short- and long-term options to move homeless out of the airport.
""We might make SamTrans tokens available to them,"" airport spokesperson Doug Yakel said. ""We might, if they're eligible, transport them to a nearby homeless shelter, if BART is still running we can give them a token to a BART train.""
But there are still limits since the city lacks enough shelters for an estimated homeless population of more than 28,000, according to Fox News. The majority are believed to be living on the streets.
Yakel said airport officials hope to find ways to help those they encounter.
""Ultimately we want to develop advocacy that finds the proper channels for these individuals,"" Yakel told the newspaper. ""So, we're starting to reach out to homeless advocacy in San Mateo County. We're looking to set up something with the city of San Francisco as well."""
Carbon monoxide detectors to be required in public housing after NBC News investigation,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/carbon-monoxide-detectors-to-be-required-in-public-housing-after-nbc-news-investigation,"The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will start requiring carbon monoxide detectors in public housing, following a NBC News investigation .
Here's what we know The investigation , which was published on March 1, found that at least 13 deaths had occurred from carbon monoxide poisoning in public housing since 2003. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless, and highly toxic gas that is almost impossible to notice without a detector. It can leak from certain household appliances and car exhaust .
While slightly more than a dozen deaths in 15 years may not seem like a lot, they could have been prevented with proper detection. Amazon sells detectors online for as little as seven dollars each . Many modern smoke detectors will also detect the presence of carbon monoxide.
According to HUD, 400 people die each year across the United States from carbon monoxide poisoning.
""A simple, inexpensive, widely available device can be the difference between life and death,"" HUD Secretary Ben Carson said in a Thursday press release . ""Given the unevenness of state and local law, we intend to make certain that CO detectors are required in all our housing programs, just as we require smoke detectors, no matter where our HUD-assisted families live.""
These new regulations will also cover privately owned federally subsidized housing.
Some states already require some buildings to have carbon monoxide detectors, but the regulations are inconsistent between states and, according to NBC News, not always enforced. HUD's new regulations once implemented, would ""require working CO detectors in all HUD-subsidized housing programs nationwide.""
Until a formal rule can be put in place, HUD is ""strongly encouraging"" public housing owners, managers, and agents to install and maintain carbon monoxide detectors in all housing, especially those ""with fuel-fired/burning appliance(s), and/or an attached garage."""

Special Counsel Robert Mueller said in his report that President Donald Trump once tried to have him fired, but White House Counsel Don McGahn refused to go through with the order.
Here's what we knowf According to the report , when Mueller was first appointed in May 2017, Trump told his advisers that it would be ""the end of his presidency"" and tried to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign but later recanted and refused to accept his resignation. Trump also suggested that Mueller had conflicts of interest.
Mueller wrote that exactly a month later, on June 17, 2017, ""the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein]"" — Sessions was still attorney general but had recused himself from the investigation — ""and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.""
The Saturday Night Massacre happened when former-President Richard Nixon's attorney general and deputy attorney general both resigned rather than comply with an order from the president to fire Watergate investigator Archibald Cox.
The report says that when the media reported that Trump was trying to end the investigation, Trump ""denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story""
McGahn left the Trump administration in late 2018.
Mueller said that Trump had also asked Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, to pass on a message to Sessions telling him to limit the investigation. These messages also went undelivered, according to the report: ""Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.""
The report also details multiple occasions where Trump tried to get Sessions to ""reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation."" Sessions had recused himself from all matters related to the Trump campaign, since he had been a Trump campaign surrogate."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted her response to the release of the Mueller report on Thursday, and said that she now backs impeachment, which she had previously shrunk from endorsing.

""As such, I'll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib's impeachment resolution,"" she concluded.
Ocasio-Cortez added a link to a section from the Mueller report and analysis from the Washington Post that said that Mueller's team left it up to Congress ""about how to handle their evidence of Trump engaging in obstruction.""
She had previously been non-committal about impeachment, saying at one point that she would go along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) about the process not being ""worthwhile.
Later she cited the political difficulty of impeaching the president.
""I think what's tough is, impeachment in principle is something I openly support,"" Ocasio-Cortez said . ""But it's also just the reality of having the votes in the Senate to pursue that. And so that's something that we have to take into consideration.""
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday that impeachment was not worthwhile, echoing Pelosi's earlier sentiments.

1930s mural showing only white people removed from middle school since it doesn't reflect 'diversity' of student body,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/1930s-mural-showing-only-white-people-removed-from-middle-school-since-it-doesnt-reflect-diversity-of-student-body,"A Chicago-area middle school has removed a 1930s mural that depicts only white people after parents and students complained it didn't ""reflect or represent"" the ""diversity"" of the student body, the Chicago Tribune reported .
The 1937 mural by Ethel Spears was created through the Works Progress Administration, according to the New Deal Art Registry . The paper said ""Child and Sports — Winter"" had been displayed in the Julian Middle School in Oak Park since the school's 2002 construction.
What did the school's principal have to say? Principal Todd Fitzgerald sent a letter to families saying the mural was removed from the school's commons Saturday, the Tribune reported.
""I have recently had a number of conversations with students and parents about the mural,"" Fitzgerald wrote, according to the paper. ""The students and parents who approached the administration felt that the mural did not reflect or represent the diversity of our student body, school or community. As a district, we are working diligently to achieve equity and promote a greater sense of inclusion and belonging in all of our schools. With these goals and the concerns of our families in mind, we decided to pursue the removal of the mural.""
Image source: Barbara Bernstein/New Deal Art Registry, used by permission
Since the WPA mural is owned by the federal government, officials said the school had to take steps to meet legal requirements for its removal and preservation, the Tribune noted.
What did the New Deal Art Registry have to say? Barbara Bernstein of the New Deal Art Registry told the paper she agrees the mural doesn't match Oak Park's present-day demographics but still views it as a possible learning tool.
""I think middle school children can understand that you have to look at art from the past with a little indulgence,"" Bernstein added to the Tribune. ""The details are old-fashioned, the clothes are funny, it's mostly all boys who are skating, and there are few people of color in Oak Park at that time. That doesn't make it worthless. Instead of removing these murals, let's add new ones that bring the picture of life in Oak Park up to date.""
She added to the paper that the WPA put artists back to work during the Great Depression: ""The Chicago area has many of these murals in post offices, libraries and schools. They are treasures from the past. They remind us of a time when things were tough, but people were optimistic. We should respect and cherish them.""
'It removes our history' David Sokol — professor emeritus of American Art, Modern Art, and Museology at the University of Illinois at Chicago — told the Tribune he's concerned about the precedent set by removing the artwork.
""This was simply a fact of what the community looked like in 1937,"" Sokol noted to the paper. ""It doesn't show anyone in a bad light. I think it's tragic. It removes our history. Taking it out of the education system is censorship and eradication. Kids could put on plays, build it into literature, theater, or a new art project. They could develop their own writings to say how they feel about it. There's opportunities for education or having a new mural to contrast it.""
Anything else?
Fitzgerald told the Tribune that school officials will be talking to students about the mural, its historical context, the reasons for its removal, and the next steps for replacing it.
More from the paper:
Fitzgerald said the school's Social Justice Club has approached administrators about possibly replacing the piece with something created by the students with the help of art teachers and community members. School officials said those conversations will take place in the coming weeks. ""We do not currently have a set plan or timeline in place,"" Fitzgerald added to the paper, ""but intend to keep the community engaged in and updated about the process as we move forward."""

How did Twitter users react? As you might expect, Library Journal's tweet got ""ratioed,"" with replies (nearly 8,000) far outnumbering likes (just over 800) as of Thursday afternoon. Here's how some commenters reacted:
""And this is why I've started collecting hardbacks of classic literature. We're not far before the serious calls for book burnings start."" ""In a few years you're going to have to bury fine literature in the garden and stuff currency in the mattress. I think liberals are confusing Progressive with Regressive."" ""You are a complete embarrassment."" ""I'm not sure if this is more insane or more racist. It is a ton of each! It is strange that a seemingly serious publication like Library Journal would want to be associated with such obvious trash."" ""Is this a joke? Library Journal is coming out against the fact that, in libraries, there are library books?"" But not everyone saw it that way:
""As a library professional with 20+ years experience in collections, I'm grateful for this astute and helpful piece. Essential to have conversations that move our work forward, not shut it down like so many hateful comments here."" ""A great article about the important balance that must be struck in modern library collections. Detractors appear not to understand the first thing about building literacy in children and communities."" Library Journal on Thursday didn't immediately respond to TheBlaze's request for comment on reactions to its tweet.
What did the blog post say? Sofia Leung — whose Twitter bio indicates she's an academic librarian who likes ""intersectional feminism"" and ""social justice"" — penned a blog post Monday titled "" Whiteness as Collections .""
Leung noted that she spent some time with an ""amazing librarian of color whose thinking continues to push me"" and ""one of the mind-blowing things she shared was this idea of how our library collections, because they are written mostly by straight white men, are a physical manifestation of white men ideas taking up all the space in our library stacks.""
She also wrote that ""libraries and librarians have a long history of keeping People of Color out"" and ""continue to do so,"" adding that ""legal and societal standards revolve around whiteness and libraries are no different.""
More from Leung's blog post:
If you look at any United States library's collection, especially those in higher education institutions, most of the collections (books, journals, archival papers, other media, etc.) are written by white dudes writing about white ideas, white things, or ideas, people, and things they stole from POC and then claimed as white property with all of the ""rights to use and enjoyment of"" that [Cheryl I.] Harris describes in her [ 1993 Harvard Law Review ] article. When most of our collections filled with this so-called 'knowledge,' it continues to validate only white voices and perspectives and erases the voices of people of color. Collections are representations of what librarians (or faculty) deem to be authoritative knowledge and as we know, this field and educational institutions, historically, and currently, have been sites of whiteness.
""Library collections continue to promote and proliferate whiteness with their very existence and the fact that they are physically taking up space in our libraries. They are paid for using money that was usually ill-gotten and at the cost of black and brown lives via the prison industrial complex, the spoils of war, etc. Libraries filled with mostly white collections indicates that we don't care about what POC think, we don't care to hear from POC themselves, we don't consider POC to be scholars, we don't think POC are as valuable, knowledgeable, or as important as white people. To return to the Harris quote from above, library collections and spaces have historically kept out Black, Indigenous, People of Color as they were meant to do and continue to do. One only has to look at the most recent incident at the library of my alma mater, Barnard College, where several security guards tried to kick out a Black Columbia student for being Black."" What did the blog author have to say? TheBlaze on Thursday attempted to contact Leung without immediate success. Her blog's ""about"" page cannot be found, and her Twitter page has been protected. It's unclear if those statuses were in effect before the Library Journal tweet came into focus."

He then blamed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for allowing that to happen.
What does the report say? The report says , on Page 78 of Volume 2:
According to notes written by [Sessions's Chief of Staff Jody] Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, ""Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I'm f***ed."" The president became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse himself from the investigation, saying, ""How could you let this happen, Jeff?"" The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had ""let [him] down,"" contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him ""you were supposed to protect me,"" or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said ""Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me. After this interaction, Trump reportedly told Sessions to resign. Sessions agreed, but Trump ultimately changed his mind and refused to accept his resignation.
White House Counsel Don McGahn had warned Trump that ""knocking out Mueller"" would only end up being ""[a]nother fact used to claim obst[ruction] of just[ice],"" the report stated.
Despite McGahn's warnings, a month after this incident, Trump asked McGahn to tell Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ""that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed ."" McGahn refused to comply ""deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.""
Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was also reportedly asked to carry out a similar order, according to Mueller. However, ""Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through."""
German court charges 92-year-old Nazi concentration camp guard for aiding and abetting thousands of murders,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/german-court-charges-92-year-old-nazi-guard,"Prosectors in Hamburg, Germany, have charged a 92-year-old man for aiding and abetting at least 5,230 murders of men, women, and children at the Stutthof concentration camp near Gdansk, Poland.
The man, who has been identified only as Bruno D., allegedly stood guard at the camp's watchtower for nine months when he was 17 years old, i24 News reported. He was assigned to security duty after a heart condition kept him from fighting on the front lines, according to the Independent.
More than 60,000 people, including 28,000 Jews, died at the camp during World War II. The case will be one of the last ever to be tried involving Nazi-era war crimes.
What are the details? The former SS man worked at the camp from Aug. 9, 1944, to April 26, 1945. Three days after Bruno D. left the camp, Germany surrendered to the Allies.
Bruno D. told prosecutors he did not actively participate in the killings at the camp where many died of starvation, cold, or execution.
But he reportedly admitted during a voluntary interrogation last summer that he witnessed people being taken to the gas chambers to be murdered and bodies being taken to the crematorium.
""What good would it have done for me to leave? They'd just have found somebody else,"" he told prosecutors in July, according to Die Welt newspaper.
He also claimed that he was not a Nazi sympathizer.
""I felt sorry for the Jews,"" Bruno D. said. ""I have harmed the people who were there. I did not know why they were there.
""I knew well that those were Jews who had committed no crime. Those who were only there because they were Jews. And they have the same right to live and work like any other person,"" Bruno D. continued. ""But that was just Hitler or his party who were against it, who had anything against Jews and wanted to root out that tribe.""
The former guard went on to become a trained baker.
What else? Last year, the case against 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, also a former SS guard at Stutthof, was halted. He was deemed too sick to continue to stand trial, according to the Guardian ."
Attorney General William Barr embarrasses CBS News reporter after she questions if he’s trying to protect President Donald Trump,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/attorney-general-william-barr-embarrasses-cbs-news-reporter-after-she-questions-if-hes-trying-to-protect-president-donald-trump,"Attorney General William Barr quickly and concisely shut down a CBS News reporter during a press conference on Thursday.
The conference concerned the new release of the redacted version of the report compiled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in regard to alleged Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.
What are the details? During the conference, Barr doubled down on his initial remarks that neither President Donald Trump nor anyone in his campaign engaged in any collusion.
After confirming that information with the release of redacted version of the report, Barr said, ""the special counsel found no evidence that any American, including anyone associated with the Trump campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.""
He went on to take questions from the media present at the conference.
One reporter, Paula Reid from CBS News, went on to point out that she felt Barr has been biased in favor of Trump and appeared to be going out of his way to protect the president.
""You cleared the president on obstruction, the president is fundraising off of your comments about spying, and, here you have remarks that are quite generous to the president, including acknowledging his feelings and his emotions. So what do you say to people on both sides of the aisle who are concerned that you are trying to protect the president?"" Reid asked.
Barr responded that his very comments are published in the Mueller report.
""Well actually, the statement about his sincere beliefs are recognized in the report, that there was substantial evidence for that,"" he answered, ""so I'm not sure what your basis is for saying that I am being 'generous' to the president.""
Ready with an answer of her own, Reid answered, ""It's an unprecedented situation. It just seems like there is a lot of effort to say — to go out of your way, to acknowledge ...""
Barr took the opportunity to cut her off, and fired back, ""Well is there another precedent for it?""
Reid conceded that there was not.
""OK,"" Barr responded. ""So unprecedented is an accurate description.""
Reid attempted to regain control of the question, but Barr was apparently unimpressed with the reporter's efforts and moved on to take other questions.

North Carolina’s Democratic governor vetoes anti-infanticide legislation. Will pro-lifers be able to override him?,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nc-democrat-governor-vetoes-anti-infanticide-bill,"North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a state-level anti-infanticide bill Thursday morning.
Senate Bill 359 was passed out of the North Carolina House of Representatives and sent to Cooper earlier this week. Like similar federal legislation that is currently the subject of a discharge petition in the House of Representatives, it is titled the "" Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. ""
The North Carolina legislation would have required that children who survive botched abortion attempts be given the same degree of lifesaving medical care ""as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age."" Failure to do so would have been classified as a felony punishable with a fine of up to $250,000.
""Laws already protect newborn babies and this bill is an unnecessary interference between doctors and their patients,"" a statement from Cooper's office said. ""This needless legislation would criminalize doctors and other healthcare providers for a practice that simply does not exist.""
In reality, current federal law passed in 2002 declares that abortion survivors are legal persons, but impose no legal penalties for medical professionals who willfully deny them lifesaving care after the fact.
""The day before Good Friday, Governor Cooper has chosen to stand with infanticide and extremist groups like Planned Parenthood and NARAL over life,"" North Carolina Republican communications director Jeff Hauser said in a statement. ""It is grotesque to think that Cooper believes providing care to infants born alive during an abortion procedure is 'an unnecessary interference between doctors and their patients.'""
And contrary to the bill's opponents' talking points about the legislation's supposed affects on abortion access, it would have imposed no restrictions on abortion procedures or time limits before a child is born. It literally applied to only newborns outside the womb.
""Caring for a living, breathing, newborn infant is too restrictive for Governor Cooper's radical abortion agenda,"" the legislation's sponsors said in a press release . ""We thought Democrats would agree that children born alive should be separate from the abortion debate, but it's clear that they want the 'right to choose' to even extend past birth. This is a sad day for North Carolina.""
The measure passed by a vote of 65-46 in the state House and by a vote of 28-19 in the Senate.
While many of Cooper's vetoes have been overridden by the GOP-controlled legislature, this is the first he's issued since Republicans lost a veto-proof supermajority in November. And while a handful of Democrats voted in favor of the legislation, it remains unclear whether pro-lifers will have enough bipartisan support to override the veto."

""What we've learned today is that Attorney General Barr deliberately distorted significant portions of Special Counsel Mueller's report,"" the statement read.
""Special Counsel Mueller's report paints a disturbing picture of a president who has been weaving a web of deceit, lies and improper behavior and acting as if the law doesn't apply to him,"" they continued. ""But if you hadn't read the report and listened only to Mr. Barr, you wouldn't have known any of that because Mr. Barr has been so misleading.""
The statement goes on to identify four lies the Democratic leaders are accusing Barr of making.
1) Whether the Office of Legal Counseling helped Mueller decide against an indictment on obstruction.
2) Whether the report has evidence of President Donald Trump obstructing justice or not.
3) Whether the president cooperated fully with Mueller's investigation.
4) That Barr omitted members of the Trump administration not reporting attempts by the Russian government to collude with their campaign.
""For these reasons,"" they concluded, ""it is imperative that the rest of the report and the underlying documents be made available be made available to Congress and that Special Counsel Mueller testify before both chambers as soon as possible.""
The pair had released a statement earlier in the day with the demand, but added their reasons later.
The Mueller report was released on Thursday with several redactions. Some Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have already called for Trump's impeachment based on what they read in the report.

13-year-old girl dies after dad admitted to shaking her as a newborn baby. Now he faces homicide charges.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/13-year-old-girl-dies-after-dad-admitted-to-shaking-her-as-a-newborn-baby,"A Pittsburgh-area father convicted of shaking his infant daughter in 2005 now faces homicide charges after his daughter — now 13 years old — died.
What are the details? Ariden Jackson, 37, admitted to shaking his daughter during a 2005 feeding because she wouldn't stop crying. Jackson made the admission that same year, and was convicted on related charges.
Doctors later diagnosed his daughter — who was four weeks old at the time of the incident — with a seizure disorder as a result of the trauma. Specialists at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh said that her 2005 injuries were ""likely to cause long-term developmental disability.""
Jackson, who was 23 years old at the time of the incident, told investigators that he shook his daughter at least four times during the feeding because his wife was napping and ""he was frustrated, angry and unfortunately took it out"" on the child. He pleaded guilty to to aggravated assault and reckless endangerment and was sentenced to five to 10 years. Jackson served 10 years in prison and was released in 2016.
Janiya, the 13-year-old girl, was in the care of a family friend and passed away in February as a result of the complications she suffered in connection with the seizure disorder.
Thirty-nine year-old Leshaun Byrd, who used to date Janiya's mother, took the child in five years ago.
""She's been with me for the past five years,"" Byrd told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette . ""I just couldn't see her going into care. Being that I knew the child and had a relationship with the child, I just decided to take her in.""
Byrd told the outlet that Janiya loved car rides, music, peanut butter, Béyonce, and bowling. Janiya was only able to speak a few words as a result of her disorder.
""She talked very little, but she would tell you if she was happy or sad by her smile,"" Byrd said. ""She couldn't tell you she was having a bad day, she would just act out. Most of the time, she was a great child.""
Byrd also revealed that Janiya loved hamburgers and hot dogs, and visited Disney World.
Byrd said that he was glad authorities were charging her father with homicide.
""He didn't afford that little girl an opportunity to grow up and be a child and enjoy her youth,"" Byrd said. ""Most of her life she was in and out of hospitals. Some days she'd have short seizures, most of the time it was long seizures, and there were times she stopped breathing and we had to perform CPR.""
According to the Post-Gazette, Jackson had not yet been arrested on the new charge as of Wednesday. Authorities are still searching for Jackson and ask anyone who sees him to call 911."
"Sorry Chrissy Teigen, 'f*** you' aren't the two words women should use more",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/sorry-chrissy-teigen-f-you-arent-the-two-words-women-should-use-more,"""If there was one word you would help, particularly women, use more frequently, what would that one word be?""
""F*** you.""
This was model-turned activist Chrissy Teigen's answer to a question asked by former MSNBC host and moderator Melissa Harris-Perry during a three-day policy retreat for House Democrats in Washington last week.
Harris-Perry's question to Teigen was predicated on Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) suggestion that women should say the word ""no"" more often.
Teigen's husband, singer and songwriter John Legend, added to the praise his wife received from the crowd following her response, then bragged on stage about how his wife was the first celebrity to begin slighting the president as if it were something to be proud of.
""Chrissy was ahead of the curve on making fun of Donald Trump. She knew before a lot of people did that he was a joke and a conman and a clown,"" Legend said.
Teigien and Legend were at the forum to discuss a variety of topics including handling the social media trolling that comes with newfound fame and President Donald Trump's behavior on Twitter, which is ironic because Teigen disparages the president so regularly on Twitter that he actually blocked her last year.
Teigen later clarified on Twitter that even if women don't use the exact words she suggested — ""f*** you"" — women should adopt that attitude with ""your eyes"" and ""your vote.""
While many modern women take Teigen's suggestion as some sort of nod to women's empowerment, Teigen's suggestion does nothing to empower women.
Adopting that attitude and language does little to advance her cause because it only stifles any potentially meaningful conversations that could have otherwise taken place. She also turns off about half the country who hears it.
If language and attitudes like these actually benefited human relationships, there'd be no need to teach conflict resolution in schools, the workplace, or in the home.
The reality is that flippant anger will get women nowhere; in fact, it's counter-productive. Of all the words available for ""empowering women,"" progressives have for the most part chosen words that are steeped in anger, aggression, and hostility — and ""no"" and ""f*** you"" are just the latest examples.
For instance, at the first annual Women's March in Washington, D.C., following Donald Trump's election, Madonna admitted in a speech to several thousand women that not only was she angry at the the results of the election but also that she thought ""an awful lot about blowing up the White House.""
Her remarks quickly circulated the web, and a few days later, the Material Girl was forced to address her comments in an Instagram post where she claimed she wasn't a violent person and that her words were taken out of context.
""It's important people hear and understand my speech in its entirety rather than one phrase taken wildly out of context,"" she said. ""I shared two ways of looking at things — one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage, which I have personally felt. However, I know that acting out of anger doesn't solve anything. And the only way to change things for the better is to do it with love.""
Comedian Kathy Griffin went even further when she infamously posted a picture of herself holding up a mocked up version of the president's decapitated head, for which she quickly received blowback.
Even though she apologized, she backtracked that apology then blamed Trump supporters for the backlash.
Her conduct, which she claimed was meant to be satirical, became a stain on her career. In later interviews Griffin said she received death threats, was under investigation, and had her comedy tour canceled because of the gruesome photo.
The president, understandably, didn't appreciate the effect her distasteful attempt at comedy had on his youngest son, Barron Trump.
""Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!"" the president tweeted.
And then there's comedian Samantha Bee, host of ""Full Frontal,"" who dubbed Ivanka Trump a "" feckless c**t "" during a segment criticizing the administration's immigration policy regarding family separations.
Even by today's standards, the language Bee used was seen as so repulsive that the Emmy-nominated host was forced to issue an apology and was unsure she'd survive the backlash.
However, Bee told the Daily Beast that the only reason she apologized for her conduct was because it took away from the message she wanted to convey.
Many philosophers, moral teachers, and leading thinkers throughout history have given clear warnings about the dangers of allowing anger to guide our behavior.
In James 1:19 (NIV), James, the brother of Jesus, advised fellow believers to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
Aristotle even said, ""Anyone can become angry — that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way — that is not within everybody's power and is not easy.""
While contemporary society perversely praises women for presenting a ""f*** you"" attitude toward those who have different political opinions or the omnipresent patriarchy, it's important to remember that women don't need to be aggressive to get their ideas or agendas across.
Women can be tough, assertive, and persuasive without unnecessary aggression or vulgarity.
Whether feminists or progressives choose to acknowledge the teachings in the Bible, there is something to be said for women who hold themselves to paramount standards instead of society's.
Margaret Thatcher, the first female prime minister of Britain, is a monumental example of the notion that women can be stern and effective leaders in the face of hostility and resistance without vulgarity or anger.
Thatcher, who was often criticized by feminists for not putting the political plight of women at the forefront of her agenda, often faced sexism herself, but she never responded to the prejudice in a manner that would take away from the goals of her party.
In 1 Peter 3:1 (NIV), Peter makes the case that a woman's gentle and quiet spirit has the power to transform even the hardest of hearts:
Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives. This is a very countercultural idea because today's society teaches women that the only way to advance alongside and above men and to be strong is to be loud, angry, and aggressive. But really that aggression is often just a mask for insecurity.
Contemporary women, especially those who identify as feminists, would reject this Biblical notion of womanhood because they mistakenly believe the Bible calls for women to be fully submissive to and below men but that's not what the Biblical notion of womanhood means.
It means setting an example in the home and community by conducting themselves in such a way that's so admirable and respectable that it's contagious.
Instead of giving the media and young women an unhelpful soundbite, Teigen and those with platforms as large as her own should reiterate that it's possible to be assertive, resilient, and effective without being vulgar.
Washington is a place where powerful women each and every day step out into the halls of Congress and effect change through honest debate, the exchange of ideas, hard work, and respectable conduct."
"Conservative Christians take a stand for Chick-fil-A after airport bans restaurant, say they’ll support the ‘God-honoring company’",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/conservative-christians-take-a-stand-for-chick-fil-a,"A group of conservative protesters held a "" Save Chick-fil-A Day "" at the Texas state Capitol after the San Antonio Airport banned the restaurant over its ""legacy of anti-LGBTQ"" behaviors .
What's a brief history? In March, the San Antonio City Council rejected a bid for a Chick-fil-A site at the airport. Councilman Robert Treviño said that the council's decision was based on inclusivity.
""With this decision, the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of equality and inclusion,"" he said. ""San Antonio is a city full of compassion, and we do not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.""
""Everyone has a place here,"" he added, ""and everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport.""
The restaurant issued a statement insisting that they would ""still welcome the opportunity to have a thoughtful dialogue with the city council.""
The Texas attorney general opened an investigation into whether the city council and airport ""violated Chick-fil-A's religious liberty"" in banning them from being included in a food and beverage agreement at the facility.
What are the new details? The conservative group, Texas Values , stood up for the Christian-founded restaurant and asked lawmakers to support two bills prohibiting the state from penalizing business owners on ""grounds of religious faith,"" according to Fox News .
According to Texas Values' website, the organization's mission is to ""preserve and advance a culture of family values in the state of Texas."" The organization also aims to ""stand for biblical, Judeo-Christian values by ensuring Texas is a state in which religious liberty flourishes, families prosper, and every human life is valued.""
The group converged on the Texas Capitol in Austin on Wednesday to encourage lawmakers to support the bills.
Texas H.B. 1035 — or the "" Free to Believe Act "" — ""would create protections for sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions, which a person or entity may then use to discriminate against same-sex couples and transgender individuals,"" according to Rewire News.
The bill ""would prohibit a governmental entity from taking any adverse action against any person based wholly or partly on a person's belief or action in accordance with the person's sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction, including beliefs or convictions regarding marriage,"" the outlet reported .
A Facebook event page for the meeting said , ""This egregious attack follows a growing trend of anti-Christian intolerance and bigotry by the government against Christians for simply living out their faith and holding to the biblical truth about marriage and sexuality.""
""No Texas business or individual should ever be punished for practicing their faith,"" the post added.
The organization also called for residents to frequent their local Chick-fil-A franchise to support the ""God-honoring company.""
Texas Values President Jonathan Saenz told the the Dallas Morning News , ""This Legislature — this House and this Senate — has an opportunity to hold the San Antonio City Council accountable and make it clear that you should not discriminate based on religious beliefs.""
""Save Chick-fil-A and help us support religious freedom,"" Saenz added."
"Teachers' unions, ACLU object to bill criminalizing sex between school employees and students younger than 18",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/teachers-unions-oppose-bill-outlawing-sex-between-teaches-and-students,"Rhode Island's two teachers' unions and the American Civil Liberties Union affiliate in the state are objecting to a bill that would criminalize sex between school employees and students younger than 18 years old, the Providence Journal reported .
Those objecting to the bill have said it's wrong to single out teachers and other school employees, the Journal said, adding that Rhode Island is one of about 30 states where the age of consent is 16 years old.
What are the details? Democratic state Rep. Alex Marszalkowski sponsored the bill that says any school employee — including bus drivers, vendors, and school volunteers with supervisory authority — would be guilty of third-degree sexual assault if they have sex with students between the ages of 14 and 18, the paper reported.
Existing state law says no crime has been committed if a teacher has sex with a student who is 16 or 17 years old unless force or coercion is involved, WPRI-TV reported . State law also says those who have sex with children younger than 14 are guilty of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, the Journal added.
More from the paper:
Erika Sanzi, an education advocate and blogger, said she asked her state representative to submit the bill after a previous bill was described as being too broad. That legislation would have made it a crime for anyone with custodial responsibility to have sex with someone between the ages of 14 and 18.
Marszalkowski decided to narrow the language after Sanzi described to him that, in several states, it is legal for a teacher to have sex with a student once that individual turns 16. ""What we're asking is that we protect students from all people who work with them in school,"" Sanzi testified to the House Judiciary Committee April 2, the Journal reported.
""The deterrent is, yes, they can be fired,"" she added, according to the paper, ""but that means they can jump to anywhere else in the country and get another job preying on kids.""
""All personnel records are confidential, so when my kid's teacher is fired for having sex with a student, I don't get to know about that,"" Sanzi said during a radio program, WPRI said. ""If they don't lose their state license they can get a job in another district. And if they do lose their state license, they can go to any other state and do the same thing.""

Teachers' unions push back James Parisi, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, said his union objects to the bill because it ignores adults in other professions who supervise those under the age of 18, the Journal noted.
""You should include all the adults who have employment or other types of authority over 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds,"" he wrote, according to the paper. ""For example, why is a legislator having sexual relations with a page not included in the bill? What about store managers, athletic coaches, clergy, and volunteers in community organizations?""
Image source: WPRI-TV video screenshot
Robert Walsh, executive director of the National Education Association Rhode Island, told the Journal that it's ""patently ridiculous for anyone to imply that our organization, or any individual teacher, would condone any inappropriate relationship between a teacher and his or her students. We do not believe that this obvious standard needs legislation to back it up and agree with the ACLU's objections to several other technical flaws in the actual proposed legislation.""
What did the ACLU have to say? The ACLU's Rhode Island affiliate wrote that ""singling out teachers, school bus drivers, etc., in this way is arbitrary and capricious,"" the Journal reported, adding that the ACLU also is concerned about school volunteers feeling the brunt of the bill, as coaches could be close in age to students
""While one may disagree whether this type of 'Romeo and Juliet' conduct is appropriate ... it should not be a felony,"" the ACLU added, the paper said.
How did the bill's sponsor respond to the objections? Marszalkowski told the Journal the bill isn't meant to single out teachers, but rather it's aimed at all school employees since schools are the one place where children are legally required to attend.
""I welcome any criticism,"" he added to the paper. ""If there is a way to amend it so it's more broadly defined but passes constitutional muster, I'm willing to do it.""

"Mayor of Arizona city declares a state of emergency, says the mass release of migrants poses 'imminent threat'",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/mayor-of-arizona-city-declares-a-state-of-emergency-over-migrant-releases-into-the-city,"Mayor Doug Nicholls has issued a state of emergency for the city of Yuma, Arizona, citing an ""imminent threat"" to residents and property over the mass release of migrants into the border city, the Arizona Republic reported.
The city's resources cannot handle the overwhelming number of migrants that continue pouring into Yuma, Nicholls said Tuesday during a press conference .
""Migrants continue to be released at a rate that cannot be sustained, overwhelming the current non-profit shelter system,"" Nicholls said in a statement .
At least 1,300 migrants were released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection over a three-week period into the local non-profit shelter.
What's the story? The shelter, which has a maximum capability to house 150 to 200 migrants, has exceeded its ability to house and provide basic human needs, according to the mayor.
""Today is a day that we had talked about three weeks ago, hoping never to get to,"" Nicholls said.
""Throughout the country we are in a position that needs to be rectified on a national level, not just within the resources of our Yuma community, to avert the threat of hundreds of people roaming the streets looking to satisfy basic human needs in our community and not having the resources to do so and the reaction of the citizens of Yuma looking to protect their property and way of life,"" he continued.
The same day that Nicholls announced the proclamation, he received a call from Border patrol officials who alerted him that CBP would release 120 additional migrants into the city the same day.
""We need to make sure that our community is maintained and that the human rights of all the migrants are also maintained and that we have a path forward that respects both,"" he said.
Many of the migrant families released to the city's shelter were waiting for transportation to other cities across the country.
""The transportation network is just insufficient to keep up with demand,"" Nicholls said. ""And the backlog of people staying at the shelter has created this capacity issue.""
What else? The city hopes that the emergency proclamation will draw national attention to the communities that are struggling with the immigrant crisis.
On Tuesday, CBP was holding at least 950 migrants, mostly family units, at its Yuma detention center. Agents apprehended at least 400 more on Wednesday."

Rashida Tlaib incites activists to 'shut down' ICE, stop waiting for Congress to pass a law",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rashida-tlaib-incites-people-against-ice,"Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan told an audience not to wait for Congress to change the laws, but instead take their own steps to ""shut down"" the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
""I want you all to shut them down. We can shut them down,"" Tlaib said of ICE. ""Don't wait for this Congress to act. Shut 'em down.""
She went on to specifically cite hunger strikes as one method to ""shut down"" ICE.
""There are some people that are using hunger strikes,"" she said, ""all these other things, going to the border, and I plan to.""
Tlaib has been an especially vehement and extremist freshman member of Congress. Upon winning her election, she used an expletive to insult President Donald Trump and advocate for his impeachment.
Democrats were forced to sign on to congressional resolution condemning anti-Semitism after controversial comments from Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).
She also defended Omar for her comments diminishing the horror of the 911 attacks.
Her office denied a query from the Daily Caller about whether she was advocating for Americans to take up hunger strikes against ICE, which she clearly appeared to say.
""I want you not to only share things on social media, but pick up the phone because many of your Michigan delegation members need to also be loud and clear about this action,"" she said during the speech.

Here's what the Mueller report said about the Seth Rich conspiracy — and how WikiLeaks is involved,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mueller-reports-on-seth-rich-conspiracy,"The Mueller report addressed the conspiracy theory surrounding Seth Rich, the slain DNC staffer that many believed had hacked the emails that ended up embarrassing the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016.
According to the report, WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange implied that the documents had been hacked by Rich in order to cover for a Russian espionage agency.
The conspiracy theory had been substantiated by a false report that was picked by many outlets including Fox News, who later retracted their story.
Sean Hannity had multiple shows on the theory that the Clinton emails were exposed by Seth Rich and that he was murdered in retaliation. Rich was found dead from gunshots in July 2016 in Washington D.C.
Police officially blamed a botched robbery for the death, but conspiracy theorists latched on to the case despite protestations from his family.
Assange helped stir the pot when he made statements implying that Rich had something to do with the emails WikiLeaks had made public ahead of the 2016 election.
Mueller's report tries to dispel those claims.
""After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking,"" the Mueller report said.
""According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. congressman that the DNC hack was an 'inside job,' and purported to have 'physical proof' that Russians did not give materials to Assange,"" the report explained.
Despite not saying so explicitly, the report concluded that Assange's ""statements about Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails.""

"Angry students want outspoken liberal prof Camille Paglia replaced with 'queer person of color' over her #MeToo, transgender criticisms",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/angry-students-want-liberal-prof-camille-paglia-ousted,"In this age of adults charged with running college campuses actually bowing in terror to every woke demand of leftist students, it was only a matter of time before the youngins at University of the Arts in Philadelphia would go after Camille Paglia, a world-renowned, outspoken feminist and professor at the school.
Paglia, you see, is a longtime liberal. But she's often voiced views that liberals — particularly of the far-left persuasion — don't like.
When Hillary Clinton was running for president, Paglia wrote that Clinton's "" blame-men-first-feminism "" wasn't doing her campaign any favors. Soon after that Paglia pointedly asked , ""What is it with the Hillary cult?"" And after Clinton lost the election to President Donald Trump, Paglia ripped the Democratic nominee, saying misogyny didn't lose her the election .
Why are students angry at Paglia?
Which brings us to the verbal dust-up at the University of the Arts. Students there launched a recent petition saying Paglia ""blatantly mocked survivors of sexual assault and the #MeToo movement, and in classes and interviews has mocked and degraded transgender individuals."" For that they're demanding the school oust Paglia and replace her with a ""queer person of color.""
Paglia, inconveniently, is a lesbian. Not that it's won her many lesbian fans, mind you: ""My problem is that I do not get along with lesbians at all,"" she told the Independent several years ago. ""They don't like me, and I don't like them."" But Paglia indeed is not a person of color, and that just won't do with this cadre of leftist youths.
In regard to their issue with Paglia not genuflecting before the #MeToo altar, the students' petition points to the following clip in which Paglia excoriates bad female behavior amid a ""bourgeois culture of excuses"":
Camille Paglia: Victim Mentality and #MeToo youtu.be
Inside Higher Ed said Paglia's comments about transgenders in a 2017 interview likely ruffled left-leaning feathers.
""It is certainly ironic how liberals who posture as defenders of science when it comes to global warming (a sentimental myth unsupported by evidence) flee all reference to biology when it comes to gender,"" she noted to the Weekly Standard. ""Biology has been programmatically excluded from women's studies and gender studies programs for almost 50 years now. Thus very few current gender studies professors and theorists, here and abroad, are intellectually or scientifically prepared to teach their subjects. The cold biological truth is that sex changes are impossible. Every single cell of the human body remains coded with one's birth gender for life. Intersex ambiguities can occur, but they are developmental anomalies that represent a tiny proportion of all human births.""
What does the school have to say?
Sadly it appears the University of the Arts students won't be getting Paglia ousted anytime soon, as their petition also takes a shot at school president David Yager, saying he should apologize ""for his wildly ignorant and hypocritical letter.""
Inside Higher Ed said Yager's letter — which doesn't mention Paglia by name — was distributed as students began urging her dismissal:
Unfortunately, as a society we are living in a time of sharp divisions—of opinions, perspectives and beliefs—and that has led to decreased civility, increased anger and a ""new normal"" of offense given and taken. Across our nation it is all too common that opinions expressed that differ from another's—especially those that are controversial—can spark passion and even outrage, often resulting in calls to suppress that speech.
That simply cannot be allowed to happen. I firmly believe that limiting the range of voices in society erodes our democracy. Universities, moreover, are at the heart of the revolutionary notion of free expression: promoting the free exchange of ideas is part of the core reason for their existence. That open interchange of opinions and beliefs includes all members of the UArts community: faculty, students and staff, in and out of the classroom. We are dedicated to fostering a climate conducive to respectful intellectual debate that empowers and equips our students to meet the challenges they will face in their futures.
I believe this resolve holds even greater importance at an art school. Artists over the centuries have suffered censorship, and even persecution, for the expression of their beliefs through their work. My answer is simple: not now, not at UArts.
The University of the Arts is committed to the exercise of free speech and academic freedom, to addressing difficult or controversial issues and ideas through civil discussion, with respect for those who hold opinions different from our own. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' 1927 advice still holds true today: that the remedy for messages we disagree with or dislike is more speech and not enforced silence. How is Paglia reacting to all of this?
Paglia told Inside Higher Ed that she considered protests against her ""a publicity stunt"" by those who don't understand her ideas — and she praised Yager's ""eloquent statement affirming academic freedom [as] a landmark in contemporary education"" and hoped other schools will see it as a model for how to ""deal with their rampant problem of compulsory ideological conformity."""

What are the details? Theron, who adopted the child in 2012, said that Jackson told her when he was three years old, ""I am not a boy,"" according to the Daily Mail .
""Yes, I thought she was a boy, too,"" she told the outlet. ""Until she looked at me when she was three years old and said, 'I am not a boy.'""
And so, based on this pronouncement from a toddler, Theron decided to raise the child as a girl.
The Hollywood actress, 43, has one other adopted child named August. Now Theron says that she has ""two beautiful daughters.""
""So there you go!"" she explained. ""I have two beautiful daughters who, just like any parent, I want to protect and I want to see thrive.""
She added, ""They were born who they are and exactly where in the world both of them get to find themselves as they grow up, and who they want to be, is not for me to decide.""
""My job as a parent is to celebrate them and to love them and to make sure that they have everything they need in order to be what they want to be,"" Theron explained. ""And I will do everything in my power for my kids to have that right and to be protected within that.""
Theron officially confirmed the news to the Daily Mail after the child was spotted out in previous years wearing decidedly feminine clothing .
In December, Theron told ""Black Panther"" star Michael B. Jordan that she has two African-American daughters that she wanted to show the award-winning superhero film.
Theron, who grew up in South Africa, said that her upbringing helped mold her into the person she is now.
""... I grew up in a country where people lived with half-truths and lies and whispers and nobody said anything outright, and I was raised very specifically not to be like that,"" she said.
The actress added, ""I was taught by my mom that you have to speak up; you have to be able to know that, when this life is over, you'll have lived the truth you're comfortable with, and that nothing negative can come from that."""
Chemistry professor at Vermont college on leave after putting Nazi gas chamber question on exam,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-at-vermont-college-on-leave-after-putting-nazi-gas-chamber-question-on-exam,"A professor at Vermont liberal arts school Middlebury College has taken a leave of absence after backlash over an exam question that seemed to ask students to put themselves in the shoes of Nazi murderers.
Here's what we know According to a screenshot provided by the student run newspaper The Middleburry Campus, the question reads:
Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) is a poisonous gas, which Nazi Germany used to horrific ends in the gas chambers during The Holocaust. The lethal dose for humans is approximately 300 mg of HCN gas per kilogram of air when inhaled....Calculate the g of HCN that would give a lethal dose in the above room (5 points).
Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Other groups including Roma, Jehovah's witnesses, people with disabilities, and homosexuals were also brutally targeted.
While at least some students who took the test found it offensive, the controversy only really gained traction after the story was ridiculed by the school's student-run satirical newspaper, The Local Noodle . The Noodle itself faced backlash for joking that the professor was ""a 'Real Nazi' about grading.""
""This inexplicable failure of judgment trivializes one of the most horrific events in world history, violates core institutional values, and simply has no place on our campus,"" Middlebury College President Laurie L. Patton said in an official statement , from April 10. ""We expect our faculty to teach and lead with thoughtfulness, good judgment, and maturity. To say we have fallen short in this instance is an understatement.""
The school also said that an inquiry had uncovered another exam question by the same professor which ""made reference to the Ku Klux Klan in a way that appeared to be humorous in intent, but which was gratuitous and offensive.""
""Middlebury has, and always will, condemn any actions that are anti-Semitic or racist in intent or effect, just as we will any other acts of bias or discrimination,"" Patton added in the statement."
Three Brooklyn parents summoned to court for not vaccinating their kids; could face jail time,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/three-brooklyn-parents-summoned-to-court-for-not-vaccinating-their-kids-could-face-jail-time,"Three Brooklyn parents of unvaccinated children have been issued court summonses by New York City health officials, facing fines and possibly even imprisonment for failing to comply with an emergency order mandating measles inoculations.
What are the details? On April 9, New York City declared a public health emergency for the neighborhood of Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The Commission of Health issued an order threatening "" civil and/or criminal fines, forfeitures and penalties, including imprisonment ,"" against any guardian of an unvaccinated child (6 months or older) who didn't receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine within 48 hours of the mandate.
On Thursday, officials showed they were ready to make good on that threat, calling three parents from separate households to appear in court for violating the order. Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot told The Washington Post her office ""did not take the emergency order lightly,"" calling the mandate ""a dramatic response to a serious problem.""
The same day, a New York judge dismissed a lawsuit brought against the city's Department of Health by five parents fighting against the order. According to The Daily Beast , Kings County Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Knipel ""debunked"" all of the plaintiffs' arguments. The parents reportedly presented objections on medical, religious, and moral grounds.
Health officials shut down four schools last week, and a pre-school this week, for ""refusing to confirm or deny that all of their attendees had received the MMR shot,"" the Daily Mail reported.
Anything else? As of Thursday, the New York City health department counted ""359 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October,"" noting the outbreak is hitting predominantly Orthodox Jewish communities.
""The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring,"" the department wrote in a statement. ""Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn or Rockland County.""
According to The Post, officials expect the outbreak to get worse before it gets better, ""especially as the week-long Passover holiday approaches and families gather at one another's homes."""
San Francisco's poop problem explodes on the city's streets and sidewalks,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-francisco-poop-problem-explodes,"Poop on the streets has long plagued the city of San Francisco, but the problem has exploded over the past few years as the city's homeless population has surged.
Reports of human feces found on the streets and sidewalks jumped to an all-time record of 28,084 in 2018, up by more than five times the number reported seven years earlier. In 2011, there were 5,547 reports of human waste in public spaces.
BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski shared a graph of the incidents reported over the eight-year period.
During the first quarter of this year, there were 6,676 reports of people poop on the streets, Forbes reported.
Overall, at least 118,352 reports of human waste have been reported across San Francisco since 2011.
Government watchdog Open The Books documented every spot of human fecal matter reported to city services over the past eight years. Open The Books is a non-profit organization that accepts no government funding.
Complaints from residents prompted the city to launch a dedicated ""Poop Patrol"" late last summer in an effort to clean up the streets. A team of Public Works employees patrol the city's defecation hot spots to try to get ahead of the mess.
Which neighborhoods had the most reports? Overall, 118 neighborhoods and 30 ZIP Codes across the city were affected, according to Forbes .
And nearly two-thirds or 72 percent of the reports came from 10 neighborhoods: Tenderloin; South of Market; Mission; Civic Center; Mission Dolores; Lower Nob Hill; Potrero Hill; Showplace Square; North Beach, and the Financial District.
But the highest concentration was focused in the city's center with more than 23,800 reports of poop since 2008.
What else? The ever-growing homeless population has pushed the city's shelter to their limits.
With more and more individuals are sleeping on the streets, there's little chance for the problem to end any time soon."
"Bankrupt Sears sues former CEO Lampert & Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, accusing them of looting the firm",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sears-sues-longtime-ceo-eddie-lampert-accusing-him-of-looting-the-company-and-forcing-it-into-bankruptcy,"Sears Holdings Corp. has filed a lawsuit against its longtime former Chairman Eddie Lampert, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and others, accusing them of siphoning billions of dollars from the retailer ahead of its bankruptcy.
What are the details? The struggling company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last fall , at which point Lampert stepped down as CEO. He created Sears Holdings Corp. in 2005, through the merger of Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Kmart Holdings Corp.
With Lampert at the helm, the firm went into a death spiral, riddled with billions in debt and plagued with devastated losses in both sales and share price. The lawsuit — filed by Sears' restructuring team on behalf of creditors — alleges Lampert and other insiders conspired to ""strip"" Sears of assets, Reuters reported, using schemes including bogus financial plans, ""fraudulent transfers,"" and deflated real estate values as part of lopsided spinoff agreements.
Sears Holdings claims its most valuable assets were hijacked as the wheels fell off, including its major brands and best real estate, in order to pay off bills with no plan for keeping the company solvent.
According to the Daily Mail , the complaint reads, ""Had defendants not taken these improper and illegal actions, Sears would have had billions of dollars more to pay its third-party creditors today and would not have endured the amount of disruption, expense, and job losses resulting from its recent bankruptcy filing.""
The company is seeking the repayment of ""billions of dollars of value looted from Sears.""
How is Mnuchin involved? Mr. Mnuchin was previously a director at Sears, but his links to Lampert go way back. The two were college roommates at Yale University, worked together at Goldman Sachs, and Mnuchin was also a one-time director at Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, Inc. (which is also named as a defendant in the suit).
Anything else? Lampert — a billionaire who is also the corporation's biggest shareholder and biggest lender — purchased most of Sears' assets for $5.2 billion after a February bankruptcy auction.
In a statement on behalf of ELS and Lampert, the hedge fund called the allegations made in the lawsuit ""misleading or just flat wrong,"" and insisted all the decisions questioned were made in the best interest of shareholders, according to Reuters."
College students are asked if MAGA hats are the new KKK hood.

The answers were predictable, dramatic, and cringeworthy.
What are the details? Phillips and Ayetiwa approached several students on the school's campus, asking the students if they felt that President Donald Trump's signature ""Make America Great Again"" campaign hat is as fear-inducing as, say, a white KKK hood would be if someone were to nonchalantly parade it around the streets.
The two young men show students photos of the KKK hood and asked them what kind of feelings the accoutrement might induce for them. Every one of the students answered variations of terror, white supremacy, racism, repulsion, outrage, and more.
Phillips and Ayetiwa then went on to ask students what they think about when they see the MAGA hat.
The more entertaining answers are below:
""The same thing. I'm not gonna lie. [I think] they're similar in some ways, maybe in their morality basis."" ""It makes me think of the fact that it's basically the hood of 2019."" ""I can see the comparison."" ""It's a modern hoodie. ... It's like the same thing. They're representing the same thing."" ""If you look at our president, you can definitely tell, it's like ..."" ""It's representing white supremacy."" ""I think most people [wearing the hat] are probably stupid."" On the flip side, others answered differently.
""Patriots. People that care for America."" ""I don't think that's comparable at all. ... You can't joke about the KKK."" ""You're saying half the country is in the KKK? I don't think that's a good comparison."" ( Content warning: Rough language):

DNA testing company Ancestry pulls ad after backlash for portrayal of early 1800s biracial couple,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-ancestry-pulls-ad-after-backlash-for-portrayal-of-early-1800s-biracial-couple,"Ancestry has pulled an add for its DNA testing service after facing backlash for its unlikely portrayal of a presumably fictional biracial couple in the antebellum American South.
What did the ad say? In the ad, a black woman in early 1800s garb approaches a white man on the porch of a building. ""Abigail, we can escape to the North,"" the man tells her, offering her a ring. ""There's a place we can be together across the border. Will you leave with me?""
""Without you, the story stops here,"" the ad says, as it shows images associated with family history research, including a marriage license for an Abigail Williams and James Miller dated April 9, 1857, in Ontario, Canada. It is unclear if the scenario is based on the lives of that couple — or any other real people. According to the Salt Lake Tribune , the commercial was intended for Ancestry's Canadian audience.
While DNA tests and family history research are popular, digging up the past can often be painful for black people. Many black Americans have a white ancestor from some point before the Civil War, but this was often the result of the rape of a slave. Additionally, the choice granted to the woman in the video was a degree of freedom not even open to many white women at the time.
And in the Northern states where slavery was illegal interracial marriage was still a taboo , even after the Civil War. In 1883's Pace v. Alabama decision, the Supreme Court decided that states had a constitutional right to ban interracial marriage. It took until 1967 for the Supreme Court to rule that interracial couples had a right to marry.
Historian Sylviane Diouf from Brown University told Time that the ad was ""a nicely packaged recreation which is absolutely untrue,"" adding that its rosy portrayal of such a difficult topic and time period was ""insulting.""
Ancestry has responded In a statement to Time, a representative for the company said:
Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history. This ad was intended to represent one of those stories. We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused. We are in the process of pulling the ad from television and have removed it from YouTube."
"Government report says USMCA trade deal will be better than NAFTA, but only slightly",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/government-report-says-usmca-trade-deal-will-be-better-than-nafta-but-only-slightly,"A new report from the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) shows that the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will improve the U.S. economy more than NAFTA would have, but only slightly .
Here's what we know On Thursday, when most news outlets were busy digesting the Mueller report, the ITC released a 379 page report detailing its assessment of the USMCA. President Donald Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and former-Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto signed the USMCA trade deal on November 30, 2018 . It is still waiting for congressional approval before it can become law.
According to this report, the USMCA will add 176,000 jobs over five years, and increase the GDP by $68.2 billion (0.35 percent). U.S. exports to and imports from Canada would both increase by $19.1 billion, while those to and from Mexico would increase by $14.2 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. The report concluded that the ""USMCA would likely have a positive impact on U.S. trade, both with USMCA partners and with the rest of the world.""
Notably, while President Donald Trump repeatedly cited trade deficits with both countries as part of his reason for scrapping NAFTA and starting fresh, these projections would see the U.S. trade deficit with Canada remaining the same, while the deficit with Mexico, which was $81.5 billion last year, would be barely touched (it's actually increased by nearly $3 billion in the first two months of 2019 compared to the same period last year, already more than the $2.2 billion reduction suggested by the ITC estimates).
The ITC also concluded that while the USMCA would add roughly 28,000 jobs in the auto industry, it would also cause the price of cars to rise slightly for consumers. This is due largely to the USMCA's requirement that 75 percent of each vehicle be made in North America in order for it to avoid tariffs, and a $16 minimum wage for auto workers. Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of a vehicle had to be made in North America.
The Office of the US Trade Representative put out its own, more optimistic, analysis the same day estimating that the number of auto jobs would be closer to 76,000."
Watch: Armed militia detains more than 300 illegal immigrants who crossed border into New Mexico,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-militia-new-mexico-migrants,"A group of more than 300 migrants trying to cross into the U.S. from Mexico surrendered to an armed militia group in New Mexico earlier this week, according to videos posted on social media.
The United Constitutional Patriots detained the Central American asylum seekers at gunpoint Monday night before turning them over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents.
The militia group, made up of former police officers and military veterans, has stood guard along the southern border in Sunland Park, New Mexico, for the past two months. Jim Benvie, a spokesman for the group, told the New York Times that they plan to stay put monitoring the border until a wall is built or until lawmakers tighten immigration laws.
""We're just here to support the Border Patrol and show the public the reality of the border,"" Benvie told the newspaper.
Sunland Park sits along the southern border near the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez, just west of El Paso, Texas.
A surge in immigrants trying to cross into the U.S. has pushed CBP, along with other government agencies, to its ""breaking point."" Agencies don't have the resources to handle the overwhelming number of Central Americans coming into the U.S.
""CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our Southwest border and nowhere has that crisis manifested more acutely than here in El Paso,"" then-Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters last month. Earlier this month, McAleenan was named acting-secretary of the Department of Homeland Security following the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
What's the story? Benvie said the members have experience in law enforcement or the military and are simply trying to assist border officials.
""We're just Americans. We're veterans, we're ex-law enforcement, we're people that care about our national security,"" Benvie told the Daily Mail . ""We're people that care about our strained Border Patrol.""
The 43-year-old compared the group's actions to a ""verbal citizen's arrest.""
Benvie, along with three other men, were patrolling Monday night when they spotted hundreds of migrants coming toward them.
""We held them there until Border Patrol came,"" he explained to the Daily Mail. ""And once they came then we did what we do, and that's to help Border Patrol get them to the processing van. So, everybody is safe.""
He described the group's actions as a ""citizen's arrest"" and claimed that Border Patrol officials have not asked the group to stop detaining border crossers.
""If these people follow our verbal commands, we hold them until Border Patrol comes,"" Benvie told the NY Times. ""Border Patrol has never asked us to stand down.""
What did Border Patrol say? Customs and Border Protection spokesman Carlos A. Diaz declined Fox News' request for comment about the United Constitutional Patriots or the recent incident.
However, he said the federal agency ""does not endorse private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands.""
What did the governor of New Mexico say? The state's governor told the NY Times that she considered the group's actions ""completely unacceptable,"" adding that migrant families shouldn't be ""menaced or threatened in any way, shape or form"" when they cross the border.
What else? Benvie said CBP officers instructed the group to refrain from pointing their firearms at the migrants, adding that it has issued a new rule prohibiting members from patrolling with military-style weapons, according to the NY Times.
The members are still allowed to carry handguns on patrol.

Democratic senator actually calls for more border security,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-democratic-senator-calls-for-dhs-border-ramp-up-opposing-colleagues-who-want-the-agency-stripped-of-funding,"Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Wednesday called for the Department of Homeland Security to send reinforcements to her state after a group of her fellow Democrats requested funding reductions to the agency in the midst of the U.S. border security crisis.
What are the details? Sinema declared on Twitter, ""Arizonans bear the brunt of Washington's failure to address our broken immigration system. We must secure the border with a comprehensive, smart, bipartisan approach — we're calling on @DHSgov to send additional resources and staff to AZ ports.""
The freshman senator's language is starkly different from that of a group of her colleagues — including every Democratic presidential candidate in the upper chamber — who sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday asking for funding cuts to the already overwhelmed agency.
The Democrats' letter began:
As your Committee considers fiscal year 2020 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations, we ask that you reduce funding for the administration's reckless immigration enforcement and detention operations that are tearing families apart and harming the American economy. We also ask that you include language limiting the DHS Secretary's ability to transfer funds for the purpose of detaining immigrants. Furthermore, we urge you to reject President Trump's FY20 request for a significant increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and detention beds, as well as his request to fund construction of his costly and ineffective border wall. With the exception of California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, none of the 19 signatories of the letter hail from border states. On the contrary, a majority represent northern and northeastern states most buffered from the immigration influx.
The day after the request to cut DHS and ICE funding was sent, the mayor of Yuma, Arizona, declared a state of emergency for his city, saying ""migrants [are] being released into the community faster than they are departing, and shelters and the staff to run them are at max capacity.""
Anything else? This isn't the first time Sinema has refused to tow the party line. She's taken heat for being one of only three Democratic senators who voted to confirm new Attorney General Bill Barr, joined Republicans in giving a thumbs down to the progressive ""Green New Deal"" while most of her colleagues voted ""present,"" and has called ""Medicare for All"" proposals unrealistic.
A columnist for AZCentral declared in February, ""Like John McCain before her, Sinema is a maverick."" "
Texas teen accused of ordering Lyft ride to smuggle illegal immigrants using mom's credit card - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-teen-accused-of-ordering-lyft-ride-to-smuggle-illegal-immigrants-using-moms-credit-card,"A teenager from Mission, Texas, landed himself in hot water earlier this month, when he decided to become a human smuggler using his mother's credit card and his sister's Lyft app.
What are the details? Jose Vigil, 17, was allegedly offered $250 per person to sneak a pair of illegal immigrants past Border Patrol and local law enforcement, The Daily Caller reported. But without a car to transport them on his own, the teen used other resources.
According to the local Progress Times , Vigil borrowed his mom's credit card and ordered a ride from Lyft using his sister's phone. The unassuming Lyft driver picked up the teen, and drove to a house to pick up his ""cousins"" — who weren't his cousins at all, but illegal immigrants from Guatemala who were soaking wet from the waist down.
But the Lyft driver's vehicle didn't have a front license plate, which drew the attention of law enforcement. Sullivan City police Officer Joshua Rodriguez pulled the car over, looked inside, and said to the driver, ""Let me ask you a question. Who are the guys in the back?""
The driver swore up and down he had no idea who they were, that he himself was just a 22-year-old who works at a pizzeria and drives for Lyft to make extra cash. While police were skeptical at first, Vigil confessed to coordinating everything, and according to the police report , ""advised that the Lyft driver had nothing to do with the smuggling.""
Police did not name the driver because he was not charged with a crime, but they did give him a scolding for not paying better attention. ""OK, first of all, didn't it seem kind of off to you that they're wet from the clothes?"" Rodriguez asked the driver. ""That they're muddy from the shoes? Anything like that? My suggestion to you, man, is if you're going to be doing this Lyft, at least be mindful of who you're going to pick up.""
Anything else? Vigil was arrested on April 5, and charged with third-degree felony human smuggling. He was released April 7 on $10,000 bond."
Yankees get rid of Kate Smith’s ‘God Bless America’ because of singer’s other songs about black people - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/yankees-yank-kate-smith-god-bless-america,"Kate Smith's 1939 rendition of ""God Bless America"" is officially out at New York's Yankee Stadium during the seventh-inning stretch because of Smith's other songs, which are purportedly racially charged.
What are the details? The Yankees announced Thursday that they will no longer play Smith's version of the song because she sang other songs with purportedly racist lyrics.
Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, late Yankees owner George Steinbrenner insisted that ""God Bless America"" — with Smith's version in regular rotation— be played during the seventh-inning stretch.
In March, the team became aware of the potential racial connotations in Smith's musical history and opted to cut her version of the song altogether, replacing it with an instrumental version of the song.
A spokesperson for the team told New York Daily News , ""The Yankees have been made aware of a recording that had been previously unknown to us and decided to immediately and carefully review this new information.""
The club added that they would rather err on the side of caution and ""sensitivity"" rather than potentially offend someone by playing the 80-year-old — and perhaps most recognizable — version of the song.
""The Yankees take social, racial and cultural insensitivities very seriously,"" the statement explained. ""And while no final conclusions have been made, we are erring on the side of sensitivity.""
Smith's song catalogue includes 1931's "" That's Why Darkies Were Born ,"" which had lyrics that said: ""Someone had to pick the cotton, someone had to pick the corn, someone had to slave and be able to sing, that's why darkies were born.""
The song's history has been questioned in the past, with some critics calling it outright racist, while others said that song was a satirical take on racism and white supremacy .
According to the Daily News , Smith also recorded ""Pickaninny Heaven,"" which was directed at ""colored children"" who fantasize about frolicking in a place with ""great big watermelons.""

Diver who rescued boys from cave in Thailand had to be rescued himself - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/diver-who-rescued-boys-from-cave-in-thailand-had-to-be-rescued-himself,"One of the divers who helped to rescue the Thai boys trapped in a cave last July had to be rescued himself on Wednesday.
What happened last year? Twelve members of a Thai soccer team, ranging in age from 11 to 16, and their coach were exploring the Tham Luang Nang Non in Thailand when they became trapped on June 23, 2018 due to flooding that made it impossible to leave the same way they entered. After an intensive rescue operation, they were found by British divers on July 2, perched on the muddy slope of a cave. It took until July 10 before they were all rescued . One of the rescuers, a former Thai Navy SEAL, died trying to save the boys.
One of the divers involved in the operation was British cave diver Josh Bratchley.
What happened now? On Tuesday, Bratchley disappeared while exploring a largely uncharted cave in Jackson County, Tennessee that had been discovered in 2017. According to the Washington Post , before this expedition the Mill Pond Cave system had only been explored by two other men. Bratchley and his team were trying to find tunnels that had not yet been mapped.
The divers he was with failed to notice that he had fallen behind until they were back outside. They went back and tried to find him, but his lifeline had broken. After failing to locate him on their own, they had to call for backup.
After initially struggling to find the exit, Bratchley had realized he should stay put so that rescuers could find him. He found an air pocket and waited for 24 hours for help to arrive.
It wasn't until Wednesday that he was found. He did not have any food or water, but reportedly managed to stay awake and alert. ""This was a really small, nasty cave,"" rescue diver Ed Sorenson said after finding Bratchley.
After so long trapped in a tight space without food, Bratchley only asked for one thing. ""His only request was he wanted pizza,"" Derek Woolbright, a spokesman for the Jackson County Emergency Management Agency, told the press ."
Voter stuns MSNBC reporter with his message to Democrats after Mueller report release,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbc-on-mueller-report,"A reporter for the progressive cable news channel MSNBC was stunned by a New Hampshire voter who warned the Democratic party that they would lose in 2020 if they kept pushing the Mueller report after its release.
""But I do want to bring in one of the voters who I've been talking to this morning,"" said Ali Vitali. ""Harold Chase, and you're someone who, now that you've seen the report come out, what are you thoughts?""
""Well my thoughts are that, like I said earlier, it's just, it's all false, the reports, there's nothing in there that shows the President of the United States is guilty of anything,"" Chase told her.
""There's no Russian collusion and there's no obstruction,"" he continued, ""you know they're gonna try to find something, looking at that report, pick it apart and they'll try to find something and run with it, and nothing's gonna happen.""
""So you say 'they' I think you're talking about Democrats,"" Vitali added. ""When you say they're gonna run with it, do you think that they should talk about this as they campaign for president?""
""Absolutely not,"" he responded, ""absolutely not, it's just gonna destroy them they won't get in, they won't win in 2020 if they keep pushing this.""
""And what do you think,"" Vitali asked, ""to you, the most important thing is, now that this report is out, what do you want to see happen next?""
""Well, the report is out,"" he replied. ""I think they just need to move on, and just drop it, you know if they just keep going forward, they're not getting anywhere.""
""They're just destroying themselves,"" he concluded.

Openly gay Trump admin official slams Buttigieg for Jussie Smollett-like 'hate hoax' against Pence,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/gay-trump-admin-official-slams-buttigieg-for-jussie-smollett-like-hate-hoax-against-pence,"A Trump administration official who is openly gay pushed back on Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg's narrative that Vice President Mike Pence's views on sexuality are hateful.
Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, said Buttigieg is only making noise about Pence's views now as a way to boost his presidential campaign.
""Mayor Pete has been pushing this hate hoax along the lines of Jussie Smollett for a very long time now, several weeks,"" Grenell said on Fox News. ""It's ironic that right about now when he's starting his fund-raising apparatus to run for president that he comes up with this… idea and this attack.
""Mike and Karen are great people, they're godly people, they're followers of Christ. They don't have hate in their heart for anyone. They know my partner, they have accepted us,"" Grenell continued.
What happened to tolerance?
Grenell made an argument that is increasingly rejected these days: that tolerance doesn't mean forcing someone else to believe exactly what you believe.
""We were the ones saying everyone should be able to accept and love each other,"" Grenell said of the gay community. ""Now, suddenly, there's a whole community of people who are demanding that we all think alike. I think it's outrageous.""
In comments on several occasions recently, Buttigieg has been critical of Pence and any Christian who does not affirm gay marriage claiming Pence's views cause harm and that the vice president has a problem with God if he believes homosexuality is wrong.
About Richard Grenell When Grenell was confirmed to his position nearly a year ago, he became the highest-ranking gay official ever to serve in a Republican administration, according to NBC News.
Grenell's appointment was lauded by the chairman of the Democratic National Committee's LGBT caucus at the time.
""Having a Republican president appoint an openly gay man as an ambassador to one of our important allies such as Germany speaks volumes to the influence that the LGBTQ [community] has in politics in the United States,"" said chairman Earl Fowlkes."

""I believe everything happens for a reason,"" one of the couple's adult daughters said in a statement, the Desert Sun reported. ""My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back.""
David Turpin, 57, and Louise Turpin, 50, looked on while two of their adult children recounted the horrific abuse they had suffered at the hands of the couple, the Desert Sun reported. Both parents reportedly cried when their children gave their statements inside the crowded Riverside County courtroom.
""I saw my dad change my mom, but they didn't change me. I am a fighter, I am strong and I am shooting through life like a rocket,"" the 30-year-old daughter continued.
It was the first time any of the Turpin children had spoken publicly since their parents were arrested in January 2018.
How long will the couple be in prison? Riverside County Superior Court Judge Bernard J. Schwartz handed down life sentences for both David and Louise.
""Children are indeed a gift, they are a gift to their parents,"" Schwartz told the couple, the Desert Sun reported. ""The selfish, cruel and inhumane treatment of your children has deprived society and especially you of those gifts.""
""Their lives have been permanently altered in their ability to learn, grow and thrive,"" he continued. By pleading guilty, ""you spared your children from having to relive the humiliation and harm they endured in that house of horrors.""
In February, the couple pleaded guilty to 14 felony counts each of torture, dependent adult abuse, child endangerment, and false imprisonment. The judge said they would be eligible for parole after 25 years.
What else did the children say? One son, who identified himself as Josh, told the court that he was working on his bachelor's degree in software engineering.
""Sometimes I still have nightmares such as my siblings being chained up getting beaten,"" he said.
""But, that is the past and this is now,"" he continued. ""I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things that they did to us.""
""Since January, I have learned so much and become very independent. In June of last year, I learned how to ride a bike and ever since then I have been hooked and ride it everywhere,"" he said, adding that has learned how to swim, eat healthy, and prepare a balanced meal.
Josh read a statement from one of his sisters, whom he identified as Jessica: ""I love both of my parents so much,"" Josh read. ""God looks at the heart and I know he sees theirs. I pray often for them.""
Jessica added that she was attending college and doing well.
A representative read a statement from another daughter identified as Joy: ""Every year from as far back as I can remember, our parents tried to give us the nicest Christmas they could,"" the woman read to the court.
Joy's statement said she believed 25 years was too long for her parents to be in prison. She asked that they be placed in detention centers that would be close enough for the children to visit them, should they want to do so in the future.
Each of the children spoke of their faith in God.
What's the backstory? Decades of abuse was revealed after a 17-year-old girl escaped through a window of the family's Perris, California, house.
The girl used a deactivated cell phone she'd found inside the house to call 911. She told authorities that she and her siblings were being starved, beaten, and held captive inside their squalid home.
The children at the time ranged in age from 2 to 29. Authorities said the youngest child was the only one who didn't appear to be abused.
For punishment, the parents often shackled their children to their beds. They were only allowed one bath a year.
The severely malnourished children's growth was stunted. They suffered severe muscle wasting and two of the girls won't be able to bear children, the Daily Mail reported.
The filthy house wreaked of feces and urine.
What did the couple say in court? David requested that his attorney read his statement to the court.
""I'm sorry if I've done anything to cause them harm. I hope the very best for my children in their future,"" David said following the portion read by his attorney. ""I hope they are successful in their chosen professions. I am so proud of each and every one of my children. I miss all of my children.""
Next, Louise spoke to the court.
""I'm sorry for everything I've done to hurt my children,"" she said. ""I'm truly sorry. I love them more than they can ever imagine.""

Commentary: Where did AOC get her 'facts' for the Green New Deal?,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-aoc-facts-green-deal,"The freshman congresswoman from New York, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is often credited for coming up with the Green New Deal but rarely does anyone question the sources for her information. In an effort to try and understand where the former bartender from the Bronx goes for her information, I set out on a cringe-worthy quest into the mind of AOC.
Fortunately, the quest was not a long one. After reading a couple of tweets I knew where her speech writers go to seek their ""facts"" about climate change.
AOC's source
From what I can tell, AOC has merely read the United Nations plan that would ultimately transform the U.S. economy from a hydrocarbon-driven economy to a greenhouse emission-free green economy by the year 2030.
Click here to learn more.
Notice the 2030 deadline that has been set by the UN and you'll understand where AOC's 12-year doomsday nonsense is derived from. Don't take my word for it, take a look at the Facebook post that AOC posted on her page on October 8, 2018.
""12-years. That's how long the latest UN study gives our planet to act on climate change before the point of no return. Food and water scarcity will put hundreds of millions of people at risk. Nature as we know it will never be the same. It doesn't have to be this way.""
With far-right populism preying on fear, racism and poverty, we owe it to our children to make a bold, Federal Green Energy Jobs program to empower people in industries that will literally save our planet. Instead of subsidies for dirty energy industries, we need just and equitable investments in green jobs for every American who wants one. Our future depends on it."" Photo credit: Screen Grab from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Facebook page
The United Nations
According to AOC, the UN study gave the world 12 years to ""fix"" the ""climate change"" problem, when in reality the UN has implemented a plan consisting of 17 goals over the next 12 years to fundamentally transform the U.S. economy into an economy that is free of greenhouse emissions and social injustice.
One of the more concerning goals found in this UN plan is the insertion of gender and social justice into their environmental agenda that as we speak is being implemented on a global scale.
What are the 17 UN Goals?
Goal 1 : No poverty — According to the UN, 793 million people live in poverty, a fact that prompted globalists to propose a lofty goal of eradicating poverty by the year 2030.
Goal 2 : End hunger — Goal 2 seeks to end world hunger by 2030.
Goal 3 : Good health and well-being — By the year 2030, the global community seeks to intervene in healthcare including but not limited to disease prevention, child birth rate, and substance abuse. The other goals are listed below.
Click each goal to learn more
Goal 4 : Quality education Goal 5 : Gender equality Goal 6 : Clean water and sanitation Goal 7 : Affordable and clean energy Goal 8 : Decent work and economic growth Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure Goal 10 : Reduced inequality within and among countries Goal 11 : Sustainable cities and communities Goal 12 : Responsible consumption and production Goal 13 : Climate Action Goal 14 : Life below water Goal 15 : Life on land Goal 16 : Peace, Justice and strong institutions Goal 17 : Partnerships for the goals AOC's Green New Deal
AOC drafted her Green New Deal FAQs in an apparent eighth grade level attempt at trying to read and interpret a theoretical problem and come up with solutions; solutions that included ignorant suggestions like bringing an end to all air travel and reducing cow flatulence.
On Wednesday, AOC released ""a story from the future"" that described her 'Green New Deal"" as the key to a transformed American Economy that she had predicted would save the U.S. from climate change.
Fox News reported that while the ""Green New Deal"" is championed by AOC, those who oppose the plan call it ""unrealistic"" and ""too expensive,"" with estimates that it could cost up to $93 trillion.
In the video, AOC focused on climate change but there are larger ambitions in play; Medicare-for-all and the federal jobs guarantee, both elements would serve to transform the U.S. economy into a socialist system.
According to the video, Democrats would win the 2020 presidential election, starting what she called a ""decade of the Green New Deal"" that prompted the social and ecological transformation to save the planet.""
What does gender have to do with 'climate change'?
Recently, a UN committee decided that gender inequality causes women and men to experience climate change differently. Yes, you read that correctly. February 15, 2018, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) released "" Gender Equality Crucial to Tackling Climate Change — UN, "" a report outlining ""the important role women and girls play in the fight against climate change.""
According to the UNFCCC , "" Women can feel the effects of climate change more than men, in part, because statistics show that women account for a larger portion of the gender demographic in poverty-stricken parts of the world .""
The report goes on to say that climate change relies on the participation of women in the planning process, or more specifically, as ""planners and stakeholders."" The committee has determined that women are better equipped to deal with environmental disasters because women are more ""sensitive"" and ""nurturing"" than men. According to the report, women must be given the opportunity to educate the global community.
Download the full report here .
""The 2030 Agenda holds the potential to transform the lives of women and girls all over the world even though the challenges are daunting. The large-scale extraction of natural resources, climate change, and environmental degradation are advancing at an unprecedented pace, undermining the livelihoods of millions of women and men, particularly in the developing world,"" authors claim.
Important questions to ask yourself:
How will the UN plan affect the U.S. economy? Do you want non-elected globalists making decisions for you and your family? Can AOC tie her own shoes? If climate change is the real threat, then how would free childcare-for-all or free Midcare-for-all lower emissions? What does feminism have to do with ending fracking and drilling for oil. In her video, AOC stated a commitment to ""Universal rights"" like Medicare-for-all and a federal jobs guarantee. She even pointed to a potential universal childcare initiative that would become a 'universal right"" in her envisioned future. But what is a universal right? Americans have heard of human rights and God-given rights, political rights and civil rights.
A quick Google search cleared up the question of what is a universal right: The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (The following list can be found on the United Nations website).
16. Marriage and Family. Every grown-up has the right to marry and have a family if they want to. Men and women have the same rights when they are married, and when they are separated.
17. The Right to Your Own Things. Everyone has the right to own things or share them. Nobody should take our things from us without a good reason.
18. Freedom of Thought. We all have the right to believe in what we want to believe, to have a religion, or to change it if we want.
19. Freedom of Expression. We all have the right to make up our own minds, to think what we like, to say what we think, and to share our ideas with other people.
20. The Right to Public Assembly. We all have the right to meet our friends and to work together in peace to defend our rights. Nobody can make us join a group if we don't want to.
21. The Right to Democracy. We all have the right to take part in the government of our country. Every grown-up should be allowed to choose their own leaders.
22. Social Security. We all have the right to affordable housing, medicine, education, and childcare, enough money to live on and medical help if we are ill or old.
23. Workers' Rights. Every grown-up has the right to do a job, to a fair wage for their work, and to join a trade union.
24. The Right to Play. We all have the right to rest from work and to relax.

26. The Right to Education. Education is a right. Primary school should be free. We should learn about the United Nations and how to get on with others. Our parents can choose what we learn.
27. Copyright. Copyright is a special law that protects one's own artistic creations and writings; others cannot make copies without permission. We all have the right to our own way of life and to enjoy the good things that art, science and learning bring.

29. Responsibility. We have a duty to other people, and we should protect their rights and freedoms.
30. No One Can Take Away Your Human Rights. Conclusion
If you are a person who has ever been concerned about a global government, you don't need to look for a conspiracy theory. The proof is available on the United Nations website. AOC is a globalist, and like all globalists, they seek to have a global panel of non-elected individuals tasked with determining what goes on in your country, state, county, city, and home.
AOC looks to the United Nations as the holy grail of ""knowledge.""
""12-years. That's how long the latest UN study gives our planet to act on climate change before the point of no return. Food and water scarcity will put hundreds of millions of people at risk. Nature as we know it will never be the same. It doesn't have to be this way.""
With far-right populism preying on fear, racism and poverty, we owe it to our children to make a bold, Federal Green Energy Jobs program to empower people in industries that will literally save our planet. Instead of subsidies for dirty energy industries, we need just and equitable investments in green jobs for every American who wants one. Our future depends on it."" The point of their agenda has nothing to do with climate change, but rather pertains to the creation of a one world government and using messengers like AOC to drive their plan to completion. Drawing lines between the current socialist agenda and the UN created plan to combat 'climate change' takes no stretch of the imagination — after all, they say it in their own words."

They can't be this stupid … After the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral this week, there have been a lot of hot takes, some celebration by deranged people, and steadfast resolve. But this ridiculous headline was not expected. Ted Cruz's national security adviser Omri Ceren noticed that the Associated Press titled a story ""Tourist mecca Notre Dame also revered as place of worship."" Were there people who didn't realize this?
Undaunted by the criticism, the AP has left the story up — headline intact. Has the culture become so secular that it takes an explainer by a news organization to let you know that the place you snapped a cool Instagram selfie at after grabbing a baguette last summer is actually a house of worship?
Not to be outdone by this story, the New York Times wrote about the heroic French priest who saved the ""Crown of Thorns"" relic and the ""Body of Christ"" from the burning cathedral. At the Free Beacon, Alex Griswold writes that the Times thought the ""Body of Christ"" was a ""statue of Jesus.""
To the more than a billion Roman Catholics in the world, the ""Body of Christ"" is the Blessed Sacrament, the actual presence of Christ on earth. To Catholics, the priest didn't save a ""statue of Jesus"" — the priest saved the physical presence of Jesus from flames. The Times has since corrected its error , but like the AP article it shows an utter disregard for people of faith.
'Impeachment, Impeachment, Impeachment' … Thursday marked a milestone in the coverage of the Trump presidency by the mainstream media. As I noted yesterday , the media switched gears toward hyping obstruction in coverage yesterday. That led to what the media really want: impeachment.
NewsBusters' Bill D'Agostino captured the 309 times members of the media said ""impeachment"" during coverage yesterday. The montage is both hilarious and sad at the same time .
Appearing on CNN, Mary Katharine Ham cut right through the media B.S. Ham told her CNN co-panelists that she hoped it was ""leg day"" because they were going to need to be strong to keep "" carrying these goal posts .""
That's exactly what the media has been doing to conservatives for generations, not just since Trump ran for office — carrying the left's water and acting as the left's attack dogs.
Elmo teaches respect … In a recent cross-promotion, HBO had ""Sesame Street"" star Elmo travel to Westeros to teach Tyrion and Cersei Lannister about respect. It's really well done . Elmo seems to have really gotten through to Cersei.
The promo clip also reminded me that one of the perennial arguments against eliminating federal funding for PBS — ""save Big Bird"" — is now shot. Remember the old PBS tagline? ""If PBS doesn't do it, who will?"" In 2019, the ""who"" is HBO .
Edelweiss … Anybody who's ever watched ""The Sound of Music"" knows that the song Edelweiss is sung as a protest of the Anschluss, the Nazi takeover of Austria. The Von Trapp family patriarch sings the song as a defiant act just before fleeing the Nazis who want to force him into service in the Navy. But to the New York Times' Maggie Haberman, Trump playing the song at the White House has a sinister meaning .
If Haberman were a millennial who first heard the song at the opening of the alternative history drama ""Man in the High Castle,"" it might be understandable, though that song is sung in hushed tones referring to a protest as well. But Haberman is 45 years old, and should know better.
Trump Derangement Syndrome is very real.
