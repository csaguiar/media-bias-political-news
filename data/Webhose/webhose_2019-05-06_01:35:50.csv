The important thing about trump is hes willing to do whatever it takes to win at all costs and thats the kind of leader we need when our country is being eroded from the inside."

It seems very clear to me that TRUMP's strategy is to allow Democrats to destroy themselves. He does this by egging them on, encouraging their thinking that they are just about to win. They become unstable and crash with the minimum of effort from him. That avoids the perception of Victor's Justice and I have been pointing this out for some months. (He says he will leave the Mueller report and its findings to Bill Barr and that is a great example of this).
People are wanting arrests and dawn raids but it will not happen this way - yet. What is being created is a gradual perception, especially in traditional Democrat areas that more people and organisations have been behaving crookedly. Jackson Cosko's trial and guilty verdict is a prime example of that - low level staffer abusing the system horribly at the time of the Kavanaugh hearings. You will note that it has been reported in the MSM, which shows that they realise the game is up. The college bribery cases will have their days in court and this will push the boat further.
This level of 'noise' is set to rise until the automatic perception of those who rely on MSNBC and CNN (not us) will be of an established link between Democrats and corruption. This will turn into a Wall of noise - there will be a prominent one every day.
Then - one day - there will be a large number of arrests. Those who will be carted off for trail are already aware of this - which is exactly why they make some of the rather hyperbolic statements they do. They are hoping they can ridicule the situation away - they can't."

LLOYD MARCUS, THE UNHYPHENATED AMERICAN
My car, which has a “Trump/Pence” bumper sticker was keyed. While pumping gas, a motorist seemed impressed by my courage to have a Trump bumper sticker. People have told me they are afraid to wear a MAGA cap or have a Trump sign on their lawn.
Having to feel so afraid to express our political views is outrageous. Democrats and fake news media have so twisted the meaning of MAGA and generated such hatred for Trump that citizens are afraid to publicly support the president of the United States. This is still America. Thugs who physically attack us for expressing our first Amendment right to free speech must be prosecuted.
Antifa, Black Lives Matter and other Democrat domestic terrorists routinely beat up Trump supporters. Meanwhile, fake news media promotes their lie that the Tea Party is the violent movement. The Tea Party is totally nonviolent. Brothers and sisters, it requires courage to stand with Trump in his quest to bring America back from Democrats’ destruction. I am grateful that God is on our side.
In the Clint Eastwood movie, “Pale Rider”, an evil businessman with an army of thugs tried to force small landowners to sell him their land. If the landowners did not sell, the businessman threatened to kill them and take their land. The small landowners voted to stay and fight for their land. They asked Preacher (Eastwood) to lead them. Preacher said, “If I lead you, some of you will die.” In other words, Preacher was saying freedom ain’t free.
As we join Trump into battle to restore America’s greatness and restore our freedoms, MAGA cap wearers will be beaten, cars will be keyed. Freedom ain’t free.
Ronald Reagan said, “ Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.”
Shockingly, it appears freedom in America is only one election away from extinction. We have a generation of dumbed-down youths who are eager to surrender their constitutional freedoms for government freebies. Most of the Democrat presidential candidates are anti-freedom and anti-American socialist/communists. If Trump is not reelected, it could end America as we know it; if not forever, at least for decades.
Illegals are invading our country via the Mexican border at its highest since 2006, averaging 3500 per day. https://bit.ly/2HRuHG8 If Democrats win the White House, they will totally ignore immigration laws. Opening the floodgates to illegals will devastatingly transform America.
Sharia Law will spread like wildfire across America if Democrats win the White House. Rashida Tliab and bold antisemitic Ilhan Omar are the first two Muslim women elected to congress. They are Phase 3 (Infiltration) of a master plan for Sharia Law to rule America. Tliab and Omar’s mission is to support pro-Muslim candidates, spread pro-Muslim propaganda and file lawsuits against anything they deem Islamophobia. https://bit.ly/15qquBv
Meanwhile, Democrats have intensified their war on Christianity, seeking to ban the Bible and make biblical teachings illegal.
If Democrats win the White House, the murder of innocent babies will dramatically increase. https://bit.ly/2V8YGMM Shockingly, 19 states support infanticide, leaving babies who survive failed abortions to die. https://bit.ly/2Yzuj42 Democrats are hellbent on passing new laws to murder babies after they are born for any reason. https://bit.ly/2U6X9u9 Over 60 million babies have been murdered since Roe v Wade in 1973. https://bit.ly/15qquBv
Decades of allowing leftist educators to dumb-down students has a disturbingly high number of American youths favoring socialism over capitalism. Youths want government to be their daddy, providing their every need and desire for free. These youths absurdly believe the way we live in the United States will cause the earth to be uninhabitable in 12 years. Consequently, these duped youths will vote for Democrats’ insane economy-crushing environmental laws.
If Democrats win the White House, they will reinstate and increase the mountain of oppressive regulations dismantled by Trump. Trump eliminated over 800 Obama regulations https://bit.ly/2I5jL6R , saving businesses $4 billion. https://nws.mx/2YHg2lP Only Democrats and deadbeat idiots hate all business owners. Small businesses have generated 65% of the new jobs since 1995. Fifty percent of the working population works in small businesses. https://bit.ly/2YEp3wd
Given the billions of dollars spent, the deep state’s corrupt schemes, fake news media’s 24/7 lie-filled reporting and over 500,000 articles purposed to destroy him, it is beyond extraordinary that Trump has survived with a 40% approval rating. Clearly, God has a hedge of protection surrounding this remarkable man. My fellow Christians please continue praying for our president and our homeland.
Defending freedom D-Day on the beaches of Normandy required a huge sacrifice of 29,000 American lives. I thought about our young troop’s thoughts the night before they landed, knowing that the next day many of them would probably die. Wow! Freedom ain’t free, folks. Freedom ain’t free.
While I believe Trump will emerge victorious in 2020, we still must rally behind and publicly express our support. We must refuse to be intimidated into the shadows by Democrats’ henchmen. I received my red “Trump 2020” cap in the mail. https://youtu.be/N6SGHUijaWQ

"Donald Trump Is 'the Least Transparent President' In 'Half a Century,' Congressman Dan Kildee Says",www.newsweek.com,Jason Lemon,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-least-transparent-president-tax-returns-1388284,"On 4/7/19 at 11:07 AM EDT Share U.S.
Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan blasted President Donald Trump on Sunday as “the least transparent president” in “half a century.”
Appearing Sunday morning on ABC’s This Week with host George Stephanopoulos, Kildee explained why Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee are currently seeking six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns.
Kildee pushed back against arguments made by the president’s attorneys that it would be a ""gross abuse of power” for the committee to be granted access to the documents by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
“This is legitimate authority that the Congress has,” Kildee explained. “This president, by the way, is the least transparent president that we’ve had in half a century,” he argued. “He’s broken precedent by not releasing his tax returns. We wouldn’t need to go through this exercise if he had simply done what he had promised to do.”
Kildee then laid out the legal argument for why Congress has authority to request the tax returns.
“Let’s be clear,” he said, “Section 6103 of the tax code grants to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee the right to order a tax return of a taxpayer in order to inform him and the committee on a subject that we are deliberating over. We are looking very carefully right now as to whether or not the IRS is properly auditing and enforcing tax law on the president of the United States.”
Last week, Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts formally sent a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, requesting the president’s personal tax returns, and those of several Trump-owned businesses, going back six years.
“We must obtain President Trump’s tax returns and review whether the IRS is carrying out its responsibilities,” Neal said in the letter . “The committee has a duty to examine whether congressional action may be needed to require such audits, and to oversee that they are conducted properly.”
Democrats have long called on Trump to release his tax returns, as he previously said he would do during the 2016 presidential campaign.
“I'm under a routine audit, and it'll be released, and as soon as the audit is finished it will be released,"" Trump said at the first presidential debate . As has been pointed out repeatedly by critics and analysts, there are no laws or regulations that prevent Trump — or anyone — from releasing their returns while they are being audited. Several months after taking office, the president went back on his previous comment , saying that he “might release” the tax returns “after I'm out of office.""

As Kildee said, Trump’s decision not to release the documents goes against precedent, although it was a slight exaggeration to say “half a century.”
Since 1976, just over 40 years ago, every president other than Trump – and most serious presidential candidates – have released their tax returns, according to Politifact . Several states have also put forward legislation that would require all presidential candidates to release their returns in order for their names to appear on ballots.
Although Republicans and Trump have pushed back against calls for the tax returns to be released, Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico appeared on Fox News Sunday and argued that it is not a political move.
“This is not political as our Republican colleagues are making it out to be,"" Luján said .
""President Trump promised as a candidate that he would share his tax returns. After he was elected, he promised he would share his tax returns with the American people,” he said. “And he’s refused to do so.” "
Iran to lease part of Latakia port - reports,www.jpost.com,ANNA AHRONHEIM,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran-to-lease-part-of-Latakia-port-reports-586033,"4 minute read. b Image by Pleiades Satellite shows Russian fighter jets and helicopters at a military base in the Syrian government-controlled port of Latakia. (photo credit: AFP PHOTO) UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later
Iran is inching one step closer to establishing a foothold on Israel’s doorstep, reportedly planning to lease Syria’s main commercial port in Latakia.According to The Sunday Times , Tehran began talks with Damascus last month to lease the container port beginning on October 1st. The state-owned port is currently managed by a joint venture between Souria Holding, a Syrian investment company and CMA CGM, a French shipping firm. While its revenues have taken a major hit since the outbreak of the civil war nine years ago and has been under US sanctions since 2015, it has 23 warehouses and can handle three million tons of cargo a year.Iran has been working to upgrade its navy, with new vessels and submarines introduced to bolster the country’s aging fleet and recently announced that it had commissioned its first indigenously developed submarine capable of firing cruise missiles.Iran’s presence in Syria is not only in the form of its militias but is deeply rooted in Syria’s government and army. While tactical and operational decisions can be taken by Hezbollah in Beirut, all strategic decisions are made in Tehran.According to the Asia Times , Iran gave the Syrian government a line of credit of some $6.6 billion since 2011, plus an additional $1b. in 2017. More recently Tehran and Damascus agreed to establish a power station in Latakia which would help with Syria’s fuel shortage, with Tehran sending shipments of heating fuel, cooking fuel and gasoline starting next autumn.Iranian developers have also been given the green light to build a 200,000 apartment development near the Syrian capital and talks to establish an Iranian GSM cellular network in Syria continues to be on the table.Dr. Yossi Mansharof, Iran and Shi’ite militia expert at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and the Ezri Center at Haifa University, says Tehran put heavy pressure on Damascus to let them rent the port despite repeated rejections by the Assad regime following Russian objections.“Khamenei invited Assad to Tehran and together with [Qasem] Soleimani they directly talked with Assad in order to bypass the Russian objection,” Mansharof told The Jerusalem Post. “Russia is keen to prevent a war between Iran and Israel and I think that the current situation, whereas Israel conducts systematic attacks on Iranian infrastructure across Syria serves the Russian interest. This is because currently – for various political, military and financial reasons – Iran and Hezbollah are not in a position to engage in military activities against the United States or Israel.”According to Mansharof, the rivalry between Tehran and Moscow is becoming “more visible” in post-war Syria.“Iran’s deputy FM [Hossein] Ansari recently declared that ‘Russia has never stood by Iran regarding Israel, Tehran and Moscow for now have shared interests in Syria but if the issue of Israel comes between them, they will part ways.’ This is an important declaration,” Mansharof said.Israeli officials have repeatedly voiced concerns over Iran’s entrenchment in Syria and the smuggling of sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah from Tehran to Lebanon via Syria, stressing that both are red-lines for the Jewish State.In February, Israel’s Channel 12 reported that Iran was operating a precision missile factory built on the outskirts of Latakia near the Russian Khmeimim Air Force Base with the help of the Syrian government and Hezbollah.In an effort to prevent sophisticated weaponry from reaching Hezbollah, Israel frequently carries out airstrikes against Iran and its allies in Syria. In January Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel has a set policy of preventing Iran’s entrenchment in Syria, and that it would be enforced whether he is in Israel or abroad.“We have a permanent policy to harm Iran’s establishment in Syria and to harm anyone who tries to harm us... This policy is permanent,” he said.Due to the airstrikes, many of which repeatedly struck Iranian shipments shortly after they were flown into Syria via Damascus airport and other bases, Iran has repeatedly requested access to Syrian ports but were denied by Russia whose Khmeimim airbase is a short 30 minute drive south.But, according to reports, Iranian companies linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij force, a paramilitary arm of the IRGC, have already started shipping goods through the port.The move by Iranian companies linked to the IRGC suggest that Tehran may use the port to not only bring in civilian goods to rebuild Syria, but as an alternative route to smuggle in weapons.With a foothold in Latakia, Iran would have direct access to the Mediterranean Sea, where it can not only bring in arms and influence, but it would give Israel’s arch enemy yet another front to strike the State should a war break out.And that could lead to new Israeli airstrikes.

What is that supposed to mean? What mythical policies do the Democrats use to protect our border?
The Democrats had a super-majority when the Obama regime began, and they could have solve our open border problem any way they wanted to, without opposition...and they did, by giving us suicidal immigration/border policies that invite, enable, reward, and guarantee an invasion. They also threw the manure of a visa lottery and automatic immigration of relatives into our well.
Don't even try to tell me that the Democrats want border security. They want permanent political power at any expense to any number of citizens. With nearly 100,000 citizens dying annually from the effects of an open border, they tell us to our faces that it's not a problem. With the prosperity of millions of blue collar workers crushed by mass immigration they still refuse to even slow it down. Only a psychopath and a traitor would say that or agree with that position.
Are you an idiot or a traitor? Are you so loyal to the (D) that you are blind to treachery and treason, or are you a willfully blind forked tongue Marxist arguing for the destruction of free people?"
