Ottawa, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday warned of the risk of interference by Russia in Canadian parliamentary elections scheduled for this fall.
""We've seen over the past number of years an increase in the interference or the implication of foreign actors in democratic processes,"" Trudeau told a news conference in Toronto .
""We saw very clearly that countries like Russia are behind a lot of the divisive campaigns, a lot of the divisive social media , you know, spreads that have turned our politics even more divisive and more anger-filled than they have been in the past,"" he said.
""Our minister of democratic institutions, Karina Gould, is moving forward on a number of significant ways to ensure that the election that is coming up in six months will be decided by Canadians,"" he added.
""That is what Canadians expect. "" The Canadian leader echoed his foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, who said that outside interference in the country's upcoming vote was ""very likely."" ""We are very concerned. Our judgment is that interference is very likely and we think there have probably already been efforts by malign foreign actors to disrupt our democracy ,"" Freeland said on the sidelines of a G7 meeting in northern France .
""What we are seeing in many liberal democracies, the effort is not so much to secure a particular outcome in an election ,"" she said. ""The effort is to make our societies more polarized and make us, as citizens of democracies, more cynical about democracy and that it can work.""Facing such risks, Ottawa announced in late January the establishment of a special task force to fight disinformation and foreign meddling in the upcoming polls."

Tripoli, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Libyan forces under Khalifa Haftar battled their way to the south of Tripoli on Friday, prompting the UN Security Council and the G7 to demand a halt to the military advance on the capital.
Haftar, commander of the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA), launched an offensive on Thursday to take the capital, held by a UN-backed unity government and an array of militias.
The lightening assault was ordered as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Libya for a visit aimed at cementing a political deal on holding elections.
After meeting with Haftar in the eastern city of Benghazi, Guterres said he was leaving "" Libya with a deep concern and a heavy heart"" and voiced hope that a ""bloody confrontation"" could be avoided.
Shortly afterwards, LNA forces clashed with a pro-government alliance less than 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of the capital, a unity government source said.
Haftar's press office confirmed there had been ""violent fighting on the edge of Tripoli with armed militias""."

Kano, Nigeria, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :At least 50 people were killed in clashes with bandits in northwest Nigeria , which has been riven by cattle rustling and kidnapping , the state government said on Friday.
The speaker of Zamfara state parliament , Sunusi Rikiji, told reporters the deaths happened on Tuesday in Sakajiki village, in the Kauran Namoda area of Zamfara state.
""We received reports that members of the (civilian militia) mobilised people... and confronted the bandits in the forest, which resulted in the killing of at least 50 people,"" he said after returning from a visit to the area.
The victims were the militia themselves and other local residents they mobilised to help them, he added, condemning the vigilante force for confronting the gangs alone.
The bandits have long been a scourge of rural communities in Zamfara, raiding villages, stealing cattle, burning homes, looting food , and kidnapping for ransom.
Civilian militia groups comprising local people were formed as protection, given a lack of security personnel in hard-to-reach areas.
But the vigilante forces have only exacerbated violence and tit-for-tat attacks after being accused of extrajudicial killings of suspected bandits.
The state government outlawed the militia groups and deployed troops instead to curb unrest but with little success.
Last December an 8,500-strong militia force was reconstituted to assist the military and police in fighting the gangs, amid wider concerns about the rise in violence.
Nigeria faces a number of security challenges, including attacks from a Islamic State-backed Boko Haram faction and renewed clashes between nomadic herders and farmers.
That has left the military overstretched and seen President Muhammadu Buhari criticised for failing to protect lives and property.
In Zamfara, an influential traditional chief called on the government to arm the vigilantes with assault riffles to defend themselves against the well-armed bandits.
Last month motorcycle-riding bandits gunned down 32 militia members outside Kware village in the Shinkafi district of Zamfara, according to the police ."

Beijing, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The Chinese chemical industry park where an explosion last month killed 78 people and left hundreds injured will be closed, authorities have said.
The blast in Yancheng city, eastern Jiangsu province, was one of the worst industrial accidents in the country in recent years, razing buildings nearby and blowing out the windows of surrounding homes. Authorities evacuated thousands of residents.
The decision to close the Xiangshui Chemical Industry Park was made Thursday by the local government , state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday.
Jiangsu province will also begin closing chemical plants, with the number of producers to be cut roughly in half by 2020 , news site The Paper reported.
Local authorities said Tuesday 187 people hurt in the blast remained in hospital with two in critical condition.
Three employees from the firm Jiangsu Tianjiayi Chemical, whose facility was involved in the blast, have been detained by police .
They bore ""significant responsibility"" for the accident , according to a statement on the Yancheng government 's official Twitter-like Weibo account.
The company , with 195 employees, was established in 2007 and mainly produced raw chemical materials including anisole, a highly flammable compound.
It had a history of violating environmental regulations, according to online records from Yancheng city's environment and ecology bureau.
Deadly industrial accidents are common in China , where safety regulations are often poorly enforced.
In November , a gas leak at a plant in the northern Chinese city of Zhangjiakou -- which will host the 2022 Winter Olympics -- killed 24 people and injured 21 others.
In 2015 , China saw one of its worst industrial accidents when giant chemical blasts in the northern port city of Tianjin killed at least 165 people."

Algiers, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A vast crowd of protesters pushing for reforms flooded the streets of Algiers Friday, while mass rallies were held across Algeria for the first time since ailing president Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned.
Activists chanted slogans demanding key Bouteflika loyalists follow his lead and quit, after social media calls for ""joyful demonstrations"" to ""peacefully bring down a dictatorial regime"".
No official figures were immediately available on the size of the rally, but it was at least as big as those held on previous Fridays leading up to Bouteflika's departure, said AFP journalists at the scene.
Rallies took place in 41 of the country's 48 provinces, according to the official APS news agency which in a first published slogans highly hostile to those in power.
Opponents of the old regime had called for a massive turnout, targeting a triumvirate they dub the ""3B"" -- Senate speaker Abdelkader Bensalah, head of the constitutional council Tayeb Belaiz and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui.
The veteran Bouteflika loyalists have been entrusted with overseeing the political transition after the president finally stepped down at the age of 82.
Bouteflika resigned late on Tuesday after weeks of demonstrations triggered by his bid for a fifth term in office. After two decades in power, he had lost the backing of key supporters including armed forces chief Ahmed Gaid Salah."

New York, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The British pound retreated Friday after London requested another extension in the long-running Brexit saga while global stocks rose modestly on US-China trade talk hopes and solid US jobs data.
British Prime Minister Theresa May asked the European Union to delay Britain's departure until June 30, while the bloc itself suggested that it might be best to postpone the split for up to a year.
As so often before, sheer uncertainty over Britain's future weighed on sterling but the currency's downside was limited by expectations that the exit from the EU will be softened by some kind of agreement with the bloc.
""As far as most Currency traders are concerned the chances of a no-deal remain remote -- but at the same time a satisfactory outcome anytime soon also seems highly unlikely,"" said XTB analyst David Cheetham.
In stock market deals London gained solidly as the pound slid, while Paris and Frankfurt had only small gains to show for the day's trading.
Wall Street stocks climbed after the Labor Department reported that the US added 196,000 net new positions last month, well above expectations, while the jobless rate held steady at 3.8 percent.
Analysts viewed the report as highly favorable to stocks because it lessened fears of a profound economic slowdown. At the same time, wage inflation moderated, reducing the chances the Federal Reserve will shift to a more hawkish posture.
""The jobs report was just perfect for equities,"" said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
The S&P 500 closed the week with a gain of 2.1 percent, lifting its total advance in 2019 to 15.4 percent. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Los Angeles, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Kim In-kyung hopes to take care of some unfinished business at the ANA Inspiration after firing one of the lowest rounds of her career on Friday.
The former tournament runner-up birdied the 18th hole to finish with a sizzling seven-under 65 and a three-shot lead in the second round of first major championship of the LPGA Tour season.
The South Korean 's round included eight birdies and one bogey to take her total to eight-under 136 on the Mission Hills Country Club course near Palm Springs , California.
""I knew my game was getting better,"" said Kim, who has seven LPGA titles. ""I have been training a lot and improving every day.
""The ball was playing shorter than yesterday so I had to adjust.
""Out here you get what you see. You can't really expect everything to go in. I was seeing some lines today and put some good speed on it."" The 30-year-old Kim is hoping to redeem herself after missing a 35 centimetre (14 inch) putt on the 18th hole of the 2012 tournament that would have delivered her the championship.
Instead she went into a playoff with compatriot Yoo Sun-young where she lost on the first extra hole.
Katherine Kirk of Australia is alone in second after shooting a 68 to reach five-under 139.
Ko Jin-young and Ally McDonald are tied for third at four-under 140, four strokes back of Kim.
Tied for fifth is China 's Yan Jing, England's Charley Hull, South Korean Park Sung-hyun and Americans Lexi Thompson and Danielle Kang who are all at three-under after two rounds.
Kim got off to a roaring start by making birdie on three of her first five holes. He only blemish of the round came on the par-four seventh where she made bogey.
She then finished strong on the back nine with birdies on Nos. 15, 16 and 18. She birdied all four par-fives en route to recording the third lowest scoring round of her career.
Despite her final hole stumble in 2012, Kim is not without a major victory. In 2017 , she captured the Women 's British Open, in a season that saw her win three times on the Tour.
Kim didn't want to talk about her playoff loss seven years ago.
""Sometimes it is difficult to take outcomes. I don't have control over it, that's the truth,"" she said.
Kirk, of Brisbane , birdied six of her first 11 holes. She was tied with Kim on the tee at 17 but back-to-back closing bogeys and Kim's blazing finish dropped her into solo second.
""Sometimes you get the breaks and sometimes you don't,"" said Kirk. ""I made a club error on 17 and that is part of golf unfortunately.
""On 18 it was a bad tee shot and so I didn't have much of a second shot. But overall I am happy with my score."""

Ankara, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday accused the US and Europe of ""meddling"" in Turkey 's affairs after statements from Western allies following his ruling party's challenge to local election results.
Erdogan and his AKP suffered an upset in Sunday 's ballot when results showed the party lost the capital Ankara and was narrowly defeated in Istanbul , the country's largest city and economic hub .
While the United States has called on Turkey to accept the results, the European Union urged Ankara to allow elected officials to ""exercise their mandate freely"".
But Erdogan rejected the remarks and told the US and Europe to ""know your place"".
""America and Europe are... meddling in Turkey 's internal affairs,"" Erdogan said in his first direct remarks to journalists since Monday.
"" Turkey gave a democracy lesson to the whole world ,"" he added.
US State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said ""free and fair elections are essential for any democracy , and this means acceptance of legitimate election results are essential"" during a briefing on Tuesday.
EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic on Monday said Brussels expected elected local representatives to be able ""to exercise their mandate freely and in line with the principles of the Council of Europe (rights group) to which Turkey is of course party.""Andrew Dawson, head of a delegation from the Council of Europe in Turkey to observe the vote , said on Monday his team was ""not fully convinced that Turkey currently has the free and fair electoral environment which is necessary for genuinely democratic elections in line with European values and principles.""

NEW YORK, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A New York man is in custody after U.S, Federal authorities allege he made death threats against Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Democrat who is among the first of two Muslim women to serve in Congress .
Patrick Carlineo, 55, of Addison, was arrested Friday and charged by criminal complaint with threatening to assault and murder a United States official, according to the Elmira Star-Gazette.
Carlineo threatened to kill Ms. Omar, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Harvey, who is prosecuting the case.
On March 21, a staff member in Omar's office received a phone call from an individual, eventually identified as Carlineo, allegedly stated to the staff member, ""Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she's an (expletive) terrorist . I'll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull."" After receiving the call, Ms. Omar's office referred the threat to the United States Capitol Police , which began an investigation in coordination with the FBI .
Omar is a newly elected representative who was elected to the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm election .
She faced backlash in recent months for tweets and comments she made that critics claim played into enduring anti-Semitic stereotypes.
Carlineo was questioned March 29 by FBI agents at his residence in Steuben County, according to the criminal complaint, according to media reports.
Carlineo told the agents he is a patriot, that he loves President Donald Trump and hates radical Muslims in government , the complaint stated.
He also told agents he didn't remember exactly what he said to Omar's staffer but admitted it might have been close to what her office reported to authorities.
When asked if there were any weapons in the residence, Carlineo confirmed there was a shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle, according to the complaint.
Carlineo made an initial appearance Friday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Marian W. Payson and is being held pending a detention hearing on Wednesday. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
Twenty states file motion to block Trump border wall funding : New York AG,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/twenty-states-file-motion-to-block-trump-bord-587316.html,"Twenty States File Motion To Block Trump Border Wall Funding : New York AG Umer Jamshaid 19 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 08:20 AM
NEW YORK, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Twenty U.S. states Friday signed a motion to block President Donald Trump 's attempts to divert Federal funds to build a wall along the US' border with Mexico aimed at controlling illegal migration.
""This wall is unnecessary, and an abuse of power that will take away resources that could be used to help Americans across our nation,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted.
The states filed a lawsuit in February after Trump declared a national emergency to help build a border wall that was a signature of his 2016 campaign for president.
The motion for a preliminary injunction to block Trump 's effort that was filed late Thursday formalized that request.
Trump's order would allow him to spend money on the wall that Congress appropriated for other purposes.
Congress declined to fulfill his request for US $ 5.7 billion to help build the wall this year.
Trump retreated from his threat to close the US-Mexican border , warning he will instead impose car import tariffs if the major US trading partner does not do more to stop undocumented migrants and drug smugglers.
""If Mexico doesn't give the help, that's OK, we're going to tariff their cars ,"" Trump said at the White House . ""I will do it. I don't play games."" Trump said he was giving Mexico one year to get the cross-border drug trade down or see him impose tariffs at 25 per cent.
If that does not work, closing the border would come next, he said.
Speaking without notes, Trump was not wholly clear on the details of his border policy changes.
""If Mexico doesn't do what they can do very easily, apprehend these people coming in we're going to tax the cars, and if that doesn't work, we're going to close the borders,"" he said.
""We're also going to do something having to do with tariffs on drugs because hundreds of thousands of lives (are) ruined a year in our country,"" he said. ""If the drugs don't stop we're going to put tariffs."" ""So we will put tariffs if they don't apprehend (migrants) and ultimately -- we're going to give a period of time, but if in a year from now, if drugs continue to pour in, we're going to put tariffs on them,"" he said.
In Mexico City , Economy Minister Graciela Marquez Colin urged Trump not to disrupt trade relations.
""For the Mexican government , it is very important to keep migration issues and trade issues separate,"" she told a press conference.
""The United States sometimes mixes the two issues. To us, it's very important to keep the ratification of the trade agreement on one track and migration-related issues on another,"" said Marquez, referring to the newly negotiated USMCA or United States-Mexico-Canada deal.
""In terms of any new tariffs, we would have to discuss them in terms of a relationship between two trade partners who are in the process of modernizing a trade agreement ,"" she added, referring to NAFTA, the existing trade agreement that the new USMCA deal seeks to update.
Separately, Trump confirmed on Friday he will skip the ""boring"" White House correspondents' dinner later this month, saying he'll hold a rally instead.
Trump, who launches almost daily verbal attacks on what he considers a hostile media , has missed the two previous sessions of the annual get-together in Washington .
Asked if he'd go to this year's gathering, on April 27, he told reporters at the White House , ""the dinner is so boring and so negative that we're going to hold a very positive rally."" Trump said his rally, in a still undecided location, will be ""a big one."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

UNITED NATIONS, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Intensifying clashes between the Myanmar military and armed separatists that reportedly involved a deadly helicopter bombing raid on civilians earlier this week in the restive Rakhine state, have been condemned by the UN human rights office, OHCHR.
""The Myanmar military is again carrying out attacks against its own civilians; attacks which may constitute war crimes,"" OHCHR Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva on Friday.
The conflict between the Myanmar military � known as the Tatmadaw - and the Arakan Army , dates back around a decade.
In the most recent escalation, OHCHR reported that on the evening of April 3, two military helicopters flew over Hpon Nyo Leik village in south Buthidaung township, firing on Rohingya Muslims who were tending their cows and paddy fields.
At least seven civilians were killed, and 18 others were injured , according to sources in Myanmar .
""These particular killings we have been able to verify with some certainty,"" Ms. Shamdasani said, noting that OHCHR had received a large amount of video and footage photographs supporting the attack .
""This is why we're putting it out there: that there was a helicopter attack , that bombs were dropped, and that these seven civilians were killed."" The mainly Buddhist Arakan Army was formed almost a decade ago in response to economic and social injustice grievances, which are distinct from the systematic discrimination and violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims that forced hundreds of thousands to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh in late August , 2017 .
The most recent violence was prompted by Arakan Army attacks on several police posts on 4 January , Ms. Shamdasani said, leading to credible reports of the killing of civilians, burning of houses, arbitrary arrests, abductions and damage to cultural property.
""There was an attack by the Arakan Army on several police posts and the Tatmadaw � the army of Myanmar - responded with very strong force and we received information that instructions were given to them to crush the Arakan Army ,"" she said, noting that only faltering discussions between the two sides had taken place.
""We call on the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army to immediately cease hostilities and to ensure that civilians are protected,"" she said. ""Humanitarian access to all areas of northern Rakhine must urgently be restored, including those areas affected by recent clashes."" The fighting was not simply an issue of Buddhists against Muslims , Ms. Shamdasani said, explaining that it has affected various ethnic groups in Rakhine and Chin States, including Rakhine, Rohingya, Chin, Mro and Daignet.
""As the international community is taking steps towards accountability for the crimes committed against civilians in previous years, the Myanmar military is again carrying out attacks against its own civilians - attacks which may constitute war crimes,"" Ms. Shamdasani said.
""The consequences of impunity will continue to be deadly."" Amid the ongoing violence, more than 20,000 civilians are estimated to have been displaced in Rakhine state, with many staying in informal settlements including paddy fields.
""The 3 April attack was carried out in an area that had seen large-scale displacement of Rohingya civilians in recent days,"" she added. ""According to information received by our office, some 4,000 Rohingya were displaced between 25 and 30 March from the villages along the road connecting Buthidaung and Rathedaung towns."" Concerns are growing because fighting was formerly restricted to hilly areas but is now moving to more densely populated areas, where the Arakan Army is embedding itself.
Echoing concerns over displaced families, UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) official Andrej Mahecic said there had been no reports of civilians fleeing across the border to Bangladesh .
He also noted that the ongoing violence had halted efforts to implement more than 30 community projects in Myanmar 's northern Rakhine state, where UNHCR still does not have humanitarian access. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Kupcho stood on 5-under par 139 with a one-stroke lead over Mexico 's Maria Fassi after 36 holes at nearby Champions Retreat with Americans Kaitlyn Papp and Sierra Brooks and Thailand 's Pimnipa Panthong another stroke adrift.
All 72 competitors enjoyed a practice round Friday at Augusta National but only the top 30 advanced to compete over 18 holes, women battling for a trophy at the iconic course for the first time.
Kupcho and Fassi will tee off in the last group at 10:20 a.m. while Americans Anna Redding and Allisen Corpuz tee off in the first pairing at 8 a.m. Saturday after ceremonial first-tee shots by former LPGA stars Annika Sorenstam, Lorena Ochoa and Nancy Lopez.
Kupcho worked Friday with caddie Brian Murphy, her bagman when she toured the course in 2017 with her Wake Forest University team and again in the final round.
""It was just a lot of fun to see the course again,"" Kupcho said. ""I played really well and was hitting the ball well. So I think I'm ready for tomorrow."" Fassi, a University of Arkansas senior, reached the green in two shots on all four of Augusta National's par-5 holes on Friday.

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The United States sanctioned 34 vessels tied to PDVSA and two companies that transport oil from Venezuela to Cuba while US officials and leaders intensified belligerent rhetoric to take military action against President Nicolas Maduro's government .
The United States has exacerbated Venezuela 's economic crisis by imposing several rounds of crippling financial sanctions and seizing billions of Dollars ' worth of oil assets since January , US-backed opposition figure Juan Guaido illegally proclaimed himself the country's interim president. Maduro has accused the United States of trying to orchestrate a coup in order to install Guaido as a US puppet.
US Vice President Mike Pence announced the sanctions during a speech at Rice University in Houston , Texas on Friday before a senior administration officials gave details to reporters in a conference call.
""Today we are taking action against a vital source of the Maduro regime's wealth,"" Pence said. ""At the direction of President Donald Trump , the United States of America will sanction 34 vessels owned or operated by PDVSA as well as two additional companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba ,"" Pence said.
The Treasury Department's Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in a press release later in the day said the United States sanctioned one Liberian and one Greek company and a ship they used to allegedly transport crude oil from Venezuela to Cuba .
"" Cuba has been an underlying force fueling Venezuela 's descent into crisis. Treasury is taking action against vessels and entities transporting oil , providing a lifeline to keep the illegitimate Maduro regime afloat,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the release. "" Cuba continues to profit from , and prop up, the illegitimate Maduro regime through oil-for-repression schemes as they attempt to keep Maduro in power.""
The United States , he added, remains committed to holding Cuba accountable for its direct involvement ""in Venezuela 's demise. ""
Separately, OFAC identified 34 vessels as blocked property of PDVSA - which was designated on January 28 - for operating in the oil sector of the Venezuelan economy, the release said.
OFAC identified a third vessel, which transported oil from Venezuela to Cuba , as blocked property that is owned by one of these companies.
In his Houston speech, Pence served notice that additional sanctions would follow rapidly to target Venezuela 's finances.

The United States , the official added, imposed the latest round of sanctions upon the request of Venezuela 's National Assembly ,
The United States had already slapped Venezuela 's state oil producer PDVSA with punitive measures, blocking the company 's assets worth $7 billion remaining under the US jurisdiction. According to the White House 's forecast, the company might lose another $11 billion in oil supplies.
Recently, commenting on the outcome of these restrictions, US Special Representative Elliott Abrams stated that Washington ""had a fair amount of success"" in persuading companies to reduce the amount of oil they purchase from PDVSA.
The US punitive measures affected Venezuela 's overall exports of crude oil and fuel: they have dropped to 920,000 barrels per day in the first month of sanctions, roughly 30 percent less than 1.5 million bpd in the prior three months, according to Refinitiv Eikon and state firm PDVSA data.
Russia, China , Cuba , Bolivia , Turkey and a number of other countries have voiced their support for Maduro as the only legitimate president of Venezuela ."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Battles on the outskirts of Libya 's Tripoli will begin on Saturday, Ahmed Mismari, the spokesman of the eastern Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, said amid the forces' offensive on the city, controlled by the rival UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).
""Tomorrow, there will be fighting on the outskirts of Tripoli ,"" Mismari said on Friday, as quoted by Al-Hadath newspaper.
The LNA representative added that Haftar's forces were located 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) to the south of Tripoli .
The army began its offensive on Tripoli on Thursday in a bid to ""liberate the city from terrorists"" after taking control of the nearby cities of Surman and Garyan.
Earlier on Friday, Mismari said that the LNA was advancing on Tripoli from several directions simultaneously.
According to media reports, LNA and the forces of the GNA are currently in clashes, trying to take control over the international airport in Tripoli .
Haftar's offensive on the city sparked international concerns about the escalation of the situation in the country, which has been devastated by the conflict since 2011 when its long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi was assassinated."

BAKU (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Azerbaijan is interested in holding trilateral talks with Iran and Russia in order to agree on economic preferences of the International North-South Transport Corridor, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov said.
Earlier in the day, the Azerbaijani foreign minister said that Baku had received an official note on the meeting of the presidents of Azerbaijan , Iran and Russia , adding that it might take place in Russia in August .
""The trilateral format of Baku - Moscow - Tehran is a good initiative. The first meeting was held in Baku , then there was a meeting in Tehran . This was a meeting of the presidents who are building a corridor all the way up to St. Petersburg . In this case, everyone is interested in it having an effect. Yes, there are questions that need to be answered since the corridor is mainly tuned to Indian goods and South China goods. All this is a topic of conversation.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The forces of the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) said they regained control over the Tripoli airport , previously captured by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), Al-Arabiya broadcaster reported.
Earlier in the day, a source close to Haftar's entourage told Sputnik that the LNA had captured the international airport in Tripoli . LNA spokesman Ahmed Al-Mismari confirmed this information later.
Tripoli International Airport is located 34 kilometers from the Libyan capital. The air harbor has not been operational since 2014. After fierce battles between Libyan armed groups on its territory, part of the terminal building was burnt down and explosions caused significant damage to the runway. In recent years, the main harbor of the capital is the Mitiga International Airport , located 5 miles from Tripoli 's center.
Al-Mismari said that Haftar's army was carrying out an offensive on Tripoli in several directions at once but has not yet entered the capital. He stated that he could not yet name the date of the end of the operation, but confirmed that the operation would continue until all objectives are completed."

New York, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Wall Street stocks concluded another solid week on a positive note on Friday after the March US jobs report showed steady employment growth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 26,424.99, up 0.2 percent.
The broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.5 percent to 2,892.74, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 7,938.69.
All three indices are at peaks for 2019 .
The Labor Department reported that the US added 196,000 net new positions last month, well above expectations, while the jobless rate held steady at 3.8 percent.
Analysts viewed the report as highly favorable to stocks because it lessened fears of a profound economic slowdown. At the same time, wage inflation moderated, reducing the chances the Federal Reserve will shift to a more hawkish posture.

The Sheer Weirdness of an Illegal Inaugural,www.commondreams.org,Ciara Torres-Spelliscy,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/06/sheer-weirdness-illegal-inaugural,"Trump's team may have violated some of the few campaign finance regulations that still apply to inaugural committees
by Ciara Torres-Spelliscy 0 Comments (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
I’ve been working on campaign finance issues for fourteen years. I’ve never seen an illegal inaugural. Until now, potentially.
During an election, a U.S. citizen can give $2,800 to a candidate running for president. But once that candidate wins, a U.S. citizen can give an unlimited amount to an inaugural committee.
Presidential inaugurations are at the very edge of campaign finance regulations. That means most of the typical campaign finance restrictions during an election, including on the size and sources of donations, simply don’t apply to an inaugural committee .
For example, during an election, a U.S. citizen can give $2,800 to a candidate running for president . But once that candidate wins, a U.S. citizen can give an unlimited amount to an inaugural committee to celebrate their candidate’s assumption of power. Here’s another example: Corporations cannot give directly to a federal candidate during an election, but they can give an unlimited amount to an inaugural committee.
Plenty of wealthy people and corporations took advantage of this increased ability to spend in 2017. NBC News found that 14 individual donors to the inaugural, who gave around $350,000 on average, were nominated to be ambassadors by President Trump. Many companies gave at the $1 million mark to the Trump 2017 inaugural. Many of the same companies also gave to Obama’s inaugural . Corporations with regulatory matters pending before the federal government often use such donations to butter up the new guy in charge. It’s a little unnerving from the outside since it looks like currying favor, but generally it’s perfectly legal.
Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are looking into what was going on in the Trump inaugural committee, including asking one of the vendors, a friend of Melania Trump named Stephanie Wolkoff, about the committee’s expenditures according to press reports .
So why are there criminal investigations into the Trump inaugural? Because it looks like the committee may have violated some of the few campaign finance regulations that still apply. For instance, inaugural committees are not allowed to accept money from foreign nationals. As the controlling regulation states :
A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a donation to an inaugural committee. ...No person shall knowingly accept from a foreign national any donation to an inaugural committee.
This regulation appears to have been violated at least once by Sam Patten , who acted as a straw donor for a Ukrainian who paid $50,000 for tickets to the 2017 inaugural. (We know about this because of a plea by Mr. Patten.) Then there is the CITGO donation of half a million dollars , which raises another potential foreign donor issue. CITGO is owned by Venezuela . While the FEC doesn’t have a particularly strong record for enforcing election laws, it did recently rouse from its slumber to hit Jeb Bush’s super PAC Right to Rise with a hefty $1.3 million fine for accepting money from a foreign-owned company. And because federal prosecutors already investigating, any alleged malfeasance may actually have some legal consequences.
The other basic requirement for an inaugural committee is transparency. While there are not many restrictions on where the money comes from, there is a requirement to report accurately to the FEC where the money came from 90 days after the inauguration. And here the Trump inaugural committee seems to have failed again. When the committee first filed its report , it had a number of bogus entries, which were fact-checked by a crowd-sourced effort spearheaded by journalist Christina Wilkie .
The most striking “error” filed by the Trump inaugural committee was an alleged donation from Hidden Figures star, and real-life person, Katherine Johnson, which listed NASA as her address . The real Katherine Johnson is 90 and doesn’t, you know, live at NASA. Also, when reporters tracked down the real Katherine Johnson’s family, they said she had not given $25,000 to the Trump fête. Another bogus entry for $400,000 listed an empty lot in New Jersey as the address. Prosecutors may be investigating whether these bogus entries were masking illegal donations.
Then there’s the allegation that the Trump inaugural committee deputy chair Rick Gates was trying to get donors to directly pay vendors, as reported by Pro Publica . This would be another way to short-circuit the required disclosures to the FEC, since the committee only reports money that it received.
On top of all that, there’s the open issue of where the money went. There has been reporting that the Trump Organization was benefiting from the inaugural by overcharging for event space at the direction of Ivanka. That’s just one more potential conflict of interest that could have easily been avoided.
Not only are the feds looking into what happened to the $107 million donated to the Trump inaugural committee, where it really came from and where it was spent, the D.C. attorney general Karl Racine is also checking to see if any local laws were violated.
After these investigations are over, America may discover something nearly unheard of and hard to pull off—an illegal inaugural.

This Castle in the Desert Provides Respite to Asylum-Seekers,www.commondreams.org,Rose Lambert-Sluder,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/06/castle-desert-provides-respite-asylum-seekers,"After leaving detention, as many as 300 asylum-seekers find temporary housing in a former monastery before they move onto the next leg of their journey
by Rose Lambert-Sluder 0 Comments Built in the 1930s, the monastery has a grand presence on an otherwise nondescript street. Sunlight's tendency to tint its stucco exterior earned the monastery its nickname the ""Pink Rose of the Desert."" (Photo: Rose Lambert-Sluder)
In the Sonoran Desert not far from a beauty school and a car wash, stands a rose-colored castle. Sun bakes the tiered terra-cotta roofs. And the long colonnades and date palms at its front entrance evoke a dream.
On certain days of the week, a white U.S. Department of Homeland Security bus pulls up out front and 80 or so children and adults step off and disappear into a turquoise-domed sanctuary.
This former 40-bedroom Benedictine monastery in Tucson, Arizona, is where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been bringing hundreds of asylum-seekers directly from detention every week since January. Casa Alitas, a Catholic nonprofit program, hosts them here for up to four days—providing meals, free clothing, toiletry kits, and medical care—preparing them for the next leg of their journeys.
At the end of their stay the asylum-seekers will board Greyhound buses bound for far-flung destinations across the U.S., where they’ll stay with sponsors, usually family members, to await hearings before immigration judges.
Normally, Casa Alitas provides housing and meals from a modest four-bedroom house not far away for up to 16 people at a time. But in January, as border crossings reached an 11-year high, a wealthy developer loaned this sprawling architectural gem to Catholic Community Services of Southern Arizona for six months, rent-free. Overnight guests can number up to 300.
Known as the “Pink Rose of the Desert,” the monastery was built in the 1930s after a group of Benedictine sisters traveled to Tucson to establish the second American branch of the Switzerland-based Perpetual Adoration Convent. They commissioned Spanish Revival architect Roy Place to design the monastery, which is marked by Baroque flourishes and a frieze with symbolic wheat, grapes, and pomegranates.
The owner, Ross Rulney, bought it two years ago from the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration , whose 16 nuns spent their days here baking altar breads, singing vespers, and playing volleyball.
These days, the space hums with different energy.
Out back is a desert springtime scene, as giggling children pedal tricycles through an orchard and women sip coffee near a yellow rose bush. A soccer game is getting underway. Bras hang to dry on the courtyard orange trees, and overripe oranges tumble onto the grass. Looking around, it’s easy to forget that all of this is just another scene in the country’s most pressing humanitarian crisis.
On any given night, as many as 300 asylum-seekers stay here, sleeping in the nuns’ former bedrooms or on cots in communal spaces such as the chapel sanctuary. Most guests are Central American and Spanish-speaking, but some speak primarily Q’eqchi’, K’iche’, and other Indigenous languages.
They create a revolving door at this castle, requiring about a hundred local volunteers, some working 12 hours or more a day, serving food, driving guests to the bus station, and attending to individual needs, says site coordinator Diego Piña Lopez.
Joseline, a 25-year-old who’s been here just a day, gushes over a cute baby onesie with giraffe prints. She’s in the clothing room of the monastery, a department set up like a well-tended thrift shop. Guests can come anytime and pick out two sets of donated clothes. Joseline’s sons, Pablo and Andrés, 4 and 6, both find superhero T-shirts they like.
The three had left Guatemala in early March in part because Joseline felt her life threatened by her brother-in-law. She helps another woman pick out new baby clothes then quickly organizes the kids’ section.
The immigration detention facility, she says, was awful. The bathrooms lacked doors, and everyone saw everything. The food was barely edible, consisting of crackers, burritos, juice cups, and ugly-tasting water, she explains. The burritos too spicy, far too spicy for her boys to eat. Breakfast might be at any hour—1 a.m., 3 a.m., 11 a.m. Guards banged on the wall.
“When we arrived [at the monastery] Sunday afternoon, we hadn’t eaten since the day before,” Joseline says. “We saw a doctor here, had a good dinner. The food is really nice. There are clothes, shampoo, fruit, coffee with milk, blankets.”
“It’s calmer here, safer. There are toys. My sons have little friends.”
There is a sense of plenty. At first blush, supplies seem strained as more guests arrive. But then, new cots show up as if out of nowhere, and extra rooms open up. Soup pots run deep, and baskets of bananas are refilled as soon as they are empty.
The resources are all compliments of volunteers and other supporters of Casa Alitas. The clothes, food, personal hygiene products, coloring books, toys, baby supplies—anything a family might need—are piled, hour by hour, near the monastery’s back entrance.
Email blasts ask community members for the day’s most urgent needs: mini shampoos, kids’ shoes, sacks and sacks of PB&Js.
A father of two, 28-year-old Gabriel sees this place as a light in the darkness. Speaking in a soft voice, he explained how he traveled from Honduras with his wife, Jessica, and daughters Hasley, 6, and Sofía, 8.
Out of gratitude, Gabriel spends full days volunteering to fold clothes and help orient newcomers, even accidentally working through lunch, then laughing at himself after realizing the late hour.
At Casa Alitas “we were met with hugs, with warmth. It was a loosening,” he says, slumping his body in an exaggerated exhale to illustrate.
On any given day, up to 100 children, like his two, run the labyrinthine hallways, playing with donated dolls or taking volunteer-taught art classes. For them, as for their parents, the monastery is a radical shift from immigration detention and the journey that preceded it. Asked how she spends her days, his daughter Sofía, her eyes alert, says, “I play. I color.” Does she help clean with her friend Aimeé? She gave a sheepish smile. “No. I eat soup.”
Soup is a hit here. Volunteers bring pots of homemade soup, beans, rice, and meat, which the residents eat at folding tables covered in bright vinyl cloths. A staggering 380 guests were served one Sunday evening. Managing the swell in numbers, up by about 150 the week before, meant asking volunteers to step up even more.
After dinner, a dreamy light mellows the orchard. Guests sip coffee in the courtyard, and kids turn the paths into tricycle motorways. Asked what he and Jessica will do tonight, Gabriel smiled and shrugged. “We’ll relax.” In two days, they leave for Baltimore, where they’ll stay with family.
And in July, Casa Alitas will leave this borrowed palace and return to its four-bedroom house across town. The monastery’s owner hopes to build luxury apartments on the lot’s vacant land. And Casa Alitas will return to its four-bedroom house across town.
But for now, out on the lawn, as the sky grows pink, Sofía puts on sunglasses and parades around a palm tree, framed by the sunlight.

The agreement to form a constitutional committee was reached during the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in the Russian city of Sochi back in January 2018 . The panel is expected to be made up of representatives of the government and opposition , Syrian experts, members of civil society , independents, tribal leaders, and women , according to the statement from the congress .
Russia, Turkey and Iran have been key foreign players in organizing the committee, and the United Nations has been helping to draft the list of the committee's future members.

If the 2020 presidential election hinges on recounts in the closest battleground states, there could be a crisis even greater than the 2000 election where the U.S. Supreme Court ended a Florida recount in its infamous Bush v. Gore ruling.
The laws and timetables governing recounts in many swing states differ widely and aren’t necessarily geared toward transparent granular counting.
That’s because the laws and timetables governing recounts in many swing states differ widely and aren’t necessarily geared toward transparent granular counting—and that’s apart from President Trump’s habit of attacking election outcomes he doesn’t like by claiming they were stolen.
“I see what the states have put out there. They have not proven realistic,” said Matthew Weil , senior associate director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, speaking of the policies and legal landscape that unfold after election night. The BPC is soon expected to issue a report on the topic. “It would be very helpful to really look at what a realistic and rational policy would be, and we can work toward that goal.”
Should presidential recounts occur, it appears that history will not repeat what happened in 2016 —when courts shut down two of the three recounts filed by the Green Party: in Michigan and Pennsylvania but not Wisconsin. But the chances of voters seeing a convincing process may prove as frustrating as 2016.
“By conventional standards, the 2016 presidential recount was close, but not by recount standards,” said Chris Sautter, a nationally known lawyer specializing in post–Election Day procedures. “Nonetheless, a truly accurate recount to fully verify the results was not possible in any of the three states because laws in those states didn’t permit meaningful recounts, and because even had the laws permitted proper recounts, most of Pennsylvania and a few counties in Wisconsin did not use election equipment that produced paper records of each vote.”
In 2016, three purple states tipped the Electoral College and made Trump president. Millions of Americans were stunned. The Green Party’s presidential nominee, Jill Stein, stepped into the “what happened?” void, raising $7.3 million and filing for recounts in the states with the three closest margins: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
The recounts accomplished little of what recounts are supposed to do—validate or update the earlier results. They were blocked in Michigan, stopped in Pennsylvania after barely beginning, and, in Wisconsin, where they were completed after revealing inconsistencies in some vote-counting machinery, Trump emerged with several hundred more votes. Instead of resolving ambiguities and bringing legitimacy to the results, the narrative was dogged by suspicions of hacked machinery, slash-and-burn political rhetoric, contentious court battles and rulings, resistance to re-examining count votes by some local officials and wide media ridicule. These factors did little to satisfy Americans seeking answers.
Since 2016, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have updated some laws or counting protocols in response to the recount, but not all of those revisions are intended to open up the process. Looking more widely, most possible 2020 swing states each have different post–Election Day rules, counting timetables and deadlines, some of which are hard to meet without squeezing in a thorough recount.
Since 2016, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have updated some laws or counting protocols in response to the recount, but not all of those revisions are intended to open up the process.
With the possible exception of Florida , most of the several dozen recount-related bills now in legislatures were not from likely presidential battleground states, heading toward passage, nor involved big changes. Or, as in Arizona, there’s a proposed bill to make it more expensive to file for a recount if it’s not automatic—a deterrent to recounting.
Many voters do not realize that elections don’t end on election night, where the reported totals are unofficial and incomplete. After all of the ballots are collected and machinery is packed up, a process called the canvass begins. This involves elected officials and civil servants, typically at the county level, compiling and reconciling the totals from their various voting options (early, at precincts, etc.) and still-arriving mailed-in votes. This process typically concludes seven or 10 days later with local certification of winners. State certification follows soon afterward.
If the top contenders are less than 1 percent apart (this slightly varies state-by-state), a recount will be triggered. Depending on the margins, the government or candidates will pay for this. Recounts also follow differing rules depending on the state. Some, like in Florida, only count problematic ballots—with no votes or too many votes. (Election audits are generally not part of this phase , but occur after the election is officially over.)
To choose the president, states have to finish this process before the Electoral College meets about six weeks later. But post-election timetables vary. In Michigan, the process can take no more than 40 days. In Ohio, it’s 31 days. In Wisconsin, 24 days. In Nevada and Pennsylvania, it’s 21 days. In Florida, it’s 14 days—although there is legislation to add five days. These timelines were set years ago, before large numbers of voters started voting by mail, which takes time to process, and Congress created the provisional ballot safeguard (for people not on voter lists), which also must be verified before counting.
What can follow close contests can appear confusing and not inspire confidence. Before three simultaneous statewide recounts were triggered in Florida last fall, including for U.S. senator and for governor, the results kept changing as mail-in ballots came in. In Broward County, Republicans rallied outside of county offices and loudly accused the election workers inside of rigging the results. In Broward County, Palm Beach County and elsewhere, officials didn’t finish in time, which meant under law that the earlier unofficial results stood. Michigan has a similar law on the books.
“It’s very weird, from a government-administration perspective, to be putting out unofficial totals, and then people are seeing them shift,” Weil said. “We now see a lot of concern—i.e., ‘Is something going on if these numbers are shifting?’ Obviously, that’s a part of the process, but I do think we need to evaluate some of those reporting policies.”
The 2016 Recounts What have 2016’s closest swing states done since that year’s presidential recounts?
To recap, several weeks after Election Day, the Greens filed for three recounts: In Michigan , where the results found Donald Trump led by roughly 11,000 votes; in Wisconsin , where he led by 23,000 votes; and in Pennsylvania , by 44,000 votes.
What followed were political brawls. In Michigan, there was fierce pushback by the GOP, where a red-run state government, and courts at the state and federal levels shut down the process. Later studies by Michigan academics argued that Hillary Clinton would likely have won the state in a recount (but not the election) if half of Detroit’s ballots weren’t disqualified . A 1954 law disqualified ballots if the number of voters signing in at precincts did not match the reported vote total, or, as was seen in 2016, ballot storage boxes were banged up or damaged—as signs of possible tampering. Frustrations in Michigan’s governing circles with the city’s elections have kept the law on the books, retired state election officials have said.
Pennsylvania saw differently dissatisfying results in 2016. A full recount never occurred, as many counties had finished the canvass before the Greens filed—including a mountain of petitions submitted at the local level. The state’s courts, a silent blue executive branch and a federal court eventually shut it down. Late last fall, Greens settled a suit with the state where it pledged to use all paper-ballots for 2020.
Only Wisconsin finished its presidential recount, where Trump won 400 more votes, and counties, much to the Greens’ consternation, used different recounting methods—some scanning ballots, others counting by hand.
Wisconsin and Michigan have passed laws to block filings by candidates who do not stand a chance at winning.
After 2016, the American Law Institute has convened a panel of election scholars to publish an update of what it considers the best principles and legislative language for states to resolve “ballot-counting disputes.” Their detailed report delves into the canvass, recounts, and a final stage, contesting results. Its principles are clear: avoid ambiguity in the counting rules and procedures to maximize the legitimacy of the election. That means embracing a transparent process and exercising a “duty of non-partisanship” as a referee.
Should presidential recounts recur in these states in 2020, there will be some differences. To start, two of these states won’t let marginal contenders file. Wisconsin and Michigan have passed laws to block filings by candidates who do not stand a chance at winning—“a good faith belief that they would have had a reasonable chance of winning,” said Shawn Starkey, communication director for Michigan’s Department of State.
That policy was aimed at the next proverbial Stein, as were other changes to Michigan law. Depending on the number of votes separating the leading candidate and a petitioner, the per-precinct filing fees can range from $25 to $250, Starkey said. (Last fall, the state had 4,797 precincts, a number that fluctuates as local populations change.) Michigan also changed some deadlines in its canvass process after 2016. It gave counties one more day before starting that process after Election Day (by 9 a.m. on Thursday, not by 1 p.m. on Wednesday), but then required an “expedited” process if the presidential candidate’s lead was less than 25,000 votes statewide, he said. Counties also must report “any out-of-balance precincts that weren’t reconciled during the canvass.”
The 1950s-era law that disqualified Detroit’s ballots—and would let the first unofficial results stand if a recount wasn’t finished—remains on the books, Starkey said. (In early March, a bill was introduced to amend that law; but it was sitting in a committee.) With regard to auditing the voting machinery or first tabulations, the state currently does not start those until “after the canvass process and official results certification,” he said. In other words, Michigan has not made recounting an easier or more open process.
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Wisconsin’s GOP-run government also blocked future Green-style recounts after 2016. But its state election agency, the Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC), has since taken steps to make results more trustworthy before officially declaring winners. Before the November 2018 election, the WEC doubled the number of wards—the most local election jurisdiction—required to double check their preliminary results, “including at least one in each of the 72 counties,” said WEC spokesman Reid Magney. “Wisconsin has several different makes and models of voting equipment in use, and each type will be audited at least five times.”
Those audits, which involved manually reviewing and counting votes, looked at 135,712 ballots in November, a March 11 report submitted to the WEC said, noting that “was the largest audit of its kind undertaken in the State of Wisconsin.” The report said that the “only noted issue arose” when an older touch-screen electronic voting system used in rural counties saw jams of printers that were supposed to produce a paper record.
“The audit results indicated there were no identifiable bugs, errors, or failure of the tabulation voting equipment,” the report said. “While there were discrepancies identified during the audit, they were the result of human error that occurred as part of the process conducting the audit. Additionally, the results of the audit did not identify programming errors that impacted how the audited voting equipment counted votes.”
The WEC could not order every county to participate in its pre-certification audits, said Magney. But nine counties took part, he said, including some of the biggest population centers. If Wisconsin held the key to who would prevail in 2020’s presidential election, it’s possible an absence of consistent statewide protocols could become an issue in post-election litigation. But Wisconsin has made the process more accountable than what existed in 2016, even though marginal candidates can no longer file for a recount.
In Pennsylvania, the prospective presidential 2020 recount landscape is not yet clear.
In Pennsylvania, the prospective presidential 2020 recount landscape is not yet clear. Last November, the state settled a lawsuit with the Greens where it pledged to replace all of its voting machinery before 2020’s election with paper ballot–based voting systems. (There’s an open question if electronic ballot-marking devices, which some counties are acquiring and critics say can be hacked, would violate that settlement. The Greens’ attorney did not return a request for comment.) That settlement also requires the state to implement pre-certification audits by 2021; however, that would be after the next presidential election.
Stepping back, Pennsylvania is undergoing a makeover of its voting systems and rules. In July 2018, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, announced the state was stepping up cybersecurity surrounding election systems. The current legislative session has numerous bills introduced to open up the voting process, primarily by joining other states that use voting by mail and vote centers. There are no recount-related bills, however.
Compared to the latest policies in Wisconsin, the state’s recount laws are fairly strict. Pennsylvania’s recounts are triggered if the leading candidate’s margin is less than 0.5 percent, and it has to take place by the third Wednesday after Election Day and completed by the next Tuesday—a tight 21-day window. A state elections agency spokeswoman said it was too soon to say what changes might be coming before 2020.
“It’s a little too early for us to predict what changes are coming in Pennsylvania in 2020,” Ellen Lyon, deputy director of the office of communications and press for its Department of State, said. “Several state legislators have election reform bills out there, in addition to the governor’s plan, but they haven’t been acted on yet.”
Other Swing States Perhaps most notable is what may unfold in Florida, where several bills are moving that would make any recount, including for president, more thorough and transparent. There’s legislation to extend its recounting period, because last November several counties could not finish their recounts in time. There is also legislation to allow the most granular vote auditing system now available to be used in recounts. That approach rescans every paper ballot and then compares those results to earlier tabulations. Should this bill pass and be signed into law, Florida would be in a class by itself among swing states for recounts.
In state after state, regulations and timetables can be out of sync with the pragmatic details of conducting modern elections.
But stepping back from that prospect, the big picture surrounding the nation’s vote verification landscape is uneven, as the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Weil said. In state after state, regulations and timetables can be out of sync with the pragmatic details of conducting modern elections. The BPC has convened three task forces to improve the “voting experience,” with one focused on vote counting. Weil said the goal is making elections more trustworthy, not making do with today’s status quo.
“There are a lot of people out there helping election officials work within the system that exists in their state, and fewer looking at the policies that are clearly prescribing what their options are—and maybe those options are not the best options,” Weil said. “I think we need to make sure that the laws line up to ensure that election officials are fully successful, because at this point in a lot of states, either they are pushing up against the laws, or they have resigned themselves to the fact that their laws are never going to allow them to do what makes the voting experience better.”
Will the vote counting landscape be better in 2020 if there are presidential recounts? As Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s retired state election director, said, “Unless it’s a very close election, nobody’s paying attention.” But if there is a contested outcome, by the time the canvassing and recounting begins, it would be too late to improve the process.

New Bill Seeks to Boost US Domestic Production of Rare Earth Elements From Coal - Senators,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/new-bill-seeks-to-boost-us-domestic-productio-587265.html,"New Bill Seeks To Boost US Domestic Production Of Rare Earth Elements From Coal - Senators Mohammad Ali (@ChaudhryMAli88) 18 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 01:35 AM
WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) A new bill introduced into the US Congress seeks to promote technology to extract rare earth elements (REEs) from coal and its byproducts, Senator Jon Manchin said in a press release on Friday.
""US Senators Joe Manchin, Shelley Moore Capito and Lisa Murkowski introduced the Rare Earth Element Advanced Coal Technologies Act (REEACT), which would allow for the development of technology capable of extracting REEs from coal and coal byproducts,"" the release said.
The REEACT legislation authorizes an annual appropriation of $23 million per year to the Department of Energy through 2027, the release noted.
""[T]he United States should not be depending on China and other foreign nations for our supply of rare earth elements. We utilize REEs in the production of everything from our cell phones and televisions to strategic weapons systems,"" Manchin said in the release.
The REEACT legislation will ensure continued research in the technologies that will allow the United States to produce REEs from coal and coal byproducts and help to re-establish US domestic production of the elements, Manchin said in the release."

by Jessica Corbett, The Trump administration revoked a visa this week for International Criminal Court Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. (Photo: ICC)
In a move human rights defenders decried as ""shameful,"" revoked the visa of the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor this week for trying to investigate alleged war crimes committed by American forces in Afghanistan.
""What we can confirm is that the U.S. authorities have revoked the prosecutor's visa for entry into the U.S."" Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's office said in a statement . The decision, per her office, shouldn't interfere with her travel to the United Nations headquarters in New York City.
""Washington's attempt to intimidate the ICC by canceling the ICC prosecutor's visa over a possible Afghanistan investigation is 's latest shameful attack on the rule of law,"" said Richard Dicker, international justice director at Human Rights Watch.
Katherine Gallagher, an international human rights attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, condemned the move as ""interference with judicial proceedings"" that violates international law.
U.S. revokes ICC prosecutor's entry visa over Afghanistan... This is interference with judicial proceedings, pure and simple-a violation of international human rights law & a breach of one of the central tenets of a democracy: that courts are independent. https://t.co/umbLLKswue
— Katherine Gallagher (@katherga1) April 4, 2019
While the decision was widely criticized in the international community, it was not a surprise.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced last month that the administration would revoke or deny visas for any court personnel who try to probe or prosecute American officials or key allies—which critics called a ""blatant effort to intimidate and retaliate against judges, prosecutors, and advocates seeking justice for victims of serious human rights abuses.""
Pompeo's announcement came after John Bolton, national security adviser and a longtime critic of the ICC, threatened to impose sanctions on court officials in September if they continued to pursue an investigation into U.S. service members' conduct in Afghanistan.
Under the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations, the United States has refused to join or support the Hague-based court, which probes and prosecutes crimes of aggression, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide under international law.
In November of 2017, Bensouda requested a probe of potential war crimes committed by U.S. military forces and members of the CIA in Afghanistan. The ICC has not yet made a final decision about whether to open a formal investigation.
Though critics oppose 's visa ban on ICC personnel who are pushing for the investigation as an intimidation tactic, it does not appear to be having that impact on Bensouda, a Gambian lawyer.
""The Office of the Prosecutor has an independent and impartial mandate under the Rome statute of the ICC,"" the statement from her office said.
""The prosecutor and her office will continue to undertake that statutory duty with utmost commitment and professionalism,"" it concluded, ""without fear or favor.""
This is nuts. The United States has imposed a visa ban on the ICC prosecutor. https://t.co/ml4xOjQI4i

BELGRADE (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The University of Maribor and SAB Launch Services (SAB-LS) company signed an agreement to launch the first Slovenian nanosatellite into Earth orbit in summer this year, Slovenian news agency STA reported on Friday.
The Trisat nanosatellite weighing 4.4 kilograms (10 Pounds ) was created at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Maribor in collaboration with the Slovenian company Skylabs.
The launch of the nanosatellite will be an important step in the internationalization of the Slovenian space industry and the recognition of its technologies, the university's rector Zdravko Kacic said.
This is proof that student research can develop into an important project for the Slovenian industry and the environment, he added.
According to the plan, Trisat will be sent into orbit in August on the European Space Agency's (ESA) lightweight non-reusable launch vehicle Vega from the Kourou cosmodrome in French Guiana. It will perform multispectral and shortwave infrared imaging of the Earth. Another 50 satellites will be launched into orbit along with Trisat, including the Slovenian microsatellite Nemo HD.

What Have We Learned From the Rwandan Genocide?,www.commondreams.org,C. Cora True-Frost,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/06/what-have-we-learned-rwandan-genocide,"It is important that we remember the horror of the genocide and reflect on the mistakes made, in order to work toward a more peaceful future
by C. Cora True-Frost 0 Comments Photographs of genocide victims are displayed at the Genocide Memorial Center in Kigali, Rwanda. (Photo: Adam Jones, Ph.D. /Wikimedia Commons/cc)
This first week of April marks the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide, a three-month long massacre during which Hutu militants killed an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus after the Hutu president was killed. The international community responded to the atrocities late, and then sought accountability after the genocide by establishing the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda (ICTR) to try those most responsible.
The legacy of Rwanda's genocide has some compelling messages for American people about the power of our words, and the danger of hate speech.
It is important that we remember the horror of the genocide and reflect on the mistakes made, in order to work toward a more peaceful future. One of the main takeaways from the ICTR's atrocity trials is that words matter.
The world of the Rwandan genocide may to most people seem far removed from the United States. It does not to me. I am a law professor who grew up an Army brat, often abroad. I graduated high school in Nuremberg in the former West Germany—the site of the famous Nuremberg Tribunal held in the wake of the Holocaust. I know that words matter. Always mindful of the horrors of the Holocaust and the ways that democratic majorities can scapegoat and dehumanize minorities, my professional focus has been in constitutional and international law.
The law, and particularly international criminal trials, should teach us about past mistakes. The legacy of Rwanda's genocide has some compelling messages for American people about the power of our words, and the danger of hate speech. Few of us are immune to the polarizing media coverage. Our leaders and media pundits use generalizations about cultures and fear-mongering to drive home support for policy in a very profound and impactful way. Creating hate as opposed to understanding will lead to repeat mistakes. This week in particular, we should heed the legacy of Rwanda's genocide, reminding our nation of what can happen when we don't identify and speak about the impact that fear has on our united psyche.
We Americans know words matter. We famously have strong free-speech protections. We are outliers in the international community for refusing to penalize hate speech. However, even those of us with the strongest commitments to free speech understand that speech can be dangerous and even constitute incitement.
Indeed, many terrorist prosecutions turn on speech acts. The Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda recognized the power of speech to lead to violence when it upheld the convictions of key figures in the genocide: Hassan Ngeze, former editor of the Kangura newspaper; Ferdinand Nahimana, an historian and founder of Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM); and Jean-Bosco Baryagwiza, a Rwandan diplomat and executive committee chairman of RTLM. The print and broadcast media fomented and disseminated statements of broad hatred of the Tutsi ethnic group through aggressive and demeaning rhetoric, even labeling the opposition as ""inyenzi"" (cockroaches) and calling for their extermination.
To honor the lives unnecessarily lost in the Rwandan genocide, we Americans can, while embracing our culture of free speech and free media, ensure that we treat all people, whatever their nationality, as human beings deserving of respect.
Today, our leaders' rhetoric is running too close to past mistakes. Words matter. America's highest leaders' refer to undocumented migrants alternately as ""rapists,"" ""bad guys"" or ""criminals"" who ""infest"" our country. We Americans must demand change in that practice, and heed the lesson of the Rwandan tribunal: that there is often a thin line between hate speech and hate crime.
Professor Susan Benesch's work on dangerous speech can be helpful in discerning that line. We can regard with extra vigilance: speech by powerful speakers who have a high degree of influence over their audience; situations in which an audience has grievances and fears; speech that either explicitly or implicitly calls for violence; contexts that include past acts of violence, including a lack of efforts to confront or solve these acts of violence; and means of dissemination that may be the primary or sole news source for the relevant audience.
In our country, reported hate crimes have risen three years consecutively, including a 17 percent rise from 2017 to 2018, according to the FBI. Indeed, the FBI director cites white nationalism and violent extremism as threats to the U.S., even as our president says he ""does not really see white nationalism as a threat."" Our increasingly polarized media leaves a chasm of understanding between us Americans.
To honor the lives unnecessarily lost in the Rwandan genocide, we Americans can, while embracing our culture of free speech and free media, ensure that we treat all people, whatever their nationality, as human beings deserving of respect.

The horror of the Rwandan genocide 25 years on,www.thenational.scot,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thenational.scot/news/17555215.the-horror-of-the-rwandan-genocide-25-years-on/,"The horror of the Rwandan genocide 25 years on Menu 0 comment What’s the Story?
TWENTY-five years ago today, the presidents of the African countries of Rwanda and Burundi were assassinated in horrific fashion, sparking genocide in the former country. Juvenal Habyarimana, 57, president of Rwanda, and Burundi’s president Cyprien Ntaryamira, 39, were travelling together in the former’s presidential jet when it was blown out of the sky by two surface-to-air missiles.
Both men were trying to end the catastrophic civil wars in their countries, which were both the result of fighting between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples.
Burundi had already experienced near genocide in its civil war but as a strong-arm dictator, Habyarimana had managed to keep his Hutu soldiers from committing outright genocide in the Rwandan civil war which was supposed to end with the signing of the 1993 peace agreement between the Rwandan Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), also known as the Arusha Accords.
There had been slow progress towards peace, and Habyarimana and Ntaryamira had sought help from other Central African leaders.
As the French-built aircraft they were flying was returning to Kigali Airport in Rwanda, it was shot down at 8.20pm local time on April 6, 1994. One missile hit the Dassault Falcon 50’s wing and another hit its tail. The plane exploded into flames and crashed to earth in the grounds of Habyarimana’s presidential palace. There were no survivors.
Who were the victims and who brought down the plane?
APART from the two presidents, there were seven other passengers, including the Rwandan chief of the armed forces and Burundi’s minister of public works. The aircraft’s three French crew also perished.
Despite exhaustive international inquiries, no-one has ever been brought to trial for the murders of the 12 men on board the jet.
Significantly, both presidents were Hutus, and while their assassination may have been carried out by RPF Tutsi fighters, a lot of the evidence – such as the make of the missiles – points to more extreme Hutus who embraced the radical Hutu Power ideology which called for the extermination of all Tutsis.
The RPF, led by Paul Kagame, now president of Rwanda, has been blamed by several investigators but it always denied involvement and the CIA has long stated the attack was acried out by Hutu extremists angry at the peace process.
What was the aftermath?
IN a word, genocide. On the morning after the assassinations, United Nations peacekeepers – many of them Belgian as Rwanda was a former Belgian colony – were rendered helpless as orders went out from self-appointed leader Colonel Théoneste Bagosorato to the Rwandan army to kill Tutsis and moderate peace-seeking Hutus. One of the first to die was the country’s prime minister. The presidential guard killed Agathe Uwilingiyimana and her husband, both moderate Hutus, along with 10 Belgian soldiers charged with her protection.
Other prominent moderate politicians and journalists were also killed within hours – the initial list of targets had been prepared in advance.
Using the pretext of the president’s murder , the interim government formed from Habyarimana’s National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (NRMD) issued hit-lists to soldiers and militias, especially the fearsome Interahamwe, the party’s youth wing. Tutsi people were arrested and killed on the spot, while many Hutu opponents of the NRMD were also slaughtered.
How Terrible Was The Genocide?
AS an example of man’s inhumanity to man, the Rwandan genocide ranks with the very worst atrocities committed against a people. Reports of the events were so horrific that at first many people outside of central Africa refused to believe what was happening.
It was only after the mass slaughter of Tutsis was featured on television – the internet was in its infancy – and reports of rape, murder by machetes and machine-ginning of entire villages began to filter through that the world took seriously what was happening in Rwanda.
The sheer scale of the slaughter was horrific. In less than 100 days, somewhere between 800,000 and one million people were murdered, and many were injured, often in machete attacks.
Women and children were not spared, and people were often killed after a simple ID check – all Rwanda citizens had to carry ID cards which identified them as Hutu or Tutsi. Lists of those who were condemned to die were read out on radio programmes and the government encouraged Hutus to kill Tutsi neighbours and steal their property.
There were reports, subsequently confirmed, that Hutu husbands were forced to kill their Tutsi wives while entire communities that had previously lived in uneasy peace now saw militias and ordinary citizens become killers.
Also slaughtered in large numbers were the pygmy Batwa people – one third of the population of 30,000 was killed.
How did it end?
AS soon as he heard what was happening Kagame launched ferocious RPF attacks into the north of the country. The UN tried to broker ceasefires, but Kagame refused to accept until the genocide ceased.
Eventually RPF fighters encircled most conurbations and Kigali fell to them on July 4, ending the genocide. Some two million Hutus fled the country fearing the RPF’s revenge.
Was there foreign involvement?
BELGIUM pulled out after its soldiers were killed, but there was evidence that France stayed, ostensibly to try to save people.
To mark the 25th anniversary of the double assassination, President Emmanuel Macron yesterday ordered a full inquiry into France’s role in Rwanda."

BERLIN (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Moscow welcomes the progress that had been made on the path to Syria 's reinstatement in the League of Arab States, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin told journalists on Friday.
""Unfortunately, Syria 's membership in the Arab League has been suspended. We think this is wrong. Syria 's return to the Arab family would be a useful, productive step, including in terms of normalizing the socio-economic ties between Syria and other countries. Syria is one of the founding countries of the Arab League. There is progress in this issue and there have been quite serious steps in favor of restoring the normalization of contacts and relations with Syria . We welcome such contacts. This is a good move. But the decision is up to the countries themselves,"" Vershinin said on the sidelines of the Russian-German consultations, held in Berlin .
The Arab League suspended Syrian membership in 2011 over eruption of the civil conflict in the country. Lebanon , Algeria , Iraq , Tunisia , Sudan , the United Arab Emirates , Oman and Bahrain have already voiced their support for returning Syria to the organization. Palestine also wants Syria to be allowed to return to the Arab League.
According to Secretary-General of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Syria may rejoin the organization only if all other members support this initiative. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Pemra issued these directions to local TVs in Pakistan through a notification on Wednesday.
The instructions were issued to solicit their (retired military officers) views on matters of national security.
Media reports stated the notification was issued on Thursday and it read that concerned quarters observed that retired officers were usually not fully conversant with the latest defense and security developments due to their service background and post-retirement time.
Hence, it was stated, they mostly switched from security matters to politics , which inadvertently embroiled military officers into the political debate. The situation was undesirable and therefore it was urged that ISPR clearance was sought before inviting the retired officers in TV’s current affairs and news shows. The officers could be called as simple ‘analysts’ instead of ‘defense analysts’ if their participation required in tv talk shows on political matters."

Nuclear Power Is Not a Viable Solution for Green New Deal,www.commondreams.org,Damon Moglen,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/06/nuclear-power-not-viable-solution-green-new-deal,"It's too expensive, too dangerous and dirty, and takes too long to deploy
by Damon Moglen 0 Comments The nuclear power plant in Byron, Illinois. (Photo: Michael Kappel /flickr/cc)
The Green New Deal resolution is a bold and necessary path forward to tackle the climate crisis. To be successful, it must leave nuclear power behind.
As momentum around the Green New Deal turns into concrete proposals, we must recognize why nuclear power is a discredited and dishonest distraction, not a solution.
With just a decade left to stop the worst effects of climate change, we must dramatically transform how we produce, use and pay for energy. And as momentum around the Green New Deal turns into concrete proposals, we must recognize why nuclear power is a discredited and dishonest distraction, not a solution.
To reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 60 percent by 2030, and down to zero by 2050, we need cost-effective, proven energy generation technology that can be scaled up to meet these benchmarks. Nuclear power does not and will not ever meet these criteria.
After 60 years, despite massive subsidies, the nuclear industry is dying of its own accord. Why? Because it’s too expensive, too dangerous and dirty, and takes too long to deploy. Reactors are closing across the country, and major corporations have declared bankruptcy.
Nuclear power simply cannot compete against safer, cleaner, and cheaper renewable energy. Nuclear power is also expensive. Nuclear’s subsidies have been buried in hundreds of spending bills, it’s costs externalized to the environment and future generations, and its bills literally unpaid, defaulted on or passed to taxpayers. Conservative estimates suggest that the nuclear industry has received more than $85 billion in subsidies. A centrist estimate might double that.
For 60 years, nuclear power has posed a serious risk to people and our planet. It will be the same for the next 10,000 years. Our children and generations of their children will be forced to endure the radioactive pollution and fallout from devastating accidents like 3 Mile Island, Fukashima, and Chernobyl, and the permanent waste that no one can safely store. The risks of nuclear proliferation and the spread of dangerous weapons and technology only adds to this.
Nuclear power is too slow to scale up to our current challenge. Far too slow. In 1997, when the historic Kyoto Protocol was signed, nuclear power’s share of electricity generation globally was around 17 percent. Now, after two decades, the aging fleet of reactors account for barely 10 percent of global electricity generation and about 4.4 percent of global commercial primary energy consumption. Even the nuclear industry’s grandiose and preposterously expensive proposal to build two new nuclear reactors a month, from now to 2050, would be far too little and far too late.
The endless talk of a new nuclear technology that will magically transform this problem is a pipe dream that has a proven record of failure. Hundreds of billions were spent on “breeder” reactors and other esoteric designs and not a single one has yielded a commercial scale reactor.
Continuing to subsidize and retool current reactors will re-direct massive resources that should be put into renewables, while doing nothing to slow global warming.
And continuing to subsidize and retool current reactors will re-direct massive resources that should be put into renewables, while doing nothing to slow global warming.
The task ahead is indeed daunting if we are to turn around global greenhouse gas emissions in the time we have. We must move from a 20th-century energy system based on dirty, dangerous, and expensive fossil fuel and nuclear power to a 21st-century energy system based on renewables.
The solution is a massive commitment to ramping up renewable energy coupled with energy storage while applying modern energy efficiency technologies to decrease demand. Wind and solar are cheap, clean, and proven to work. We must focus all resources on scaling those up.
Some have suggested that climate change is so dire that all options must be on the table. But that’s an ideology, not a strategy. We must choose the technologies that will not produce greenhouse gases and can be scaled up quickly, safely, and at lowest cost. That means the path ahead must be based on renewable energy. If we want to stop the worse of the climate crisis and pull humanity back from the apocalypse, this is the only way forward.

Pakistan urges UN Security Council to fulfill its responsibility on Kashmir,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/pakistan-urges-un-security-council-to-fulfill-587236.html,"Pakistan Urges UN Security Council To Fulfill Its Responsibility On Kashmir Mohammad Ali (@ChaudhryMAli88) 20 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 12:15 AM
UNITED NATIONS, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Pakistan has cited the lack of implementation of UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir, which pledged self-determination to the Kashmiri people, as an example of the 15-member body's inability to fulfill its responsibility.
Speaking in the General Assembly 's long-running intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi said this was another compelling reason for reform of the world body.
""Solemn promises have been broken, on not one, but several resolutions on Kashmir, and undertakings reneged on"", the Pakistani envoy said in her statement in the two-day session that began on Thursday.
Urging reform of the Council's working methods, Ambassador Lodhi said that such moves should be aimed at enhancing the transparency, openness and inclusive decision making in the functioning of the body.
""It goes without saying,"" she stressed, ""that the majority of member states attribute the non-transparency and exclusive nature of working and decision-making of the Council to its permanent members.
Referring to Pakistan 's experience, having served seven times as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, she said that elected members had done more to reinvigorate the working methods of the world body.
Therefore an expansion in the Council in the permanent category could imperil those gains.
Stressing that the ideal of a more transparent and open Council should not be mortgaged to the narrow interests of a few countries, Ambassador Lodhi maintained that aspirants for permanent status in the Council will necessarily fail to prioritize collective good over individual interest.
""We know only too well that Permanent members of the Council jealously guard their domain. There is no reason to believe that that any new permanent members would act otherwise"", she added.
True representation, the Pakistani envoy argued, was inherently linked to active and continuous accountability, and any measure of effectiveness was contingent on redressing the Council's existing dysfunctionalities, and not reinforcing them.
""We, therefore, need to increase, not diminish, the ratio of non-permanent to permanent members"", she stressed.
She underscored that the best way to ensure a responsible and accountable Council would be to strengthen the role and authority of the General Assembly in determining its representation in the Council.
""If elections and accountability are fundamental to our governments, parliaments, regional and international bodies and multilateral institutions"", she asked, ""why should the Security Council be an exception to this? Ambassador Lodhi emphasized that so called 'quick fix' solutions that aim to address substantive issues of Security Council reform without finding common ground would be counter-productive.
""The reform process is too important to be reduced to procedural short cuts"", she said.
Pakistan, she reiterated, would continue to seek a comprehensive reform of the Security Council to turn into more democratic, representative, accountable, transparent and efficient body.
""This is an ideal that we all espouse. This is also an ideal that will make the UN 'fit for purpose' to confront the challenges of tomorrow"", she added."
FACTBOX - Libyan Conflict,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/factbox-libyan-conflict-587235.html,"FACTBOX - Libyan Conflict Sumaira FH 18 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 12:10 AM
MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The forces of the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Khalifa Haftar, started to advance on Tripoli , controlled by the UN-backed interim Government of National Accord (GNA).
Media reported on Thursday that Haftar had ordered an offensive on Tripoli after his army took control over cities of Surman and Garyan. Haftar's aim was to ""liberate the city from terrorists.""
The armed conflict in Libya began in February 2011 as one of the stages of the so-called Arab Spring. Mass rallies erupted in Libyan provinces with demands for the departure of Jamahiriya leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi, who had been in power for over 40 years and ruled the country under a clannish and inter-tribal system.
The city of Benghazi, the second-largest city in Libya , became a stronghold of Gaddafi opponents. Military confrontation between government forces and rebels began in the country. Direct foreign intervention had a profound impact on the course of the confrontation.
Anti-government protests began in Benghazi on February 15. Demonstrators demanded the release of lawyer and human rights activist Fathi Terbil, who was representing the families of those killed during the riot in Abu Slim prison in 1996.
The crowd of protesters did not disperse after Terbil was released, but clashed with the police . After that, the security forces dispersed several hundred demonstrators, who were chanting slogans against the government . Libyan media reported that 14 people were injured in the clashes.
By the end of February , the city of Benghazi fell under the control of Gaddafi opponents. A national Libyan council was formed in the city. It was a revolutionary body, the authority of which had to be recognized by all the cities that had supported the overthrow of Gaddafi government .
Opponents' speeches spread across Tripoli . According to international organizations, the authorities brutally suppressed the demonstrations.
On February 26, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution introducing international sanctions against the Libyan leadership. The UN Security Council measures, designed to stop the killing of the regime opponents, in particular, provided for an embargo on arms trade with Libya , freezing of accounts and a ban on the Libyan leader's foreign trips. This prohibition also applied to the leader's family and some of his entourage.
By this time, Gaddafi had almost completely lost control over the eastern part of the country.
On February 27, the Libyan opposition announced the formation of an interim authority, the National Transitional Council, and preparations for the presidential election .
On March 17, the United States and its Western partners initiated adoption of the resolution by the UN Security Council, the resolution introducing a no-fly zone over Libya . Russia and China decided not to use their veto power, as they considered that it did not run counter to the international community's efforts to resolve the situation in the country.
In practice, however, the forces of the NATO-led Western coalition exceeded the UN mandate and began to launch air strikes against the country's state, civilian and military facilities, thereby siding with the rebels.
On March 19, a foreign military operation against the Gaddafi regime began in Libya . The armed forces of the United Kingdom , France , the United States , Canada , Belgium , Italy , Spain , and Denmark took part in it. The aircraft of the French Air Force, which took off from the Saint-Dizier-Robinson airbase, launched the first airstrike against Libyan military facilities near Benghazi.
On March 31, the leadership of the campaign in Libya completely passed to the representatives of the NATO command.
The armed rebellion in Libya lasted about nine months. As a result, Gaddafi was overthrown and killed on October 20, 2011, near his hometown of Sirte, where he was hiding from the harassment of the opposition .
The oil-producing country suffered tremendous economic damage.
The exact number of deaths is still unknown. According to official Libyan statistics, 5,500 people were killed during these several months of 2011. According to expert estimates, 40,000 people died during the NATO operation.
On October 23, 2011, the National Transitional Council officially announced the end of the civil war in Libya .
The NATO operation in Libya ended on October 31, 2011.
After Gaddafi's death, various clans and armed groups began the struggle for power both at the state and regional levels.
On July 7, 2012, parliamentary elections to the General National Congress were held in Libya . The majority of seats went to two competing parties: the National Forces Alliance and the Islamist Justice and Construction Party.
The confrontation between the Islamists and moderate forces with the support from a part of the military personnel led to another armed conflict, which resulted in the establishment of dual power in the country in August 2014.
The House of Representatives, recognized by the world community, was based in the city of Tobruk in the east of the country, while the pro-Islamic General National Congress (GNC), which was supported by armed groups, was based in Tripoli .
Both governments and both parliaments (the GNC in Tripoli and the House of Representatives in Tobruk) raised claims to be considered the only legitimate leadership of the Libyan state. This led to a new phase of the long-lasting armed conflict in Libya . The amorphous nature of both formations, lack of resources and local support prevented any of them from gaining a crucial advantage in the ensuing military confrontation.
The relentless attempts of the UN and international mediators to bring the representatives of the GNC and the House of Representatives to the negotiating table were unsuccessful. Notable progress was made at the end of 2015 .
On December 17, 2015 , the Libyan Political Agreement under the auspices of the UN on the settlement of the internal conflict was signed in Morocco 's Skhirat.
The main point of the agreement , which took the parties to the conflict 14 months to coordinate, was the formation of an interim Government of National Accord, which would operate during a transitional two-year period. It should have ended with new parliamentary elections.
On December 23, 2015 , the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2259 approving the December 17 agreement on the formation of the Government of National Accord. The resolution was unanimously approved by 15 members of the UN Security Council.
The Government of National Accord was formed on March 31, 2016 , and was headed by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj.
Islamists from the GNC, which stopped existing at the time, joined the High Council of State, a parallel parliament , which, according to the UN plan, should have played an advisory role.
The Tobruk parliament did not support the Government of National Accord, rejecting a vote of confidence in it. The parliament appointed influential General Khalifa Haftar, former friend of Muammar Gaddafi, commander of the armed forces.
Dual power and a collapse of the security system led to an increase in the activities of armed rebel groups and terrorist organizations.
Libya became a breeding ground for the Islamic State (IS terrorist group, banned in Russia ) outside the middle East. After settling in the port city of Sirte, where Gaddafi held out until the fall of 2011, the terrorists took control of a part of Libya 's seacoast, interposing themselves between territories controlled by competing power centers. Together, political opponents drove the IS out of Sirte, but there were no evidence that the leaders of the group were destroyed.
According to media reports, supporters of the IS fled to the south, to the desert. In September 2017, Haftar's inner circle admitted that the Islamists ""are returning to their previous place.""
Within several years, the Libyan National Army , under Haftar's leadership, freed vast territories in the east of the country from terrorists close to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization (banned in Russia ) and the IS, and completely cleared the cities of Benghazi and Derna from radicals. In July 2018 , the representative of the Libyan National Army said that its troops controlled up to 90 percent of the country.
As a result of years-long civil conflict, there is no single central government in Libya , and the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament , elected in 2014 and backed by the LNA, governs the east of Libya , while the GNA, controls Libya 's western parts from Tripoli .
Multiple states, primarily regional ones, have attempted to act as mediators to resolve the Libyan conflict or to influence of the warring parties.
Last May, an international conference on settling the situation in Libya was held in Paris under the auspices of the United Nations . The meeting was attended by Sarraj, Haftar, Aguila Saleh and the president of parliament in eastern Libya , among others.
During the meeting, the sides agreed to hold parliamentary and presidential elections on December 10 and to work toward unifying the country's security forces. However, the agreements reached in Paris were not implemented.
In November 2018 , a conference on the Libyan settlement was held in Italy 's Palermo . It was attended by the Libyan authorities, including Sarraj, as well as the presidents of Egypt and Tunis . The Russian delegation to the meeting was led by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
Haftar also attended the conference, during which he held separate talks with delegations from France , Egypt , Tunis and Russia . Private talks with Haftar provoked discontent among the supporters of Sarraj.
Yet, during the conference, the sides agreed to hold presidential and parliamentary elections, scheduling them for spring. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Standardized Testing is a Tool of White Supremacy,www.commondreams.org,Steven Singer,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/06/standardized-testing-tool-white-supremacy,"It's time to treat all our children fairly. It's time to hang up the tests
by Steven Singer 0 Comments ""What is a standardized test but an assessment that refers to a specific standard? And that standard is white, upper class students."" (Photo: Pixabay/cc)
Let’s say you punched me in the face.
I wouldn’t like it. I’d protest. I’d complain.
And then you might apologize and say it was just an accident.
Maybe I’d believe you.
Until the next time when we met and you punched me again.
That’s the problem we, as a society, have with standardized tests.
We keep using them to justify treating students of color as inferior and/or subordinate to white children. And we never stop or even bothered to say, “I’m sorry.”
Fact: black kids don’t score as high on standardized tests as white kids .
It’s called the racial achievement gap and it’s been going on for nearly a century.
Today we’re told that it means our public schools are deficient. There’s something more they need to be doing.
But if this phenomenon has been happening for nearly 100 years , is it really a product of today’s public schools or a product of the testing that identifies it in the first place?
After all, teachers and schools have changed. They no longer educate children today the same way they did in the 1920s when the first large scale standardized tests were given to students in the U.S. There are no more one-room schoolhouses. Kids can’t drop out at 14. Children with special needs aren’t kept in the basement or discouraged from attending school. Moreover, none of the educators and administrators on the job during the Jazz Age are still working.
Instead, we have robust buildings serving increasingly larger and more diverse populations . Students stay in school until at least 18. Children with special needs are included with their peers and given a multitude of services to meet their educational needs. And that’s to say nothing of the innovations in technology, pedagogy and restorative justice discipline policies.
But standardized testing ? That hasn’t really changed all that much. It still reduces complex processes down to a predetermined set of only four possible answers—a recipe good for guessing what a test-maker wants more than expressing a complex answer about the real world. It still attempts to produce a bell curve of scores so that so many test takers fail, so many pass, so many get advanced scores, etc. It still judges correct and incorrect by reference to a predetermined standard of how a preconceived “typical” student would respond.
Considering how and why such assessments were created in the first place , the presence of a racial achievement gap should not be surprising at all. That’s the result these tests were originally created to find.
Modern testing comes out of Army IQ tests developed during World War I.
In 1917, a group of psychologists led by Robert M. Yerkes, president of the American Psychological Association (APA), created the Army Alpha and Beta tests . These were specifically designed to measure the intelligence of recruits and help the military distinguish those of “superior mental ability” from those who were “mentally inferior.”
These assessments were based on explicitly eugenicist foundations—the idea that certain races were distinctly superior to others.
In 1923, one of the men who developed these intelligence tests, Carl Brigham, took these ideas further in his seminal work A Study of American Intelligence . In it, he used data gathered from these IQ tests to argue the following:
The decline of American intelligence will be more rapid than the decline of the intelligence of European national groups, owing to the presence here of the negro. These are the plain, if somewhat ugly, facts that our study shows. The deterioration of American intelligence is not inevitable, however, if public action can be aroused to prevent it.
Thus, Yerkes and Brigham’s pseudoscientific tests were used to justify Jim Crow laws, segregation, and even lynchings . Anything for “racial purity.”
People took this research very seriously . States passed forced sterilization laws for people with “defective” traits, preventing between 60,000 and 70,000 people from “polluting” America’s ruling class.
The practice was even upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1927 Buck v. Bell decision. Justices decided that mandatory sterilization of “feeble-minded” individuals was, in fact, constitutional.
Of the ruling, which has never been explicitly overturned, Justice Oliver Wendell Quote: : “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. ...Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”
Eventually Brigham took his experience with Army IQ tests to create a new assessment for the College Board —the Scholastic Aptitude Test—now known as the Scholastic Assessment Test or SAT . It was first given to high school students in 1926 as a gatekeeper. Just as the Army intelligence tests were designed to distinguish the superior from the inferior, the SAT was designed to predict which students would do well in college and which would not. It was meant to show which students should be given the chance at a higher education and which should be left behind.
And unsurprisingly it has always—and continues to—privilege white students over children of color.
The SAT remains a tool for ensuring white supremacy that is essentially partial and unfair—just as its designers always meant it to be.
Moreover, it is the model by which all other high stakes standardized tests are designed.
But Brigham was not alone in smuggling eugenicist ideals into the education field . These ideas dominated pedagogy and psychology for generations until after World War II when their similarity to the Nazi philosophy we had just defeated in Europe dimmed their exponents’ enthusiasm.
Another major eugenicist who made a lasting impact on education was Lewis Terman , Professor of Education at Stanford University and originator of the Stanford-Binet intelligence test. In his highly influential 1916 textbook, The Measurement of Intelligence Quote: :
Among laboring men and servant girls there are thousands like them [feebleminded individuals]. They are the world’s “hewers of wood and drawers of water.” And yet, as far as intelligence is concerned, the tests have told the truth. …No amount of school instruction will ever make them intelligent voters or capable voters in the true sense of the word.
...The fact that one meets this type with such frequency among Indians, Mexicans, and negroes suggests quite forcibly that the whole question of racial differences in mental traits will have to be taken up anew and by experimental methods.
Children of this group should be segregated in special classes and be given instruction which is concrete and practical. They cannot master, but they can often be made efficient workers, able to look out for themselves. There is no possibility at present of convincing society that they should not be allowed to reproduce, although from a eugenic point of view they constitute a grave problem because of their unusually prolific breeding (91-92).
This was the original justification for academic tracking . Terman and other educational psychologists convinced many schools to use high-stakes and culturally-biased tests to place “slow” students into special classes or separate schools while placing more advanced students of European ancestry into the college preparatory courses.
The modern wave of high stakes testing has its roots in the Reagan administration—specifically the infamous propaganda hit piece A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Education Reform .
In true disaster capitalism style , it concluded that our economy was at risk because of poor public schools. Therefore, it suggested circumventing the schools and subordinating them to a system of standardized tests, which would be used to determine everything from teacher quality to resource allocation.
It’s a bizarre argument, but it goes something like this: the best way to create and sustain a fair educational system is by rewarding “high-achieving” students.
So we shouldn’t provide kids with what they need to succeed. We should make school a competition where the strongest get the most and everyone else gets a lesser share.
And the gatekeeper in this instance (as it was in access to higher education) is high stakes testing. The greater the test score, the more funding your school receives, the lower class sizes, the wider curriculum, more tutors, more experienced and well compensated teachers, etc.
It’s a socially stratified education system completely supported by a pseudoscientific series of assessments.
After all, what is a standardized test but an assessment that refers to a specific standard? And that standard is white, upper class students.
In his book How the SAT Creates Built-in-Headwinds , national admissions-test expert, Jay Rosner, explains the process by-which SAT designers decide which questions to include on the test:
Compare two 1998 SAT verbal [section] sentence-completion items with similar themes: The item correctly answered by more blacks than whites was discarded by [the Educational Testing Service] (ETS), whereas the item that has a higher disparate impact against blacks became part of the actual SAT. On one of the items, which was of medium difficulty, 62 percent of whites and 38 percent of African Americans answered correctly, resulting in a large impact of 24 percent... On this second item, 8 percent more African Americans than whites answered correctly.
In other words, the criteria for whether a question is chosen for future tests is if it replicates the outcomes of previous exams—specifically tests where students of color score lower than white children. And this is still the criteria test makers use to determine which questions to use on future editions of nearly every assessment in wide use in the U.S.
Some might argue that this isn’t racist because race was not explicitly used to determine which questions would be included. Yet the results are exactly the same as if it were.
Others want to reduce the entire enterprise to one of social class. It’s not students of color that are disadvantaged—it’s students living in poverty. And there is overlap here.
Standardized testing doesn’t show academic success so much as the circumstances that caused that success or failure . Lack of proper nutrition, food insecurity, lack of prenatal care, early childcare, fewer books in the home, exposure to violence—all of these and more combine to result in lower academic outcomes.
But this isn’t an either/or situation. It’s both. Standardized testing has always been about BOTH race and class . They are inextricably entwined.
Which leads to the question of intention.
If these are the results, is there some villain laughing behind the curtain and twirling the ends of a handlebar mustache?
Answer: it doesn’t matter.
As in the entire edifice of white supremacy, intention is beside the point . These are the results. This is what a policy of high stakes standardized testing actually does.
Regardless of intention, we are responsible for the results .
If every time we meet, you punch me in the face, it doesn’t matter if that’s because you hate me or you’re just clumsy. You’re responsible for changing your actions.
And we as a society are responsible for changing our policies.
Nearly a century of standardized testing is enough.
It’s time to stop the bludgeoning.
It’s time to treat all our children fairly.
It’s time to hang up the tests.

UNITED NATIONS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The United Nations and the Zimbabwean government launched another effort to obtain additional $60 million for the humanitarian response to tropical cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe , the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Zimbabwe said in a statement on Friday.
""The government , United Nations , donors and non-governmental organizations convened today to launch a revised Humanitarian Flash Appeal to include response to Cyclone Idai requesting for an additional USD 60 million ,"" the statement said.
The Zimbabwean government initially asked for $234 million to address the emergency needs of 2.2 million people as a result of the cyclone devastation coupled with a drought and ongoing economic challenges. However, the severity of cyclone Idai left 270,000 more people extremely vulnerable, bringing the amount of money needed to address the humanitarian response to $294 million .
Given the Zimbabwe Vulnerable Assessment Committee's recent finding that 5 million people will face food insecurity in 2019 , the new appeal seeks the funds to provide the affected population in the country with emergency food and water .
Cyclone Idai caused landfall in Mozambique in mid-March, bringing torrential rains and ghastly winds, before heading west to neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi . Recent media reports indicate that more than 700 people have died across the three countries as a result of the cyclone, with many more left injured or homeless.

In an interview with a private television channel, the president said the country could not be run as one unit and the 18th amendment was meant to devolve powers for what the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf had also struggled.
However, he called for the capacity building of the provinces as there was ample room for improvement in the governance and reforms, particularly the taxation.
To a question, he said the 18th amendment was not more sacred than the constitution and if the constitution could be amended, then why not the 18th amendment, he questioned.
He said the issue of payables by the center to Sindh government should be debated at Council of Common Interest and the province's reservations should be addressed.
To a question, the president said the country had moved out of extremism and terrorism, so it was now heading towards economic progress .
He said being nuclear power and one of the most beautiful countries in the world and rich with generous people, nothing could deter Pakistan to achieve progress .
He said the direction of the national economy had been set and it would take sometime to accelerate the economic growth. He said the national economy would get a kick start after the upcoming budget and finalization of the terms and conditions with the IMF .
He said, at least verbally, all the political parties were on the same page against corruption . He said it was the masses which bore the brunt of corruption in the past, in form of inflation or taxes.
To a question about the differences between the PTI leaders, he said it was unsuitable as the party's internal matters should have been discussed with the prime minister , not publicly.
He said during next National Assembly session, he would sit in his chamber at Parliament House to meet the parliamentarians from all parties once in a week.
Responding to a question, he said the clerics must teach the people about cleanliness, civic responsibilities, malnutrition and breastfeeding to create a social revolution.
Asked about the president's role and powers, he said he was briefed and updated regularly about the foreign policy, national security and legislation. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

BERLIN (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Russia is ready to continue discussing the reform of the UN Security Council in the light of Germany 's aspirations for permanent membership, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin told journalists on Friday.
The Russian diplomat participated in Russian-German consultations on UN issues at the German Foreign Ministry.
""The question is broader. The question is about Security Council reform,"" Vershinin said, answering a question from a Sputnik correspondent about the position of the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding Germany 's repeated desire to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
According to the deputy prime minister , this issue has been discussed in New York for many years.
""We will continue to discuss it. We believe that we need a decision to come to. This decision should get an overwhelming majority, and better consensus in the General Assembly . Too much responsibility, of course, with each step in improving the Security Council. We cannot lose its effectiveness,"" he said.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters in New York earlier that the question of obtaining permanent membership in the UN Security Council by Germany is very long-term.

London, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Theresa May asked the European Union Friday to delay Britain's departure until June 30 while Brussels suggested that it might be best to postpone the split for up to a year.
EU leaders also reacted sceptically, saying that there had to be a strong justification for any further delay.
The competing visions of how to unwind Britain's 46-year EU membership will be hashed out again at a summit in Brussels on Wednesday.
Strong resistance is likely against May 's plan, which would involve Britain planning for European elections on May 23 but then not actually holding them.
The current Brexit deadline of April 12 has already been pushed back once from March 29 because of the UK parliament 's repeated failure to back the deal May signed with the other 27 EU leaders in December .
May's formal request to EU Council president Donald Tusk said Britain thinks the delay ""should end on June 30 2019 "" -- the same date she asked for and was refused at the last EU summit last month.
""If the parties are able to ratify (the withdrawal agreement by) this date, the government proposes that the period should be terminated earlier,"" May wrote in a letter released by Downing Street.
A senior EU official said that Tusk's own idea for a ""flexible"" 12-month extension ""will be presented to member states today"".
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte -- seen as one of May 's closer European allies -- said the letter ""doesn't answer"" important concerns.
Meanwhile a source in French President Emmanuel Macron's office said it was ""premature"" to consider the request without ""a clear plan"" from May about what she intended to do with the extra time.
France's Europe Affairs Minister Amelia de Montchalin said: ""Another extension requires that the UK puts forward a plan with a clear and credible political backing.
""In the absence of such a plan we would have to acknowledge that the UK chose to leave the EU in a disorderly manner,"" she said.
Amid fears of a possible no-deal departure, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will travel to Dublin on Monday for Brexit talks with Irish leaders, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's office said.

A 23-year-old man was charged Friday for pretending to be missing Illinois boy Timmothy Pitzen.
The claim was quickly disproved through DNA evidence.
Brian Rini, an ex-convict, could get up to eight years in prison after being charged with making false statements to federal authorities, reported CBS News . Advertisement - story continues below
Rini was treated at a center for people with mental health or substance abuse problems in Ohio in 2017, according to court papers.
His DNA was already filed away because he had a criminal record.
Rini had been in prison for a year for burglary and vandalism.
The FBI concluded Rini’s DNA was not a match for Timmothy. Advertisement - story continues below
“It’s not OK to do it because of the harm that it causes, the pain, for the family of that missing child,” U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman said of Rini’s claim that brought back pain and suffering for Timmothy’s family, according to CBS News.
“It’s devastating. It’s like reliving that day all over again,” Timmothy’s aunt Kara Jacobs said.
Rini was jailed in Cincinnati on Tuesday, reported CBS News.
Timmothy was last seen at a water park in Wisconsin, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . Should Brian Rini be sentenced to the maximum eight years?

President Donald Trump has hired attorneys to fight a congressional request for his tax returns, according to a letter made public on Friday.
In a letter to the IRS’s general counsel, William S. Consovoy, of the firm Consovoy McCarthy Park PLLC, argued that Congress “cannot legally request — and the IRS cannot legally divulge” Trump’s tax returns without what he calls a “legitimate legislative purpose.”
On Wednesday, Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, requested Trump’s personal tax returns for the past six years. Advertisement - story continues below
He also requested returns for eight Trump family companies.
On Twitter, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made her feelings on the subject clear. Congress: “We’re going to need a copy of the President’s tax returns from 2013-2018.”
45: “No, I’m ‘under audit.’ ”
Congress: “We didn’t ask you.”
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 3, 2019 Advertisement - story continues below
Neal asserted that the request is not politically motivated.
Instead, he said he wants to conduct oversight of the IRS’s policy regarding audits of sitting presidents and vice presidents.
But Consovoy pushed back against that logic by pointing out that Neal is seeking Trump’s tax returns for several years before he became president.
“It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponents.

Once this Pandora’s box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation,” Consovoy wrote in the letter to Brent J. McIntosh. Advertisement - story continues below
“We are confident that this misguided attempt to politicize the administration of the tax laws will not succeed.”

A California coroner’s jury decided late Thursday that a lesbian couple killed themselves and their six adopted children by driving off a cliff last year.
After a coroner’s inquest, the jury found Thursday that Jennifer and Sarah Hart killed themselves and murdered their entire family on March 26, 2018, when they drove off a cliff in Mendocino County, The Associated Press reported.
Their six adopted children, ages 12 to 19, all died in the crash. Advertisement - story continues below
Authorities opened an investigation into the couple’s alleged mistreatment of their children just days before the fatal crash, sending social workers to the house on March 23, according to NBC News .
The Harts immediately left their home in Woodland, Washington, and drove to northern California, where they died. TRENDING: Ex-SEAL Known for Exposing Stolen Valor Takes on Nathan Phillips –‘Was Refrig Mechanic’
California Highway Patrol investigator Jake Slates said records recovered from Sarah Hart’s phone show deleted searches about suicide, Benadryl and overdose methods, and whether drowning is painful, People reported.
After recovering the family’s bodies, authorities determined that Sarah Hart had toxic levels of Benadryl in her body, according to Mendocino County Sheriff Deputy Robert Julian. Advertisement - story continues below

The children had large amounts of sleep-inducing drugs in their bodies at the time of death, Slates said, according to NBC News.
“They both decided that this was going to be the end,” Slates said. “That if they can’t have their kids that nobody was going to have those kids.” Advertisement - story continues below

The body of 15-year-old adopted son Devonte Hart has not been recovered.
“It is my belief that both Jennifer and Sarah succumbed to a lot of pressure,” sheriff’s Lt. Shannon Barney said Thursday, according to NBC News. “Just a lot of stuff going on in their lives, to the point where they made this conscious decision to end their lives this way and take their children’s lives.” Advertisement - story continues below
The suicide-murder comes after a neighbor filed a complaint alleging that the Harts deprived their adopted children of food as a form of punishment.
Sarah Hart pleaded guilty to spanking one of the children in a 2011 domestic assault charge case.
Child welfare authorities also investigated the couple in 2013 but did not pursue a case against them, according to NBC News.

"Assange Faces Cruel, Degrading Treatment if Turned Over to US - UN Torture Expert",www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/assange-faces-cruel-degrading-treatment-if-t-587221.html,"Assange Faces Cruel, Degrading Treatment If Turned Over To US - UN Torture Expert Muhammad Irfan 20 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 12:00 AM
WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces the prospect of cruel and degrading treatment if he is expelled from Ecuador 's embassy in the United Kingdom and deported to the United States , UN special Rapporteur on torture Nils Melzer warned in a press release on Friday.
""In my assessment, if Mr. Assange were to be expelled from the Embassy of Ecuador , he is likely to be arrested by British authorities and extradited to the United States ,"" Melzer said. ""Such a response could expose him to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights, including his freedom of expression, his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. ""
WikiLeaks earlier quoted a ""high level source"" saying Assange will be expelled from the Ecuadorian embassy within hours or days.
Assange has been in Ecuador 's London embassy since 2012, fearing that he will be arrested and extradited to the US for publishing thousands of military and diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks.
The US Department of Justice Department has secretly filed criminal charges against Assange, according to published reports."
