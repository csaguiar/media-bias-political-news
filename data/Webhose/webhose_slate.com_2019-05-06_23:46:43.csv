"Game of Thrones: Bran actor Isaac Hempstead Wright, Maisie Williams, more answer fake hotline questions on Jimmy Kimmel Live (VIDEO).",slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/game-of-thrones-bran-stark-hotline.html,"That Movie About Charlize Theron Falling for a Schlubby Seth Rogen Is Actually Pretty Feminist Now that the eighth season of Game of Thrones is underway, Jimmy Kimmel Live ’s fake hotline for puzzled fans is more useful than ever. You may recall that thanks to “a small but diabolical clause in their HBO contract,” cast members on the show are manning the phones to answer questions. This time those questions range from what Kit Harington smells like to why Gandalf chose Bilbo Baggins to accompany Thorin. (Some of the callers may be a tad confused.) Isaac Hempstead Wright gets into character as Bran Stark to help one fan locate her keys—and tell her how she’s going to die. Kudos to the set designer who included little Easter eggs for each actor’s cubicle; Bran’s includes the prominently placed “Raven Bran” cereal but also a framed photo of Hodor . If only that attention to detail extended to the fake phone number, which plays a generic automated message. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Robert Mueller must testify to Congress next.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/mueller-must-testify-to-explain-william-barr-dispute.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore Attorney General William Barr’s obfuscating, querulous, and disingenuous congressional testimony on Wednesday was the kind of performance we’ve come to expect from him. Barr criticized special counsel Robert Mueller for declining to issue a definitive conclusion on whether President Donald Trump committed obstruction. He waved away sections in Mueller’s report that clearly describe Trump’s obstructive acts . And he implied that Mueller’s letter to Barr , in which the special counsel questioned the attorney general’s summary of his report , meant something entirely different from what it actually says. As usual, Barr seemed to view his job on Wednesday as shaping a narrative that is maximally beneficial to both himself and the president. To do so, he once again threw Mueller under the bus. This strategy has been effective so far because of Mueller’s reticence to issue any public comment beyond his report. But if Barr’s testimony proved anything, it is that Congress must ask Mueller to testify—immediately. Early in his testimony, Barr declared that he was “surprised” when he learned that the special counsel was “not going to reach a decision on obstruction.” He claimed that he is “not really sure” why the special counsel did not reach a conclusion, and that Mueller “shouldn’t have investigated” potential obstructive acts if he felt he couldn’t render a prosecutorial decision. But contrary to Barr’s assertion, it is actually no mystery at all why Mueller did not declare if Trump committed obstruction. The special counsel laid out his reasoning in his final report . He explained that he accepted the Office of Legal Counsel’s “legal conclusion” that a sitting president cannot be indicted, which curtailed his ability to exercise traditional “prosecutorial discretion.” Moreover, he recognized that, “apart from” OLC’s view, a “federal criminal accusation” would both burden the president’s “capacity to govern” and “preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.” Put simply: Mueller thought it would be futile to accuse Trump of obstruction if he can’t be indicted, so the special counsel instead laid out the facts and left Congress to decide whether “constitutional processes”—that is, impeachment—are appropriate. Mueller could explain why he did not explicitly accuse Trump of unlawful obstruction, thereby refuting Barr’s dishonest narrative. Whatever Barr thinks of this reasoning, it is laid out clearly in Mueller’s report. Yet Barr purports to remain bewildered that the special counsel did not formally accuse Trump of obstruction and indeed uses that puzzlement to bolster his claims that Trump did not obstruct. “We don’t conduct criminal investigations to collect information and put it out to the public,” Barr said. “We do it to gain information.” Thus, in Barr’s telling, the attorney general simply had no choice but to announce “that the evidence developed during the special counsel’s investigation was not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.” No careful reader could reasonably interpret Mueller’s report as an invitation to the attorney general to make “a binary decision” (Barr’s words) about whether Trump obstructed justice. Mueller plainly left this matter to Congress—where Democrats have been hampered in their efforts to hold Trump accountable by Barr’s pseudo-exoneration. This muddle is one reason why the special counsel needs to testify: He, and he alone, could explain why he did not explicitly accuse Trump of unlawful obstruction, thereby refuting Barr’s dishonest narrative. Mueller’s testimony would also allow the public to better grasp how he and his team understood the evidence in the report. This clarification has become necessary, because after warping Mueller’s own words, Barr decided to act as Trump’s defense attorney to downplay one of the most damning episodes in the special counsel’s report: the series of encounters between Trump and then–White House counsel Don McGahn. Mueller explains that the president ordered McGahn to fire Mueller, citing the special counsel’s alleged conflicts of interest as pretext for his termination. In Mueller’s analysis, there was “substantial evidence” to establish that this incident constituted a criminal act of obstruction. In Barr’s telling, however, it was all one big misunderstanding. “There’s no question,” Barr said, “that whatever instruction was given [to] McGahn had to do with Mueller’s conflict of interest.” And Trump “later said that what he meant was that the conflict of interest should be raised with [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein] but the decision should be left with Rosenstein.” The gist of Barr’s spin is that, yes, McGahn interpreted Trump’s words as an order, but who can know for sure? “There is a distinction,” Barr said, “between saying to someone, ‘Go fire him,’ … and saying, have him removed based on conflict.” Here’s what the Mueller report actually says: The president “called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed.” Trump allegedly told McGahn, “You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.” Mueller, he said, “can’t be the special counsel.” He “had to go.” And Trump added, “Call me back when you do it.” McGahn refused, and Trump later told him to lie about his demand that Mueller be terminated. Yet to Barr, none of this evidence is sufficient to “show corrupt intent beyond a reasonable doubt.” This conclusion relies on a questionable semantic distinction to absolve Trump and contradict Mueller’s findings. Which is why the special counsel deserves an opportunity to rebut Barr’s dubious interpretation of his report. Finally, there is the matter of the letter Mueller sent to Barr on March 27 after the attorney general released his hugely misleading summary of the special counsel’s report. (The existence of this letter only became public knowledge on Tuesday night.) Here is how Mueller characterized his concerns in the letter he wrote to Barr:
The summary letter … did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. … There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure the full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations. And here is how Barr characterized a follow-up conversation about the letter:
I asked him if he was suggesting that the [summary] was inaccurate and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate, and that the press was reading too much into it. I asked him specifically what his concern was and he said that his concern focused on his explanation as to why he did not reach a conclusion on obstruction. And he wanted more put out on that issue. … But he was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report. There is an unavoidable conflict between Mueller’s letter and Barr’s testimony. Mueller stated that Barr’s summary “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of his report. Barr testified that Mueller’s only gripe was that “the press reporting had been inaccurate.” These claims cannot be squared. Someone is lying. Right now, Barr appears to assume that Congress, and the public, will only hear his side of the story—a reasonable assumption given Mueller’s public taciturnity throughout his investigation. But it is now obvious that a rift has opened between the two men, and that Mueller is frustrated with Barr’s handling of his report and has been for a while. The attorney general doesn’t seem to care. “It was my baby,” Barr said of the full report on Wednesday. “It was my decision how and when to make it public, not Bob Mueller’s.” That may be correct. But there is no reason why Mueller cannot go before Congress to set the record straight and no reason for the rest of us to trust Barr’s characterizations until he does. The attorney general has so distorted the public perception of Mueller’s report that the special counsel’s silence now threatens to undermine the impact of his findings. Barr has somehow managed to depict Mueller as simultaneously indecisive and overzealous—too quick to condemn Trump, yet dithering in his duty to render a judgment. Meanwhile, Barr has exploited Mueller’s silence to recast the special counsel’s dissatisfaction with the attorney general as irritation with the media. This fantastical narrative should not go unrebutted. And only Mueller has the knowledge and authority to tell Congress just how far Barr has wandered from the truth. Support our journalism

Why the Russians might use a beluga whale as a spy.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/beluga-whale-spy-marine-life-russia-navy-dolphins.html,"What Do We Do First if We Spot an Asteroid Hurtling Toward Earth? Last week, a beluga whale approached a fishing boat off the coast of Norway. The fishermen, surprised to encounter such a sociable whale, then noticed it was wearing a harness. Once they removed it, they noticed a label on the inside: “Equipment of St. Petersburg.” The Norwegians then contacted Russian researchers, who said their whales don’t wear harnesses. Plus, belugas are social animals that typically travel in small groups, so this lone whale seemed suspicious. Experts surmised the fishermen’s new smiley friend might actually be a Russian spy. In all fairness to the beluga, let’s be clear that it’s an alleged spy. There’s no conclusive evidence yet about where it’s from or what it was up to. After all, it does seem like the antithesis of sneaky to outfit your spy with a harness that’s directly traceable back to its origin. “If we were using this animal for spying do you really think we’d attach a mobile phone number with the message ‘please call this number’?” Russian Col. Viktor Baranets reportedly told a broadcaster. Plus, wouldn’t you think that the second most powerful military in the world would have more advanced technology than a friendly looking whale seeking nose pats and fish from strangers? On that point, at least, the answer is: not necessarily. Certainly, Russia’s military, as well as those of many other nations, has been developing water drones, or, as the U.S. Navy prefers to call them, “unmanned undersea vehicles.” (The word drone has “ a negative connotation ,” says the Navy .) These UUVs can do jobs deemed too dangerous or tedious for crewed watercraft, like mapping the seabed and coast, keeping tabs on harbors and ports, collecting items from the seabed, and counteracting mines. Russia is rumored to be working on nuclear torpedo drones , a terrifying prospect, and China has developed a fleet of drones to be used during sea battles. Spy whales predate all that, and while they may not be what comes to mind as “military technology,” they may be superior to fancy, expensive new machinery when it comes to surveillance and minesweeping. Since the 1960s , both the Russian and U.S. militaries have been training marine mammals to do their bidding. Despite news reports in 2012 that the U.S. was planning to phase out its marine animal program by 2017 in favor of UUVs, the U.S. Navy still maintains its fleet of bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions. Also in 2012, Ukraine rebooted its dolphin training program, which Russia inherited after it annexed Crimea in 2014. As recently as 2016, Russia was in the market for new recruits , offering $24,000 to any dealer who could provide them with five bottlenose dolphins. Though belugas are not as common as dolphins in military marine animal programs, it would be smart to have a few in your arsenal. They operate in colder temperatures and deeper depths , perfect for, say, the waters off the coast of Norway. Doug Cartlidge, former adviser to Russia on dolphin care, told Wired in 2007 that the Russians were training dolphins to attach mines to enemy ships and to prod enemies with a needle attached to a pressurized carbon dioxide tank, which would functionally kill whomever the dolphins touched. The U.S. Navy, on the other hand, claims its dolphins have never been used to kill. These days, marine animals appear to be trained for many of the same recon, fetch, and surveillance duties as UUVs would perform. A beluga’s unassuming adorableness makes it a capable spy simply because no one would suspect it. At this point, in the U.S. Navy, UUVs are frequently used for minesweeping, says Ed Budzyna, the Navy Marine Mammal Program’s spokesman. Dolphins are “not the first to be called” these days for that kind of job. But there are many good reasons to use marine animals over UUVs for tasks that both are capable of. First off, animals don’t need to be recharged. While many current UUVs have a battery life of about 24 hours, belugas “could operate nearly indefinitely,” says Bryan Clark, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a retired submariner. “You could take a sensor you might put on a UUV, like a sonar system, and the whale could swim out for days at a time.” Assuming the whale is trained to resurface periodically, its trainers could pull the data it collects, outfit it with a new sensor, and send it on another mission immediately. That could be what this beluga was doing. According to the BBC , marine biologist Audun Rikardsen said the harness had a GoPro camera holder attached to it. (It seems strange for the Russian military to be using GoPros for reconnaissance, but whoever outfitted the beluga in that harness appears to have wanted footage from its adventures.) There also may be missions that animals are still better at than UUVs. Sea lions are very good at hearing and seeing underwater. “The water can be cloudy or muddy, but it’s still no trouble for a sea lion,” says Budzyna, while “robotics would have a hard time with pier pilings and murky waters.” Depending on their mission, belugas could also be cheaper to train and manage than UUVs. The Navy says that its cost analyses have found that the MK 5 QuickFind Marine Mammal program, which uses sea lions, “is much less expensive to employ than either remotely operated vehicles or human divers for depths from 100–1000 feet.” Granted, it’s still not cheap. It costs money to transport animals for special missions, since they must travel with custom enclosures and a full veterinary staff. The Atlantic Wire reported in 2014 that the cost of the military’s mine-hunting dolphin program is about $ 14 million ; Hakai reported earlier this year that dolphin upkeep between 2012 and 2019 cost around $75 million , averaging out to just under $11 million a year. A “cheap” UUV is in the neighborhood of $50,000 , and after factoring in costs of maintenance and training staff to use it, it may actually be more cost effective to use military animals, says Clark. Also, look at that face. A beluga’s unassuming adorableness makes it a capable spy simply because no one would suspect it (unless it had a super-suspicious label on its harness, of course). The military has relied on this tactic before, using reconnaissance pigeons to drop off recording devices, take photos, or train to identify individual faces, like Osama bin Laden’s because people generally don’t think of animals as spies. On the CIA’s page about the history of pigeon surveillance, it acknowledges the advantage conferred by pigeons’ mundanity: “Being a common species, the pigeon concealed its role as an intelligence collection platform among the activities of thousands of other birds.” Belugas in the sea could also fly under the radar, so to speak, just as birds do in the sky. “If you’re the target, you might think, ‘It’s just a whale swimming around,’ and not be worried about what it’s doing,” says Clark. “You wouldn’t necessarily think it’s a surveillance system.” Another advantage of belugas spying in their home territory is that unlike UUVs or other water craft, belugas aren’t mechanical and may be less likely to pose a disturbance to other marine life. Meanwhile, the beluga at least seems to be having fun in Norway, fetching rings for locals . If it is indeed a spy, it certainly won’t be the last marine mammal to turn up in search of food or attention from humans, but let’s hope this one gets to retire to a nice marine sanctuary in peace.

Barr refuses to testify before House Judiciary Committee about Mueller report.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-refuses-testify-nadler-house-judiciary-committee-mueller-report-contempt-obstruction.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore After a day of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Bill Barr intends to skip a second day of scheduled testimony Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee. Barr is backing out of the hearing because of a plan by the Democrat-chaired committee to allow staff lawyers from both parties to question the attorney general. Both Barr and House Republicans objected to the proposed format, which, in addition to the usual five-minute rounds of questioning from representatives, would have included a 30-minute round for staff attorneys to follow up on the representatives’ questions.* The thinking went: specialized lawyers could do a better job than members of Congress pinning down some of the facts. The Republican thinking went: Yuck, that sounds a lot like a courtroom. The Department of Justice protested that having staff question the attorney general was “unprecedented and unnecessary.” As W. Neil Eggleston wrote in Slate this week, that is very much not the case. Barr’s refusal to appear injects a new source of acrimony between the Trump administration and the Democrat-led Congress that has been aggressive in using its new majority power to pick up on lines of investigation that were buried on the GOP’s watch. The White House has pushed back hard and filed suit to prevent current and former members of the administration from complying with subpoenas to appear under oath before Democrat-led committees. The standoff between House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Barr had been brewing over the last week. Nadler told CNN Sunday morning that if Barr refuses to show, “then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena.” Adding to the standoff is the fact that the Judiciary Committee deadline for Barr to produce an unredacted version of the Mueller report to Congress was 10 a.m. Wednesday. That was likely to, ahem, come up in the House hearing the following day. There now is an increasing likelihood that Barr will not only refuse to testify but will not give members of congress full access to the unredacted Mueller report. That raises the possibility that Democrats could hold Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate. “Democrats have discussed holding Barr in contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena and threatening to skip the scheduled hearing, according to several lawmakers and officials familiar with the plan,” the Washington Post reports . “During a pair of closed-door meetings Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, the committee decided that it would probably make a push for a Barr contempt citation if he refuses to testify Thursday or ignores their subpoena for the full, unredacted report by Mueller.” “We are now seeing the attorney general engage in obstruction of a congressional subpoena,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the committee, said Wednesday “Congress has a number of tools at its disposal, obviously beginning with holding him in contempt.”
Correction, May 1, 2019: This post originally misstated that senators would question Barr. Representatives do the questioning during House hearings."
William Barr Senate hearing: Republicans discrediting the Mueller investigation ignore the 34 indictments.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-hearing-mueller-investigation-indictments.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore When Attorney General William Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to testify about special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, Republican Sen. Mike Hawley characterized it as an attempt to “overturn the results of a democratic election.” Sen. Lindsey Graham said, “When the Mueller report is put to bed, and it soon will be, this committee is going to look long and hard on how this all started.” And Sen. Mike Lee’s line of questioning suggested that he believes the foundations of the investigation were too flimsy and motivated by political bias. In their attempts to discredit the investigation, those characterizations essentially ignored what the special counsel has already accomplished: uncovering an assortment of crimes committed by dozens of people, including Trump campaign advisers. In case Republicans on the committee—or anyone else—need to be reminded, here’s a rundown of the indictments against 34 people and three companies achieved by the special counsel, many of which have led to guilty pleas: Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chair Manafort faced 25 counts from Mueller’s team related primarily to his lobbying efforts in Ukraine and financial wrongdoing. A jury in the Eastern District of Virginia found Manafort guilty of eight counts related to the financial crimes, and he additionally pled guilty to conspiracy against the U.S. and witness tampering in the District of Columbia. He was sentenced to a total of seven-and-a-half years of incarceration. Rick Gates, former Trump campaign aide Gates was one of campaign chair Paul Manafort’s closest associates and confidants, so their indictments were intimately linked. Gates pleaded guilty in February 2018 to felony counts of conspiracy against the U.S. and lying to federal authorities in connection with work he and Manafort completed for a pro-Russia faction in Ukraine. By agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel, Gates was able to avoid a host of other charges having to do with foreign financial dealings. Konstantin Kilimnik, former Russian military interpreter Mueller’s office indicted Kilimnik for conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice in June . Kilimnik worked with Manafort on lobbying efforts in Ukraine and, according to the indictment, attempted to sway two journalists who were potential witnesses. Kilimnik does not currently reside in the U.S., so he may never be prosecuted. Alex van der Zwann, lawyer Van der Zwaan, a Dutch national, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to charges of lying to federal agents about his interactions with Gates and Kilimnik. Van der Zwaan had been involved in Gates’ and Manafort’s lobbying efforts in Ukraine and later admitted to lying about that work and deleting related emails. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison. Michael Flynn, former White House national security adviser Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump was inaugurated, and lying to the feds about his lobbying efforts on behalf of Turkey. Roger Stone, former Trump campaign adviser Mueller’s office unveiled charges against Stone in January on seven counts of obstruction of justice, lying, and witness tampering. The investigation also found that Stone had been seeking out stolen emails from WikiLeaks that could damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The indictment alleged that Stone lied to Congress about his communications with the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks and his knowledge of the organization’s plans to release the hacked material.Stone is also accused of influencing one of his associates to use Fifth Amendment protections to avoid answering questions from the House Judiciary Committee. Stone’s trial is scheduled for November. George Papadopoulos, former foreign policy campaign adviser Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days of incarceration in September after pleading guilty to charges of lying to the FBI about his interactions with foreign nationals with ties to the Russian government. Papadopoulos had allegedly tried several times to set up meetings between Russian officials and Trump campaign staffers over the course of the election but was ultimately unsuccessful. Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to charges of lying to Congress about the canceled Trump Tower project in Moscow, particularly concerning the length of the endeavor and Trump’s knowledge of the business discussions. And as a result of an investigation that Mueller referred to the Southern District of New York, Cohen also pleaded guilty in August to eight counts of campaign finance violations related to hush money agreements with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Cohen was ultimately sentenced to three years of incarceration. 12 Russian GRU agents Mueller’s office charged members of the GRU, the Russian intelligence agency, in July on 11 counts related to the hacking of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic National Committee. 13 Russian nationals and three companies In February, 2018, a group of Russian nationals and three associated companies were charged for a sprawling election interference scheme that involved sowing discord and promoting distrust of American democracy on social media. The internet trolls assumed fake personas, spread disinformation, and attempted to boost Trump’s candidacy. It is unlikely that the any of these individuals will be extradited from Russia to face trial. Richard Pinedo, fake ID vendor Pinedo, a California man, was sentenced to six months in prison and six months of home detention in October for selling fake online identities that 13 Russian operatives would eventually use to set up PayPal accounts for their efforts to sow discord on social media during the 2016 election.

Google employees are protesting to remain the company’s watchdog,slate.com,April Glaser,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/google-employees-are-protesting-to-remain-the-companys-watchdog.html,"Facebook Just Hired the Co-Author of the Patriot Act and An Advocate Who Helped Fight It When Alphabet employees decided to stage protests in their offices this week, there was one big difference from the last time workers at the internet giant held a demonstration: They were now hesitant to use Google products for any planning. Just over a week earlier, two of their colleagues alleged that the company had retaliated after they’d organized a massive walkout back in November. So instead of using the most convenient online communication tools in the world, they opted for encrypted text apps to keep their plans out of the potential sight of their employer. In less than 24 hours, they planned a Wednesday “sit-in” in which more than 1,000 Googlers across 15 U.S. offices reminded the company that it still has to answer to its own workforce. Activism within Alphabet reached a dramatic peak last November when 20,000 employees across 50 offices worldwide walked out of work to protest how Google’s parent company deals with accusations of harassment and discrimination. But demonstrations within the company over how it does business, and with whom, have been going on for a couple years now. Last June, Alphabet decided to stop building artificial intelligence services for a Pentagon drone program after thousands of employees signed a petition demanding the company end the contract. And it was only last August that about 1,000 employees signed an internal petition calling on Google to scrap Project Dragonfly, its plan to build a censored search engine in China, which the company had to address. None of these impacts would have happened without employee organizing, and the current push within Alphabet to protect workers’ ability to dissent appears to be underlined by a realization that if anyone is going to meaningfully regulate one of the most powerful companies in the world, it’s going to be the talent that helps make it so powerful. Wednesday’s action comes a little over a week after two employees who were core organizers of the November walkout, Meredith Whittaker and Claire Stapleton, shared on an internal Google email list examples of alleged retaliation they had faced in the months that followed. The walkout, which was held to protest how the company had dealt with serious accusations of sexual assault and harassment and what many employees described as a culture of impunity for executives, led to immediate reforms inside Alphabet. Within days, the company agreed to end forced arbitration in cases involving accusations of sexual harassment or assault, a policy that prevented employees from taking their grievances to court. Workers continued to organize, and in February, Google eliminated its forced arbitration policy for employees entirely. But organizers still felt a sting. Stapleton, a 12-year veteran at Google, shared that she was informed she would be demoted and lose half of the people who report to her. “I was told to go on medical leave, even though I’m not sick,” Stapleton wrote in an email to an internal list describing the retaliation she experienced. It was only after she hired a lawyer that Google investigated and decided to walk back its decision to demote her. Whittaker, who leads Google’s Open Research Group and is the co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University, received notice that in order to stay at Google, she’d have to “abandon [her] work on AI ethics and the AI Now Institute,” according an email she sent internally. (Google disputes the employees’ allegations of retaliation.) Instead of leaving the office in unison on Wednesday, workers at Google used a variety of tactics. Some called in sick, a reference to Stapleton’s directive to take medical leave. Others set up an email auto-response to detail their grievances over how the company has treated the walkout organizers. In cities like New York, Pittsburgh, Cambridge, and Mountain View, California, workers gathered to read accounts shared by employees across the company alleging experiences of retaliation for speaking out against sexual harassment, bigoted comments from management, and discrimination in pay and promotions at Google. If employees are afraid to speak out when they’re mistreated, speaking out about the ethics of Google’s work will be even harder. Whistleblowing within technology companies is one of the few levers that can hold these conglomerates accountable. Users can complain, but companies don’t have to respond. Lawmakers could regulate and force corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon to be more transparent and responsible, but that’s probably not happening in the U.S. anytime soon. Tech companies, after all, work hard to stay unaccountable by spending big and hiring former government officials to get their way. Just last month, Facebook brought on the co-author of the Patriot Act as its general counsel. Last year, it was reported that Google outspent every other company in the country in its effort to lobby U.S. lawmakers, and in the first quarter of this year, Amazon outspent both Facebook and Google in its bid to influence Washington. Even when European regulators have cracked down on tech companies’ overreach, as they have over the past three years by issuing fines to Alphabet that add up to about $9 billion, it doesn’t amount to much more than a few speeding tickets for a company that had $137 billion in revenue in 2018 alone. Google and its peers are enormous enough that most of us depend on them to handle key functions of our daily life. In part it’s because their products are so useful. Google tells us where to go and how to get there. Facebook helps us maintain connections within our communities. We depend on software from tech companies to guide how we work, relax, and learn. Technology companies, like Google, deliver the information that we need to participate meaningfully in democracy. But these companies have also become so big that they face few checks on their behavior. That has put workers in an important position. Alphabet might not like that its employees are forcing it to be better. But as a user of Google products, I’m grateful. When it comes to keeping one of the most powerful corporations in the world in line, whistleblowers are often all we’ve got. And the scary part is that Google’s tech is so embedded in our lives—Gmail, Chrome, Search, Docs, Maps, Android—that when there’s something we don’t like about Google, there’s often nowhere else to go. Employee organizing has important changes so far. Hopefully, for the sake of everyone who depends on Google products, it will again."
Former CIA agent pleads guilty to spying for China.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/former-cia-agent-lee-pleads-guilty-spying-for-china.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore A former Central Intelligence Agency officer pleaded guilty Wednesday to spying for China, the latest in a series of high-profile espionage cases involving American intelligence officers working for Chinese intelligence. Jerry Chun Shing Lee submitted his plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors, which will likely means prosecutors will seek a sentence of 17 to 27 years for the 54-year-old, rather than life. Lee worked for the CIA from 1994 until he resigned in 2007. A naturalized citizen who was born in Hong Kong, Lee returned to Hong Kong after leaving the CIA, where he started a business importing cigarettes with a former police officer who has ties to the Hong Kong intelligence world. Lee’s business partner connected him to Chinese intelligence operatives. After meeting with Chinese intelligence in mainland China, Lee made undisclosed cash deposits totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars into his Hong Kong bank account over the course of three years. It was around this time, in 2010, that “the C.I.A.’s informant network in China collapsed,” the New York Times notes . “Intelligence officials have been divided over how the network crumbled. While some believed that the Chinese had hacked the covert system the C.I.A. used to communicate with its foreign sources, others believed that Mr. Lee had given the Chinese at least some of the names.” Lee denied ever actually passing along information to the Chinese; the FBI uncovered two small notebooks that “contained true names and phone numbers of assets and covert CIA employees, as well as the addresses of CIA facilities” all related to China, according to the indictment ."

TBS Since last week’s episode of Game of Thrones aired, audiences have been complaining about how dark and difficult to see it was, thanks to a deadly combination of low-light cinematography, bad video compression, and uncalibrated television sets . As critic Alan Zilberman noted, there was a lot more visual information buried in the footage than most viewers could see: This is a brightened image from Sunday's Game of Thrones. I'll never understand why Benioff, Weiss, and Sapochnik insist on keeping it so dark pic.twitter.com/9fUXSSOrZu — Alan Zilberman (@alanzilberman) April 30, 2019 Fans have been cranking the brightness on the episode’s darkest shots to find out what the hell is happening in them—there’s a slowed-down, brightened-up version of the mid-air dragon fight where you can kind of tell who’s clawing at whom—but even the richest Redditor doesn’t have access to the kind of state-of-the-art television production resources that are at the disposal of a talk show host like Conan O’Brien. So O’Brien had his staff do it right, producing a version of “The Long Night” that looks good on every television.

Billboard Music Awards: Watch Drake’s shoutout to Arya Stark.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/billboard-music-awards-bbmas-drake-arya-stark-game-thrones.html,"Apparently they’ve worked closely together since his stint on Degrassi High. Kevin Winter/Getty Images for dcp The Billboard Music Awards were held Wednesday night in Las Vegas, and for once, the Faceless Men of Braavos got their due. The famed order of assassins from Game of Thrones has been an important player in the music industry since 1910, when Billy Murray hired them to bake Blanche Ring into a pie as part of a complicated and bloody scheme to secure the wax cylinder rights for “ Come Josephine in my Flying Machine ,” but usually their machinations are kept behind-the-scenes. Tonight, however, on his way to a record-breaking 12 Billboard Music Award wins in a single night, Drake publicly acknowledged the people whose untraceable poisons and pointy daggers have made his success possible. Watch him give a shout out to Faceless Man alum Arya Stark for “putting in that work last week.” We’ll never know exactly what work Drake was referring to, but to win his Billboard Music Awards, he had to beat out Cardi B, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, Juice WRLD, Maroon 5, Post Malone, Travis Scott, and XXXTentacion. This would be a good time to look into any suspicious deaths from members of their production or publicity teams over the past year or so, with special attention paid to people who appear to have died accidentally after choking on their wine at a wedding. In the meantime, Drake’s public acknowledgement of Arya Stark will undoubtedly kick off yet another feud for the outspoken rapper, this time with Arya’s nemesis the Night King, who once again failed to take home even one Billboard Music Award. Industry observers expect him to respond by raising an unstoppable army of undead warriors to destroy all memory of humanity forever, or possibly by recording some sort of diss track.

"Tuca & Bertie, reviewed.",slate.com,Inkoo Kang,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/tuca-and-bertie-review-tiffany-haddish-ali-wong-lisa-hanawalt-netflix.html,"What’s It Like to Almost Beat Jeopardy ’s Game-Changing Champion? The first sight that greets viewers of Tuca & Bertie , the new Netflix show by illustrator and BoJack Horseman production designer Lisa Hanawalt, is bouncing blue boobs protruding from the side of a building. Boobs definitely seems like the right word for them; these leaping, nippled mounds seem both matter-of-fact and ebullient, their carefree springiness amplifying a dancing edifice’s bodily bliss. On Tuca & Bertie , breasts hang off structures, mushroom caps replace heads, smitten characters’ bones flee their bodies when their crush talks to them, and, well, I’ll save the sex stuff for you to discover yourself. Our protagonists, voiced by Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong, have avian heads and human bodies, an Etsy-friendly aesthetic familiar to BoJack fans. But whereas BoJack ’s chimeras underscore the absurdity of Hollywood excess, on Tuca & Bertie , with its more intimate focus on friendships, relationships, daily female struggles, and, later in the season, unresolved trauma, the mix-and-match look unexpectedly speaks to the universality of the characters’ experiences. Anyone can see themselves in the plight of a bird that feels like it’s forgotten how to fly. Especially in its early episodes, Tuca & Bertie feels like the manic lovechild of BoJack and Broad City , another oft-surreal series about female besties caught up in an occasionally unhealthy codependence. At the series’ outset, Tuca (Haddish) has just moved out of the apartment the two of them shared for years to make room for Bertie’s (Wong) stability-craving boyfriend, Speckles (Steven Yeun). Gabby and brash, Tuca’s a toucan who lives off the generosity of a wealthy aunt (Jenifer Lewis). Sweater-swaddled Bertie’s a demure songbird, as well as a data processor at Condé Nest (among other things, Hanawalt is responsible for BoJack ’s pun-riddled background gags, a penchant she indulges here as well). It takes a few installments to adjust to the show’s frenetic pace and frequent digressions; initially, I took a mini-break at the two-thirds point of each episode. But around the fifth half-hour, Tuca & Bertie and I met in the middle, as the series slowed down to tackle darker subjects like sobriety and sexual harassment. Needless to say, this is a cartoon for grown-ups—not just because of the boobs, but because of the extraordinary sensitivity with which it deals with issues like office humiliations and existential anxieties and complicated relationships. (I knew we were watching adult-ass bird-women when Bertie’s croissants earned her a job offer with a celebrity chef, but she didn’t quit her job immediately to go pursue her dream, because not everybody gets to do that.) By deciding to live apart, 30-year-old Tuca and Bertie have entered a new phase of their lives. Tuca starts to fear that, as she gets older, her fuck-it-all ways are starting to be less “quirky” and more “sad.” Bertie worries that settling down with Speckles means settling for him and that her control-freak personality might drive away both her boyfriend and her best friend. This is wildly familiar territory, of course, but even the most stock situations are told in Hanawalt’s visual larks and heartfelt compassion for her characters. When a coarse co-worker gives Bertie a nasty comment, her fed-up left boob (voiced by Awkwafina, natch) jumps from her sweater to stalk off and go get a drink. And we’re back to the breasts. It’s safe to say Tuca & Bertie has a boob fixation—specifically, with reclaiming them for women. It’s hard not to think of Jessica Rabbit and all the countless other ways the female body has been distorted in animation for the straight male gaze as Hanawalt normalizes the presence of boobs and nipples—like when a pre-date trying-on-outfits montage displays, with not a hint of titillation, a female character’s bare chest—while celebrating their capacity for delight. Lived-in-ness is one of the hardest qualities to convey in cartoon form, which is why the bikini tan lines on Tuca and Bertie’s plant-lady neighbor (plant head, human body, medical-school education) is such a splendid detail. Hanawalt even takes back the three-boob gag from the likes of Total Recall and Mallrats . Along with the penultimate episode, which is as harrowing and heartbreaking as anything on BoJack —a stratospherically high bar—its free-the-nipple ethos feels uncommonly healing. It’s a smart use of Netflix’s streaming liberties and an ambitious mainstreaming of feminist art. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Haddish embodies an archetype we’ve seen her as several times now (as well as a character whose tragic history is not dissimilar to the actress’s early years), but Tuca & Bertie allows her to fill in those outlines in fascinating new ways. Wong’s comedic persona is of a wild child too (if a reformed one), which makes the dramatic shadings of her performance a revelation. As on BoJack , the supporting voice cast is full of marvelous surprises, which I won’t spoil further, but it’s arguably the hand-drawn-style animation, with bright, saturated colors, that’s the real star. The characters are so expressive they can convey conflicted horniness, and the city of Bird Town playfully defies all known laws of physics and common sense. In Hanawalt’s hands, you’ll feel wonderfully unbalanced, then tenderly comforted."
Rabbit Holes: Why Exploring the Weird Limits of Google Maps Is the Best Way to Kill Time,slate.com,Allie Conti,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/google-maps-one-star-reviews-rabbit-holes.html,"Rabbit Holes: Why a 1950s Motivational Video Is the Best Form of Procrastination Rabbit Holes is a recurring series in which writers pay homage to the diversity and ingenuity of the ways we procrastinate now. To pitch your personal rabbit hole, email . Lakshmi Mudragada did not have a good time on Sea Cow Island. Sure, the potato-shaped land mass in the middle of the Indian Ocean doesn’t have any amenities, but the generic tropical beach picture on Google Maps looks nice enough. What went wrong? The one-star review on Google isn’t accompanied by text, so perhaps the story behind it will always be a mystery. But trying to untangle the mysteries behind various aspects of Google Maps is my preferred way to kill time. For example, how did Lakshmi get out to SCI in the first place? Or did they even really go there at all? When you try to get directions to the remote British territory from Brooklyn, for instance, it breaks the program. Rather than direct you to a regional airport in Madagascar or somewhere else “nearby,” it just zooms out so far that it shows a picture of Earth situated in the black expanse of outer space. I find this only slightly more intriguing than terrifying. Even though I spend all day on the internet, my world feels very small sometimes. The lives of people in areas like Palau or the Marshall Islands aren’t usually portrayed on TV or film. But Google Maps reviewers provide clues from which I can make up stories about these places on the other side of the earth, and sometimes they offer pictures that help fill in a coherent vision of them. It’s like a choose-your-own-adventure travel guide where everything is annotated in the most bizarre way possible—a “ Bandersnatch ” where you can play for as long or as little as you like and don’t have to worry about reaching any sort of satisfying narrative conclusion. When the story broke about the missionary who was killed trying to contact the last pre-Neolithic society on earth off the coast of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands this past November, I understood his curiosity, if not his confidence. I’d already pored over the Bay of Bengal and its archipelago from the comfort of my desk chair, and I’d seen the offerings at a roadside restaurant off National Highway 4 that takes you from the coastal point of Mayabunder to the capital of Port Blair. I’d also noticed that Google did not have the slightest data point available for the last place the missionary ever tried to set foot, beyond the fact that it existed. My procrastination habit isn’t just limited to the last blank spots on the Google map either; more familiar places work just as well. A co-worker recently told me that his sister had moved to someplace in my home state of Florida; he had to go and Google the name, even though he’d just been there. It turns out the forgettable town was called Freeport, and upon learning this, my immediate instinct was to look it up. It’s a suburb and therefore shaped like a plate of spaghetti, with no obvious Main Street or place to begin a journey. Searching for a clue of where to start, I scrolled through the place’s few commercial offerings, which is how I ended up on the page for Paul Lee Tattoo. The proprietor’s works include your typical yin-yangs and tribal patterns, sure, but photos from the shop also include a still-bleeding back freshly inked with a gator depicted busting through a wall like a reptilian version of the Kool-Aid Man. After completing this digital trek, I was pleased to report back to my co-worker with sympathies and a pointed recommendation of where his sister should never get a tattoo. Looking at your own hometown through the lens of Google Maps can also be enlightening. After all, the reviews represent a collection of what people there deem important or indicative of—something, although of what is up to you. In the case of Lake Mary, Florida, you get front-on shots of cookie-cutter houses and architecturally lacking commercial properties, a Chick-fil-A decorated for Christmas, a bad-looking steak at a sports bar, empty parking lots, and a Confederate flag in a display case. That’s a relatively accurate portrait, though not one I would have ever put together myself. I wonder how it would read to an outsider, though, or to someone as unfamiliar with the American South as I am with an app-breaking destination called Tristan da Cunha ? All I have to go on there are cryptic yet poetic messages that give me no idea of what a lived experience is actually like in the most remote yet inhabited archipelago on earth. Oddly: “The people … drift off walking sideways mid conversation.” Ominously: “The return to the past is the real future.” Or, more simply: “Too far.”"
William Barr rigged Donald Trump’s acquittal.,slate.com,William Saletan,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-mueller-report-hearing-rigged-trump-prosecution.html,"How Are We Supposed to Understand Brett Kavanaugh Now? Five weeks ago, special counsel Robert Mueller gave Attorney General William Barr a 448-page report on the Russia investigation. The report documented multiple attempts by President Donald Trump to manipulate, disrupt, and terminate the investigation. But two days after receiving the report, Barr announced that the evidence was insufficient to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. How did Barr reach that conclusion? On Wednesday, we got the answer: He devised legal standards that make it impossible to convict a president of obstruction. At Wednesday’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Barr testified not as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer but as a defense attorney for the president. When Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota asked Barr about Trump’s attempts to manipulate witnesses, the attorney general rebutted her by presenting what, in his opinion, “the president’s lawyers would say.” Barr dismissed Mueller’s efforts to get an interview with Trump—Mueller “never sought it. … Well, he never pushed it,” the attorney general lied—and he complained that Mueller’s analysis of the president’s obstructive conduct “permits a lot of selectivity on the part of the prosecutors.” In place of Mueller’s analysis, Barr laid down four rules that guaranteed Trump would escape prosecution. 1. A president’s efforts to terminate an investigation of himself are presumptively innocent. Under U.S. law, anyone accused of a crime is presumed innocent. But Barr clings to this presumption even after the president has attempted, on multiple occasions, to abort an inquiry into his own alleged misconduct. Barr told the committee that Trump’s presidential orders—including the firing of then–FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 and the attempted firing of Mueller a month later—were “authorized by the Constitution” and therefore “facially innocent.” 2. No amount of evidence can disprove a president’s post hoc account of his motives. Mueller presented copious evidence that Trump, having decided to fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, seized on a completely different rationale—outlined in a memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—as a pretext for the firing. But at Wednesday’s hearing, when Sen. John Cornyn of Texas asked Barr whether Trump “was relying, at least in part,” on Rosenstein’s critique, the attorney general assured Cornyn, “That’s right.” Mueller also documented conversations in which then–White House counsel Don McGahn and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an ex-prosecutor, explained to Trump that there were no grounds to fire Mueller based on putative conflicts of interest. But at the hearing, Barr insisted that Trump’s subsequent efforts to oust Mueller might have been based not on fear of the Russia investigation but on the alleged conflicts of interest. Barr defended the president’s preposterous lie about his attempt, through McGahn, to fire Mueller. In June 2017, Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, said Trump was strongly considering firing Mueller. A few days later, Trump called McGahn twice at home and told him to get rid of the special counsel. According to McGahn, Trump repeatedly pressed him to contact Rosenstein—“Call me back when you do it,” the president told McGahn—and oust the special counsel because “Mueller has to go.” But at Wednesday’s hearing, Barr stood up for Trump’s version of the episode. “What he meant,” said Barr, paraphrasing Trump’s account, “was that the conflict of interest should be raised with Rosenstein, but the decision should be left with Rosenstein.” Barr was equally generous in his defense of Trump’s signals to witnesses. Klobuchar asked the attorney general about public comments in which Trump had warned two witnesses in the investigation, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, not to “flip.” Barr replied that Trump could easily defend those comments. “By flipping, he meant succumbing to pressure in unrelated cases to lie” against the president, Barr suggested. That’s an odd claim to make about Manafort—who was found to have lied to prosecutors while protecting Trump —or Cohen, whose testimony against Trump was corroborated by checks and audio recordings . 3. If a president thinks any part of an allegation is false, he can lawfully obstruct an investigation of that allegation. On Jan. 25, 2018, the New York Times reported Trump’s attempt, through McGahn, to fire Mueller in June 2017. In the week after the Times story appeared, Trump repeatedly pressed McGahn to deny the story. McGahn refused, saying the article was true. Trump rebuked McGahn for taking notes, demanded that he deny the story in writing “for our records,” and threatened to fire him if he didn’t recant. Mueller documented this episode through White House records and multiple witnesses. But at Wednesday’s hearing, Barr insisted that Trump’s intent was innocent because one word in the Times article was debatable. “The New York Times story said flat-out that the president directed the firing of Mueller,” said Barr. He noted that Trump later denied having used the word “fire” in his calls to McGahn. Therefore, said Barr, it was possible that “the president truly felt that the Times article was inaccurate” and, in ordering his White House counsel to recant, didn’t think “he was instructing McGahn to say something false.” 4. If a president thinks any part of an investigation is unfounded, he can lawfully shut it down. Barr told Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont that if a legal proceeding was “based on false allegations, the president does not have to sit there, constitutionally, and allow it to run its course. The president could terminate that proceeding, and it would not be a corrupt intent, because he was being falsely accused.” The attorney general made the same argument to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, contending that a “falsely accused” president could fire a special counsel without corrupt intent. Barr didn’t confine this argument to meritless inquiries. He applied it to investigations that involved any false allegations. He specifically said it was a valid basis for terminating the Russia investigation since the president “was being falsely accused.” “Two years of his administration have been dominated by allegations that have now been proven false,” Barr told the committee. In defiance of Mueller’s report , he claimed that Trump “did nothing wrong” and that suspicions of collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign were “without a basis.” Together, Barr’s four rules make an obstruction of justice case impossible. The president could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue, fire the FBI director, fire a special counsel, threaten witnesses, and instruct subordinates to lie, and he wouldn’t lose the support of his attorney general. That’s why Trump hired Barr in the first place. And that’s why Mueller’s investigation shouldn’t end with Barr’s refusal to prosecute the president. We can’t let a lawyer acquit his own client.

"Ben Sasse, Barr hearing: Explains problem with legal Trump-Russia links.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/ben-sasse-barr-hearing-explains-trump-exoneration.html,"Oglala Sioux Tribe Tells South Dakota Governor That She Is “Not Welcome” on Reservation In the first volume of his report to the attorney general about Donald Trump’s “links” to Russia, special counsel Robert Mueller wrote that the evidence his team had gathered “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Not surprisingly, Trump interpreted this conclusion as a “complete and total exoneration,” while Attorney General William Barr described it as a conclusion that “no collusion” took place in 2016. That’s not quite what the Mueller report says, though. For one, it notes that it does not address the issue of “collusion” because the word collusion doesn’t have a specific legal meaning. For another, it says that some of the witnesses investigators spoke to provided “information that was false or incomplete,” “deleted relevant communications,” or “communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption”—limitations that the special counsel says may have prevented its office from gathering information that “would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.” And finally, the report does conclude, even if it stops short of recommending criminal conspiracy charges, that the Trump campaign was “receptive” to some offers of Russian assistance and “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.” According to Mueller, Russia in turn “perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency.” Which, as Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse and Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons pointed out in their questions to Barr during Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, is not necessarily a great state of affairs. Sasse is the kind of Republican who tends to get exasperated at Trump for constantly doing things that are reckless and destructive. But he also represents MAGA-friendly red-state constituents , so his remarks weren’t phrased in a confrontational gotcha format. They nonetheless laid out concisely why it’s concerning that Trump et al.’s attitude toward Russian influence has not, as of yet, been disincentivized. Get The Angle in Your Inbox

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Sasse made his point via a question about Paul Manafort. Manafort served as Trump’s campaign chairman on an ostensibly “volunteer” basis, but, per Mueller’s report, sought to exploit the high-profile position financially. One of the ways he appears to have done so, according to Mueller, was by offering Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska—a close ally of Vladimir Putin’s who had previously employed Manafort for consulting work—access to the campaign. As Sasse put it:
Paul Manafort is hired by Deripaska for things related to the Ukraine. … He is on the payroll of a Russian oligarch that has interests completely disaligned with the American people. He is on his payroll. Is it permissible for [an American campaign official] to be paid by someone who is basically an enemy of the United States? Manafort was charged with a number of crimes that Mueller uncovered, but none were directly related to 2016 activities involving Deripaska. The special counsel also chose not to prosecute ex–National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who, like Manafort, had recent financial ties to Russia and demonstrated a willingness to advance Russian interests while working for Trump. Ostensibly, Mueller made this decision because neither Manafort nor Flynn were in touch with the specific Russian operatives who carried out cyberattacks against Democrats; likewise, neither individual appears to have been caught giving a tangible indication that their interest in Russia-friendly policies was a reward for Russia’s sabotage of Clinton. As Sasse pointed out, though, this would suggest that it would be OK with the Department of Justice for a foreign country like Russia or China to cultivate influence by systematically putting as many American campaign operatives as possible on retainer in the hopes that they’d end up, like Manafort, as influential “volunteers” on U.S. campaigns:
Could they come in and build a database of all campaign operatives in the U.S.? And just decide to hire all of them and say, why don’t you volunteer for this campaign and you volunteer for that campaign? Could we have campaign chairmen and women running around the U.S. paid for by foreign entities, choosing to volunteer on campaigns, going forward? Is that legal? And later:
If the Chinese government decides to start hacking into 2020 campaigns, I would hope there is clarity from the Department of Justice about whether or not Democratic presidential campaigns and whether the Trump re-election campaign are allowed to say, “we are interested in this hacked material.” Barr didn’t have much of a response for Sasse, calling the subject “a slippery area” and saying that whether any of the hypothetical behavior Sasse described would be criminal “depends on the specific circumstances.” The issue was framed even more pithily by Delaware’s Coons, who targeted Barr with a question based on the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting attended by three top Trump advisers and several Russians. The Russians had high-level government and intelligence connections and had conveyed through an intermediary that they were interested in providing the Trump campaign incriminating material about Clinton in the context of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” No one on the Trump campaign was charged for the incident; Mueller’s report concludes that prosecuting them for accepting illegal foreign campaign support would have been difficult because of ambiguity over whether they “had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful” and whether incriminating information legally constitutes “a thing of value” as the relevant statute requires. Coons’ question put Barr on the spot as to whether this is supposed to mean the meeting was A-OK.
COONS: Going forward, what if a foreign adversary—let’s now say North Korea—offers a presidential candidate dirt on a competitor in 2020? Do you agree with me the campaign should immediately contact the FBI?
BARR: [Long pause] If a foreign government?
COONS: If a foreign intelligence service, a representative of a foreign government—
BARR: Yes. Yes.
COONS: —says, “We have dirt on your opponent,” should they say “ I love it , let’s meet,” or should they contact the FBI?
BARR: If a foreign intelligence service does, yes. So, Barr’s answer appears to be that campaigns should worry about being approached by well-connected foreigners who want to trade incriminating information for changes to money-laundering laws only if those foreigners are wearing, let’s say, T-shirts and novelty baseball caps that say WE ARE FOREIGN SPIES. It’s an interesting position for the U.S.’s top law enforcement officer to take, but that’s where we are now."

The local Canadians, on the other hand, only favored the cooked dishes. “I watched them eat spinach salad, tempura, and teriyaki chicken very, very quickly,” Tojo tells me over hot tea at his current restaurant, Tojo’s. “But the sushi they refused before they tasted. They didn’t eat raw crab and tuna … raw they didn’t eat.” Given the popularity and ubiquity of sushi today, it’s hard to imagine a time when we weren’t eating raw fish, but such was the case in 1970s North America. For Tojo, a trained sushi chef, watching his customers forgo his pièce de résistance, day in and day out, motivated him to make his sushi better.

Momoko, Tojo’s Daughter But first, he needed to figure out why they didn’t want to try it in the first place. Eventually, Tojo moved outside of the familiarity of Japantown and became the head chef at a new spot, Jinya, on the highly trafficked and diverse West Broadway. He struck up a relationship with one of his regulars, a young flight attendant named Mami Yamaguchi, at the now-defunct CPA Airlines. Unlike most of the local Canadians who came to eat at Tojo’s restaurant, Mami was Japanese herself; she spoke multiple languages and didn’t shy away from trying Tojo’s sushi, which quickly endeared her to Tojo. She became, in a sense, his cultural translator, taking him to the popular French restaurants at the time, like William Tell, where Tojo noticed Canadians did in fact enjoy seafood, especially local Dungeness crab—when it was boiled. With Mami’s guidance, Tojo started to explore the local fish markets in pursuit of his most pressing question, “Why don’t Canadians like raw fish?” Tojo wandered the seafood aisles of Safeway and the local market on Granville Island to see where Canadians were shopping for fish. In contrast to the Japanese suppliers he was buying from, the Canadian markets, it turned out, served their fish with less presentation. “No decoration, very bad smell. Fish smell,” Tojo recounted. “In my training when you go to the market, seafood smells just like watermelon, fresh watermelon, or cucumber smell. Big difference. Over there, Safeway? Ah! Stinky! That’s why.” Suddenly the driving question to Tojo’s sushi conundrum had an answer: smelly fish. Tojo decided to create a sushi that Canadians would like, one that didn’t require the use of the local supply. It wasn’t so much a concession as a vestige of his training in Osaka, where he was known for his omakase creations, i.e. serving the customers’ needs with what was fresh and available. Omakase in Japanese loosely translates to “I’ll leave it up to you.” It’s more than just a menu; it’s a ritual built on the ever-changing ingredients in the chef’s kitchen, while still considering the desires of the customer. Many omakase chefs don’t have a predetermined menu in mind; rather, they build the menu as it unfolds, relying on a sense of what works and what doesn’t for each individual customer. It necessitates, in other words, a certain type of trust between the customer and the chef. What made Tojo’s style of omakase different was that he didn’t feel bound by his locale, North America. Take, for instance, his favorite dish unagi , or barbecued eel, which simply wasn’t available as an ingredient in Vancouver. In order to offer it as a menu item, he instead used the skin of a fish that came to Canada in droves, salmon, seasoning it with the classic sauce used on traditional unagi. This was, in effect, the way Tojo’s California roll was born: by mixing what was available and accessible to him, with what people in his restaurant actually wanted to eat. Nothing more or less elaborate than that. Tojo doesn’t remember the exact day or circumstance that led to the roll. He does, however, remember many customers complaining about eating seaweed. So one day, he replaced the raw fish with avocado and boiled local crab, inspired by what he saw at William Tell. Then, he hid the nori behind a veil of rice by rolling the sushi inside out. Finally, to really make the roll sing, he added a little mayonnaise. “We were born very poor,” he said. “That time after the war, no food. We put mayonnaise and greens from the garden. That is kind of like Western food, little bit fancy. Before they put only soy sauce. But when we discovered mayonnaise, we put in lettuce, tomato, cucumber—put mayo, I love it!” To be clear, the California roll on the menu at Tojo’s restaurant is called the Tojo Maki, not the California roll. Tojo had never even been to California at that point in time (a detail he has impressed on me several times). While the name “Tojo Maki” enjoys significantly less notoriety than “California roll,” Tojo insists that he was the first to come up with it. Asked why I should believe his version of the California roll’s origin story, he replied simply, “In Japan you have pride. Good chef never copies. Never.” The competing theory is that the California roll was, in fact, invented in California’s Little Tokyo in the 1970s. According to this version of events, a man named Kanai Noritoshi, who owned a Japanese food import company called Mutual Trading Company, started what was considered the first sushi counter, Kawafuku, and it was there that he invented the “California” maki. Kawafuku’s head chef, Ichiro Mashita, also claimed credit after starting his own restaurant, Tokyo Kaikan. As for Tojo’s attempts at solidifying his place in California roll history, he did try to trademark his roll in the early ‘90s, after the fact. For this he called on his lawyer, Barry Joe, who has been working with Tojo for 40 years. Unfortunately, for the progenitors of all things wacky maki, trademarking a recipe is extremely difficult to enforce, and extremely costly, at close to several thousand dollars a year for a patent on something like the Tojo Maki. For the rest of us, the who of who can legitimately claim credit for the California roll feels besides the point. The idea that people want to claim credit for its invention at all is a testament to its ubiquity, and to its ultimate commercial success. The California roll’s rise didn’t occur without its critics, like chef Hiroko Shimbo, author of The Sushi Experience . “The California roll is not Japanese sushi because it was created for the convenience of American diners,” she said. “We call it ‘sushi,’ but that’s another dish.” I asked Shimbo whether she thought it was authentic. “No,” she explained. “Why is it not authentic is simply the nori, when we make rolls in Japan, is always outside. And of course there is a reason nori is on the outside: to keep the sushi rice moist and juicy (and the nori gets a little chewy), and that’s how rolls are made in Japan.” As Shimbo speaks, I can’t help but wonder: Is authenticity not chimerical? Cross-cultural remakes of culinary classics date back to globalization itself. The English soup mulligatawny originated from the Indian dish molo tunny; L.A. galbi came from Korean immigrants in California who made use of a cheaper cut newly available to them; and even tempura exists thanks to the Portuguese (although now it seems so steeped in authentic Japanese tradition that considering it anything else seems preposterous). “Whenever some new dish comes to one’s country from another country, that food is always transformed into a slightly different form in order to appeal to the people in that new country,” Shimbo explained. “In Japan they like soft-textured bagels, so a few companies came up with a soft bagel, kind of a fluffy bagel, and that’s ‘bagel’ to the Japanese. And here in America no one can accept that soft bagel.” Maybe that’s what gave the California roll its staying power. Japanese sushi made a small adjustment: a piece of cooked fish in place of raw, a bit of extra sauce and some nori hidden from view. But what is authentic sushi? Even if it’s created for Americans, is it not still sushi? Maybe not what Shimbo grew up associating with sushi, but sushi nonetheless—without which some of Tojo’s most valued regulars may not have come back for a second or third taste. But what sushi needs in order to be authentic, Shimbo continued, is “respect of each flavor in each ingredient. When we cook something, we don’t add spices or something to mask. Using oil masks the flavor of ingredients, so the chefs or cooks, whenever they make some dish, try to use a method to keep the true flavor of the ingredients at the end of the preparation. So that when you eat chicken you enjoy the flavor of the chicken, not the sauce.” Some would say that the California roll, at least a good one, does just that. The balanced combination of ingredients, the subtleties of the rice’s temperature, the freshness of the nori, the perfect amount of mayo—all of these are what make a California roll sing. According to Shimbo’s definition, then, maybe there is a version of the California roll that’s “authentic” and another that’s not.
Tojo at Jinya, holding a takeout order for restaurant regular, Paul Belserene.
Momoko, Tojo’s Daughter Tojo’s creative approach to omakase has led to many other types of adaptations, like the Golden Roll, which does away with nori by wrapping sushi fillings in a thin egg crepe. Or his take on tuna sashimi, which comes pre-marinated to avoid the chance of a customer getting the wrong balance of fish to wasabi to soy. Visible in all of Tojo’s menu items is this well-worn habit of “tricking” his customers into trying more and more of his sushi—what may appear to be sushi gimmicks, but which clearly are clever maneuvers to appeal to the palette he’s catering to. One of Tojo’s most valued regulars, Paul Belserene, couldn’t stomach uni until he tried Tojo’s preparation of it, which now has him hooked. As Belserene remembers it, Tojo “saw his hesitation with uni,” so he made him an uni shiso temaki, placing the sea urchin on top of a shiso leaf so its slippery texture would be masked. “The bitterness of the shiso leaf, the crunch of the nori, and the softness and deep umami of the urchin,” as Belserene described it, was his “gateway drug into uni.” Thanks to Tojo, you can’t go a mile in any direction in Vancouver today without hitting a sushi restaurant. In 2016, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries honored Tojo as the Goodwill Ambassador for Japanese Cuisine, recognizing his work as a chef even as he pushed the boundaries of what’s accepted as “sushi.” I asked Tojo if he thought he would have received this award had he not invented the California roll. “You know, I don’t know,” he said wistfully. “I put the American palette and Japanese old-fashioned cooking together, little bit. That’s my cooking. Because otherwise, people no understand.” More from Food52 :How These Crispy Sheet-Pan Pork Chops Made It on My All-Star Dinners ListThis Chickpea Pot Pie Is So Good, You’ll Be Like ‘Chicken, Who?’Our 10 Most-Popular Recipes Right NowBanana Bread-Chocolate Chunk CookiesFilipino Chicken Porridge (Arroz Caldo)

Democrats Respond to Barr’s Multi-Faceted Attack on National Integrity With Press Conference Involving Ceramic Chicken,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/steve-cohen-william-barr-chicken-democrats-no.html,"This Week in Brexit: A Plague on Both Your Houses In November 2018, I wrote a piece that complained about the Democratic Party’s tendency to create “messaging” initiatives and talking points characterized by toothless quasi-humor and a failure to grasp either the stylistic dynamics of virality-oriented modern media or the substantive urgency and forcefulness that the current political situation requires. On Thursday, Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen responded to honesty-challenged Attorney General William Barr’s arrogant refusal to allow himself to be questioned by a House Judiciary Committee attorney by eating food in a hearing room and bringing in a fake chicken thing to a press conference: Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen, who brought a ceramic chicken and ate from a bucket of KFC during the House Judiciary hearing, says “‘Chicken Barr’ should have shown up today and answered questions” https://t.co/PVMpCmTID2 pic.twitter.com/7sOgTV2yBz — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 2, 2019 Meanwhile, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly said at a private meeting that she believed Barr had committed criminal perjury by claiming in an April 9 hearing that he wasn’t aware of any objections Robert Mueller’s special counsel team might have had to Barr’s summary of their work. When pressed on the issue in public by a reporter, though, her response was that “there’s a process involved here, and as I said, I’ll say it again, the committee will act upon how we will proceed.” Wow—a process to be acted upon? Someone better get a glass of water, because that’s some spicy rhetoric! Why didn’t the Democrats read my article???"
Mueller can’t get away with silence anymore.,slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/robert-mueller-william-barr-rift-mueller-must-speak.html,"Mueller Spent Years Collecting Evidence. Barr Is Pretending It’s Not There. For almost all of the story of To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley is nothing more than a metaphor. He’s a mysterious, shadowy figure who can be pressed into service to symbolize any number of literary tropes, but despite the importuning of primary characters who only want Boo to come out of his house, he only does so when he’s ready, and when it’s necessary. Robert Mueller has been, for more than two years, a metaphor. He’s been the guy whose firing would have signified the pick-up-a-brick moment for millions of Americans , he’s been the caped superhero coming to save us all, and he’s also been the shadowy Clark Kent, toiling away in dorky obscurity, refusing to engage with whatever it is that corrupts even well-meaning public servants who must interact with Donald Trump. For two years, Mueller has defied all public longings and expectations and demands, instead allowing his indictments, his report, and his words on paper to speak for themselves. But like Boo Radley, it’s now time for Robert Mueller to come out. If Attorney General William Barr’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday demonstrated anything, it was that a deep rupture has yawned open between these two old friends and Washington lifers. It wasn’t just that Barr denigrated Mueller as a “political appointee” or dismissed his March 27 letter as “ snitty ,” and thus clearly the work of underlings. It wasn’t just that Barr implied that Mueller was either too timid or too incompetent to come to a conclusion on the question of whether Donald Trump had obstructed justice. And it wasn’t just that Barr suggested that since the entire Mueller probe had been proven to be “based on false accusations,” it was illegitimate, which certainly suggests that Mueller devoted two long years to a—you guessed it—witch hunt. Presumably, from now on, if the president decides any legal investigation is “based on false accusations,” he can just go ahead and impede it , a framing that makes a hash of everything Mueller sought to do. When pressed Wednesday on Mueller’s bona fides, Barr snapped that “Bob Mueller is the equivalent of a U.S. Attorney. … His work concluded when he sent his report to the attorney general. At that point, it was my baby.” This is not how you talk about a colleague you respect. This studied restraint rested on Mueller’s unwavering assumption that if he trusted the fact-finding process of the investigation and the machinery of the Justice Department, he might come out the other side intact. But it’s not just that. At the most basic level, Barr has distorted Mueller’s actual work product, including his polite and confidential and lawyerly letter asking (twice) that Barr correct his inaccurate summary of Mueller’s careful report. It’s a letter that Wired’s Garrett Graff, who wrote a book about Mueller, described thusly : “I’ve read just about every word Bob Mueller has ever said publicly or published. He’s written precisely one letter like the angry one he sent to Barr: It excoriated Scotland for letting the Pan Am 103 bomber out of prison.” With the rollout of the report and Wednesday’s charged testimony, Barr betrayed Mueller the institutionalist not once but twice, first by warping years of his team’s painstaking investigative work in order to control the media narrative, and then by denigrating Mueller’s March 27 letter as the work of a “snitty” staffer, as opposed to a sober and deliberate bit of caution from the special counsel quietly asking that his work not be appropriated for political ends. Mueller, a lifelong Republican, has tried—probably harder than any public figure in the Trump ambit—to avoid doing anything that would draw him into the tractor beam of bullying, name-calling, and soapy melodrama that are the final resting place for anyone who involves himself with this president. Where lesser men have attempted to split the difference, compromise at the margins, and to persuade themselves that they were still doing noble work despite allowing Donald Trump to use and exploit them, Mueller simply never engaged, even when the president was attacking him by name. It was an elegant dance, along the invisible seam of public and private, institutionalism and self-protection. This studied restraint rested on Mueller’s unwavering assumption that if he trusted the fact-finding process of the investigation and the machinery of the Justice Department , he might come out the other side intact. Well, any hope that Barr the institutionalist or Barr the defender of the Justice Department or Barr the believer in truth-seeking processes was going to help Robert Mueller thread this impossibly small needle was vaporized conclusively this week , and now, as my colleague Mark Joseph Stern argues, Robert Mueller is going to have to talk . Efforts to speak through his filings have proved futile in the hands of someone willing to twist and compromise Mueller’s own words until they mean the very opposite of what they originally established. And now that the rift between these two old friends and colleagues has been laid bare, the only person who can do anything about it is the person who has practically made a religion of keeping his head down. Mueller has a narrowing path along which he might hope to salvage his own words and his own work from the attorney general, who seems to have taken custody of Mueller’s “baby” and then unabashedly attempted to tell us all that the baby was actually an accent lamp all along. Nobody has been more voluble than I have about Mueller’s right and inclination to quietly do the work, then step aside . But if he doesn’t step into the limelight to say out loud what he has written, and proved, and corroborated, and supported (with evidence Barr seems never to even have inspected ), his entire effort will only serve as confirmation that those of us who still believe in systems and investigations and truth are all a bunch of chumps. I don’t envy Robert Mueller. As the one and only character in this endless gothic saga who has managed to remain untarnished by the president’s highly contagious lack of principle, I take no pleasure in arguing that he will now have to engage. His silence and doggedness should have spoken louder than words. But in the hands of someone as bent on politicizing his efforts as William Barr, his silence and doggedness have now been weaponized against him. The special counsel cannot just live amid the heroic metaphors anymore. Like Boo Radley, Mueller needs to come out. Support our journalism

William Barr’s Justice Department Just Filed the Most Nakedly Political Brief in the Agency’s History,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-doj-obamacare-brief-partisan-hack.html,"Barr Rigged Trump’s Acquittal On Wednesday afternoon, after Attorney General William Barr finished his truculent and mendacious testimony before the Senate, the Department of Justice filed perhaps the most embarrassing, illogical, and nakedly political brief in the history of the agency. With Barr’s assent, the DOJ argued that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because Congress zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty in 2017. The timing couldn’t be worse. After obliterating his own credibility at the Senate hearing, Barr scorched the Justice Department’s legitimacy, deploying fatuous pseudo-legal arguments to further the Trump administration’s partisan goals. The DOJ will not soon recover from Wednesday’s body blow. Texas v. United States , the latest assault on the ACA, is built upon a series of sophistries. The case was brought by a coalition of conservative states, led by Texas, which recruited two consultants to serve as plaintiffs. They assert that when Congress reduced the ACA’s penalty to zero dollars, it inadvertently destroyed the whole law—the tax credits, the exchanges, protections for preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion, everything. According to Texas’ theory, the Supreme Court only upheld the ACA because it interpreted the penalty as a tax. But, they claim, a tax that collects zero dollars is not a true tax. So the individual mandate can no longer be viewed as a tax, rendering it unconstitutional. And because Congress never intended the ACA to function without the individual mandate, the rest of the law must be struck down too. This leap in logic makes no sense. It is true that taxes typically collect revenue, so perhaps the mandate cannot fairly be called a tax anymore. It could even be true that the zeroed-out penalty is now unconstitutional. But that does not matter , because ifthe penalty is illegal, it should be severed from the rest of the law. As the Supreme Court recently explained , when one provision of a statute is invalidated, courts should preserve the remainder of the law unless it is “evident” that Congress “would not have enacted those provisions … independently.” In other words, courts that strike down part of a law should not eviscerate the rest of it without evidence that Congress would’ve wanted that extreme result. Here, congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In 2017, Congress declined to repeal the entire ACA but chose to zero out the individual mandate’s penalty in the tax bill . By doing so, it declared its belief that the law could function without an operative penalty, a lawful exercise of its legislative powers. But Texas claimed that by amending the ACA, Congress inadvertently demolished it, because the law cannot function without a penalty—even though Congress decided that it could. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, courts should simply sweep aside this legislative intent and invalidate the law top to bottom. Congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In an opinion panned by liberals and conservatives alike, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor embraced this theory late last year and ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. This view was too militant even for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department, which opted for a compromise position: It alleged that the mandate was unconstitutional but that only a few other provisions must fall with it. This half-measure was still a big deal, because the DOJ urged the courts to kill a centerpiece of the law: its bar on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. And the DOJ’s brief at the time reflected, as University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley put it , “enormous contempt for the rule of law.” It was, as other scholars noted , “excruciatingly stupid.” But at least the DOJ did not go whole hog, adopting Texas’ radical position that courts should reject Congress’ authority to amend its own law. Until now. After Barr took control of the DOJ, the agency changed its position and has now told the 5 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas is right—the full ACA is now unconstitutional. With a straight face, the Justice Department argues that, by reducing the mandate to zero dollars, Congress gave Americans a “legal command” to buy health insurance. The Supreme Court has said that such a direct command would be unconstitutional because the mandate could only be justified as a tax. Moreover, the justices who discussed severability said that the ACA cannot function without the mandate. In sum, the DOJ wrote, the mandate is now illegal, it cannot be severed, and so the whole law is unconstitutional. Where to begin with this lunacy? Start with the DOJ’s framing of the mandate as it stands now. As a factual matter, the ACA currently gives Americans a choice between buying health insurance and paying nothing. There’s no real dispute here; if you forgo insurance, you will suffer no legal consequences. Yet the DOJ interprets the mandate as a “command” that gives Americans “no choice” but to purchase insurance. And its brief insists that Congress created this command in its 2017 tax bill—even though legislators surely knew that the Supreme Court already ruled that such a command would be unconstitutional in 2012’s NFIB v. Sebelius . It requires willing suspension of disbelief to surmise that by giving Americans a choice not to buy insurance by zeroing out the mandate, Congress actually gave them a “command” to insure themselves. And it taxes credulity to believe that Congress would create this “command” after the Supreme Court stated that such a rule would be unconstitutional. But imagine for a moment that the DOJ is right—that the Republican-led Congress of 2017 didn’t actually relieveAmericans of their duty to buy health insurance but forcedthem to do so (without any enforcement mechanism). If the courts must strike down this new “legal command,” why should the remainder of the law fall with it? After all, Congress obviously thought the ACA could function without a mandate that raises revenue. To square this circle, the DOJ repeatedly cites the dissent in NFIB , which proclaimed that the mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the law. The Justice Department seems to think that the view of four dissenting justices (in a 2012 case) can override the view of Congress (in 2017 legislation). It appears to have forgotten that a dissent is not law. The zaniest portion of Wednesday’s brief, however, has to be its effort to salvage the few provisions of the ACA that the current administration likes. It does so by selectively raising the problem of standing. Now, in reality, the individual plaintiffs in this case—two consultants who don’t want to buy health insurance—shouldn’t have standing to sue at all. That requires an injury, and these plaintiffs have none , because they pay no penalty for forgoing insurance. The DOJ casts this problem aside by asserting that they are injured by the “legal command” to insure themselves. And its brief argues that the plaintiffs have standing “to challenge the numerous provisions of the ACA that work together to cause” this injury. But in a puzzling paragraph, the DOJ adds that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge several provisions of the ACA that criminalize health care fraud. Why? The real answer is that the Justice Department is already prosecuting people under these provisions, and those prosecutions would be thwarted if the full law were struck down. But the DOJ avows that while the plaintiffs have standing to challenge almost the entire ACA, they can’t challenge these provisions because they do not “actually injure the individual plaintiffs.” Oh, really? So the rule that insurers not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and the tax credits for lower-income Americans, and the expansion of Medicaid in states other than Texas —all these provisions “actually injure” the plaintiffs? But prohibitions on fraud somehow do not? The DOJ makes no effort to defend this evanescent distinction, because it is indefensible. Barr reportedly opposed adopting this preposterous position but caved to President Donald Trump’s demands. He deserves no credit for his feeble resistance. Barr owns this brief , and it will live on as a testament to his craven lawlessness long after the Supreme Court rejects its casuistry. The Justice Department’s reputation will take years to recover from this nadir, if it ever does. Barr marched his agency to the brink of illegitimacy. Support our journalism

Xavi Made Modern Soccer. Did the Game Leave Him Behind?,slate.com,Eric Betts,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/xavi-retirement-barcelona-spain-undervalued.html,"Rockets-Warriors Was All About One Specific Type of Foul In 1814, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace posited a hypothetical intelligence that, given the location of every atom in the universe and the forces acting upon them, would be able to calculate the future with the same clarity with which it observed the past. This concept, which would come to be known as Laplace’s demon , would know all the causes and thus be able to see all the effects. The entire universe, from its beginning to its end, would be contained within its mind. Xavi, soccer’s own Laplace’s demon, announced Thursday that he would retire at the end of this season after 17 years at Barcelona and four lucrative swan-song seasons at the Qatari club Al-Sadd. No one in the history of the sport has ever controlled games like the diminutive Spaniard did; no one has ever been as good at the simple task of receiving the ball and knowing immediately where it needs to go next. He played as though he could see the future, as though the only input required for him to map out the rest of the game was the kickoff. Xavi sat at the literal center of two of this century’s most dominant teams, and he, more than anyone—and in this case, “anyone” includes all-timers Thierry Henry, Gerard Piqué, and even Lionel Messi—dictated how Barcelona and Spain played: retaining possession through short passing in close quarters, bending and eventually exhausting defenses with their intricate movement. Xavi found little pockets of space and weaponized them. Between 2008 and 2012, he won two Champions League trophies, three Spanish La Liga titles, two European Championships, and one World Cup, or just about everything it was possible for him to win. Yet because his game appeared so simple, because he did the things everyone is supposed to do only better, it took years for him to get the acclaim he deserved. Even after he was named the best player of the 2008 European Championship, halfway through a year spent masterminding the most dominant club season in recent history with Pep Guardiola’s first Barcelona team, the Daily Mail published a headline over a picture of the five nominees for the FIFA World Player of the Year Award that read “ The Best Players in the World (and Xavi) .” He might still be undervalued, despite all those trophies. The soccer magazine FourFourTwo named him the 50 th best player of all time in 2017, which one day is going to seem nearly as ridiculous as “(and Xavi).” His presence on the field wasn’t additive but multiplicative. Perhaps the difficulty of appraisal stems from the fact that he was so different from the midfield idols he supplanted: inexhaustible battlers like Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira, polished playmakers like Kaká and Pavel Nedved. Xavi was the stylistic opposite of the 2006 World Cup’s best player, Zinedine Zidane. Even at 34, Zidane dominated games, arresting the eye like a bolt of lightning. You were always conscious of him, always waiting for his next audacious display, up to and including the career-ending head-butt in that World Cup’s final. Xavi never played that way. He was a conduit, shepherding the game but not overwhelming it. He was not the kind of player you were always aware of; indeed, he moved about the pitch so much you’d be hard-pressed to keep constant tabs on him. Instead, you’d notice his contribution—a sudden, surprising one-touch pass to split two different layers of defenders—then go back via replay or rewind and discover that of course it was him. Trying to spot Xavi’s next pass before he played it was a good way to prove how little you knew about the game. He saw his options faster than you could even with your advantage of the wide shot. His presence on the field wasn’t additive but multiplicative. His entire game fit into one of our most-hallowed sporting clichés: He made his teammates better. On a squad of zeroes, the effect might be small; it wasn’t until this season that Al-Sadd won the Qatar Stars League with him, and he’s been hurt for much of the year anyway. But for Spain and Barcelona, his contribution was so immense it defined an era of the sport. Following Spain’s World Cup triumph in 2010, the team’s style, known as tiki-taka, appeared poised to sweep the world. Brendan Rodgers rode a couple of seasons of overachieving possession-based soccer at Swansea to the top job at Liverpool. Jürgen Klinsmann’s hire in 2011 as the U.S. men’s national team coach hinged on his promises to bring more possession play: “If you play Brazil or Argentina, you might play differently than maybe a country in CONCACAF, but it is a starting point if you say we want to start to keep possession, we want to start to dictate the pace of the game, we want to challenge our players to improve technically in order to keep the ball.” Results were mixed, we might charitably say. The chasm between original and imitators was never bridged. Teams such as Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan had sporadic success designing labyrinthine bunkers for Xavi and Andrés Iniesta to navigate during that 2008–12 run, but it was the development of more sophisticated pressing and counterpressing strategies that ultimately supplanted tiki-taka as the tactic du jour, largely because those schemes were the first to reliably beat it. The longest section of the tiki-taka Wikipedia page is about the strategies other teams developed to beat Spain and Barcelona , starting with the U.S. national team’s win over the Spanish in the 2009 Confederations Cup semifinal, Spain’s first defeat in 36 matches. Surprisingly, the list doesn’t include simply waiting them out. Not to take away from the achievement of Diego Simeone’s title-winning Atlético Madrid in 2014, but it’s no coincidence the all-consuming whirlwind unleashed by Xavi’s teams subsided just as age caught up to him. Instead of a stylistic revolution, tiki-taka turned out to be a complex exoskeleton constructed around his singular genius. Remove its pilot, or slow him down a crucial step or two, and what you were left with was a clunky and easily disrupted machine like the one eliminated before the knockout round of the 2014 World Cup. Barcelona adapted its tactics to play faster and has won four of the last five La Liga titles. Spain has clung harder to the style and, after a brilliant qualifying campaign, finally passed itself to death against the hosts during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Even Guardiola’s Manchester City doesn’t attempt what his Barcelona did with Xavi at the helm. The next step for Xavi, the obvious step almost since he turned professional, is coaching. He may start in Qatar, perhaps with Al-Sadd, perhaps eventually even taking over the country’s national side ahead of the 2022 World Cup. There may be other stops along the way, but the final destination feels inevitable: Barcelona. No one is more ingrained in the Barcelona way. Even in Qatar, he remained the club’s moral philosopher and an easy source for quotes on a range of Barcelona-adjacent subjects, from questioning the current status of its famed youth academy to piling slight after slight on Neymar for daring to leave for Paris Saint-Germain. The one constant to it all is a strict interpretation of what it means to play the Barcelona way. As he put it in his retirement announcement: “I love seeing the teams take the initiative on the field, play attacking football and return to the essence of what we all loved since our childhood days: football possession.” If, or when, he does get the Barcelona job, that dogma may be tested. Will he learn to be flexible? Or does he have a solution to the problem that has stymied the world since his peak: How do you play like Xavi without Xavi?"
Report: FBI Sent Undercover Agent to Meet With Papadopoulos During 2016 Campaign,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/fbi-agent-george-papadopoulos-trump-campaign-russia.html,"William Barr Is a Different Kind of Trump Surrogate In 2016, the FBI sent a trusted investigator posing as an academic’s assistant to ask Donald Trump aide George Papadopoulos about the Trump campaign’s links to Russia, the New York Times reported Thursday. The news of such a proactive step by the agency is likely to cause some Trump supporters to accuse the FBI of “spying” on Trump and his campaign in an effort to damage his chances of winning, as Trump himself has insisted in the past. But the effort can also be interpreted as a signal of how concerned the FBI was at the time about potential Russian inference in the election. The FBI became alarmed about that possibility in the summer of 2016 after Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had offered to help the Trump campaign by releasing the emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The Australian government alerted American officials once Wikileaks published that trove of hacked emails, and the FBI opened its Russia investigation in July 2016. According to the Times, the FBI decided to look into whether Papadopoulos had Russian contacts. During the investigation, the agency decided to also look into Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and Carter Page. The FBI then had Cambridge professor Stefan A. Halper, reportedly a longtime informant, reach out to Papadopoulos to set up a meeting in London to discuss a Mediterranean natural gas project. The FBI also sent along a trained agent, who had given her name as Azra Turk, to pose as Halper’s assistant. The two were meant to quiz Papadopoulos about any connection between the campaign and Russia, and Turk also met with Papadopoulos separately for drinks. Papadopoulos wrote in his book that when he met Turk in London in September, she began to immediately press him about the campaign’s connection to Russia. (British intelligence officials were also notified about the operation, according to the Times, but it’s unclear if they were at all involved.). He wrote that he met with both Turk and Halper the next day, and in a follow-up drink with Halper, the professor began immediately quizzing him about the hacked emails and Russia. Turk and Halper did not learn anything of significance from the effort, but Halper, a well-connected academic, continued his work with the FBI. He met repeatedly with Page and gradually became more closely connected to the Trump world. The FBI has said the agency carefully considered the seriousness of monitoring an active presidential campaign, according to the Times, and it was careful that word of the investigation should not reach the public. Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general, is investigating the FBI’s activities, including those involving Halper, before the 2016 election. Attorney General William Barr has said the results of that investigation could be completed in the next couple months. Support our journalism

"My cats only sleep outside, and I’m worried: pet advice from Beast Mode.",slate.com,Nick Greene,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/cats-sleep-outside-transition-inside.html,"My Mom’s Dog Despairs Each Morning I Can’t Walk Her. Should I Stop Doing It on Weekends? Two kittens bumbled into our backyard and our lives last summer, and what started out as my little project to make sure they got some food and got neutered—through our SPCA’s trap-and-release program—turned into something bigger. Now my husband and I have two cats. They’re socializing well and they come inside a lot, even to sit on the couch and snuggle with us. They’ve been to the vet and had all their shots and get monthly flea treatments. For now, they sleep in a little heated tent on our deck, which they took to immediately and treat as their home base. But I would like to transition them to being indoors more. We’re aiming to at least bring them inside at night to keep them safer and so they won’t have to deal with temperature extremes. Do you have any tips on making this transition a smooth one? We’re considering installing a cat flap to see if that makes them more comfortable. Would moving their tent inside as part of their move be a good idea? —Cats Under a Cold Tin Roof Dear Cats Under a Cold Tin Roof, Welcoming strange beings into your life is a scary proposition, so allow me to commend these cats for their bravery. Humans can be unpredictable and messy, but they’ve found two adoptees who possess great demeanors and a willingness to learn. It’s a perfect match. You and your husband deserve praise as well. The strays may have adopted you, but you’ve accepted the responsibility of keeping them healthy and safe with compassion and patience. By the sound of it, you’ve done a swell job so far. I’m sure the cats feel the same, even if they’re too busy glamping in their heated tent to tell you so. Be prepared to deal with two cranky and put-upon cats at first. If you feel totally ready to keep the cats under your roof at night, then, by all means, go for it. “It’s certainly safer for the cats to be indoors at night,” certified animal behaviorist Mikel Delgado says . “There’s more risk of injury and other wildlife [encounters] during the dark hours.” To habituate them to being inside, Delgado says it’s all about creating a welcoming environment that they will enjoy—especially since there will be more than one cat in the home. “Make sure there are enough resources for the cats to use,” she tells me. “That means multiple feeding dishes, multiple litter boxes, vertical space, things that they can climb, places to sleep.” The tent you’ve pitched is a clear example of the kindness you’ve shown to these cats, but you don’t have to restructure some of your own indoor living space to accommodate this edifice. If it creates needless clutter, feel free to keep it on the deck. The cats will deal. As with the tent, the cat flap isn’t necessary to facilitate a smooth transition. “I’m more of a cold-turkey person. Once they get used to the cat flap, great, but then that will have to change,” Delgado says. “If they truly want the cats indoors at night, then they should just rip the Band-Aid off.” In the long run, it will be less of a hassle than pitching a tent inside or punching a hole in your door. Speaking of hassles, be prepared to deal with two cranky and put-upon cats at first. “They’re going to protest for a few days because of the change of routine, but that won’t mean they won’t adjust,” Delgado says. It is key that you ignore this behavior, because they will interpret any response—even if it’s just telling them to shut up—as encouragement to meow and whine even more. “Cats are very good at manipulating humans,” Delgado says. And how. This is a big move, both for you and the cats, so now is the time to consider everything that this change in accommodations will entail. Because once you decide to upend their nighttime routine, it’s up to you to stay the course. “If these people have decided that this is the safest option for these cats,” Delgado says, “then they should just jump in and do it.” The move may be difficult initially, but if you get them on a routine and make them feel comfortable in their environment, then the cats should warm up to the new digs. They may stay outside all day, but they’ll be happy to call your house their home at night. They adopted you for a reason, after all. "
That Movie About Charlize Theron Falling for a Schlubby Seth Rogen Is Actually Pretty Feminist,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/long-shot-review-charlize-theron-seth-rogen-romcom-progressive.html,"Under the Silver Lake Is a Total Mess and Totally Worth It Like many rom-com heroines, Long Shot ’s Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) has an aspirational job, a glitzy wardrobe that makes zero sense for her salary, and an unwitting need for the right guy to come along, loosen her up, and inject some fun into her life. Unlike many rom-com heroines, Charlotte curses, has sex, occasionally wears dowdy pantsuits, and, most notably, throws even more of herself into her career at the end of the movie, to the absolute delight of her male partner, Fred (Seth Rogen). In Long Shot ’s world—as in ours—public-facing women are relentlessly scrutinized, and powerful ones are generally considered too intimidating to date. The film’s irresistible fantasy—and hopefully, increasingly, our reality—is that there are men who are perfectly content supporting their high-powered wives, just as women have been doing for their husbands for most of recorded history. Helmed by Jonathan Levine, who also directed Rogen in 50/50 and The Night Before , and based on a screenplay by Dan Sterling ( The Interview )and Liz Hannah ( The Post ), Long Shot fits neatly in the actor’s wheelhouse in most ways. It features a solid joke just about every minute—many of them about masturbation, pop culture, and Rogen’s character’s Jewishness. It also includes a getting-high sequence, unabashedly liberal politics, and more than a twinge of self-pity about Rogen’s honestly-pretty-good looks (more on this later). But Long Shot feels like something new, too—a brogressive rom-com that mixes inconvenient boners and aerodynamic cum with extensive observations about sexism and a rare romanticization of the male helpmate. The movie doesn’t get all its gender dynamics right, and an out-of-nowhere call for bipartisan cooperation feels like a ham-fisted insertion by a nervous studio exec. But all the way up to its own version of a happy ending, it’s a fresh, timely spin on the rom-com formula, the next step forward after the feminist strides in Rogen’s Neighbors movies and a possible new path for dude comedies that are no longer content to pretend that women don’t have our own stuff going on. Before it refers to the disparity in status and attractiveness between Charlotte and Fred, the “long shot” of the title describes the presidential prospects of Charlotte, the youngest secretary of state ever and a frequent target of ogling by conservative pundits. Charlotte serves a popular, numpty president (Bob Odenkirk) who became commander-in-chief by playing one on TV (his favorite line: “I’m not nuking a tsunami!”), and who has to be tricked into thinking her ideas are his to implement them. When her boss decides he’d rather pursue a movie career than seek reelection, Charlotte decides to throw her hat into the ring—and after a series of convolutions, hires as one of her speechwriters the unemployed firebrand journalist Fred, who she used to babysit 25 years ago. Charlotte and her team travel to nearly two dozen countries together as she attempts to sell an environmental deal that will make her a competitive candidate, and in such close-quartered conditions, the politico and the writer fall for each other’s idealism and accomplishments, even as they disagree on whether it’s OK to compromise to effect change. (Anyone still smarting from the intra-Democratic battles of 2016 should find some salve in this romance between Hot Hillary and a Bernie bro.) But when Charlotte wins the sitting president’s endorsement, her protective aide (June Diane Raphael) warns that the public won’t accept a model-esque woman with a schlub like Fred. Apparently the voters in this universe have never seen most movies, television shows, lots and lots of real-life couples—or simply don’t register that “mixed-attractiveness” relationships aren’t all that rare. Long Shot feels like something new—a brogressive rom-com. Rogen is as funny as he’s ever been, but it’s Theron who’s the standout. She makes the absurdities of Charlotte’s life, like being unable to eat skewered foods in public or “micro-napping” while standing with her eyes open, seem not only believable, but human. The movie has plenty of compassion for the thousand and one constraints Charlotte has to keep in mind at all times (don’t be “angry,” but don’t be “weak”), but what hits hardest are the moments when we see her breezily commanding leadership in action. In front of the cameras, she’s buttoned-up but learning how to open up (mostly through the jokes and autobiographical details Fred peppers into her speeches). But when she needs to get things done behind the scenes, she displays a surgical decisiveness, a treasure trove of wonky knowledge, and a no-bullshit matter-of-factness that’s impossible not to get a girl crush on. It’s the kind of nonpathologized portrayal of a woman taking charge that knocks you off your seat because you hadn’t realized how much you were missing it. I do wish we’d gotten to see Charlotte actually making deals, though— Long Shot would have you believe that being secretary of state is just jet-setting around the world, attending fancy parties, and tangoing with the prime minister of Canada (Alexander Skarsgard, in a hilarious sendup of his beefcake image).

The eleventh hour in a rom-com tends to be my least favorite, when the destined couple mope around for a few minutes before reuniting for the final time. But the one in Long Shot is particularly aggravating, largely contingent as it is on Rogen’s supposed hideousness. Rogen is clearly responding to one particular strain of the backlash against Knocked Up that pointed to the attractiveness gap between him and co-star Katherine Heigl—a criticism meant to draw attention to the ostensible sexism of the movie as well as of the industry at large . But the excessive focus on Fred’s everydude appearance—after such well-earned sympathy for the crap Charlotte puts up with every day—feels like, to put it in political-coverage terms, false balance. Fortunately, Long Shot soon remembers that Fred’s most lovable quality doesn’t have to be his looks. "
"The Angle: From Kavanaugh to Biden, What’s Really Changed?",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/kavanaugh-biden-barr-mayor-pete-vaccines-meeting-gorbachev.html,"A Republican Senator Gave the Best Explanation Yet of Why Mueller’s Report Doesn’t “Exonerate” Trump Two steps back: In the months since Christine Blasey Ford took her stand against Brett Kavanaugh, what’s really changed ? He made it to the Supreme Court, and Joe Biden, who’s mishandled sexual harassment allegations in his work and his life, is an early front-runner in the 2020 presidential race. Christina Cauterucci looks back on the thwarted hopes of the #MeToo movement and can’t help feeling “there’s some upper threshold to the amount of justice survivors can expect to see in this country.” Calm cop, bad cop: William Barr doesn’t have the bluster of some of Donald Trump’s other hires, and Lili Loofbourow argues that’s by design. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the attorney general maintained a calm, mildly condescending demeanor while working doggedly to make the president legally untouchable: “Barr’s composure was an inverse function of the legal acrobatics he was attempting.” Vax populi: If you spent time in the science-loving corners of social media this week, you may have heard that presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg initially botched his answer to a question about vaccinations. (He later changed his position.) Daniel Engber, however, argues that the mayor’s original response—that vaccinations should be mandatory, but medical, personal, and religious exceptions should be allowed unless there’s a public health crisis—is not so radical at all and, in fact, is perfectly reasonable. “Mikhail Sergeyevich, please allow me to explain myself”: Werner Herzog’s latest film is a documentary wherein he sits down with Mikhail Gorbachev (and other Cold War–era politicians) to paint a thorough picture of the Soviet leader’s life. Joshua Keating reviews the movie, which not only explores a subject fit for Herzog’s scope but also depicts “ a love story about Germany and Russia .” For fun: At last, a beaver emoji .

William Barr Is a Different Kind of Trump Surrogate,slate.com,Lili Loofbourow,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-donald-trump-calm-defense.html,"How Are We Supposed to Understand Brett Kavanaugh Now? Given his tendency to employ the colorful over the competent, it’s slightly surprising that Donald Trump’s taste in attorneys general has bypassed loudmouths like Rudy Giuliani in favor of small, precise men. Both Jeff Sessions and William Barr are notable for their unintimidating demeanor and for the skill with which they couch extreme ideology in the garb of conventional, calm lawyering. Perhaps this is the kind of person the president believes will accept his documented efforts to dictate terms to the Department of Justice. Or maybe his tendency to view the attorney general as his own personal lawyer, rather than America’s top law enforcement officer, led him to choose a type he thought he could dominate. It’s no secret that Trump considered Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from the Mueller probe—ethically, the bare minimum—a personal betrayal. (Trump felt the attorney general should have protected him, and Sessions’ failure to do so is one reason he’s no longer in the role.) In Barr, Trump has found an attorney general with hoary Republican bona fides who accepts Trump’s view and has developed a theory according to which Trump’s feelings not only matter more than the law, but should dictate it. Barr’s ideology is a fit, and so—for a TV president who prizes style over substance—is his stagecraft. Barr has developed a theory according to which Trump’s feelings not only matter more than the law, but should dictate it. Though stolid and undramatic, William Barr has proven himself an eager finger-pointer (singling out Rod Rosenstein, Robert Mueller, the media, and Trump’s opponents for particular blame) and an able advocate for the agitated president. That’s not his role, of course—or it shouldn’t be—but Barr keeps slipping into outright advocacy for the man he was theoretically supposed to consider indicting. Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to answer questions about the Mueller report, Barr made his allegiances obvious. Asked about Trump’s remarks excoriating people who “flip” on the wrongdoers above them, Barr took the remarkable step of ventriloquizing the president’s defense. “I think what the president’s lawyers would say,” he said (as if he weren’t acting as one), “is that the president’s statements about flipping are quite clear and express and uniformly the same, which is by ‘flipping,’ he meant succumbing to pressure on unrelated cases to lie and compose in order to get lenient treatment.” (Carried away by this role-playing, Barr would eventually go on to ventriloquize not only Trump’s lawyers, but Trump himself.) Barr isn’t only there to translate Trump’s mafia-speak into legitimate legalese. The attorney general, who has a long history of doing all he can to maximize executive power, appears to be on a mission to make presidents even more legally untouchable than they already are. His strategy isn’t confrontational; it’s staid in ways that camouflage the extraordinary deference he’s showing to the president’s moods. Barr has already argued that making a determination of corrupt intent requires a deep and sympathetic study of the president’s grievances. He accordingly channels the president’s sulks just as he explains his slang: Barr explained Trump was “frustrated and angered” by public concern that he might have done questionable things against the national interest—like invite the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails , hire a compromised foreign agent as national security adviser , or give sensitive Israeli intelligence to the Russians. Barr’s calculus accords the president’s frustration so much legal weight that Trump’s “witch hunts” and “Angry Democrats” and dangled pardons and attempted firings of the special counsel are, all things considered, more than reasonable. By contrast, he characterizes public alarm over the aforementioned activities as not only unreasonable but evidence of how unfairly the president has been treated . “As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates,” Barr explained while defending the president’s outrage in his press conference before releasing the Mueller report. “At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability.” If Barr extends to the president a therapist’s compassion, he seems to find Mueller, his longtime friend and colleague, both incomprehensible and incorrect. “I’m not really sure of his reasoning,” Barr said when he was asked whether he agreed with Mueller’s reasons, outlined in his report, for not offering a definite pronouncement on whether prosecution was appropriate. “I really could not recapitulate his analysis, which is one of the reasons in my March 24 letter I simply stated the fact that he did not reach a conclusion and didn’t try to put words in his mouth.” To sum up: Barr not only refused to publish the summaries Mueller himself wrote for the public, but he also wrote up such a misleading summary that the famously taciturn special counsel formally objected, asking again that his own summaries be released. And then , having substituted his own text for Mueller’s, Barr demurely suggested he hadn’t wanted to put words in Mueller’s mouth. This priggish sleight of hand is Barr’s wheelhouse. He launders impropriety with a functionary’s demeanor and a spin doctor’s acumen. In Wednesday’s hearing, Barr’s professional reserve became a kind of smoke screen for repeated swipes at the special counsel. He suggested, for instance, that Mueller should have “pulled up” (whatever that means) if he thought he wasn’t in a position to pronounce: “I think that if he felt that he shouldn’t go down the path of making a traditional prosecutive decision, he shouldn’t have. That was the time to pull up.” This curious statement omits Mueller’s clear explanation that his decision not to charge was not because prosecution wasn’t appropriate, but because it wasn’t up to him to make the next move. The next move, Mueller clearly notes, is up to Congress. Barr disagrees with this. “I’m the captain,” he said of the report. “This is my baby.” Barr’s composure was an inverse function of the legal acrobatics he was attempting. That phrasing was pretty weird, but on the whole, Barr’s conduct was calm, courteous, and slightly condescending. It was professional and meant to reassure. He framed extraordinary claims as if they were simple common sense, peppering his remarks with obviously s and looking for all the world like the put-upon bureaucrat. He would not concede that the president’s conduct was concerning or wrong or unbefitting, repeatedly insisting that it was “constitutional.” He characterized concerns about Russian efforts to compromise Trump’s campaign as overblown while noting that the phenomenon of foreign governments targeting Americans is rather commonplace, even generic. Under duress, he admitted that a presidential campaign should call the FBI if thus approached, but seemed unwilling to condemn or even disapprove of Trump’s campaign for failing to do so. Even Barr’s petty moments were muted. Yes, he called Mueller’s letter “snitty,” but spared Mueller the insult by proposing that someone else had written it. (This sly little suggestion does double work, of course: It supports his earlier claim that he didn’t know what Mueller thought. Anyone on his staff might have written that letter!) When Sen. Richard Blumenthal observed that Mueller’s letter was a truly exceptional intervention—“an extraordinary act, a career prosecutor rebuking the attorney general of the United States, memorializing it in writing, right? I know of no other instance of that happening”—a nettled Barr replied pedantically: “Well, I don’t consider Bob at this stage a career prosecutor. He’s had a career as a prosecutor.” This level of self-control, unusual in Trump’s circles, has advantages. Barr’s composure was an inverse function of the legal acrobatics he was attempting: He posits, for instance, that the investigation was illegitimate because the president wasn’t indicted. It follows that obstruction is impossible! Since Mueller didn’t pronounce on the president’s criminality, anything the president did to stop the inquiry was fair (Barr likes the phrase “the exercise of his constitutional duties”). This is the kind of wackadoodle argument one has to read several times through in order to absorb its astonishing implications; it seems to suggest that law enforcement may only pursue inquiries it knows to be true while ignoring that the pursuit is how we discover truth. This legal theory of time travel is presented as sensible and self-evident. It’s boring to blame our reality TV president for nudging the government toward reality TV shenanigans, but we work with the gifts we have. Inflammatory theatrics are Trump’s one proven skill—he likes to say his picks are “straight out of central casting.” He’s not wrong: They have tended to be larger-than-life and unconcerned about things like respectability (Anthony Scaramucci, Steve Bannon, Omarosa). Even Trump acolytes who care about such things—like Brett Kavanaugh, or the Lindsey Graham of yore—have sacrificed their probity to put on the kind of big angry show Trump loves. But in William Barr, Trump has found a new sort of character, to fill a new sort of need. Reality TV is famously scripted to maximize drama. The fights and tantrums tend to work if you squint, even if you know they’re manufactured. They attract an audience. But depending on what you’re going for, sometimes you don’t want too much attention. If you want a clean way to make the really giant twists seem boring, even routine, what you need is a drama minimizer: someone who can pass off chaos as bureaucracy. Or obstruction as constitutional duty. Or one man’s feelings as American law. For that, Donald Trump has William Barr. Support our journalism

My Husband Secretly Loves Bisexual Porn. Does That Mean He’s Into Guys?,slate.com,Stoya and Rich Juzwiak,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/husband-likes-bisexual-gay-porn-sex-advice.html,"I Think of Truly, Truly Terrible Things to Climax During Sex Dear How to Do It, My husband and I have been married for 16 years. We have sex about once a month, after kids and lots of life stuff, and that’s fine for me. I think he’d like a little more, but he’s seemed OK with our current pace. I know he masturbates pretty frequently—he goes to a particular room, and I know what’s up—but I try to respect his privacy. Recently, I was cleaning in that particular room and I brushed his laptop, which was not password-protected. You probably know where this is going: He had left some porn up on the screen. The thing is, it was bisexual porn. And the guys were definitely the focal point of this particular one from what I could tell. I was sort of shocked and I only looked for a second before I shut the laptop and left the room. My husband has never mentioned a sexual interest in men in any way, and I never would have guessed he might have one. This ate at me for a couple weeks before I finally mentioned it to him in a clumsy way. He turned bright-red and said it was just porn, nothing more. I should have let it go, but I pressed, and he eventually said he prefers bisexual porn but would never want to try anything with a guy in person. I asked him if he would if I gave him my blessing. He seemed super flustered and said he didn’t know. He denied he’s bisexual and said it’s just curiosity, but I could tell he was a little unsure. He seemed happy to change the subject and I finally let it go, but I feel really uneasy about what I found out. He would die before talking about this with a couples’ therapist. I also have no idea if I’d be OK with letting him explore, but I definitely can’t just forget about this. What should I do? —Not Snooping Stoya : So, some fantasies are just fantasies. Sometimes people fantasize about things they would never want to actually happen. Rich : Yeah, and porn can kind of tease out those very fantasies but also keep them at bay. Stoya : That too. Rich : Could it be possible that the fact it is so distant is what makes it hot? Like, it’s hot precisely because it’s so removed from his experience? Stoya : Definitely possible. Rich : All of which is to say, this isn’t necessarily a sounding of the alarm.Maybehe’s just bored with the aesthetics of straight porn and wanted to branch out. Plenty of straight women are into gay porn, which depicts scenarios that they are excluded from by definition. Stoya : Absolutely. Or he could want to kiss another dude, on the penis. Rich : He very well might. One thing that I have to say, even if it’s ultimately immaterial, is that I don’t believe this instance of porn discovery was as innocent as the letter writer makes it out to be. “I was cleaning in that particular room and I brushed his laptop.” Please. I think she was snooping. That’s probably neither here nor there, but let’s not bullshit a bullshitter. Stoya : Sometimes, I think I take our letters at face value too often. Rich : It’s because you’re pure of heart. I’m the cynic. Stoya : It’s good to have roles. Porn-watching habits are not statements of a desire to act. Rich : It’s true. But maybe, ya know, it’s worth acknowledging that there may be a violation of privacy afoot. A minor one. Ideally, these things would be out in the open in a relationship, so I also kind of feel like as long as it isn’t devastating, whatever it takes to get to the truth is ultimately OK. Stoya : Yeah, I was mostly thinking how sad it is that they can’t just, like, talk about this. Rich : I felt for the guy. He seemed really shaken—and this is from her perspective. Stoya : He might be dealing with a lot of shame or fear. Rich : For sure. I know that this is not a fashionable thing to say and could be contradicted with a man cave full of counterexamples, but it’s hard for straight guys in some ways. “Straight” is such a narrow path for a lot of guys, and deviating from it means calling into question your entire identity. This kind of thing can be worldview-altering. Stoya : I’m wondering if there are ways that our writer can be cautious with her husband while satisfying her own need to address this further. Rich : Like if she put on bisexual porn for their next sex session? A way to kind of illustrate her acceptance? Stoya : That might be the worst option! I’m imagining the guy turning into an actual turtle and retracting his head into his upper chest out of embarrassment. But at the end she says she definitely can’t just forget about this. Which leads me to believe she’s going to want to address his taste for bisexual porn again in the future. Rich : Right. So how to do that delicately? Stoya : Displays of acceptance might be part of that, but I think she should proceed slowly. Rich : Yes, and you know, this is still recent, so he’s still getting used to the idea of someone knowing his secret. So maybe his wife’s discovery didn’t yield an immediate exhale moment, but that could be coming as he becomes more comfortable with what all of this means. Which is to say that these conversations could go better in the future. Maybe a good way to approach this is for her to make herself available to talk about this without pushing. Ask him if he’s comfortable talking about it, instead of staging a confrontation every time. Stoya : Or sharing some of her own undisclosed sexual interests if she has any. Sometimes that kind of vulnerability goes a long way to putting a partner at ease. Rich : That’s a great point. Does she have any bi-curiosity herself? Stoya : An interest in toes? A desire for latex? Rich : It would be useful to really understand his sexuality. If he is indeed bi, then in theory this poses about as much threat as if he were into redheads but married a brunette. Just another element of his taste palate, you know? Stoya : Totally. There’s no reason to panic, and porn-watching habits are not statements of a desire to act. Rich : But ideally, as the letter writer hints, he’d be allowed to explore this if he were really interested in it. I know it’s a big ask, but life is short. Seems a waste to go through it wanting but never getting your hands on some dick. Stoya : I think she could do some thinking on what she would need to feel comfortable. Boundaries about sleepovers? No green boxer shorts? Or, you know, deep conversations about what “ fluid bonding ” means so she’s prepared in case he does want to explore and expresses that? Rich : Yes. It’s a big idea to get used to. I totally understand why people use monogamy as a security blanket, but allowing him to experience this sex he’s potentially interested in and presumably never has had would be a great gift to him. Stoya : She might find she enjoys compersion. Rich : Yes—and/or participating. Stoya : Ooooh, yes, that too. I think, just remember their love and trust for each other, nurture that, and be careful with each other if they decide to explore. Rich : I agree. If these conversations instill a sense of fear in him, there’s a good chance he’ll have a fight-or-flight response and then they’ll be no further along than they were in the first place. Stoya : Definitely. So use plenty of caution and be gentle."

Palantir Said It Had Nothing to Do With ICE Deportations. New Documents Seem to Tell a Different Story.,slate.com,April Glaser,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/documents-reveal-palantir-software-is-used-for-ice-deportations.html,"The Surprising Way Bodycams Can Keep Police Officers From Helping People Palantir Technologies, the $20 billion data-analytics firm founded by Peter Thiel with the help of $2 million from the CIA’s venture capital firm, has never been shy about its work with governments and law enforcement. But in December, when it was reported that the company renewed a $38 million contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Palantir sent a statement to the New York Times that appeared to distance the company from the Trump administration’s detention, deportation, and family-separation policies. Palantir stressed that it works with the Homeland Security Investigations unit of ICE, not Enforcement and Removal Operations, which “is responsible for interior civil immigration enforcement, including deportation and detention of undocumented immigrants,” the statement read. “We do not work for E.R.O.” That might be the case, but a close read of recently released ICE documents reveals that Palantir has been far more involved with the detention and deportation functions than previously implied. The May 2017 documents, which were obtained through Freedom of Information Act litigation led by the American Immigration Council in partnership with other immigrant rights groups and published last week in the Intercept , come from the Homeland Security Investigations unit. One particular seven-page report, titled “Unaccompanied Alien Children Human Smuggling Disruption Initiative,” explains the formation of a 90- to 120-day program targeting smugglers who help unaccompanied minors cross the border into the United States. The document outlines a plan for “identification, investigation, and arrest of human smuggling facilitators, including, but not limited to, parents and family members.” Once an unaccompanied minor is located by an ICE investigation agent, the document instructs the agent to log the “arrival in the Investigative Case Management (ICM) system.” The advocacy group Mijiente, which has been tracking Palantir and other tech companies’ ties to ICE, found the name of the Palantir software in the document, which it described in a blog post Thursday. ICM is a system built by Palantir, funded initially by a $41 million contract with ICE in 2014. With the ICM system, immigration agents are provided access to intelligence from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and other law enforcement agencies, in addition to information like a subject’s criminal record and work history. “When an unaccompanied minor comes to the U.S. and goes to a shelter, various departments help find a sponsor for the child to take them out of custody and allow them to do be united with their families,”Mijente’s Jacinta Gonzalez told me in an interview. Previously, immigrants would be able to come forward and claim their child, be reunited, and then go through the immigration process. But under the program listed in the documents, ICE appears to have been conducting background checks on parents claiming children. This, according to Gonzalez, deters family members from claiming children, which has caused them to be detained for longer periods of time. “What these documents show is that as ICE was starting this program to try to prosecute and arrest people, and the key place where that information was stored and communicated to be able to prosecute them was through the ICM and Palantir’s information sharing,” says Gonzalez. According to the ICE documents, after an unaccompanied child is apprehended, law enforcement border teams are instructed to check their database and contact suspected family members or sponsors. If applicable, the documents instruct agents to then “seek charges against the individual(s) and administratively arrest the subjects and anybody encountered during the inquiry who is out of status.” A 2017 letter from a coalition of immigrant rights groups to oversight officials at the Department of Homeland Security detailed how ICE and Customs and Border Control “are using unaccompanied child asylum seekers as bait to prosecute and deport their parents.” In a statement provided to the Intercept last week, ICE said that in the course of the operation, 443 people without documentation were arrested. Only 35 of those arrests were due to criminal activity. While the specific program detailed in the documents that describe how children crossing the border were used to arrest their family members appears to not be ongoing, the process of verifying the immigration status of sponsors is still active, according to Gonzalez. The Investigative Case Management software is not limited to identifying families of unaccompanied minors. The Palantir software is used in range of investigations with DHS and ICE, providing agents with the ability to search across government databases, according to a 2017 report in the Intercept. Palantir did not respond to a request for comment. Over the past year, tech workers across the U.S. have been calling on their employers to sever ties with Immigration and Custom Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol. Last summer, hundreds of Microsoft employees called on CEO Satya Nadella to end the company’s contract with ICE. Hundreds of Salesforce employees likewise last summer called on CEO Mark Benioff to cancel the company’s contract with CPB. This led the CEOs of both companies to make statements about how they don’t support the separation of families at the border. But Palantir, which owes its existence to government investment, is a different breed of tech company. As CEO Alex Karp has said , Palantir is “proud that we’re working with the U.S. government.” Support our journalism

Baltimore’s Mayor Is Brought Down by a Series of Self-Published Children’s Books,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/baltimores-mayor-pugh-is-brought-down-by-a-series-of-self-published-childrens-books.html,"Trump Changes His Mind, Says Mueller Shouldn’t Testify Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh’s bizarre tenure in office came to an end Thursday, when she resigned amid a cloud of scandal and scrutiny over, of all things, a self-published series of children’s books. Scandal erupted in March when the Baltimore Sun reported that the sale of Pugh’s “Healthy Holly” books raised serious ethical and legal questions. The books themselves are harmless, featuring a young black protagonist Holly and positive themes of healthy eating and exercise, but it’s the whopping $700,000 the series netted Pugh that caused problems. In the six weeks since the story broke, the 69-year-old Democrat has faced raids of her home and City Hall office, and has taken an extended leave of absence from office as the stories of apparent impropriety continued to pile up. The number of copies sold by Pugh is a staggering haul for 99 percent of authors, much less a self-published one, where sales can often range in the hundreds to low thousands. The extraordinary success of the books authored by someone holding public office raised questions about who, exactly, was buying the books—and why. It turns out the books were bought in large chunks by entities that had business before the government that Pugh had influence over—first in the statehouse and then in the mayor’s office. The University of Maryland Medical System, for instance, paid Pugh $500,000 for an order of 100,000 books. The order was filled in installments of 20,000 beginning in 2011. “Joseph Cohen, vice president of Kromar Printing in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said his company was paid between $13,000 and $15,000 for each of the 20,000-book orders it completed,” the Washington Post reports . That means Pugh was clearing close to $85,000 per batch of books depending on shipping and other associated costs. At the time, Push was a state senator and also on the hospital network’s board. In the statehouse, Pugh was on a committee that provided some funding to the hospital network. Kaiser Permanente also paid Pugh, who was elected mayor in 2016, more than $100,000 for another 20,000 copies. In 2017, the health care provider landed a $48 million contract with the city of Baltimore. The Associated Black Charities ponied up another $80,000 for 10,000 copies. With federal and state investigations digging deeper into the financial mess, Pugh submitted her resignation Thursday. “I am sorry for the harm I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and the credibility of the office of the mayor,” she said in the statement. “Baltimore deserves a mayor that can move our great city forward.”"

How bodycams affected one former police officer’s job.,slate.com,Katie Miller,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/body-worn-cameras-police-officers-discretion.html,"The Decadelong Humiliation of Runner Caster Semenya It was a routine traffic stop. A Subaru Forester blew past a stop sign in northwest D.C., and I pulled it over. But the driver, a middle-aged woman with an infant in the back seat, seemed shifty. “Good afternoon, ma’am. My name is Officer Miller. May I please see your license, registration, and proof of insurance?” “I don’t have my license on me,” she blurted. “No problem.” I pulled my notebook and pen out of my back pocket and handed it to her. “I can look your license up in the system. Please write down your name and date of birth.” The driver didn’t reach for my notebook. Instead, she reached for her purse and said, “I’m sorry. I just lied to you.” She handed me her license—two years expired. I was supposed to arrest her. I looked at the grocery bags on the floor and then the child, wide-eyed, my red and blue lights splashing across his hairless head. Violating protocol, I asked the woman to park the car and call a friend to pick her up. In five minutes, she was gone. That traffic stop took place at the tail end of 2015. I couldn’t have gotten away with that decision today. I didn’t know it then, but the era of “nothing to see here” and “keep it moving, folks” was coming to an end. A year earlier, Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri. Amid calls for increased police accountability, a prominent reform that took root was body-worn cameras for officers. Not long after that traffic stop, I was wearing one too. Seemingly overnight, keeping my job meant doing everything by the book. At first, I loved it—the impartial third party affixed to my chest. I could review video when I forgot something a witness told me, letting me include extra details in my reports at the end of the shift. The footage squashed false complaints at a time when it felt like everybody hated the police. I watched my colleagues speak more respectfully to citizens and fellow officers. But the new system wasn’t without its downsides. My footage was subject to review by my supervisors, who could punish violations of our general orders, no matter how petty. Body cameras provided a piece of evidence shown to judges, juries, and, of course, defense attorneys, who could now pick apart both my recorded voice and my testimony at trial. And it was a public record the mayor sometimes released to local news outlets when there was a use-of-force incident. Seemingly overnight, keeping my job meant doing everything by the book. And seemingly overnight, the technology proliferated. Before Ferguson, there were only a couple dozen police departments piloting body-worn cameras. Today, half of the country’s 18,000 police departments have them. The change was sweeping, and it was fast. Part of this is because the perceived benefits of body-worn cameras are obvious—citizens and officers behave better in the presence of a camera. Yet studies do not present a clear picture of their effectiveness. According to some , a bodycam program is correlated with a reduction in civilian complaints against officers as well as use-of-force incidents. But a study conducted on the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, where I worked, found no meaningful change at all in these statistics.* Regardless of their broader efficacy, my colleagues and I adapted our behavior to preserve our relationship with members of the community, even as body cameras forced an unfamiliar formality with them. Gone were the days of being able to tell a mom to park her Subaru. I made fewer traffic stops. I spent less time patrolling on foot. If I discovered a homeless person urinating in public, the video forced me to fine him, arrest him, or violate general orders by not recording the interaction. I used to pop into a market on New Hampshire Avenue and holler at Mike, the owner, who gave me the latest news from the block. Technically, I should have pressed “record” the moment he indicated there was criminal activity underfoot, like people blocking the sidewalk in front of his business. For fans of The Wire , a television show about politics, police, and crime in Baltimore, my dilemma may ring familiar. In most American cities, it’s unlawful to consume alcohol in public—an ordinance that burdens both the police who have to enforce it and people in low-income neighborhoods, where the addicted and unemployed sit on stoops and at street corners, passing Mad Dog 20/20 or Colt 45 back and forth. Thus, an official explained in one episode , drinking from a brown paper bag came to be a gentlemen’s agreement. By concealing the beverage, police weren’t obligated to address it and folks could enjoy their beverages on a hot summer day without interruption. It didn’t make drinking in public lawful; it provided a workaround for police and citizens who agreed it was frivolous. Body-worn cameras had the reverse impact of the brown paper bag. Whereas the brown bag gave officers permission to look the other way, the body-worn camera was a third party making certain we didn’t. So, bodycams may have made it easier to hold bad cops accountable for their actions, but they also have the effect of holding citizens strictly accountable for theirs. I did what I could to preserve community policing, but when I was called to people’s homes for family disputes, it was particularly challenging. Often, I found, people call police because they want someone to listen to them. They don’t necessarily want anybody locked up. They’re inviting a third party to a matter that overwhelms them. I found this most common with single mothers dealing with rebellious children. Before body-worn cameras, I was happy to listen fully to their account of events, describe civil and criminal recourses, and take their preferences into account when deciding whether an arrest was prudent. If a mother told me her child had broken something of hers in a heated argument, we could talk candidly about her safety and whether a police intervention was the best strategy to address the problem Since the adoption of body cameras, the law is the law. If a person described being the victim of a crime while I was interviewing them, I was obligated to take police action. I once interrupted a mother who called 911 on her son, pointed to the camera on my chest, and said, “If you’re about to report a crime, we have a duty to apply for a warrant for his arrest.” Her son was a young man of color without a criminal history. She was unharmed but frustrated. And there was a hole in the drywall that could have been punched in. Whether it became evidence that her son committed a crime was entirely dependent upon what she chose to say next. She nodded, suppressing the mouthful she had rehearsed before I had even arrived, understanding the discretion I had given her. We stood looking at one another for a moment—the two of us, skirting a system. Even if the benefits of body-worn cameras are disputed , the technology is likely here to stay. Once they are outfitted with them, police officers generally believe the pros outweigh the cons. Citizens are supportive of them. Though it made community policing more difficult for me, with clever communication, I could work around it—I could build the trust that it, ironically, was intended to foster. That’s because I’m confident good cops will always find a way to be good cops. And as much as I hope it spells change for the bad apples, that conclusion is far from foregone. As I wrapped up on the scene with the mother who called 911, I asked, “Is there anything else I can do for you, ma’am?” She said, “No, I guess not.” As I turned to leave, she went out of her way to add, “Thank you.” My department’s motto was: “We are here to help.” When I left the department last year, it struck me how much harder that mission had become.

Already a member? Sign in here. Danny: yeah the LW seems a little bit … blasé about that? Nicole: He seems lax, not abusive Danny: “if we had the kids six days a week instead of three, i’d end it” Nicole: which is a lot easier to work with And if having a big difficult convo doesn’t work, marriage definitely won’t Also, have you attempted to talk about if/how YOU are allowed to be a less lax person in their lives? Signing up to be the bitch doesn’t sound great either Danny: right! my take is that she’s erred on the side of just staying totally uninvolved for fear of seeming like she’s putting her oar in or trying to take the place of the kids’ mom but if you have lived together for over a year and plan on getting married, you definitely have a stake in this family you’re, if not a parent, at least part of a co-parenting team, right? Nicole: Right! The living together for over a year thing AND the impending wedding seem like this is the perfect opportunity to say “hey, let’s talk about my role as a parental figure, and also our philosophy around raising kids.” Danny: yes! and that’s exactly the tone you should take Nicole: which everyone should do before marrying ANYONE if they plan on having kids Danny: yes! and I hadn’t even considered the question of whether or not the LW wants to have kids with her fiancé so that’s also worth talking about first especially because she doesn’t really say anything about the kids besides “they’re not disciplined enough” Nicole: Right! No particular affection Danny: which definitely sounds TRUE, but also makes me worry she hasn’t been able to develop her own relationship with them, even if it’s just of the sort of “friendly aunt-like person” variety Nicole: She says she loves them, but it’s not coming off super warm here Right Danny: I would say do not get married unless and until you feel reasonably confident that you and your husband are at least on the same chapter, if not the same exact page, about child-rearing together and if you’re still feeling like “things are fine but ONLY because the kids spend half the week somewhere else, if we had to take them on full-time i’d end it” I think you should not marry him! that feels like a big enough qualification that you would be signing up for a lifetime of likely frustration and alienated affection Nicole: Yep. Process it to the ground, get everything on the table, and make it an absolute must for marriage Danny: right! and you don’t have to make it a DEMAND just acknowledge you’ve both left this pretty big issue mostly unaddressed so far Nicole: This is a v logical step Danny: and it’s time to figure out how to become a parenting team, not just a couple and also maybe find ways to spend a little one-on-one time with both your stepkids so you have a sense of what they’re like and what kind of relationship you can establish with them Nicole: And, if the convo is good, that convo should expand to include the kids a bit 3 and 7 are super young, but if things are going to change, prepare them for it Danny: yeah that is part of why I wanted your read here—what kind of discipline is (broadly) appropriate for 3-year-olds? Nicole: Yes! timeouts, basically Danny: like, i picture a lot of careful explaining and like “here are your two options: do you want to brush your teeth first or put on your jammies first?” kind of stuff Nicole: Natural consequences if they’re safe Yep, that’s pretty much how it goes! Danny: and maybe your stepkids’ mom could potentially be helpful here? assuming you have a cordial relationship which is maybe assuming too much Nicole: There is a lot of missing detail here in general, I fear Danny: that’s never stopped me from filling in all the detail myself with wildly confident brush strokes! a reader: three sentences, bare Nicole: Lolo possibly they are Russian spies! Danny: me, a master of interpolation, shading, and chiaroscuro: yes … like me you had your heart broken by a british stranger in 2003, then again in 2005 … you never stick to what’s on your grocery list … you are full of secret contempt for others you disguise as affableness etc etc"
"With Smarter Living, the NYT is making an old bet on service journalism.",slate.com,Shannon Palus,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/nyt-smarter-living-section-service-journalism-financial-bet.html,"Hate-Filled Letter Posted Online Claims to Be From Synagogue Shooting Suspect I have been thinking a lot about what to say no to in my life. Second dates with people who are just fine, a new maxi dress that is cute but expensive, and a day hike that would take longer to travel to than to do have all gotten the boot as of late. That’s thanks to the words, “if it’s not a ‘hell yeah,’ it’s a ‘no,’ ” which have been stuck in my mind like they’re on a Post-It Note. The quote is from entrepreneur Derek Sivers , but it didn’t come to me via his book “Anything You Want,” nor did I hear in one of his advice videos or on a “Monday Motivation” edition of a podcast , or even on Pinterest . Those are all places it’s appeared, but I first read it in the New York Times—and not in an interview about Sivers’ company, but in an earnest newsletter entry about how to make decisions. The newsletter also references a study suggesting that many people who perceive themselves as too assertive are not perceived that way by others, to assure readers that if they do opt for “no’s” they probably won’t come across as assholes. The self-help-y soundbite might seem unusual for the paper of record, but it’s part of a strategy that’s proven successful. The New York Times has been on a bit of a hot streak financially speaking , a trend that has been at least partly attributed to the boost in digital subscribers in the months after Donald Trump’s election . While the “Trump Bump” leveled off midway through 2017, the paper’s subscription base has continued to grow, in part thanks to growing initiatives in lifestyle-oriented areas, including Smarter Living—the Times’ central hub of how-to’s, which includes the newsletter where I found advice on how and when to say no. The section does very well: Its weekly newsletter has 360,000 subscribers and is opened by a vast majority of those people (80 percent), Digiday reported in June of last year. A full third of the most saved articles on the paper’s app so far that year were Smarter Living stories. Spend a couple hours reading these Smarter Living originals, and the world becomes a series of problems and answers of varying levels of helpfulness. Jealous? Here’s how to get around it . Anxious? “ Talk therapy is rarely a bad thing ,” says a source. Biking in the winter? Here are five cheap(ish) things you can buy. Some of the advice is strikingly pat. Want to live like a successful entrepreneur? Wake up at 6:27 a.m . each morning. Need to “ save a few bucks ”? “Cut out nonsocial eating out.” Wondering how to cope with emotional downs of participating in a capitalist economy? Build a failure resume ! Some of it is surprisingly useful, deep dives into corners of the world that most of us experience, but rarely think about so carefully. Headed to a party? Here is a long packet of information on how to speak to people. Which is all to say: It’s service journalism—reported advice that basically attempts to help you live your best life. This has long been a staple of women’s magazines, BuzzFeed listicles, and WebMD. What’s it doing alongside in-depth, nuanced, and newsy reporting? In part, it’s keeping the Times afloat. Smarter Living evolved out of a bid for both money and clicks, part of the paper’s strategy to double digital revenue to total $800 million by 2020, as WWD notes . That strategy includes other advice services like Cooking , Wirecutter (disclosure: my former employer), and a new parenting section , none of which are primarily news-based. The Smarter Living vertical began as a “module on the homepage” in the summer of 2016, WWD reported , serving as a magnet for the service journalism that was already appearing elsewhere in the Times. The landing page still pulls much of its advice from other sections, like the magazine , Food and Drink , and Style . But today, Smarter Living has also evolved into wholly original content, including a weekly newsletter, helmed by Tim Herrera, an editor with a background in social media and growth, a chatty and informal voice, and a cabal of staffers and freelancers. (In a piece for Nieman Lab, Herrera said that he gets between a dozen and 200 cold pitches per day.) This has long been a staple of women’s magazines, BuzzFeed listicles, and WebMD. What’s it doing alongside in-depth, nuanced, and newsy reporting? As it gets harder and harder to make money in media (and some of those service-journalism staples shutter ), building a how-to station inside of the Times makes sense. Combined with money-earning affiliate links on any advice that involves making a purchase (a strategy that many digital publishers, including Slate, have recently deployed) this type of journalism is almost always apolitical, caters to a universal logic, and rarely digs into profound quandaries that could alienate readers. As Digiday notes , this makes it a safe option for advertisers. At the same time, there’s nothing that new about supplementing the Times’ hard-hitting reporting with lighter fare. In the late ’70s, the paper launched a Living section, and then a Home section, which it framed in similar terms to today’s forays: “The Times wants its own to be unique, to have the best graphics, to be the most informative, serviceable and innovative and above all, the liveliest,” said publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger at the time. “Our aim is to create an authoritative voice—the way we have tried to do in other critical fields, such as theater, architecture, music, ballet, art and food.” The authoritative voice in the ’70s was similar to today’s Smarter Living—it was primarily occupied with the minutia of self-improvement. In digging through the archives to read a recurring feature called “Home Clinic,” I learn the life hack of turning down your thermostat during the day to save energy , and a tip on how to remove a broken bulb from its socket ( use a bar of soap !). In a June 22, 1977 edition of the Living section, I read about a new trend: Fresh vegetables are suddenly “in” and can be found at farmers markets. There’s a column with questions about cooking, including such small queries as where to find “corn flour” (it’s just the British word for “cornstarch”). There’s even the kind of commerce fare that I’d previously figured was spurred by the world of online shopping and affiliate links: a list ( listicle , if you will) ranking food processors based on some light testing, and a chart comparing the merits of various store credit cards. Food processors from the 1970s are not relevant to my life, but reading about them invokes in me a similar feeling to reading service journalism today: It’s comforting, akin to staring into a well-organized closet. That there is a correct way to do something as mundane as unscrewing the jagged remains of a lightbulb or as becoming an extrovert at parties is comforting, even if it won’t always work as seamlessly as advertised. This strategy for luring readers, as a report on the paper’s future published in 2017 noted, “succeeded brilliantly.” Which is why the paper is trying to replicate it now, in the digital age. While the particulars of consumer tech and home thermostats have certainly evolved—today you’ll be advised to get a smart thermostat—the ever-enduring readership for more instructions, more recipes, more tips and quotes, even if they are sometimes re-runs, reveals just how reliable telling readers the correct way to do things can be."
Choosing restaurants from the outside: tips from restauranteurs.,slate.com,Chason Gordon,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/choosing-restaurant-street-tips-food-experts.html,"You Can Hate Sarah Michelle Gellar’s “Mug Cakes” All You Like. I’ll Eat Them. Standing face to façade with a restaurant while deciding whether to commit is the speed dating of the food world. The eatery’s sign flickers at us hopefully, trying to grab our attention without desperately saying, “If you ate here, you’d be full by now.” The menu tries a little sweet talk—promising “house made” dishes “grilled to perfection” and “drizzled” with something that came from a nearby farm, they swear. And the ambiance does everything in its power to convince us through the window that here, in this comfortable, flatteringly lit assortment of tables and chairs, we’ll eat a good meal—if only we’d just come inside. We suitors, on the other side of things, have our own prejudices regarding the dance of culinary seduction. Many look for flowery menus and rustic buildings filled with happy, eating people; the brazen may even step just inside to examine the atmosphere more fully, scanning coldly past the humanity of the host to spy, ideally, our double sitting at a table. I find myself spouting off overconfident reasons why a restaurant looks good to my very patient friends. “That place serves teriyaki and burgers,” I announce. “The burgers will be terrible.” Or, “Ooh, it has a flora of restaurant guide stickers on the window. That must be tasty.” Big lines, cool lighting, an ethnic restaurant that actually has people of that ethnicity eating there—there are numerous signals many of us look out for. But are any of these tactics actually effective? Is there a hard and fast way to avoid spending your evening angrily eating a bad meal? I took up the question with some restauranteurs, because they own the joints and can see past many of the contrivances that lure the uninitiated (like me). Overall, they recommend seeking a consistent authenticity and clarity of vision that begins in the kitchen and reverberates throughout every element of the restaurant, from a genuine ambiance to the menu’s earnestness to the building’s character and where it’s located. “Does the place look like it fits where it is? Does it look like effort was put into the design and setup?” asks chef Ethan Stowell, the James Beard nominee behind How to Cook a Wolf and numerous Seattle restaurants. “When you’re dealing with a place that feels good and is designed to make the customers feel the way the menu makes them feel, that’s great.” Telling whether a human being is genuine is hard enough; it’s even more difficult when it’s an inanimate object like a building. Ideally, you want an exterior and ambiance that reflects the tone of the menu—barbecue in a joint designed around the smoker, historic-looking buildings for authentic Old World food—and a place with personality that looks like the owners care, but without trying too hard. Stowell explains: “If everything is sleek chairs and polished white and super flashy, that’s different to me than having a rustic off-white finish with marble countertops and some ceramic pots around that make it feel a bit more homey.” Different, in that the former ambiance is adopting every inauthentic design cliché, which bespeaks a lack of creativity and care that could translate into the food itself. Beware of Edison lightbulbs. That line between unaffected effort and forcing it is difficult to negotiate, but for Stowell it’s even visible in the name. “There’s creative, and then there’s going too far,” he says. “And there’s just something like Luigi’s Italian Palace. Really, is it a palace? Is there even a guy named Luigi? That’s too stereotypical.” A good name can convey the vibe one might be looking for and intrigue with originality. Like the name Chason, for instance: Clearly, I’m a great guy. (What?) “If you’re everything for everybody you’re usually nothing for nobody.” — Ethan Stowell Past the sign and through the window, it would be helpful if a random customer rubbed their belly and beckoned you in, but a better indicator is seeing the actual food being prepared. Sometimes a visible kitchen illustrates freshness and openness, a “sliver of that world that you see from outside of the street, and what are you showing the public as a restaurateur,” says owner Kathy Sidell of the Saltie Girl and the MET Bar restaurants in Boston. “If you see yummy stuff in the window, you’re going in.” Stowell is a fan of this in Seattle spots as well. “You go to Spinasse and they’re making the pasta right in the window, they’re slicing the prosciutto right there on a meat slicer,” he says. “At Din Tai Fung they’re making the dumplings in the window. All that kind of theater stuff is good.” It’s not that eateries without visible kitchens are necessarily lacking, but the more a restaurant is willing to show, the easier it is to assess before sitting down. These initial quick judgments usually take a few seconds, at which point we walk over to the posted menu and study it like the Dead Sea Scrolls. Here’s what you don’t want to see: everything. This isn’t a food court, and while figuring out what you want to do in life is often a long journey for people, restaurants should have this decided far before the menu is printed. “When it’s too cross-cultural, when it’s too all over the place, that’s an issue. There’s a restaurant I’m thinking of right now that has fettucine Alfredo with your choice of shrimp, chicken, or salmon. You’re like, ‘OK, that’s not a good sign,’ ” says Stowell. “That’s the way people used to eat in the ’80s: They would offer everything for everybody, and let them combine it how they want. But we’ve gone away from that and more toward, ‘We’re going to guide you to what’s good.’ If you’re everything for everybody you’re usually nothing for nobody.” For Sidell, a single focus is ideal. “There are Japanese masters that have been doing just tempura for 80 years, and extraordinarily so. When you go there you realize how much it takes to do one thing well, let alone trying to do many things well,” she says. Along these lines, it helps if the menu goes into a bit of detail. Imagine you’re interviewing a steak for the job of being eaten. You don’t want the steak to just say, “I’m a good steak, I swear.” Details like suppliers and cooking methods show that it’s sincere about wanting the job. “If people are taking the time to use morel mushrooms, they’re caring more. Calling out specific varieties of oysters, where the chicken and beef are from, and all the seasonal ingredients that are out there,” says Stowell. “The more in-depth they get with those descriptions, the better off they are.” Carrying around a bingo card with all these guidelines is hardly practical and wouldn’t fit in your wallet. But whether it’s fancy or casual, old-fashioned or modernist, you can often tell if the restaurant is full of crap. Sidell and Stowell—hey, not a bad name for an eatery—seem to be seeking a singular vision that expresses itself in every facet of a spot, rather than an unoriginal concept created by committee to pander. So if you’re standing outside a restaurant that feels organic to the city, features an authentic ambiance that lets the food do the talking, and has a menu that’s as personal as it is focused; by all means, head on in. Should it turn out to be bad, just grab a slice of pizza on the way home. But not at Luigi’s."

Oglala Sioux Tribe bans South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem from reservation over anti-protest laws.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/oglala-sioux-tribe-ban-south-dakota-governor-kristi-noem.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset The Oglala Sioux Tribe, the largest tribe in South Dakota, has banned the state’s governor from its reservation after she supported a pair of recently passed laws aimed at deterring protests of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, according to a letter the tribe sent on Thursday informing the governor she was “not welcome” on tribal lands. “I am hereby notifying you that you are not welcome to visit our homelands, the Pine Ridge Reservation, until you rescind your support for [the two laws] and affirm to your state and this country that First Amendment rights to free, political speech are among the truths you hold to be self-evident,” Julian Bear Runner, the tribe’s president, wrote in a letter to Gov. Kristi Noem. According to the Washington Post , the move is a dramatic one, and a spokesman for the tribe said he couldn’t remember another time when the leaders banned a representative of the state government. According to the letter, the ban will remain in place until she withdraws her support for the two laws, which allow officials to sue activists for something the law has called “riot boosting,” a term the American Civil Liberties Union contends the state invented to go after protests that could disrupt pipeline construction. Under the laws , passed in late March, the state can sue activists if any violence or lawbreaking occurs at a protest they organized, promoted, or even encouraged, and the money from the suit can be used to pay for damages or law enforcement costs. The ACLU is challenging the laws in federal court, contending that its overly vague language gives broad power to crack down on political expression and makes for a chilling effect on speech. The Oglala Sioux, many of whom are opposed to the pipeline because it would run through sacred tribal lands and have participated in protests against it, also allege the state legislators crafted the bills with the input of TransCanada, the company behind the project to build the pipeline, and without that of the tribe, in violation of the tribe’s sovereignty according to the treaty it signed with the U.S.—something the leaders were “particularly offended” by, according to the letter. “We have superior legal title to all the land west of the Missouri River that you and/or big oil seek to trespass and aggress on,” Bear Runner wrote in the letter. “These are our lands and our waters. Before you presume to visit our homelands again, the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council must rescind its action as of May 1, 2019.” According to the tribe, Noem has made recent trips to the reservation without informing the tribal leaders, a move they saw as a further dismissal of tribal sovereignty. According to the letter, another diplomatic violation would put Noem at risk of a more serious tribal process: “If you do not honor this directive—for example, if you were to repeat your recent visit absent permission from our tribal government—we will have no choice but to banish you.”"
This week in Brexit: Labour and Conservatives both take a hit in local elections,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/brexit-local-elections-rory-stewart-penny-mordaunt.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset For once, the biggest political news in Britain this week wasn’t directly Brexit-related. Gavin Williamson, the defense secretary seen as a close ally of Prime Minister Theresa May, was fired on Wednesday over a media leak about a National Security Council meeting concerning plans to allow the controversial Chinese company Huawei to help build the country’s 5G network. (Williamson denies he was the sources of the leak.) Parliament also declared a “ climate emergency ,” making Britain the first country in the world to do so, following widespread protests in London by the group Extinction Rebellion and a speech to MPs from teenage activist Greta Thunberg. But don’t let this focus on critical global concerns like climate change and cybersecurity make you think there was no Brexit news this week. There’s always Brexit news. This week in bipartisan shellackings: Voters throughout much of England and Northern Ireland went to the polls on Thursday to vote in local elections. These voters may or may not have included former foreign secretary and aspiring future prime minister Boris Johnson, who tweeted that he had just voted , then deleted that tweet after people noted that no elections were being held in his district of London. Aides suggested he voted near his second home in South Oxfordshire, but that raises questions about why he deleted the tweet or why he’s registered to vote outside the constituency he represents in Parliament. That mystery aside, it was expected to be a very bad night for the ruling Conservative Party, with supporters frustrated over Theresa May’s failure to deliver Brexit on time, and it was very bad : Although votes are still being counted, the Tories have already lost 850 local council seats throughout the country and have lost control of at least three councils. Sajid Javid, the home secretary and another aspiring future prime minister, says the party should expect to do even worse in European Parliament elections later this month, assuming those actually happen. It was also an unexpectedly bad night for the Labour Party, which has lost at least 80 seats. The big winners of the night are the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, and independent candidates. Prime Minister Theresa May, who was heckled at a Conservative conference in Wales by a party member telling her to resign, said the election results were a message from voters to the leaders of both parties to “just get on and deliver Brexit.” That’s certainly true for her party’s supporters, but for Labour, it’s not as clear. The party lost votes to the Lib Dems and Greens, two staunchly pro-remain parties that both favor a second referendum on Brexit. It may be that voters don’t like Jeremy Corbyn’s ambivalent position in negotiations on Brexit and want him to take a firmer stand. This week in negotiations: Before the elections, May and Corbyn were both signaling that they were getting closer to a Brexit deal. May is reportedly considering agreeing to keep the U.K. within a customs union with Europe . This would allow British businesses to continue to enjoy tariff-free trade with Europe. It would restrict Britain’s ability to negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries, though May’s allies emphasized this week that Britain would still be able to negotiate deals on services, intellectual property, and other areas. This would be viewed as a betrayal by hard-line Brexiteers within May’s party. But after they rejected her withdrawal agreement three times, she’s more or less written them off and decided to try to negotiate with Labour. Corbyn could also face a backlash for helping May deliver Brexit, particularly if he ignores demands from supporters for a second referendum. This week’s new faces: After Williamson was sacked, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt was appointed defense secretary. The Navy reservist will be the first woman to hold the role. She’s also known for having once appeared on a diving reality show , which is a thing, apparently, and once saying the word cock six times in a speech to Parliament after losing a bet with her Navy buddies. So, that’s fun. She’s also a pretty hardcore Brexiteer. Taking her place as international development secretary and joining the Cabinet is Rory Stewart, the former diplomat known for his best-selling memoir about walking across Afghanistan . Stewart was a remainer but has been an enthusiastic public advocate for May’s Brexit plan, which may be part of the reason he’s in the Cabinet now. Naturally, he too thinks he’d be a great prime minister . Days left until next deadline: 182"
"What It’s Like to Sing “Under My Thumb,” Over and Over Again",slate.com,Studio 360,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/under-my-thumb-rolling-stones-romantic-songs-patriarchy.html,"Jules Indelicato. Courtesy of Magnolia McKay “Every Breath You Take” by The Police sounds like a romantic ballad about devotion, which is why it’s been played at countless weddings. But listen to the lyrics a bit more closely and it’s hard to imagine a worse song for walking down the aisle. The song is a pretty nasty piece of business about stalking. Which is why, while it’s actually a terrible wedding song, it was a perfect song for a site-specific art project in San Francisco in the fall. The project was called Romantic Songs of the Patriarchy , and it took place in the Mission District of San Francisco in the Women’s Building, a provider of health, social, and legal services to women. It was by an Icelandic artist named Ragnar Kjartansson and it worked like this: Female musicians were positioned throughout the building on three consecutive days, and each one of them was assigned to sing one song that might sound romantic but which actually is pretty misogynistic. Like this bit of lechery from Rod Stewart: And this from the Beatles: And this particularly astonishing one from the Crystals: The singers who took part in the project didn’t cover their song just once. They performed the same song over and over and over again for three days, basically on a loop. So visitors to the building would climb a set of stairs, or round a corner, and hear another song. About 20 female and nonbinary singers took part in the marathon performance. One of those singers was a Bay Area musician named Jules Indelicato. And they are featured on Studio 360 , the public radio show and Slate podcast. You can hear them singing their cover in the segment, which was produced by Magnolia McKay, in the link below. Jules Indelicato: We were each given songs. The songs were not our choice. I got “Under My Thumb” by the Rolling Stones. My whole demeanor when performing this song was very full of myself and suave and proud that I had tamed this wild beast. “The difference in the clothes she wears, it’s down to me. The change has come. She’s under my thumb.” And at the end of the song there’s this gigantic release that becomes greater and greater with every repetition. And then a breath and you start again. You stop seeing it in the lens of time, and it becomes more of a sculpture, or a painting. In the first minute, people would come in and they’d realize what song I’m singing. And excitement would come over their face like, “Oh, honey, she’s doing the Rolling Stones! Listen.” By the end of the first chorus I’d see the smile kind of leave. And I’d see them start to fidget and I’d see their eyes kind of searching to lock onto mine. There was this one very emotional turn where I had really, really gotten into it and really started to feel like I was that person in the song. That toxic, powerful, snide man with no shame. And I was singing my heart out very subdued, but very intense. And I look up and this woman is crouched in the corner, clutching her heart and clutching her mouth with her other hand and just shaking her head and sobbing. And I look up with a sneer and a smile on my face right as I say, “She’s under my thumb.” And at that moment, I—my throat caught up in my chest, and my eyes started welling up, and I look at her and she looks at me, and I realize that some of this is kind of seeping into my body. Some of this pride, and some of this, like, snarky toxicity. I just felt so gross. And I look at her on the ground and I see how much she’s going through. And then I look up and I realize that there’s a little girl in the room and she’s watching this whole interaction, and she’s been there for the whole song. I don’t see her parents around anywhere. And then I think about her, and I think about all of the songs that she’s heard today. And how she’s growing up being shaped by the same stuff. And it kind of just made me really overwhelmed at how deeply hurt we are by pop culture. And so I wanted to stand up right there and just leave. But I sat back down and I took a breath. And I started the song again, and again, and again. To hear a full audio version, listen to this episode of Studio 360 below, where host Kurt Andersen introduces the story at 39:00.

President Trump spoke to Putin about the Mueller report during phone call.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-mueller-report-phone-call.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset In a pair of tweets Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump said he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and discussed, among other topics, the “Russian Hoax.” It appears to be the first time Trump has spoken with Putin since the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, speaking with reporters, said that the Mueller report was only discussed “very, very briefly” and “in the context that it’s over and there was no collusion, which I’m pretty sure both leaders were both very well aware of long before this call took place.” Had a long and very good conversation with President Putin of Russia. As I have always said, long before the Witch Hunt started, getting along with Russia, China, and everyone is a good thing, not a bad thing.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2019 But Trump has already been criticized for the way in which he appeared to depict Putin as an ally in matters related to the Mueller investigation, given the Russian government’s confirmed role in attempting to sway the election. “A hostile foreign power attacked our democracy,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a tweet. “The president welcomed that attack, obstructed the investigation into it, & is now cozying up with the leader who orchestrated it. Congress needs to do its job, stand up for our national security, and begin impeachment proceedings.” Sanders told reporters that the call lasted more than an hour—as the New York Times pointed out, that makes it one of Trump’s longest calls with a foreign leader. Asked if Trump pressed Putin on the 2016 election meddling, Sanders avoided a direct response. “[W]hat I can tell you is that this administration, unlike the previous one, takes election meddling seriously,” she said . “And we’re going to do everything that we can to prevent it from happening. That’s why we’ve taken a whole-of-government approach.”"

Eva Stories is a Holocaust memorial on Instagram.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/holocaust-instagram-eva-stories.html,"A post shared by Eva (@eva.stories) on Apr 28, 2019 at 4:36am PDT Eva’s narrative, which played on Instagram Stories and was permanently saved to the account’s Story Highlights, begins in relative peacetime. Eva introduces us to her grandparents and her best friend Annie and, from afar, shows us the cute boy she has a crush on. Eva hangs out at her grandfather’s pharmacy, where Annie gives her a “love potion” made of gold glitter. The videos are charming, if cutesy, often decorated with app add-ons like hashtags, location tags, stickers, and emoji. But the silliness is flecked with anxiety. When we meet Eva’s papa, she calls him “just as handsome as an Aryan,” before bragging, “One day, when I get older, I’ll marry an Aryan Englishman.” Later, while Eva fools around on the sidewalk, we can just make out a passerby muttering “dirty Jew” and see Eva’s face fall before she shuts off her camera. We watch as her freedoms dissolve one by one, until her family is carted off to a ghetto. Screenshot from @Eva.Stories The power of Instagram, and the reason it makes for a punchy story medium, lies in its immediacy. When Eva addresses the camera, she speaks freely in intimate close-up. Mia Quiney, the British actress who plays Eva, is capable of toggling between a charming, breezy adolescence and tangible rage and fear when things get dark. Her naturalism is amplified by the story’s structure: Scenes last minutes or seconds, allowing us to experience a full revolution of mood over just a few moments. When Eva’s mother sews a yellow star on Eva’s favorite peacoat, her response is to scream and thrash like a petulant child. “This isn’t me,” she cries, fretting that the kids at school will make fun of her. Seconds later, Eva’s wearing the star in a quiet selfie video, staring into the camera coolly. The project’s set design and costumes are faithful to 1944 Hungary, with the notable exception of Eva’s smartphone—the only one that exists in the world of the story. Since our narrator is alone in using the device, the story feels less like a modern, fantastical update on the Holocaust—like Inglourious Basterds or Life Is Beautiful— than a highly stylized slice of it. The project brings to mind the 2015 film Son of Saul , which was similarly shot in intimate close-up—and, despite its eventual Oscar win, drew equal criticism for depicting the Holocaust in an “entertaining” form. Not long after the end of World War II, the German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno posited that “to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” Adorno later retracted the statement , but it gestures at the overwhelming challenge of approaching the Holocaust’s horrors as an artist. While the war bred documentaries and Hollywood-style propaganda films to support the Allied war effort, depicting the Holocaust seemed to require a dignity and gravitas that felt too massive for ordinary cultural tools. But slowly, art crept into the void, helping to commemorate the troubling past and confront lingering pain. Yet even now, each time a new work that touches on the Holocaust is released, it becomes the subject of scrutiny: Does it sensationalize its material? Does it trivialize it? Does it offer insight? We’re right to ask these questions, about Eva Stories and everything else. Screenshot from @Eva.Stories When I first saw Eva ’s promo ad on Instagram, I was skeptical. The project seemed blasé and inappropriate, not to mention pathetically out of touch in its presumption that Instagram is the only way to reach young people. My suspicions were partially confirmed when I began watching. A clumsy early scene in which Eva’s young cousin is deported to Poland feels both stagy and awkwardly abrupt, as if the episode were being improvised by school kids on a playground. The Instagram frills—like the hashtags #lifeduringwar and #reporterlife, which are both repeatedly appended—can also be cringy, and were so obviously engineered by adults that they come to function like a Brechtian distancing device, taking us out of a scene when they should be adding to its teenage realism. But slowly, Eva Stories won me over. The character of Eva does most of the work, both through Quiney’s performance and Eva’s identity as an aspiring journalist, a detail that was lifted from Eva Heyman’s real journal entries. This job ambition becomes the narrative driver behind Eva’s incessant smartphone recording (hence #reporterlife), which helps to justify the inherent queasiness of her whipping out her phone while soldiers harass her family. By the time Eva crams onto the train that will take her to Auschwitz, we’ve gained a real sense of her life. She was a normal, silly, happy kid—one among millions whose lives were ruined and cut short. The smartphone is an obvious embellishment to this history, but Eva Stories isn’t inventing a new past; it’s retrieving a truth about these kids’ existence. Every day, appalling, terrible things are conveyed to me through my iPhone, arriving on Twitter or Facebook or news apps. Typically, I look to Instagram for fun stuff—cute animals, delicious food, friends, fashion, art. It’s understandable that, for many, it would be jarring to see this safe, superficial space merge with war and suffering. But that jarring-ness is part of the point. The Holocaust’s memory is a painful one, but these days, it is perhaps more painful to realize that it might not persist, that as the atrocities grow further away in the rearview and fewer survivors remain, the Holocaust is liable to lose resonance. While watching Eva, I kept thinking of a story that’s told at Passover during one of the best-known parts of the Seder. It identifies a “Rebellious Son” as a child who asks his parents, “What is this service to you ?” and thus separates himself from his community. The Seder story’s goal—to teach kids to feel engaged in their culture so that the Jewish memory doesn’t fade—is the same as the mission of Eva Stories. Like Eva herself, the project is reporting from a new frontier of difficult storytelling, and its timing is crucial.

The International Planetary Defense Conference asks what to do if an asteroid is headed to Earth.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/international-planetary-defense-conference-asteroid-impact.html,"Mayor Pete Is Not an Anti-Vaxxer Imagine this: Scientists have just detected an asteroid hurtling toward Earth. According to their calculations, the damage would be catastrophic, and we don’t have long to prepare. Experts determine that the best plan of action would be to launch armed spacecraft, perhaps with nukes, to rendezvous with the asteroid. Though this sounds suspiciously like the plot of Armageddon , it’s also the plot of the sixth International Academy of Astronautics Planetary Defense Conference. Representatives from NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the European Space Agency, the U.N., and other international space experts have gathered in College Park, Maryland, this week to do a cosmic fire drill. The premise of this role-play universe begins with an imaginary asteroid called 2019 PDC, which has a 1 in 100 chance of striking Earth in 2027. According to NASA , those odds were selected for this drill because experts worldwide generally agree that that’s the threshold for when we should take collective action. Sure, it seems far-fetched, but it’s only a matter of time until we’re faced with a serious asteroid threat. This year has already seen three close asteroid flybys , between 73,500 and 274,000 miles away from us, but none close enough to sound the alarm. (For reference, the distance between Earth and the moon is 238,900 miles.) Small asteroids pass within 4 million miles of Earth all the time. Earth has definitely seen some giant impacts before, but it seems in our best interest to be ready next time around. (As this amazing shirt from the European Space Agency says: Dinosaurs didn’t have a space agency .) So, the logic goes, practice makes perfect. The conference looked like any other—experts giving presentations in a nondescript meeting hall—but instead of covering new advances in the field, the talks gave a broad outline of the hypothetical impact scenario and discussed the questions and decisions that would stem from it. The scenario is wrapped around an excellent and compelling storyline. Though every tweet from organizers and attendees, as well as the PowerPoint slides, included the word EXERCISE in bold letters, I found myself getting drawn into the role-play as I watched the conference livestream from home (and, apparently, so did some momentarily alarmed folks on Twitter, prompting one astronomy account to remind followers that the scenario was not real). Like a good sci-fi storyline, each day of the exercise advanced the story forward. While Day 1 took place in real time, Day 2 took place three months later, in July 2019, and then we jumped forward to Dec. 30, 2021, on Day 3, to 2024 in Day 4, and to 10 days before impact on Day 5. At first, efforts focused on quantifying the problem: Where might the asteroid strike, and with how much force? By Day 3, experts had calculated that 2019 PDC would land in the middle of Denver, completely incinerating the immediate area (one scientist used the phrase “molten buildings” to describe the damage) and casting shock waves hundreds of miles out. “Windows are breaking from Pueblo to Laramie,” said physicist Mark Boslough to set the scene at his end-of-day briefing about the asteroid’s physical effects. A great deal of discussion has focused on how best to deflect the asteroid’s path. Some suggested deploying kinetic impactors, launched to collide with the asteroid and knock it into a different path, as well as launching nuclear weapons. The problem is that scientists aren’t yet sure exactly how each method would move the asteroid because they’re not sure of the asteroid’s mass, which, as you may guess, matters a lot when it comes to physics. The logistics of this exercise assume that humankind will send a probe up to study the asteroid more closely, but given the lag in how long it takes for spacecraft to reach the asteroid, scientists will need to make a decision about their deflection method before the probe sends back additional data. In imaginary 2024, the experts decide to send up a series of kinetic impactors, which successfully move the asteroid out of Earth’s path, but the force of the impacts also causes a chunk of the asteroid to break off—and the simulation has it hitting Earth in April 2029. Luckily, the fake piece is small, by celestial standards: It’s estimated at 60 meters. While it will likely become smaller or even vaporize while entering our atmosphere, it still has the power to inflict damage; for instance, the Tunguska meteor in 1908 was thought to be around the same size, and while it didn’t leave a crater, it flattened hundreds of miles of Arctic forest. On Day 5, it was revealed that 2019 PDC would hit Manhattan in 10 days, an incident “worse than Tunguska.” Experts drew up models of the damage and began planning for evacuations. Unsurprisingly, much of the drill focused on decision-making and mission logistics. How do we learn as much as we can about this asteroid, and what do we do to minimize its damage? But a full-scale rehearsal like this also brings more practical considerations to the forefront, and attendees’ questions and experts’ analyses highlight the very real concerns people might have should a scenario like this arise in real life. One attendee seemed pretty hand-wavy about potentially destroying a huge swath of the western U.S. At the end of Day 3, for instance, one attendee seemed pretty hand-wavy about potentially destroying a huge swath of the western U.S., even for a thought exercise, saying, “I might be biased since we’re all on the East Coast here, but … ” This person went on to ask: Had we considered possibly sending spacecraft up just to nudge the asteroid slightly away from any major population center, instead of nudging it out of Earth’s orbit? The speaker, NASA’s Brent Barbee, politely shot him down. “I would characterize that as a last resort. Our primary goal would be to move the asteroid off of Earth,” he said. The moderator of the Q&A also jumped in to add that the impactors’ targeting wouldn’t be precise enough to ensure the exact amount the asteroid would be moved. But still, this questioner is probably not alone. The people who would be tasked with huge decisions like this are more likely to live in certain cities, and, as well-intentioned as they may be, that could color decisions. But it’s also not clear who, ultimately, will get to make those calls. Attendees brought up questions about the possibilities of different countries “getting in each other’s way” when it comes to launching spacecraft meant to work together, like if three different space agencies each contributed kinetic impactors to a global mission. “With a mission of this scope, you’d need strong coordination,” said discussion moderator Paul Chodas, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “With procedures and protocols, we could achieve the coordination necessary, but it would be essential to coordinate very closely.” In theory, there would be an international team that coordinates important intergalactic decisions, like how to launch defense against the asteroid or, if nuclear weapons are used, who actually initiates the detonation. (Hopefully, this coordination is better than that of the crew in Armageddon , when Bruce Willis pushes young Ben Affleck out of the way at the last moment.) “We don’t have those procedures in place right now, but we’re developing them,” Chodas said. Figuring that out appears to be outside the purview of this conference, but it seems like a piece of the puzzle law and politics experts should figure out long before we’re faced with an actual asteroid threat. And one hopes that any team meant to represent the interests of all humans on Earth includes delegates from countries that don’t have their own space programs but can contribute in other ways, like drawing up policies and offering technical expertise. Currently, the International Asteroid Warning Network is the go-to group for finding and monitoring near-Earth objects and coordinating international resources, and while there are a good number of institutions from space-faring countries represented , it’s definitely biased toward wealthier powers. This thought experiment also demonstrates how important it will be to bring in experts outside of physics and astronomy. In several summaries, experts have mentioned the consequences of a huge asteroid event on plane or train travel and internet access, as well as the possible destabilization of the economy as property values in potential strike areas plummet. Others have pointed out that areas outside the immediate strike zones will likely be ravaged by wildfires caused by the impact. There are real costs to culture, as well. One researcher noted that when 2019 PDC incinerates Manhattan, museums like the Met would need to move their collections elsewhere as quickly as possible. My favorite question came from an attendee who has clearly seen his share of action movies: “How big would [the asteroid] need to be to pop the cork on Yellowstone?” The scientists onstage didn’t seem to immediately understand his question, so the attendee went on to explain that an impact could destabilize the Wyoming supervolcano . “We have not considered volcanic impacts,” replied one of the scientists. “Well,” the attendee said, “maybe it’s something to take a look at.”"

"The Sunrise Movement dismisses Beto O’Rourke’s climate change plan, then comes around.",slate.com,Josh Voorhees,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/beto-orourke-climate-change-sunrise-movement-2030.html,"How Are We Supposed to Understand Brett Kavanaugh Now? Beto O’Rourke released his first major policy proposal this week, a $5 trillion —yes, trillion with a T —plan to combat man-made climate change through a combination of executive, congressional, and private-sector action. Coming from a man who entered the 2020 race as a political cipher and who has since shown a preference for policy half-steps , the plan was shockingly detailed and ambitious. But even viewed without the lens of low expectations, O’Rourke’s proposal still looks remarkably bold. It calls for a “legally enforceable standard”— think carbon tax —to force the United States to be carbon neutral by the middle of this century, and a federal investment in renewable energy that is greater than what the nation spent to put a man on the moon. Sounds ambitious, right? Now for the shocker. The Sunrise Movement, an upstart advocacy group that has been loudly calling for climate action, responded with a giant thumbs down . O’Rourke, according to Executive Director Varshini Prakash, got “the science wrong” when he chose 2050 as his carbon-neutral deadline instead of 2030. “Beto claims to support the Green New Deal,” Prakash said in a statement, “but his plan is out of line with the timeline it lays out and the scale of action that scientists say is necessary to take here in the United States to give our generation a livable future.” For good measure, Sunrise cited the previous times when O’Rourke had pointed to 2030 as his ideal target. Then came the backlash to the backlash, from progressive policy wonks who see the 2030 target as unattainable, including Vox’s David Roberts , the original climate hawk , who has defended Sunrise in the past. And then another surprise followed before the week was up: Prakash walked back her criticism of Beto, considerably, by way of a Twitter mea culpa. We came out a bit too hot on @BetoORourke ’s climate plan, focusing just on his timeline & not enough on everything that’s spot on abt it.2050 *is* too late a deadline for the US to reach netzero GHG emissions, but Beto’s plan was a great start & I hope many others follow suit. https://t.co/Id2eIcJwXP — Varshini Prakash 🌅 (@VarshPrakash) May 1, 2019 The week’s twists and turns originally had me fearing that the climate movement was about to eat itself at a moment when the stakes are higher than ever. But now I think that Beto’s rollout, the insta-backlash, the counterbacklash, and the semi-retreat, taken together, illustrate how climate infighting on the left is more productive than destructive. To understand why, first let’s look at the fault line from which this fight erupted: the target date by which the United States needs to be carbon neutral. Climate math, to put it mildly, is complicated. It does not lend itself easily to pithy summary, which is why the focus on specific dates can be a bit counterproductive. The broad brushstrokes, though, are important: While the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does not address what individual countries need to do, it does lay out a timeline for the world as a whole. And while there’s some wiggle room around the edges depending on what happens down the road, the IPCC has concluded that the world most likely needs to cut its carbon emission in half by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by roughly 2050 in order to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the point at which the damage caused by a warming world would go from bad to really, really bad . And so many climate-conscious Democrats have settled on 2050 as their goal for the United States— including presidential hopefuls like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has made global warming the signature issue of his campaign (and who rolled out a sweeping climate plan of his own on Friday that takes a creative sector-by-sector approach ). Even Sunrise’s beloved Green New Deal is a little fuzzy on its timeline. It calls for a 10-year “mobilization,” but one of its co-authors, Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, has been clear that’s not the same thing as complete decarbonization. Things only get considerably more complicated from there, as they tend to when you’re talking about an existential crisis. The world’s governments are not going to move in unison toward that goal. And so many believe the United States and Europe will need to lead the way—for reasons of morality (the West has been burning obscene amounts of fossil fuels for far longer than the rest of the world), practicality (the West has more money to invest in clean energy), and geopolitics (the United States, in particular, has given everyone good reason to doubt its commitment to the fight). Again, estimates vary, but some experts see 2030 as the date by which the United States would need to be carbon neutral in order to give the rest of the world the cushion it will likely need to get there by 2050. In order to hit that expedited timeline, though, the United States would have only a few years to fundamentally reshape American life—from how we travel to what we eat to where we live. That is not going to happen as long as there is a climate denier in the White House, but even a climate-focused Democrat would face myriad and possibly insurmountable challenges—both practical (how to decarbonize the aviation industry) and political (how to overcome GOP climate denials in Congress)—should one be sworn in as president in January 2021. Things only get considerably more complicated from there, as they tend to when you’re talking about an existential crisis. So, if the world can’t get to carbon neutral by 2050 unless the United States does by 2030, but the United States can’t get there by then, what’s the answer? I don’t know! No one does yet. But I am pretty confident the solution to that quandary isn’t in the existing advocacy playbook that pushed Congress to the brink of major climate action a decade ago but has yet to come anywhere close since. That’s why I was excited to see the Sunrise Movement instigate this week’s push and pull among a host of well-meaning actors, even though it was messy and a bit awkward. Sunrise is relatively new to the scene, and it’s still finding its footing. But the fact it isn’t always marching in lockstep with the larger climate community is a feature, not a bug. The group’s defiant streak has enabled it to harness the energy of so many young progressives, and then to use that energy to push the Democratic establishment to do more—by taking to the streets , by confronting lawmakers in their D.C. offices, and by releasing strongly worded press releases even when White House hopefuls unveil proposals that are quantum leaps forward from the status quo. That’s a good thing because doing more is clearly what’s needed. Yes, there are risks to being the progressive gadfly. If Democratic candidates start to think proposing anything short of a 2030 goal is going to get them ridiculed by the climate crowd, they may decide to focus their attention on other issues on which their base is more easily pleased. But Sunrise doesn’t represent the entire climate movement, merely the leftward flank of it. By creating a little chaos, as Sunrise tends to do, the group make it harder for candidates, the media, and voters to complacently downplay the full scale of the climate crisis. And in the process, these rabble-rousers can notch a few tiny victories along the way, as they did this week when O’Rourke announced Wednesday —after Sunrise had softened its criticism of him—that he’d no longer accept campaign donations above $200 from fossil fuel company executives, which Sunrise had been pushing him to do. A small step, to be sure, but a step nonetheless. There won’t be some buzzer that sounds on Jan. 1, 2030 or Jan. 1, 2050 to confirm whether the United States has averted climate disaster. Progress on global warming is not a binary. Success, both literately and figuratively, is a matter of degrees. Support our journalism

Montunas' Trellis Lirio tote: who would buy it?,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/montunas-tote-who-would-buy-it.html,"The Legend of the Vomelet, the Absolute Worst Food in the Military It’s that time of the year again, when the pollen-heavy rains of spring have overstayed their welcome, and we all breathlessly await the real arrival of summer. Along with the prospect of beach days comes the annual opportunity to guess what new trends and takes on warm-weather staples will overtake Instagram. Throwing her hat into the predicting ring early is Who What Wear senior news editor Erin Fitzpatrick, who declares that “the Montunas’s Trellis Lirio Rope-Trimmed Acetate and Linen Tote … is ripe to become a summer It bag.” How exactly Fitzpatrick has divined this forecast isn’t entirely clear, but the Montunas bag is certainly ripe to be named of the strangest objects I’ve ever laid eyes on. Apparently inspired by the “shape of plant pots,” the Trellis Lirio tote is a curious little bag that costs a mere $435 and resembles either an inverted lampshade or one of the little trash cans that one keeps in their bathroom. Or perhaps a half-full, to-go cup of ice cream. Maybe an Easter basket? The tote features a structural exterior made of acetate pearlescent slats and a drawstring pouch interior. There’s also a pink tassel involved. The website copy suggests that buyers “match your lip color to the pretty pink rope handle” and that the tote is “one for Instagram,” which makes sense since it looks as if it will fit approximately three things. Other bags in the Montunas line are comparably … eccentric. The Guaria tote , for example, looks a bit like a rectangular green spice rack attached to a silk scarf and is “inspired by hanging pots and planters.” The Lirio bag is similar in structure to the Trellis Lirio, except without the slats, which somehow makes it look even more like a bathroom trash can, albeit one cast in resin. According to one of the founders of Montanaus, all of the acetate bags are inspired by their orchid house in the mountains of Costa Rica.
The shapes are all based on orchid pots and vessels, and the names are native Costa Rican orchids. For us, nature is our biggest inspiration—it’s not hard when you’re from Costa Rica! The new Pearl collection fuses together the two important parts of nature there: the jungle and the sea. Yes, of course. Now that I’ve read that, I definitely understand the raison d’être for this little trashcan orchid pot bag. While the entire “bag” strikes me as nonsensical, what I will say is that the most confounding part is that the little interior linen pouch is apparently removable, which feels both like a security risk and a huge hassle. Whoever owns this purse is stuck holding it perfectly upright, lest their linen bag of three things tumble out onto the street. Or should you leave your home without the linen pouch, you’re walking around with what is functionally a bucket with slats through which anyone can see what three things you’ve chosen to carry with you. Actually, now that I think about it, this might be the perfect bag for a concert venue where you’re only allowed to bring in a transparent vessel. Price: $435 Who would buy this thing?

Why Facebook’s ban of Alex Jones and Milo was so underwhelming.,slate.com,April Glaser,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/facebook-alex-jones-ban-underwhelming.html,"The Decadelong Humiliation of Runner Caster Semenya On Thursday, we found out what the sound of a defenestrated troll is like. That afternoon, Facebook banned Infowars, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, and other inflammatory figures like far-right personalities Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos, white supremacist politician Paul Nehlen, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has long been criticized as holding anti-Semitic and homophobic views. These bans are reportedly permanent and extend to the fan pages and groups affiliated with their accounts. The breakup wasn’t clean. The news broke before Facebook had actually banned all of their accounts across its platforms. Loomer and Yiannopoulos were still able to post to Instagram for nearly an hour after the Washington Post, the Atlantic, CNN, and the Verge published stories saying they were getting the boot. In that time, Loomer and Yiannopoulos used their accounts to tell their legions of followers where else to find them. On Facebook, Alex Jones was able to stream on Facebook Live for nearly two hours after the world learned that he was technically no longer welcome there. Facebook told Wired the reason for the time lag was that scrubbing these characters’ footprint was a bigger job than they anticipated. While Facebook briefed news organizations ahead of time over these actions, the company didn’t specify how these accounts had violated the platform’s policies. Instead, a spokesperson told multiple outlets that the company has “always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,” which was a bit tough to swallow, considering these accounts have been spewing hate for years—and many, many hateful accounts remain on the social network. (A quick search Friday on Facebook for the term “jews oven” unearthed a page called “Jewsinoven?”) The Facebook spokesperson continued, “The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.” Facebook didn’t share what rules specifically were violated or what the process was for reviewing its rules. Presumably, if Thursday’s actions reflect a new approach that Facebook is now taking—or at least a new sense of urgency—then far more than seven accounts would have been banned. Still: At the end of the day, a bunch of high-profile bigots had been stripped of a major platform. It should’ve resonated as a victory against the fringe figures who have benefited from the distortionary effects of social media, where ranking algorithms tend to benefit divisive, emotional content. So why did this latest act of content moderation instead feel underwhelming? The lack of transparency is so troublesome because Facebook’s content moderation processes aren’t only applied to famous racists. Deplatforming certainly does help to reduce the spread of hate. Since Alex Jones lost his main Facebook and YouTube pages in August, traffic to Infowars has plummeted . Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right provocateur who was banned from Twitter for directing racist harassment at the actress Leslie Jones, can no longer receive financial backing from his fan base via Venmo or PayPal and is reportedly in severe debt. (Those services banned him last year after he sent $14.88, a number that symbolizes a salute to Hitler in neo-Nazi communities, to a Jewish journalist.) But, particularly in Facebook’s case, deplatforming also has to align with a set of clearly articulated policies so that it isn’t read as a tyrannical act of corporate censorship that will further inflame accusations of bias. In this case, Facebook created a news story in much the way it might if it had announced a new product , but it didn’t actually say why specifically the accounts were removed. What should have been a by-the-book punitive act became a spectacle—and probably one that Alex Jones and the like will try to spin to their advantage. Facebook has the power to punish wrongdoers, as it did on Thursday. But we don’t know its full rationale for doing so, nor do we know who will be next. The lack of transparency is so troublesome because Facebook’s content moderation processes aren’t only applied to famous racists. For years, black users on Facebook have been forced to navigate the platform’s mercurial enforcement of its speech policies. It’s become so routine for black activists to get suspended when they complain about racism that it’s become common practice in activist communities to create backup accounts and use slang like “wypipo” to dodge the company’s content moderation algorithm. Complaining about racism isn’t hate speech. But Facebook appears to have done less hand-wringing when moderating content from this community than it has with content that is anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, or racist, or that promotes dangerous conspiracy theories that have led to violence. While figures like Alex Jones might attract the attention of higher-up Facebook executives, most people are moderated by a mix of algorithm and low-level contract workers—and are subject to a broad brush with little room for appeal. I emailed Facebook to ask specifically which rules were violated, what the process was for reviewing the rules, and if this means more accounts, presumably of lesser-known users, would be banned for engaging in hateful rhetoric soon, too. I have yet to hear back. But unless this move is part of an overall cleanup effort in which the company includes its rationale for taking action and promises to do so consistently into the future, don’t expect Facebook to become free of bigotry anytime soon. Removing hate will always be a game of whack-a-mole. It’s good to ban high-profile bigots. It’s also critically important to explain in clear terms what policy was violated, how many violations were tabulated, and what they did to violate the policy—either shared with the account holder or with the public. Simply saying the company “always” does this isn’t sensical or sufficient. What might be more bothersome, however, is that Facebook risks unleashing a whole other breed of hate and disinformation across its network—one that a high-profile act of deplatforming doesn’t address. Earlier this week, Facebook shared that it is redesigning its platform to promote the use of private groups for sharing Facebook posts, which would reduce the prominence of the more open news feed. Moving people into private rooms will certainly make it a lot easier for Facebook to continue its haphazard style of governance. It’s a lot easier to promote and share bigotry in a closed group of racists than it is to do so on a public page—and for that bigotry to spread widely without anyone noticing, as it did on WhatsApp during the Brazilian elections last year. And it’s a lot harder for users who are trying to fight hate to report it. I expect the people who lost their accounts on Thursday to start new ones soon, or worse, commandeer an account or group with a large following from an ally. Sure, they probably won’t have the reach they did before, but hate is insidious. Policies against racism don’t eradicate racism. Unless Facebook applies its rules consistently and transparently, people with an agenda will find a way to come crawling back to find their fans. And if they’re in big private groups, where only their fellow sexists, anti-Semites, Islamophobes, homophobes, and racists are allowed in, they may well find a hideout there too."

"North Korea launches short term projectiles, according to South Korea.",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/north-korea-short-term-projectiles.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies North Korea fired several short-term projectiles into the sea Saturday, in what could be the country’s first missile test since 2017 and a possible warning to the U.S. after the two countries’ denuclearization talks stalled. While it’s not clear what the projectiles are, the South Korean military, which reported the test and originally identified the projectiles as “short-term missiles” before revising its statement, has used the term before for missiles before they can be identified. There is no evidence that the test Saturday involved a nuclear explosion and it appears not to have been an intercontinental ballistic missile, according to the New York Times . The projectiles were fired from the east coast of the peninsula and launched 45 to 125 miles. The launches will not have violated the moratorium the country declared in November 2017 on nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile tests, according to the Washington Post . That moratorium was intended to help clear the path for negotiations with the U.S. and South Korea. In April, North Korea tested a new weapon, which it called a “tactical guided weapon,” and which is thought to have been a more conventional weapon. That test appeared to be a warning to President Trump to continue the talks between the two nations, as in February a failed summit in Vietnam between Trump and Kim Jong-un resulted only in frustration. In that summit, Kim demanded sanctions relief in return for partial disarmament and Trump refused to lift sanctions until North Korea gave up all of its nuclear weapons. The two did agree to remain in discussions, and both nations have said a third summit between the two leaders remained a possibility. Since then, it appears North Korea has only become more frustrated with sanctions and the hard line taken by the U.S, as well as with continued U.S.-South Korea military exercises. Last month, Kim said in a speech he was losing patience and that he would give the U.S. until the end of the year to come up with new terms. According to the Post, South Korea’s president said the North’s actions violated a September military cooperation agreement between the two countries aimed at reducing tensions. A spokeswoman for the president said the South would work with the U.S. to “ramp up vigilance and closely communicate with neighboring countries as needed.” According to the Times, the South Korean foreign minister said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said in a conversation with her that the U.S. would respond “with caution.” In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said he still believes he can reach a nuclear deal with Kim.

Portland and Denver’s Four-Overtime Game Revealed the Six Stages of Exhaustion,slate.com,Nick Greene,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/portland-and-denvers-four-overtime-thriller-took-its-toll.html,"Sadly, delirium often presents itself as confidence in the truly fatigued.

"Tyson recalls 11.8 million pounds of frozen chicken, according to the USDA.",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/tyson-recall-frozen-chicken-metal.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies Tyson Foods Inc. has recalled 11.8 million pounds of frozen chicken strips because of the possibility that some may contain metal, the United States Department of Agriculture announced Saturday. That announcement came after six people complained of finding pieces of metal. Three of the people said they sustained cuts to their mouths. The company had already recalled 69,000 pounds of chicken strips in March but dramatically increased that nationwide recall after more of the complaints were filed. The potentially contaminated chicken strips were produced between October 2018 and March 8 of this year, and their “use by” dates range from October of this year to March 2020. They can be identified by the number “P-7221” on the back of the package. While most are listed under the Tyson brand, the recall also affects some products from Publix, Kirkwood, Giant Eagle, Hannaford, Spare Time, Best Choice, Great Value, Meijer, and Food Lion. You can see a more detailed list of recalled items here . It’s rare, but not wholly unheard-of, for frozen chicken products to become contaminated because of the process of producing the “meat slurry” with processing equipment. As Aaron Mak wrote the last time Tyson issued a major recall—in that case, for reports of rubber in its chicken—there are processes to prevent contamination, but there is no fail-safe. While maintenance programs monitor equipment for fatigue and inspectors usually check the equipment during cleaning and sanitation at the end of the day, it can still be hard to screen out material that contaminates the chicken because the slurry can’t easily pass through filters. However, metal pieces, unlike rubber, could be caught with metal detectors. In a statement posted to the company’s website, a spokeswoman for Tyson said the company had “discontinued use of the specific equipment believed to be associated with the metal fragments” and that it would install “metal-detecting X-ray machinery to replace the plant’s existing metal-detection system” and use a “third-party video auditing system for metal-detection verification.” In January, Tyson recalled 36,000 pounds of chicken nuggets after rubber was reported found in some of the chicken nuggets. That same month, Perdue issued a recall after receiving complaints of wood in their gluten-free chicken nuggets."

All 143 people on board the plane survived and sustained no life-threatening injuries. The jet, which had departed from Guantanamo Bay and was operated by charter airline Miami Air International, crashed at 9:40 p.m. after passing through thunderstorms, according to CNN . It’s unknown if the weather had anything to do with the rough landing. Passengers told reporters that after a hard landing on the runway, the plane bounced, swerved, and then crashed into the water in the middle of a storm. The passengers on board were a collection of active-duty military members, their family members, and government employees. Many were traveling home to see their families. Passengers took to the wings of the plane to await rescue, and firefighters helped ferry them to safety with rafts. Twenty-one of the people on board were sent to the hospital for minor injuries. A commanding officer at Naval Air Station Jacksonville said at a press conference that the landing and the survival of all the passengers and crew amounted to a “miracle.” “We could be talking about a different story this evening,” he said. The jet did not fully sink into the water, as it came to a stop in a shallow portion of the river, but the bottom of it—including the cargo hold, where the pets were held—was submerged. It’s not yet known how many pets were on the flight, but there were at least four. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash landing. As a result, the jet has been left untouched on the site, and passengers have not yet been able to retrieve their luggage. Authorities have not yet said what caused the plane to end up in the river."
Watch Stephen Colbert do a Nixon impression that is absolutely devastating to the Republican Party under Trump.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/stephen-colbert-nixon-impression-donald-trump-scandals.html,"This is not normal! CBS There’s a fierce debate going on inside the Democratic Party right now—mostly between Joe Biden and observable reality , to be honest—over whether Donald Trump is some sort of dark aberration in American history or just a particularly exuberant expression of the greed, fear, and hatred that have powered the Republican Party for decades. But there’s one way in which Trump undeniably represents a break from the past: His braying, cracking voice is impossible for comedians to resist imitating, and nearly as impossible for them to make funny, or even tolerable. Countless late-night monologues have run aground on this shoal, because it’s hard to write jokes about Donald Trump without quoting or imitating the absurd things Donald Trump says; but as soon as you give a comedian the chance to do his voice, they’ll do it; and as soon as any version of Donald Trump’s voice goes out over the airwaves, a significant portion of the audience will be involuntarily plunged into eyelid-twitching paroxysms of rage and sorrow. That’s not exactly a comedy sweet spot, but it’s interesting, because it represents a way in which the Republicans have actually disgraced themselves in the Trump era, as opposed to just being a little more honest about who they always were and what they always wanted. Take Richard Nixon, for instance. Perhaps no Republican president before Trump did more to align the Republican Party with white supremacy —although there’s certainly stiff competition—and while every president of every party abuses their power to some degree, Nixon was forced to resign in disgrace , the very definition of overstepping your bounds. But although Republicans long ago abandoned their commitment to the rule of law and our common humanity, there was one responsibility Nixon took very seriously: He was funny in a way that insured basic minimum standards for Nixon impressionists. On Friday’s Late Show With Stephen Colbert ,* the host briefly took the audience back to the halcyon days of a more civilized era: Colbert’s Nixon impression alternates between not sounding much like Richard Nixon and not sounding anything like Richard Nixon, but it’s still funny: The victory sign, the hunched shoulders, and the basset hound jowl shake do most of the work. Even fictional characters can do a good Nixon—see, e.g., Mr. Burns’ Nixon on The Simpsons , in which Harry Shearer filters a Nixon impression through his Mr. Burns voice, itself a combination of Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Tracy Morgan set out to do a bad impression of Nixon and still couldn’t stop it from being hilarious, as this video, entitled “Tracy Morgan’s Terrible Nixon Impression” and previously hailed in the pages of Slate as “ the nation’s worst Nixon impression ,” proves. As a bonus, it also features Conan O’Brien’s Nixon: It’s true that a gifted Trump impressionist like Anthony Atamanuik can somehow turn Trump’s unbearable personal affect into laughter, but this is expert-level work: For everyday, run-of-the-mill hosts of major network late-night television shows, Trump’s voice is a tar pit where laughter goes to die. In Lincoln’s day—and even in Nixon’s—the Republican Party was committed to helping all comedians succeed, backing a slate of candidates with silly, easy-to-parody affectations ranging from stovepipe hats to handlebar mustaches. With a simple, graceful shake of his jowls, Stephen Colbert reminded the nation just how far the GOP has fallen. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

"Trump rails against Facebook's decision to ban ""dangerous individuals.""",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-rant-conservatives-facebook-ban.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies On Twitter Friday night, President Donald Trump railed against “ the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms” and complained that conservatives were being unfairly pushed off social media. The president has on several occasions before complained of broad suppression of conservative voices by tech companies, but this time, Trump singled out a number of people, including James Woods—whom he called a “Conservative thinker”—and Paul Joseph Watson. He then proceeded to amplify the tweets of a number of conspiracy-minded accounts (including one bizarre video by an account called Deep State Exposed asserting that “the ‘elite’ proclaim America must submit to Islam or else!!!”). Most of the tweets had to do with censorship. In total, he sent out more than a dozen tweets on the subject. But the people he retweeted are not known for mainstream conservative thinking. Instead, many of them peddle right-wing conspiracy theories and overt white supremacy. The Twitter rant was sparked by Facebook’s decision to bar seven users from its services, citing its policies against “dangerous individuals and organizations.” The purge included Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, the virulent anti-Semite Paul Nehlen, and Alex Jones. In particular, Trump focused on Paul Joseph Watson, an Infowars personality known also for his conspiracy-mongering . Trump mentioned Watson in his own tweet Friday, and he retweeted a video Watson made criticizing Facebook the next morning. Watson’s conspiracies are not harmless. While it can sometimes be hard to see the ways in which “chemtrails” and 9/11 conspiracies—conspiracy theories he supports that have been popular for many years—are harmful, his efforts to push the conspiracy theory about murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich directly brought anguish to Rich’s mourning family . Besides his conspiracy-mongering, Watson is also known for his racism and sexism. He once joked that the Women’s March should be renamed “handful of self-entitled, fat, ugly feminists trying to get arrested in desperate attempt to impress any man.” He once said “science” proves African and Middle Eastern people have problems with “aggression” because of “low IQ.” He has asserted that “there’s no such thing as moderate Islam. Islam is a violent, intolerant religion which, in its current form, has no place in liberal western democracies.” But the greatest harm likely has to do with his insistence on constantly amplifying absurd right-wing fake news stories without any apparent concern for the truth. Trump also retweeted Lauren Southern, a far-right Canadian activist who has faked transitioning genders as a pretext to interview transgender activists. She claimed Black Lives Matter caused more deaths than the Ku Klux Klan. She showed up at an anti-rape protest with a sign that read, “There is no rape culture in the West.” Even actor James Woods, who has used slurs to describe Muslims, had his Twitter account briefly suspended because of a tweet that violated the site’s rules, according to CNN Business . The president has amplified the voices of racists , misogynists, and white supremacists on his Twitter feed before. But in a dust-up between tech companies and extremists over those extremists’ right to say offensive and bigoted things on those platforms, he sided explicitly with the extremists in a shared sense of victimhood. “Why is @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN, @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook,” he said, to conclude his rant. “Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!”"

The meteor shower is a result of debris left behind by Halley’s Comet. Every year, when the earth passes through the trail the comet left behind, some of the material burns up in our atmosphere, giving us a flash of light. While the shower will be more visible for viewers in the Southern Hemisphere, those in the Northern Hemisphere should still be able to catch some of the display. Luckily, there will be no bright moon to get in the way of viewing, so if you can find a clear patch of sky, you should position yourself to face eastward between 3 a.m. and dawn. It’ll take about half an hour in the dark for your eyes to adjust, but then you should be able to spot some shooting stars. And, according to NASA, even if you can’t take the time to go star-gazing Sunday or Monday morning, you should still be able to catch some for up to a week after. Support our journalism

Facebooks Clear History tool might actually happen. Its about time.,slate.com,,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/facebook-clear-history-button-real-wow.html,"With Smarter Living, the NYT Is Making an Old Bet on Service Journalism At the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in May 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg floated a very un-Facebook-like idea. He said the company was building a “clear history” feature that would let users “flush” their browsing data from Facebook, much like you can erase it from your web browser. He added that the feature would start with the data that Facebook collects from “websites and apps that use Facebook’s ads and analytics tools.” The concept is something privacy advocates have long called for. Yet Zuckerberg’s apparent embrace of it came as a surprise. That’s because it runs counter to Facebook’s long history of agglomerating as much user data as it can, from wherever it can find it. So the trial balloon immediately raised three questions: 1) Really? 2) When? And 3) Really?? We now have an answer to at least the first two of those questions—and a strong hint as to the third. The answers are: 1) Yes, really. 2) This year. And 3) Well… probably really. Mostly. Until Tuesday, the “clear history” idea was starting to look like it might have been an empty promise, made by Zuckerberg under duress and quietly scuttled after the fuss died down. After initially saying the feature would take a few months to build, Facebook told the tech site Recode in December that it was “ taking longer than we initially had thought ,” citing technical obstacles. It’s an excuse that might hold more water if it didn’t come from a company that employs thousands of the world’s most skilled software developers. By last week, the press was losing patience. BuzzFeed’s Ryan Mac wrote a story headlined, “ Mark Zuckerberg promised a clear history tool almost a year ago. Where is it? ” Mac’s reporting suggested that the project was a fantasy at the time it was proposed, and may have never really gotten off the ground. “Mark just wanted to score some points,” one anonymous company source said. On Tuesday, however, Facebook gave a strong indication that “clear history” really is coming—and it attached a more credible timetable. Specifically, Chief Financial Officer David Werner told an audience of bankers, investors, and industry insiders at a Morgan Stanley conference that the feature is coming later this year—and that it would likely hurt Facebook’s targeted advertising business. “”Broadly, [clear history is] going to give us some headwinds in terms of being able to target as effectively as before,” Wehner said, per CNBC. The context is noteworthy, because Wehner wasn’t glad-handing world leaders at Davos or trying to smooth over a controversy in the media. He was warning a bunch of moneybags to expect a punch in the pocketbook. These are people who have more of a vested interest in advertising-industry profits than they have in Facebook’s public image or its users’ privacy. So if it weren’t really happening, Wehner would have little incentive to bring it up. More importantly, the fact that Facebook’s CFO is talking about the feature in terms of “headwinds” to its business suggests that it’s not mere window-dressing. The implication of my third question above—“ Really??” —is that Facebook might indeed release a feature called “clear history,” yet design it in such a way that it’s either ineffectual or unlikely to be broadly used. Facebook and other tech platforms specialize in manipulating users’ behavior via the design of their products. So they know how to bury a feature when they don’t want many people to avail themselves of it. Such a move allows them to mollify privacy critics while maintaining the status quo for the vast majority of users who aren’t aware they can opt out. That still might turn out to be the case with “clear history.” But Wehner’s statement makes it seem more likely that this is a feature Facebook expects people to actually use—perhaps because they’ll actually be able to find it. Otherwise, the effect on its ad business would be negligible. Even so, important questions remain about the feature’s design and function. One question I asked Facebook was: Will the data actually be deleted , or just cleared in some way that leaves it stored on Facebook’s servers? The answer from a Facebook spokesperson suggested it won’t be deleted, per se, though it at least reaffirmed that the data will no longer be used for ad targeting:
From a targeting and optimization perspective, Clear History will be similar to our existing partner data control in Ads Preferences­­—the data a person clears will not be used to personalize their ads. We’ll share more guidance and details on impact for advertisers as we get closer to the launch. That would be in keeping with Facebook’s early statements about the feature. In a May 2018 blog post, the company said it would “remove identifying information so a history of the websites and apps you’ve used won’t be associated with your account.” In other words, the data will still exist, it just won’t be attached to you anymore. Deleting would be a stronger step, but short of that, this seems like a relatively strong form of anonymization, if implemented carefully. Here’s hoping Wehner is right and the feature hurts Facebook’s ad revenues. Not because Facebook losing out on some profits is a good thing in itself—but because it would mean that the feature is actually doing what Facebook promised it would. Support our journalism

"SNL: Adam Sandler hosts for the first time, reprising his classic characters and performing a song about the late Chris Farley.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/snl-adam-sandler-monologue-chris-farley-song-chris-rock-kristen-wiig-jimmy-fallon.html,"Adam Sandler, singing a song about Chris Farley. NBC Adam Sandler hosted Saturday Night Live this week for what was somehow the first time in his career, in an episode filled with nods to his time on the show in the early 1990s, his film career in the decades since, and the almost unbelievable fact that he’s never hosted the show before now. Although Sandler is a Saturday Night Live legend today, when he left the show in the summer of 1995—following a critically reviled season that spawned headlines like “ After Two Decades, How Much Longer? ” and “ Comedy Isn’t Funny ,” many of which specifically called him out as an emblem of the show’s decline—there wasn’t much sense that he was on his way to a great career. (The Associated Press story announcing his departure from Saturday Night Live summed up his non- SNL work in two sentences, one of which was, “He appeared last year in the flop Billy Madison .”) Box office success came later , critical acclaim later still , and Sandler’s return to host Saturday Night Live ? That only happened this week. Sandler opened the show with a monologue that helped explain why he has only returned for a few cameos, with an assist from Chris Rock, who has a Saturday Night Live story of his own: It’s not the first time Sandler has addressed his complicated feelings about the way he and Chris Farley left the show, but it’s the first time he did it in song. Here’s what he told the Daily Beast in 2014 :
Yes, we were [fired]. We kind of quit at the same time as being fired. It was the end of the run for us. The fact that me and him got fired? Who knows. We were on it for a few years, had our run, and everything happens for a reason. We kind of understood because we did our thing. It hurt a lot at the time because we were young and didn’t know where we were going, but it all worked out. In the decades since leaving SNL , Sandler has become part of the comedy landscape, so much so that Saturday Night Live was able to build an entire sketch around the current cast members imitating Adam Sandler characters. The appeal of getting to play one of Sandler’s dunces was so great that it attracted former cast members Jimmy Fallon and Kristen Wiig, neither of whose time on the show overlapped with Sandler’s: It’s a nice structure for a sketch that basically exists to let the cast geek out about getting to work with Adam Sandler. Sandler then revisited one of his own classic bits, returning to the Weekend Update desk as Opera Man, last seen in the days when Colin Ferguson was a household name. But Sandler saved his deepest dive into early 1990s nostalgia for his final appearance, performing a country song about Chris Farley from his Netflix special 100% Fresh . If you told a random television critic in the spring of 1995 that 24 years later, Adam Sandler would return to Saturday Night Live to perform a sincere country song about mourning Chris Farley, that critic would probably be furious that you mastered time travel, then used it to pass on news about SNL instead of bringing back a sports almanac or at least killing baby Hitler. But he or she would also be surprised that the passage of time had turned Sandler and Farley from “the guys ruining Saturday Night Live ” into beloved objects of nostalgia from the show’s glory days. Maybe there’s hope for Alec Baldwin yet. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again. Email address: Send me updates about Slate special offers.

Trump says political correctness is to blame for the Kentucky Derby controversy.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-says-political-correctness-is-to-blame-for-the-kentucky-derby-controversy.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies On Sunday morning, Trump weighed in on the controversial decision the day before to disqualify the horse that crossed the finish line first at the 145 th Kentucky Derby. Racing officials determined after the event on Saturday that the horse Maximum Security, the first-place finisher, had swerved into another horse’s path and thus could not win the crown. The 65–1 long shot Country House was instead named the winner. The president sent out a tweet expressing his displeasure with the decision and implying that the “wet and sloppy track” was actually at fault. He also suggested that “political correctness” had played a role in the upset:
The Kentucky Derby decision was not a good one. It was a rough & tumble race on a wet and sloppy track, actually, a beautiful thing to watch. Only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did NOT win the Kentucky Derby - not even close! This is the first time in history that the apparent winner of the Derby has been disqualified, and also undoubtedly the first time that a sitting president has tweeted to quibble with the outcome. As Politico points out, former New York City mayor and current attorney for the president Rudy Giuliani retweeted Trump’s complaint and also voiced his support for Maximum Security, writing, “This horse stood up to all challengers and was stronger at the end.” This isn’t the first time that the president has made accusations about “political correctness” in sports. Trump sent a fundraising email to his supporters in September blasting ESPN for its “spineless surrender to the politically correct liberal mob” after the network announced that it would not be broadcasting the national anthem before Monday night football games, despite the fact that this was a policy held over from previous seasons. Trump’s attack followed his long feud with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started a movement among athletes to kneel during the anthem to protest police brutality."

Morgan must be formally nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. “I am pleased to inform all of those that believe in a strong, fair and sound Immigration Policy that Mark Morgan will be joining the Trump Administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ICE,” Trump wrote. “Mark is a true believer and American Patriot.” The Washington Post reports that senior ICE leaders were taken by surprise, only learning of the selection from the tweet. Morgan is a former career FBI agent who served as the Border Patrol chief for the last six months of the Obama presidency, but was then replaced when Trump assumed office. Since then, Morgan has spoken to various media outlets backing many of Trump’s immigration proposals, such as building the border wall and sending migrants to sanctuary cities. “I was removed. I’m standing up and saying, ‘I should have disdain for them, but I don’t because they are right,” he said in a January interview with Law and Crime . Morgan has consistently characterized current immigration trends as an unprecedented crisis. Trump withdrew the nomination of Ronald Vitiello, who had 30 years of experience with the Border Patrol, to head ICE in April. The Post reported at the time that White House adviser Stephen Miller had been lobbying against Vitiello. The president said of the move, “We’re going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction.” Former Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned two days later. “Here’s phase one of what ‘tougher’ looks like, in my opinion,” Morgan told the Los Angeles Times last month when news broke of Vitiello’s nixed nomination, “They have to stop expecting that Congress is going to do their job. DHS is going to have to address this issue all alone.” Morgan claimed that there is an incentive for undocumented immigrants to “grab kid, step one foot onto U.S. soil” to bypass border laws. He further said that, while he doesn’t believe that the White House will reimpose its family separation policy, it must take dramatic action “even if we lose in the courts.” The Trump administration has been ramping up efforts to tighten border security in recent weeks. The Justice Department directed judges late last month to deny bond hearings for asylum seekers, which would leave them in detention for months while they wait for their claims to be adjudicated. The administration is also asking Congress for additional border security funding to expand detention space and enact other measures. Support our journalism

Trump comes out against potential Mueller testimony.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-comes-out-against-potential-mueller-testimony.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset House Judiciary Committee member David Cicilline said on Fox News Sunday that the committee had decided on May 15 as a “tentative date” for special counsel Robert Mueller to testify about his investigation. Cicilline claimed on the program that a representative for Mueller had preliminarily agreed to the date, adding, “We think the American people have a right to hear directly from him.” The congressman sent out a tweet later in the day reading, “Just to clarify: we are aiming to bring Mueller in on the 15th, but nothing has been agreed to yet. That’s the date the Committee has proposed, and we hope the Special Counsel will agree to it. Sorry for the confusion.” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler also said last week that the committee was aiming to hold the hearing on May 15. Amid the confusion, Trump sent out a string of condemnatory tweets about the investigation and Congress on Sunday that included the lines, “Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!” This was an abrupt reversal for the president who, when asked by reporters on Friday whether Mueller should testify, said , “I don’t know. That’s up to our attorney general, who I think has done a fantastic job.” Attorney General William Barr previously told Congress that he has no problem with Mueller testifying. Cicilline also said on Fox News Sunday that the White House “has so far indicated they would not interfere with Mr. Mueller’s attempts to testify.” Testimony from Mueller could provide clarifying information about the report’s findings and its handling by the Justice Department. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the investigation concluded there was “no collusion” and “no obstruction,” even though Mueller outlined 10 episodes of potential obstruction in the report. Many have also accused Barr of misrepresenting the contents of the report in the four-page summary he wrote prior to its release, and House Judiciary Democrats surfaced a letter last week that Mueller sent to the attorney general, which read, in part: “The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.” Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Mueller said in a subsequent phone call that he did not think the summary was inaccurate, but was rather objecting to the media’s coverage of it. Sen. Lindsey Graham sent a letter to Mueller on Friday ostensibly inviting him to testify before the Senate as well; it read, in part, “Please inform the Committee if you would like to provide testimony regarding any misrepresentation by the Attorney General of the substance of the phone call.”"
SNL: Adam Sandler plays a travel agent who is very worried you are expecting too much from your vacation.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/adam-sandler-saturday-night-live-italian-travel-agent.html,"Travel can only do so much! NBC This week’s episode of Saturday Night Live was primarily a nostalgia trip fueled by the incongruous sight of Adam Sandler back in Studio 8H. But one sketch would have killed even without being placed in the context of the Adam Sandler Televisual/Cinematic Universe or the even more popular Aging Gen Xers Who Are Looking Mortality in the Eye, Perhaps for the First Time Universe. Meet Joe Romano, a travel agent who is extremely worried you might be expecting more from your trip to Italy than he can deliver: There’s a bit of a fake-out here: Initially, the premise seems to be something along the lines of Dan Aykroyd’s “ E. Buzz Miller’s Art Classics ,” as Sandler explains his family’s generational commitment to showing the wonders of Italy to “people from all over the world, but mostly Long Island and Jersey.” But the sketch takes an unexpected and delightful turn about a minute in, when Sandler turns toward the camera and begins lecturing the audience about not pinning their hopes for a better life on tourism:
People love us. But every so often a customer leaves a review that they were disappointed or didn’t have as much fun as they thought. So here at Romano Tours, we always remind our customers, “If you’re sad now, you might still feel sad there, OK? You understand? That makes sense?” There’s nothing funnier than a sketch in which a familiar television form is distorted and ruined by one character’s monomaniacal weirdness, but the last great example was Louis C.K.’s “ Sectionals ” ad, a sketch that has since been distorted and ruined, along with the rest of C.K.’s body of work, by one character’s monomaniacal weirdness . So it’s good to see the form is still alive and well. But what’s interesting about this variation is that Joe Romano may be weird, but he is also essentially correct. Where’s the lie here?
A day is a long time to feel happy, for all of it. Most of us get 45 minutes if we’re lucky. The reason it is incongruous and funny for Sandler to admit this in a travel ad is that denying that basic fact about the human experience is the foundation of modern advertising. By the way, “Romano Tours” is four minutes and 11 seconds long. If you liked it, you’re just 40 minutes and 49 seconds away from one of the happiest days of your entire life.

The worst person in Game of Thrones' The Last of the Starks is Cersei Lannister.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/game-of-thrones-worst-person-in-westeros-season-8-episode-4-cersei-lannister.html,"Stephen Colbert Accidentally Proves Donald Trump Is Not a Typical Republican After each episode in Game of Thrones Season 8 , we’ll be answering a crucial question: Who is currently the worst person in Westeros? This week, editorial assistant Rachelle Hampton is joined by Slate associate editor Seth Maxon. Rachelle Hampton: Hey, Seth, and thanks for joining me to decide this week’s Worst Person in Westeros! There are numerous contenders now that the army of the (un)dead is actually dead and Cersei is back on the chessboard after what I can imagine was a nice nap last week. She was truly in fine Mad Queen form this week, managing to kill off the one morally pure character on this show, and breaking my heart in the process. But let’s back up to the beginning of “The Last of the Starks,” which opened up with a solemn reminder of who exactly had died in the Battle of Winterfell—let’s all pour one out for my girl, Lyanna. That joyous after-battle feast had a whole lot going on, from the drinking games to that extremely weird interaction between Sansa and the Hound to Dany deciding to lord-ify Gendry on the fly. That last move was a clever bit of politicking and maybe one of the only smart leadership decisions Dany’s made this entire season, proving that she, too, can be as clever as Tyrion purportedly is. And speaking of his cleverness, it is, once again, nowhere to be found this episode. From futilely trying to convince Cersei that she’s not a monster to his continued loyalty to Dany despite her obvious (and low-key poorly written) descent into madness, Tyrion is a shadow of his former self. Is his misguided trust enough to make him the worst this episode? Seth Maxon: Before I get to Tyrion, let’s talk about that battle feast. Given the stakes and limited time remaining in the show, it is kind of astonishing how much of the first half-hour of this episode was focused on characters either getting down or not getting down, if not turning down a future of getting down. (Tough break, now-Lord Gendry.) The world did just nearly end, though, and they’re all astonished to be alive, so I guess getting drunk and getting down does seem like an appropriate celebration. L’Chaim! Tyrion does continue to seem misguided—but I think there’s more going on here than blind trust. He wasn’t wrong in that final scene in thinking that he is, at this point, the only person with a shred of hope to convince Cersei of anything. They did grow up together, and despite everything, he knows her more deeply than anyone else on either side of that looming clash. Talking to Cersei might have been futile, but I think he was right to try to appeal to her, because it was the only chance he had to stop the war. His tongue, it is said, is his greatest weapon, and speaking then was the most he could do. And as for his continued loyalty amid Dany’s narratively dissatisfying descent, Tyrion seems most driven by what he mentioned to Sansa on the barricades: fear. He’s probably wrong when he tells Varys that Dany’s the best possible leader for Westeros, but he’s not a bad person for being afraid of her wrath. What about Daenerys herself? While the rest of Winterfell was grieving and grief-drinking (and getting down), she started this episode by swiftly pivoting from “humankind is lucky to have survived the apocalypse; a bunch of people we love are dead” to “the game is back on.” And she persistently ignored the advice of her smartest advisers and allies (notably Sansa, again) and, in doing so, worsened her chances in the war against Cersei, saw her closest confidant and dragon child killed, and (along with Cersei) made nearly certain mass death basically inevitable. Is Daenerys the worst? Hampton: As much as it pains me to say this, Daenerys’ decisions this week ultimately made sense. I might just be getting used to her megalomania and unique talent for assembling advisers just for the express purpose of ignoring their counsel. I might just want her to burn down King’s Landing after queen of my heart Missandei died, who knows! But the decision to march her troops immediately south after slogging through that battle wasn’t one she made alone—Jon and Tyrion both seemed to agree. And it doesn’t really seem like waiting a few weeks would have prevented that Euron sneak attack that shouldn’t have worked by any stretch of the imagination. She’s flying thousands of feet in the air and doesn’t see a battalion of ships? Only one of her dragons can pivot now? I call bullshit. In terms of who is more directly responsible for the thousands of deaths we will certainly see in upcoming weeks, I unfortunately have to say that Dany doesn’t share equal blame with Cersei. Which, of course, only makes Jaime’s decision to return to Cersei’s side all the more depressing. His slow development of a conscience, seemingly cemented by his ride north and his relationship with Brienne, was one of the more compelling parts of the show as it currently stands. And then he throws it all away for his crazypants sister. While I hate what the writers did to Brienne in her last scene—battle-hardened warrior that she is, she’d never beg Jaime to turn away from a fight—I hate Jaime’s turn back toward the incestuous dark side more. But what say you, Seth? Maxon: Man, great point about the dragons and the Dragon Queen missing Euron’s fleet from above. Get your dragon heads in the game, y’all. And Missandei absolutely deserves to be avenged; I wish that for us all. But I think the most important point you make about Dany is that Jon and Tyrion supported her when they might have had the power to stop her. The blame for the coming bloodshed is indeed shared, among them all as well as with Cersei. Jaime preparing his return to his sister was hard to watch. He is seemingly tearing down all he’s built up—in himself and with Brienne—to succumb to his ultimate demon. The great Ser Brienne believed in Jaime, and he’s betraying that faith. But I think there’s more to his choice than may be immediately apparent. Now that humankind is saved, he likely believes he owes his loyalty to the person to whom he’s always been most loyal. And in his self-hatred, he believes siding with Cersei is more true to who he “really” is. He thinks that he’s a mythical knight—and at bottom he is one—and kicking it with Brienne amid a great war would never strike him as honorable. I think Brienne will be proved right about Jaime’s nature in the end. Returning to Cersei is also the only way he can personally stop her. The Kingslayer can’t slay the queen from Winterfell. In King’s Landing, he may yet. As for the queen: Her refusal to join the fight for humanity’s survival and her clinging to the throne at the expense of all else is what has brought about this whole war. If we believe the episode’s prognosticators, thousands will die so she can stay on the throne and pass power to her baby. Those are Cersei’s only goals. And maybe even colder still: She ordered Missandei beheaded. You see where I’m going here. Hampton: I do see where you’re going, and I’m right there with you. It was clear from the moment that Cersei stepped out onto that platform with Missandei what was going to happen and that it was going to cement her as The Worst. But for the sake of being thorough, let’s go through her crimes against humanity this week. Normally I am at least somewhat amused by Cersei’s villainy—and as I said last week, she inspires the revenge-seeking wine aunt in me. But not this episode. First, she used her people as human shields and hostages, bringing them into the Red Keep to maximize the human fallout if and when Dany decides to storm the city. Then she lies to Euron about the paternity of her baby—which I honestly do not care about but still, not great form. One of the more subtly cruel moments is putting Missandei back into shackles, while mocking Dany’s “breaker of chains” title. Of course, what tips her into Worst Person territory is that beheading, which was not only heartbreaking but pragmatically stupid. Keeping Missandei as a hostage while refusing to surrender would’ve made much more sense in the long term. It also would’ve kept some of Dany’s rage at bay, thus minimizing the chance that she decides to go for scorched-earth tactics and keeping casualties lower. Before this moment, I, like Tyrion, had a faint hope that Cersei wasn’t just content to rule over a burning city of screaming children just to say she won. Now, it’s fair to say that hope is as dead as the Mountain once was. It’s not like Cersei was ever exactly a saint, but were her actions this week enough to name her our Worst Person? Maxon: I think that they were. I too can’t be moved much by Euron incorrectly thinking he’s a daddy-to-be, but that is a long and awful list of cruelty and death. And for what? A long history of cruelty does not exonerate more cruelty. Cersei Lannister, some weeks you do have that vengeful wine-aunt charm, but this week … Hampton: Even a pitcher of the best Dornish wine couldn’t stop you from being named Worst Person in Westeros.

Game of Thrones: What was that coffee cup doing there?,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/game-of-thrones-daenerys-coffee-cup-starbucks-winterfell.html,"Can you spot it? HBO It’s almost impossible to make a movie or television show without a continuity error or two, and that goes triple for period pieces: Every shot is an opportunity to accidentally photograph a contrail or a passing car in the background and bring the audience’s suspension of disbelief crashing down. But when you name a character something as fancy as “Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains,” you have a special responsibility to make sure that character does not appear to be addicted to Dunkaccinos . Unfortunately, this week’s Game of Thrones didn’t quite meet that standard: In one shot, Daenerys sits at a large banquet table celebrating her victory over the Night King. She’s holding one of the show’s trademark giant goblets of wine, but right before her on the table sits a disposable coffee cup with one of those cardboard sleeves that keep you from burning your hands. We’ve altered the shot slightly to draw your attention to the cup, but you can find this at 17:39 in the HBO Now version of the episode: Now can you spot it? HBO Naturally, the internet noticed immediately. “Didn’t know they had a Starbucks in Winterfell,” Reddit user ttek15 posted , and social media was off to the races. For some viewers, the misplaced coffee cup was an emblem of the show’s decline in its last few seasons: the starbucks cup... as if we needed any more proof they dont give a shit pic.twitter.com/948IakEUe1 — we're not suicidal just angels who want to go bac (@danystormborn) May 6, 2019 For others, it was proof that Game of Thrones was even more intricate and carefully crafted than they’d previously realized: The Starbucks cup is a deliberate clue by the Daves that Game of Thrones and Monty Python and the Holy Grail have the same ending — Danny Bowes (@bybowes) May 6, 2019 The last scene is everyone ripping their wigs off and getting in cars — Danny Bowes (@bybowes) May 6, 2019 And for some Game of Thrones fans, it was just another piece of evidence in the ongoing case against capitalism, at least after they’d retconned the production screwup into Game of Thrones canon. This user is lambasting Starbucks for rushing to open a franchise in Winterfell just hours after the Night King’s fall: De verdad que el capitalismo voraz no tiene límites, Starbucks abrió franquicia en Winterfell a unas horas de la caída del rey de la noche. #GameOfThrones pic.twitter.com/U6SDsFG2t4 — Skyshock (@SkyshockGG) May 6, 2019 Mostly, though, Daenerys’ mysterious coffee cup has raised practical questions about the Game of Thrones universe. It’s being described as a “Starbucks cup,” but although the logo on the sleeve is blurry, it doesn’t much resemble Howard Schultz’s green siren .* Is it from the craft services table? A Westeros-only chain? When Daenerys orders coffee, does she insist the baristas write her full name and title on the cup? What happens to them if they misspell it? And why would a woman who spent an entire night engulfed in flames before emerging without so much as a blister need a cardboard sleeve to protect her from a cappuccino? What is she hiding ? The Game of Thrones showrunners have written themselves into corners and somehow written their way out before, but it’s going to take a lot of all-night brainstorming sessions to explain Daenerys’ coffee habit away.

The cheese and veggie omelet MRE: the worst food in the military.,slate.com,Zachary Lunn,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/vomelet-bad-mre-omelet-military.html,"Until Recently, I’d Never Seen Another Black Hunter Depicted in Pop Culture. When I Finally Did, It Hit Very Close to Home. In the Army, when we trained in the field—and especially when we deployed overseas for combat operations—we had to put up with a ton of bullshit. There was the frequency with which our uniforms’ crotches blew out when performing basic actions like climbing into a Humvee turret, and the yet-to-catch on weight-loss routine of taking a dump in a Porta-Potty in 120-degree Baghdad heat. (Save it for nighttime, it’s cooler!) We were up to our eyeballs in dust that clung everywhere. We produced sweat from our shins, which I hadn’t thought possible. All these years later, though, what I can’t stop thinking about is the omelet. The primary operational food rations for the military are “Meals Ready to Eat,” prepackaged bags of foodstuffs that replaced the Vietnam-era C-Rations. Three MREs a day and you’re good to go. To me, “Ready to Eat” should really only apply to fruits and some vegetables, but they have to get creative to support the demands of a ground-fighting army, I totally get it. According to the Army, these things are made to withstand a parachute fall from 1,250, and with a few exceptions, they taste like it. When I was in Iraq, I would dream of being lucky enough to pull a tuna or chicken with noodles MRE. Both of them are fantastic. Pork rib and beef enchilada are not so great, but you could choke ’em down. In 2005, the Department of Defense’s Combat Feeding Directorate introduced a new item to their lineup of MREs: Menu Item No. 4, the cheese and veggie omelet. And it’s bad. I mean legendarily bad. Imagine a gelatinous (yet somehow firm?) rectangular slab of yellowish-beige food matter . Somewhere in there you might get slivers of honest-to-God peppers or tomatoes, though if you can detect them you have the finely tuned taste buds of Julia Child. You know that homemade slime your kids love to make with water, glue, and Borax ? The stuff that makes fart noises and creates a ridiculous mess for you to clean up later? The cheese and veggie omelet MRE is basically that, only marginally less poisonous. Troops quickly dubbed it the “vomelet” both for its taste and barf-like appearance. Mix it with the hash browns that came with it and you had bona fide Hollywood prop puke. As quickly as 2006, a year after the omelet’s implementation, all of us in basic training knew of its infamy. My recruiter had grinned and warned me to stay away from it before shipping me off, and I remember overhearing a fellow recruit in basic training doing the same for the benefit of the soldier standing next to him in the chow line. But sometimes an omelet encounter was unavoidable. For grunts like me, military life often involves getting randomly assigned to short-term details—hauling hundreds of rucksacks onto a trailer, or raking gravel, or burning the shit from outhouses in Iraq. This means while you’re performing that grueling duty, everyone else gets their choice of MRE; when you stagger in later, sweaty and tired and covered in gravel, you’re stuck with the vomelet. Do my Army buddies remember the vomelet with the same hatred I do? One, Nathaniel, told me he recalls getting stuck with one after not eating for a day or so and still only being able to manage one bite. I don’t blame ya, brother. Another, Nathan, said he once saw someone devour one on guard duty and blow chunks soon after. That guy’s a true American hero, that’s what I say. Then there’s this one guy—there’s always one—who said, “I didn’t mind it.” Fuck you, Eric. Mix it with the hash browns that came with it and you had bona fide Hollywood prop puke. The Combat Feeding Directorate tried to make good. The 2005 version included a bag of M&M’s or Skittles that could go for twenty bucks in basic training. After the first year of Menu Item No. 4’s production, miniature bottles of Tabasco sauce were included in the MRE package. The directorate added an off-brand Pop-Tart, too. Nevertheless, the vomelet remained my, and every other soldier’s, least favorite MRE until it was discontinued in 2009 after a four-year run. That doesn’t mean they no longer exist, though: MREs are made to last at least three years at 80 degrees, but even that doesn’t stop people from eating them well after their supposed shelf life. There’s an entire subculture of preppers, gun enthusiasts, outdoorspeople, and survivalists who are super into MREs and military rations, acquiring them and posting reviews on forums and YouTube. ( Sample omelet review: “It really is as bad as you’ve heard.” ) I failed in my attempt to track down one last Cheese and Veggie Omelet MRE for old time’s sake. I did, however, find a cheese and veggie omelet T-shirt . A T-shirt! The first thing I did? Bought that shit for Eric because he’s an idiot and also he once lent me a tapestry to hang in my room in Iraq and I never gave it back. The second thing I did? Checked the product description. “Thankfully we will never have to suffer through the hell that is the Veggie Omelet No. 4 again!” wrote the person who designed this shirt. “Remind everyone to be thankful for the Joint Services Operational Rations Forum for getting rid of this meal!” I’ve been out of the military for seven years. In 2018, the Army introduced pizza to its MRE menu . Holy shit. I can imagine pulling rooftop guard for eight hours—sweat seeping through my helmet liner, neck stiff from the weight of my night vision goggles—and lumbering down the stairs at the end of my shift where a fucking pizza is waiting for me like the Holy Grail. Another shift in eight hours? No problem! I guess I’m not mad about the pizza. Food has a serious effect on morale. It’s not just how bad a meal tastes: It’s how that meal can heighten all the other stressors of military life. For me and the other soldiers in my unit, the omelet became a stand-in for how we believed the Army felt about us and how we expected to be treated. The omelet MRE went into production just before George W. Bush’s 2007 troop surge in Iraq, which extended my unit’s yearlong tour to 15 months. Having to eat that felt like the Army was giving me the finger for helping its grandmother cross the street. When I think back to my years in the Army, yeah, I remember singing Bob Marley over the Humvee’s radio, knowing my platoon was laughing and their spirits uplifted for a brief, rewarding moment. But I can still taste the vomelet."
Boeing Failed to Disclose Faulty Cockpit Alert for Months Before Lion Air Crash,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/boeing-delay-faulty-alert-light-737-max.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies Boeing was aware of a faulty system that inactivated a cockpit alert function in its 737 Max jets for months before the deadly Lion Air crash but failed to disclose the issue to airlines and regulators until after the accident, according to a statement the company put out Sunday. The aerospace manufacturer maintains that the issue “did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation.” While it’s not known if the lack of a functioning alert light—known as the “angle of attack disagree alert”—played a role in the Lion Air and later Ethiopian Airlines crashes that killed a combined 346 people, the statement raises further questions about how transparent the company has been in dealing with the 737 Max jets. Preliminary investigations for both accidents suggest faulty data from a malfunctioning angle of attack, or AOA, sensor, sent the signal to the plane’s anti-stall software that the plane was pointed at a dangerously high angle, putting it at risk of stalling. The software, known as MCAS, reacted by pitching the nose downward. The pilots struggled and failed to regain control of the plane. Boeing had become aware shortly after rolling out the new 737s in 2017 that the AOA disagree alert, which might have warned pilots that the AOA sensors were sending inaccurate information, did not work unless the airlines also bought a separate optional feature called an AOA indicator. The jets have two AOA sensors, and the optional indicator would trigger the alert if the two sensors were sending contradictory information, indicating one or both of them was faulty. When Boeing began delivering the jets in 2017, the company included the cockpit warning light as a standard feature, but when a few months later it determined it only worked in jets that also contained the optional indicator, as the New York Times put it, “a safety feature that Boeing thought was standard was actually a premium add-on.” Only 20 percent of customers had purchased the indicator, according to the Times. Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were among those that chose not to buy it. But Boeing insisted—and still insists—that the 737 Max jets were safe to fly even without the disagree light, given the other gauges present to measure the plane’s position, speed, and performance. And Boeing told the Times that the disagree light would not have warned pilots of sensor disagreement until the jets were 400 feet above the ground, meaning it would not have alerted the Lion Air pilots to a faulty sensor until after takeoff. (According to the Times, conflicting information over this was another source of frustration for pilots. A spokesman for pilots for American Airlines, which had purchased the optional indicator, told the Times they were given extra confidence to fly the 737 Max jets because Boeing told them the alert would function while still on the ground.) Boeing notified the Federal Aviation Administration of the nonfunctioning warning lights after the Lion crash in October 2018. An FAA spokesman said the agency then determined that the issue presented only a low safety risk but still chastised the company for the delayed notification. “Boeing’s timely or earlier communication with [airlines] would have helped to reduce or eliminate possible confusion,” the spokesman told the Associated Press . Airlines were then informed of the need for the add-on for the alert to work. Southwest Airlines told the AP that after Boeing notified it of the issue, Southwest added the optional feature. The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into whether Boeing misled regulators about features on the plane, including the MCAS software, which relied on only one of the two AOA sensors. Boeing is also facing a number of lawsuits from the families of the passengers and an investigation by the Transportation Department’s inspector general. Boeing is working on an update to make the anti-stall system less powerful and reliant on both sensors, according to the Times. It will also update the disagree alert to make them independent of the AOA indicators, which will also be installed in all 737 Max jets before they are allowed to fly again."

This all sounds pretty alarming, but a couple of facts are worth keeping in mind. First, the White House probably did not actually decide to do this over the weekend. The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group had already left in early April on what the Navy press release called a “ regularly scheduled deployment .” As Rand Corp. analyst Becca Wasser tweets , “chances are this deployment has been long-planned. [White House] message is piggybacking on planned ops to make a point.” (Hopefully the ships are at least headed in the right direction this time.) Second, it’s not clear what “troubling and escalatory indications” Bolton is referring to. According to the New York Times , citing an American military official, “as of late Friday, military analysts were not tracking any new, imminent or clearly defined Iranian or Iranian-backed threats against Americans in Iraq or the region.” Update, May 6, 2019: U.S. Officials are now saying, according to CNN, that the move was ordered in response to “serious and credible” intelligence suggesting a threat to U.S. forces in Syria, Iraq, and at sea from Iranian forces and proxies. So, there’s no sign that anything actually “happened” over the weekend. Iran didn’t do anything out of the ordinary, that we know of, and neither did the United States. But the escalating rhetoric could still be worrisome. Bolton’s latest rhetorical volley follows a series of moves by the Trump administration to dial up the pressure on Tehran, including designating the regime’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization and ending sanctions waivers for countries importing Iranian oil. Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, warned of unspecified “consequences” in response. Iranian officials have suggested several times in recent weeks that they could retaliate by shutting down the Strait of Hormuz, the crucial waterway through which 20 percent of the world’s oil flows, a move that would cause an immediate spike in global oil prices and significantly raise the risk of armed conflict. Iran has threatened to do this several times over the years and has never followed through, but the latest signals from Tehran may have been what prompted Bolton’s missive. There have also been reports that Iran could announce later this week that it is withdrawing from at least some of its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. This week will mark one year since the U.S. withdrew from the deal. Bolton, who has given paid speeches to the controversial Iranian opposition group M.E.K., has long advocated regime change in Iran. As Dexter Filkins’ recent New Yorker profile of the national security adviser explained, President Donald Trump, a skeptic about military intervention, may be less enthusiastic about that strategy. (As one source told Filkins, “Bolton’s worst nightmare is that Khamenei will write Trump a letter saying, ‘Why don’t we get together and talk?’ Because he knows that Trump would jump at that opportunity.”) Iran’s Zarif surmised this in a recent interview , describing Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed as the “B team” who were looking to provoke Iran into doing something that could provide a pretext for military action, as opposed to Trump, who wanted to pressure Iran into negotiation. While Trump has often seemed less preoccupied with Iran than some of his advisers have, he clearly sees a hard line as politically advantageous and has been letting Bolton—as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo—set the aggressive tone. We may see the consequences very soon."

But when Disney announced that a live-action Lady and the Tramp would be coming to its streaming service, the project invited one especially tricky question: What would it do with the problematic “The Siamese Cat Song”? Variety reports that Janelle Monáe, who has a voice role in the movie, and her artist collective Wondaland are “reinventing” the 1955 movie track, which has long been listed among Disney’s most racist moments for its stereotyped representation of East Asian culture. Originally recorded by Peggy Lee for the feline character pair Si and Am, the song opened with the lines “We are Siamese if you please/ We are Siamese if you don’t please” and presented the cat duo as sneaky and sly—adding to their problematic animated rendering with slanting eyes and buck teeth. In the new version, the pair will reportedly not be Siamese cats. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

"Trump Should Have Been Charged With Obstruction, According to Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/federal-prosecutors-letter-trump-obstruction.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset More than 400 former federal prosecutors have signed a letter contending that President Donald Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice based on the findings of the Mueller report if he weren’t president. The letter , published to Medium on Monday, is backed by a growing list of impressive names—413 at the time of this post’s publication. They include, as the Washington Post notes, Bill Weld , who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination; Donald Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration; Paul Rosenzweig,* who served as senior counsel to Ken Starr; and a number of U.S. attorneys and former chiefs and directors of various departments and agencies. The signatories include career government employees who have worked for decades at the Department of Justice and high-profile political appointees who have served during both Republican and Democratic presidencies dating back to the Eisenhower administration. “Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would, in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President, result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice,” the former federal officials wrote. The Mueller report did not conclude that Trump had committed criminal obstruction of justice, in part because of the DOJ policy against indicting sitting presidents, but Mueller did write that “if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” The report details both Trump’s efforts to fire Mueller and—after being told by White House counsel Don McGahn that he could not fire Mueller—Trump’s attempt to cover up those efforts. (Attorney General William Barr has said it would be difficult to prove the latter beyond a reasonable doubt.) The report also concluded that Trump had tried to use intermediaries outside the White House to pass along the message to have Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation, limit the scope of the Mueller investigation. “The Mueller report describes several acts that satisfy all of the elements for an obstruction charge: conduct that obstructed or attempted to obstruct the truth-finding process, as to which the evidence of corrupt intent and connection to pending proceedings is overwhelming,” the prosecutors said in the letter. Barr said he had determined that the Mueller report was “not sufficient” to establish any criminal wrongdoing by the president. But the federal prosecutors named in Monday’s letter acknowledged the potential defenses of Trump’s behavior and rejected Barr’s reasoning anyway. “To look at these facts and say that a prosecutor could not probably sustain a conviction for obstruction of justice — the standard set out in Principles of Federal Prosecution — runs counter to logic and our experience,” they wrote. “As former federal prosecutors, we recognize that prosecuting obstruction of justice cases is critical because unchecked obstruction — which allows intentional interference with criminal investigations to go unpunished — puts our whole system of justice at risk,” they concluded. “We believe strongly that, but for the [Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President], the overwhelming weight of professional judgment would come down in favor of prosecution for the conduct outlined in the Mueller Report.” Support our journalism

Video Therapy,slate.com,Shannon Palus,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/video-therapy-evidence-stronger-than-text-based-therapy.html,"Why You Don’t Need to Worry About That New Drug-Resistant Super Fungus One morning a week, before work, I sit in bed and have a session with my therapist. I’ve been seeing her for close to a year. We’ve never met in person. As a professional product reviewer and anxious person, you can bet that I didn’t hand my psychological well-being over to a person in a screen without first carefully reviewing the evidence behind the practice. I’ve reported extensively on internet and app-based therapy, including authoring Wirecutter’s guide on the best services out there. Between that reporting and my personal experience, I’ve learned that video-based therapy can be just as good as, or even better than, in-person therapy. Which was why I was frustrated by a piece questioning the validity of therapy apps by Jess McHugh, published last week in Elemental. McHugh explores the evidence behind therapy apps and argues that it comes up lacking. But what McHugh—and, I worry, many consumers—doesn’t do is distinguish between the different types of internet-based therapies available, namely video and text. (McHugh also briefly addresses mental health apps that involve self-guided exercises, which in my opinion show promise but are ripe for false advertising and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.) When it comes to therapy delivered primarily by text, I agree with McHugh’s assessment. The research that these companies cite is promising but nascent . Work conducted with robust sample sizes has been done by companies themselves, making it less reliable. Text-based apps like Talkspace and BetterHelp are getting a lot of attention thanks to celebrity endorsements and advertisements on Instagram. But the newness of the exchange—patients engage with their therapists in an intermittent but ongoing conversation via a secure text platform—means they are still very much worth questioning. I’m glad to see McHugh do that. But video-based teletherapy has been fairly well-tested. One trial that ran from 2006 to 2010 involving nearly 100,000 patients receiving care from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that those who used video versus traditional services actually saw a decreased need for hospitalization. The researchers theorized this might be because care to keep them from reaching a breaking point was so accessible. For the VA, “telemental health services have revolutionized mental health care delivery,” the authors note. So, consumer-facing services that work via video aren’t charting untested territory in the same way text-based apps are—instead, they’re following in the footsteps of hospitals. There are potential downsides to video therapy, of course. Therapy is in part about gestures and reading emotion, notes Ellen Vora, an NYC-based psychiatrist and one of McHugh’s sources. But video platforms, where patients meet with therapists over Skype-like calls, allow therapists to see a patient’s body language. Via video, unlike text, a therapist can see if a patient stalls or has trouble getting words out, can sit with a patient while they cry, or can furrow their brow in sympathy. I’ve sobbed to my current therapist many times and have found the experience quite similar to doing so in person. The major consumer-facing players in video therapy are AmWell and Doctor on Demand, which have the option for a visit over a computer or a phone app. They’re not as app-y and quick fix–y in their posture as some of the text-based companies, and they do not advertise aggressively on social media. But video therapy is also expanding—even therapists with traditional in-person practices are offering video sessions over free telemedicine platforms. And Talkspace allows for users to connect over video if they prefer (though it costs more) while BetterHelp also has an option if you want to be matched with a therapist willing to do video (in fact, despite the text-first nature of these app, some providers will only see patients via video). One of the main advantages of apps is the convenience, which becomes more than convenience for people who have trouble physically or mentally getting themselves to traditional therapy. (I personally switched to video after I kept finding myself having to take an emergency $35 Lyft to my in-person therapist, but that was mainly because the New York subways were so frequently haywire.) Science writer and Slate parenting columnist Melinda Wenner Moyer, who started seeing her therapist over Doxy.me after the therapist moved away, told me that she was skeptical about the switch but now actually prefers video therapy. “I can sit in the comfort of my own home, with a cup of coffee next to me—it just feels more comfortable opening up in my own space.” Video therapy isn’t without downsides. One of the major annoyances: Just like regular Skype, the secure video platforms can be buggy. It’s not ideal for couples therapy, where it helps therapists to see the dynamic between two people. Depending on your specific diagnosis and disposition, your doctor or therapist might have her own reasoning why it’s best for you to see someone in a traditional office. But the place most consumers should draw the line isn’t between in-person therapy and app therapy. It’s between face-to-face therapy, whether in person or via video, and text-based therapy. The real efficacy questions center around text-based therapy, which deploys an under-researched format that is distinctly different than normal therapy. If we lump video in with the rest as iffy and unproven, we risk keeping a lot of people from getting help."

The 2020 Election’s Approach Is No Reason to Avoid Impeachment,slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/2020-election-approach-shouldnt-end-impeachment.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies Americans seem to largely agree that President Donald Trump is a criminal . Recent polling supports that claim: 54 percent of American voters say Trump “attempted to derail or obstruct the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election,” while 72 percent say Robert Mueller conducted a fair investigation. Despite the president’s bluster about how the Russia hoax has “stollen” two years from his presidency, for which he thinks he ought to seek “reparations ,” most Americans understand that the president threatened his staffers who sought to cooperate with the Mueller probe. They understand that he tasked others with limiting the scope of the probe and with firing Mueller, and that he instructed his legal counsel to falsify documents to clear him of obstruction. None of this is even disputed. The only question is whether he can be charged for it while he remains in office. In an astounding letter released Monday, 400 former prosecutors contend that, were he not president, Trump would have been charged with obstruction. Virtually nobody other than Attorney General William Barr accepts Barr’s analysis that obstruction was never even on the table. Instead, the public is intuitively reaching a similar conclusion to Mueller’s: The president committed crimes, but as a sitting president, he cannot be indicted while in office. Which means that, again, the remaining question is what to do about the fact that the president committed crimes. (One can also ask why criminality is the only bar we have set for ourselves , but that’s perhaps beside the point.) Donald Trump won’t accept a 2020 presidential election loss, whether it’s by a large margin or a small one, for the same reason he never accepted his 2016 popular vote loss—he doesn’t like it. On Saturday, the New York Times published an article indicating that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to seek impeachment because she’d rather focus on winning the 2020 elections by huge margins. Somehow, even as she conceded that “Trump would not give up power voluntarily if he lost re-election by a slim margin next year,” Pelosi placed her confidence in massive margins being the one thing the president would respect. On some level, Pelosi is correct to fear the spectacle of a protracted public impeachment battle, but the notion that Democrats should somehow circumvent a president who evinces no respect for the law by persuading him that this time he lost for realz strikes me as demented. Donald Trump won’t accept a 2020 presidential election loss, whether it’s by a large margin or a small one, for the same reason he never accepted his 2016 popular vote loss—he doesn’t like it, and so he won’t let it be true. He will convince a third of the country that it wasn’t true, because he doesn’t like it. Indeed, that Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 is, by means of his perfectly circular reasoning, the very reason he will not countenance the idea of Russian involvement in the theft of the 2016 election. It’s also the reason he created a fraudulent “voter fraud” commission. His psychological fragility on this matter has meant that he has done less than nothing to deter more meddling in the 2020 election. He wouldn’t even broach the topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, because if you live in Donald Trump’s head, no election loss is legitimate. It’s funny to think that a “big” election loss would make the difference. None of this is news to Nancy Pelosi, but unfortunately, putting one’s faith in the elections system makes even less sense today than it did in 2016. As Jamelle Bouie observes, we are now in the epicenter of an all-out vote suppression crisis that has become an all-out democracy crisis. It’s easy to forget this, but it bears repeating: The reason former FBI Director James Comey didn’t take the Russian threat against the elections system seriously enough in 2016 is because he believed Hillary Clinton would win by large margins. The reason President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder and others who knew about the threats before we did failed to respond with utmost urgency and seriousness is because they too believed that Hillary Clinton would win. By large margins. Time and time again, people who had access to both information and power opted to take the less draconian path because they believed that there would still be a free and fair election and that Trump would not win it. We know how that turned out. We make the same mistake of not acting on the ongoing threats to congressional oversight, to free and fair voting, and to foreign cyberattacks because an election might solve it at our peril. An election may well become the problem. Doing less than absolutely everything possible to reinstate the rule of law in America today in the hopes that there will be less election interference next time, or more benign election interference, or less purposive election interference, is insane. This isn’t a joke. This is a full-fledged crisis of constitutional democracy and the checking function of Congress . It’s heartening to think that in a year and a half we can vote our way out of our predicament, but it’s a bit like suggesting that we have a good long national think about how things are currently going and tend to it all in 2020, when all the systems that were already broken in 2016 are more broken. If Democrats in the House seriously believe that the attorney general has covered up illegal activity and is refusing to accept congressional oversight, they should model seriousness. Which means that they should do something about it, beyond waiting for the problem to be voted away by large margins. As Jennifer Rubin noted two weeks ago , Democrats have more than one possible response to Donald Trump’s illegal conduct at their disposal. There is no reason why they need to take any single one of them off the table, and there is certainly no reason why they should announce the plan to do so to the New York Times. Banking on an elections system that is being warped before our eyes is a recipe for disaster, and it’s a lesson that should have been learned by now. The challenge Pelosi faces is the same challenge faced by Mueller, and by Eric Holder. Elections matter, and getting out the vote in 2020 matters. But the Rule of Law still matters, and we shouldn’t abandon it because this small problem of Donald Trump might go away in 2020. The fact is that this problem might not go away in 2020, though by then, the argument that obstruction itself is an impeachable offense will have been lost to us. That’s all the more reason to fight for the rule of law today, as if it were sliding away. Because it is sliding away. That isn’t something the country should wait to vote on. The country already knows it is true. Support our journalism

Treasury Sec. Mnuchin Refuses to Hand Over Trump Tax Returns Setting Up Likely Court Battle,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/treasury-mnuchin-refuses-congress-trump-tax-returns-neal-supreme-court.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin informed Congress Monday that the Treasury Department will not release President Trump’s tax returns as demanded by the House Ways and Means Committee because they do not “reasonably serve a legitimate legislative purpose.” The move was widely expected given the Trump administration’s unprecedented efforts to thwart Congressional inquiries into his general presidential shadiness and has set up a legal standoff between two branches of government that appears destined to be resolved by the third—in the Supreme Court. Congressional Democrats are seeking six years of the president’s personal and business tax returns. “As you have recognized, the committee’s request is unprecedented, and it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers,” Mnuchin wrote in a letter to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) “In reliance on the advice of the Department of Justice, I have determined that the Committee’s request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose, and pursuant to section 6103, the Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.” Neal, who has justified the request as part of an effort to assess the effectiveness of the automatic presidential tax audit that all sitting presidents are subjected to, issued a short statement in response to Mnuchin: “I will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response.” Democrats’ next move remains uncertain though all available options seem likely to end in court. Neal could file a lawsuit accusing Mnuchin of breaking the law by not complying with Congress’ request; he could also try to subpoena Trump’s returns."
Critics Complain That Free College Wouldn’t Be Progressive. They’re Missing the Point.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/free-college-tuition-warren-sanders.html,"This Week’s Worst Person in Westeros: Cersei Lannister Thanks to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Democrats are going to spend part of the 2020 presidential campaign debating the merits of free college. And already, we’re starting to hear a familiar refrain from the idea’s critics: Eliminating tuition for everybody is a bad idea, because it wouldn’t be progressive . Some skeptics, like South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, point out that people who go to college tend to earn more than those who don’t, which makes it unfair to give them a free ride if they can afford to pay. “As a progressive, I have a hard time getting my head around the idea of a majority who earn less because they didn’t go to college subsidizing a minority who earn more because they did,” he told reporters last month. Others note that, because poorer students already tend to receive generous financial aid, the big winners would be upper-middle-class and wealthy students who currently pay full-freight. Economists Sandy Baum and Sarah Turner, for instance, recently published a “back of the envelope” calculation showing that 37 percent of the money the government would need to spend to do away with tuition for full time students would benefit undergrads whose families earn at least $120,000 a year. “To make college affordable, should we create a scholarship program that gives the biggest financial rewards to students from rich families?” they wrote recently in the Washington Post . “ Put that way, it’s hard to imagine such a program becoming politically popular, particularly on the left. Yet some of the ‘free college’ plans touted by many Democratic presidential contenders would do just that. They generally would provide the largest benefits to those with the greatest capacity to pay.” These sorts of arguments aren’t wrong, exactly. But they tend to overlook something important: The main point of abolishing tuition at all public colleges isn’t to directly help the neediest undergrads (though you can certainly design a plan that also does that). It’s to rope middle-and-upper-middle class families into a broader social democratic project, one important piece of which is making sure that public colleges stay well-funded for everybody. In other words, to its supporters on the left, the fact that free college might be a bit regressive isn’t really a bug. Before I get into the politics of this issue, though, I want to spend a moment on Baum and Turner’s big stat, which is a bit misleading. First, their analysis doesn’t include part-time college goers, who tend to be poorer and make up nearly 40 percent of undergrads. They would benefit from the end of tuition, too. Second, it assumes that, with tuition gone, lower-income students would not get to keep their Pell grants to use on living expenses, even though that is exactly what Warren and Sanders have both called for in their free college plans. If you crunched the numbers on Warren and Sanders’ actual proposals, the results would probably look a lot different than what Baum and Turner came up with, and less regressive. Baum and Turner’s broader point, however, is directionally correct. Today, affluent undergrads pay more for college than their poorer peers, so—measured in pure dollars and cents—they would benefit disproportionately from zeroing out tuition. Likewise, Buttigieg is mostly just stating the obvious when he points out that people who attend college earn more on average than those who don’t. Making college free isn’t strictly “progressive,” in that sense. But it’s also not supposed to be. The entire policy agenda of the social-Democratic left is based on the idea that simple, universal government programs are generally better than means-tested benefits , because letting everybody enjoy nice things like higher education for free or cheap creates buy-in for a robust welfare state, whereas programs for the poor are easily targeted for cuts. If families that earn six figures can send their 18-year-olds to school without worrying about a tuition bill, they’ll be more likely to support properly funded public colleges that also benefit working class kids, and might even feel more warmly about their tax dollars helping to pay for someone else’s healthcare, since they’ll know that they too are benefiting from the government’s largesse. It’s not just about helping the poorest kids afford school. It’s about establishing the idea that certain things, like education at every level, are a right, and building support for strong public institutions to provide them. To be clear, there are some public policy experts who absolutely believe that doing away with college tuition—especially two year schools—would be a boon to low-income students, many of whom have extreme difficulty navigating our maze of a financial aid system, or get less help than they really need. There are also many writers , myself included , who think that our entire, voucherized system of higher education finance has been a disaster that’s contributed to rising tuition and encouraged the growth of rapacious for-profit-colleges, and that at this point it simply makes more sense for the government to directly fund colleges and require that they keep their prices low or at zero, RATHER THAN TK . But fundamentally, much the logic behind free college really does boil down to the idea that it would be an effective political bribe for the upper-middle class that could pay long term dividends for everybody else. (Some, like Baum and Turner, might be tempted to draw a comparison between tuition-free college and student debt forgiveness. The crucial distinction between them is that tuition-free college is an ongoing program meant to support our public education infrastructure, while forgiving college debt is basically a one-time cash transfer, much of which would benefit people who attended private schools, unless it’s means tested.) Now, you can certainly argue over the left’s theory about means-testing vs. universal benefits. It’s far from clear that the only way to build support for a program is to make sure everybody benefits from it. Medicaid is extremely popular with the broad public, even though it mostly serves the poor, near poor, disabled, and elderly. A solid majority of Americans have opposed food stamp cuts, even though the program exclusively helps low-income families (notably, that hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from trying to cut it ). But critics of free college need to at least engage with left’s argument, rather than write the whole notion off because it isn’t progressive enough. Progressivity isn’t the point.

Why didn't anyone want to repair Notre Dame before the fire?,slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/why-didnt-anyone-want-to-repair-notre-dame-before-the-fire.html,"This Week’s Worst Person in Westeros: Cersei Lannister The nave of Notre Dame is, as we all know, currently without a roof. But still standing over it is an enormous block of scaffolding, a reminder that the cathedral was in bad shape before it was devastated by the fire on Monday night. The scaffolding, which now looks like someone dropped a gigantic bowling ball through its center, was completed in the summer of 2018 for what was supposed to be a 30-year renovation of the aging cathedral. That plan was made before the roof burned. And after? At a press conference on Tuesday, Frédéric Létoffé, one of the presidents of the French organization that represents historic monument restoration companies, said he thought the reconstruction would take 10 to 15 years. Yes, less time than before. The restoration project had been unable to raise any money. Then, in less than 24 hours, it raised nearly a billion dollars. By Tuesday afternoon, French President Emmanuel Macron had declared the cathedral would be rebuilt in just five years.* April 16, 2024, mark it down. Just in time for the Paris Olympics. Turns out, if you want to raise awareness about the state of a decaying historic landmark, inviting reporters to observe the chipped gargoyles is not the most effective strategy. Instead, Slate recommends lighting the whole thing on fire. Just when it looks like the blaze is contained, suggest the structure may not survive—before concluding a little later that it will. After the world has mourned the vast, resonant nave, open the front doors of the cathedral to reveal the rib-vaulted ceiling largely intact. And once it is assumed that the enormous organ is burned and 13 th -century stained-glass rose windows have melted into pools on the ground, prompting a global moan from the hundreds of millions of people who have stood awestruck in their glow, reveal that actually, they survived. To be clear, I am not doubting that the French firefighters and engineers worried the 850-year-old building might not survive. And I’m definitely not suggesting that a desperate priest tiptoed into the “forest,” as the warren of 13 th -century oak beams supporting the pointed roof was known, to set the whole thing on fire, though I encourage you to pick up my thriller Notre Drame , coming soon to a Hudson News near you. But I am saying that the thought of a world without Notre Dame just wasn’t real until you could smell it. France owns Notre Dame, but the Paris archdiocese is responsible for its daily operations. In 2017, the diocese asked the French state for 150 million euros to restore the church, whose masonry was coming off in chunks. Then-president François Hollande offered 4 million euros a year. So the archbishop set up a Friends of Notre Dame charity to raise money from, among others, the church’s many well-pocketed American admirers. Results, as Létoffé emphasized, were mixed. Then, the cathedral went up in flames. Before the fire was even out, the floodgates had opened. By Tuesday evening, the French families behind LVMH and L’Oréal had pledged 200 million euros each; a number of others joined in from France and elsewhere. An insurance company offered 1,300 oak trees for the reconstruction of the roof; grassroots campaigns raised thousands too. The response to this outpouring has been mixed. Gilles Carrez, a deputy from the right-wing party Les Républicains, noted that the French public was really paying for the reconstruction, since those enormous charitable gifts would spare their donors the country’s 65 percent tax rate. Every hundred million euros given to the Notre Dame project means 60 million euros missing from the 2020 budget, he said. There was agreement on the other side of the aisle—the economist Julia Cagé, who worked for the Socialist candidate Benoît Hamon in 2017, wrote on Twitter that “billionaires should pay taxes, not give when they feel like it, benefiting from enormous tax breaks.” And on Wednesday, the secretary general of the CGT labor union said on television, “If they’re capable of giving dozens of millions to reconstruct Notre Dame, why don’t they stop telling us they don’t have enough money to address social problems.” Obviously, this is not the ideal way to go about restoring the church. The work will be long and onerous, beginning with the rush to stabilize the walls and windows weakened from thermal shock. Europe’s biggest tourist attraction will be closed for years. Much of the magic of its ancientness and its continuity is lost forever . Numerous 3D scans will ensure the building can be rebuilt as it was—if that’s what we want. But why? The warren of ancient beams that upheld the roof, built from 50 acres of oak trees, was a marvel in the middle ages, but one that no visitor then or now ever saw and few even knew existed. After the cathedral at Reims burned under German bombardment in 1914, a roof of reinforced concrete served the same purpose with greater security and lesser cost. The mid-19th century restoration of Notre Dame, undertaken by the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, caked the cathedral in gothic revival. Whitney Krahn, who recently competed her Ph.D. on Viollet-le-Duc’s writing, said the architect viewed his additions not as historicist pastiche but as modern and vital. Shortly after I spoke with her on Tuesday, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced an architectural competition to redesign the spire. Would a jury dare choose something modern, like IM Pei’s celebrated glass pyramid at the Louvre? Victor Hugo argued the church’s special beauty owed something to its amalgamation of centuries of art and science, each of which had left its traces like sediment from an ebbing flood. Did someone say architectural competition? Photo illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photos by harmpeti/iStock/Getty Images Plus, IakovKalinin/iStock/Getty Images Plus. Notre Dame is at least the third priceless historic building to go up in flames during a renovation in the past year, after the Mackintosh building at the Glasgow School of Art and the National Museum of Brazil both caught fire last summer. (There’s no use speculating about what kind of construction site mishap set Monday’s first spark in motion. Workers were using flammable solvents and blowtorches as they dismantled elements of the roof for preservation.) Like Notre Dame, the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro had been unable to secure government funding and had resorted to crowdfunding its own restoration. What gets saved and what gets gutted too often depends on the whims of the plutocracy. The Washington Monument? Restored, posthaste, thanks to the donations of the private equity tycoon David Rubinstein. As the tax analyst Victor Fleischer observed in a New Yorker article about Rubinstein’s philanthropy and the carried-interest tax loophole that makes it possible, “If we had a government that was better funded, it could probably fix its own monuments.” The French seem to be on the precipice of similar realization: This money could have and should have been raised years ago. Why does it always take a crisis? The inferno at Notre Dame belongs not just to the recent spat of historic structure fires, but more broadly represents our inability to give the proper consideration to maintenance and repair. A very literal example of this: Not everyone is sure France currently has enough skilled tradespeople to rebuild a cathedral in five years. In a 2013 essay , “Rethinking Repair,” the information scientist Steven Jackson argues for a “broken world thinking” that treats decay, rather than growth, as the default state of the affairs. (It hardly needs to be said anymore that this seems equally true of physical structures, human institutions, and the natural world.) In November, the anthropologist Shannon Mattern issued a call to arms for the caretakers: “What we really need to study is how the world gets put back together.” Our tendency to mortgage the future in favor of the present shows up in everything from the single-use disposable plastics that rain down on the snow-capped Pyrenees to the planned obsolescence of each iPhone to America’s obsession with spending billions more building new roads than maintaining old ones. This sense of “care” as something to be meted out at intervals, in beach clean-ups and temporary scaffolding set-ups, is at its core a blissful misunderstanding of our broken world, where the falling apart begins before the building is even complete. It shouldn’t take a fire to illuminate the glory of good repair. At Notre Dame, the past seemed so firm, no one thought of the future.

San Francisco is about to be the first city in the U.S. to ban facial recognition.,slate.com,April Glaser,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/san-francisco-first-city-ban-facial-recognition.html,"How Police Departments Try to Force Google to Hand Over Data on Anyone Near a Crime Scene San Francisco, renowned these days as a hub of technology, is about to be at the forefront of curbing its potential abuses: The city is now on track to be the first municipality in the United States to ban use of facial recognition technology by the city government. On Monday, the “Stop Secret Surveillance Ordinance” passed a committee vote. It will head to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for a final vote on May 14. Beyond prohibiting face surveillance, the bill also requires all other types of surveillance technologies—like automatic license plate readers, predictive policing software, and cell phone surveillance towers—to only be adopted by city agencies following a public notice and vote by the Board of Supervisors. The bill also requires clear policies for how surveillance technologies will be used by the city government. It may feel like you’re visiting the future every time you access your iPhone X by staring at it, but facial recognition is truly everywhere already: The technology is busy at work at Facebook, identifying who you’re smiling next to at a party. It’s at the entry and exit points in international airports. It’s in sport stadiums, studying whether you’re having a good time. Facial recognition is even at the mall, deployed to recognize shoplifters. While the federal government has gone all-in on face ID—the FBI has a database with more than 400 million faces in it—advocates and concerned San Franciscans have been pushing back at the city level, citing worries over how surveillance tools could be used to profile communities already at risk of overpolicing. The result of their activism is the bill that advanced on Monday. A similar proposal to ban the use of facial recognition across the bay in Oakland, where public approval of new surveillance tech is already required, will be debated later this month. Facial recognition is as alluring to law enforcement as it is flawed in its application, especially when it comes to identifying darker-skinned people. An MIT study released earlier this year found that Amazon’s facial-recognition system, Rekognition, misidentified darker-skinned women as men 31 percent of the time, yet made no mistakes for lighter-skinned men. The potential injustice here is obvious: If police decide to approach someone based on data retrieved from facial recognition software and the software is wrong, the result could be misapplied use of force—not to mention a case where existing biases in policing are reinforced by biased technology. The databases that are traditionally fed to facial recognition systems in order to match a recent photo to someone’s identity are commonly linked with mugshot databases. According to a letter to the Board of Supervisors from groups supporting the ordinance (including the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California and the Council on American-Islamic Relations), “because mugshot databases reflect historical over-policing of communities of color, facial recognition ‘matching’ databases are likely disproportionately made up of people of color.” Despite these concerns, Amazon recently tested its technology with police departments in Orlando, Florida, and Washington City, Oregon. It’s unclear how widespread facial recognition already is among police, since many departments across the country aren’t required to disclose when they adopt new surveillance technologies. If San Francisco supervisors approve this ordinance next week, though, at least that city’s police won’t be able to use such software. There was some pushback from attendees of Monday’s meeting. “I think we’re cautiously optimistic that it will pass” the final vote, Tracy Rosenberg, the director of Media Alliance, a Bay Area group that works on technology justice issues, told me in an interview. She said a group of about 20 people connected to small businesses showed up to express concerns that “they wouldn’t be able to give video from their private surveillance camera to be able to catch shoplifters,” Rosenberg said. The board members weren’t persuaded, since, according to Rosenberg, there are many ways that police have been analyzing private camera video for decades, like by finding a car’s license plate captured in a video at the scene of a crime, without the help of face-ID databases. Restricting the use of prejudicial policing and surveillance technologies is monumental—the last thing anyone wants is for racism to be baked into the technologies police use. The San Francisco ordinance could be used as a model for other major American cities to adopt similar policies. It also shows that people can have a say in the technologies that are used by the police to surveil their communities. The local activism to pass proposals like the one now on track to pass in San Francisco should be a sound-off to lawmakers across the country: People care about their privacy and have rightful reservations about giving police carte blanche to use surveillance technology. The new law won’t take away the sidewalk-facing cameras that are increasingly tough to miss around San Francisco, but it will make their vision a little cloudier."
Turkey Cancels Pivotal Istanbul Election Rebuke of Erdogan and Orders a Revote,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/turkey-cancels-pivotal-istanbul-election-result-seen-as-rebuke-of-erdogan-and-orders-a-revote.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies Turkey’s election authority invalidated the results of Istanbul’s recent mayoral race, which had been seen as a jarring rebuke of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s leadership and part of a larger turn away from his party in a number of cities across the country. A new election is now scheduled to take place in late June after the reversal of the March 31 st vote, which immediately sparked cries of foul play as Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, or AKP, tries to keep its grip on power. The AKP had appealed the results of the Istanbul tally claiming irregularities after the opposition challenger Ekrem Imamoglu narrowly defeated Binali Yildirim, the AKP mayoral candidate. The election board said Monday that some officials overseeing the voting were not civil servants, which is against the law and, it said, enough to justify throwing out the previous vote in favor of a new one. Despite benefiting from the election commission’s decision, the ruling puts Erdogan and the AKP in a newly precarious position. Division have emerged within the party over whether it was even advisable to push for a revote given the softening of Erdogan’s support in urban centers. The first race raised the national profile of Imamoglu, the ultimate winner, and a second race is likely to only expand his notoriety with voters. It’s also not clear if the result will be any different the next time around. “Analysts said the decision to challenge the results was a high-stakes gamble for Erdogan—forcing a replay of a vote that was largely seen as a referendum on his own leadership,” the Washington Post reports . “Imamoglu and other successful challengers nationwide had benefited from voter dissatisfaction with Turkey’s faltering economy, as well as a rare show of unity by the normally fractured political opposition.” Whatever political dissatisfaction Istanbul voters were expressing after 18 years of Erdogan at the helm, pushing to invalidate an electoral loss seems unlikely to fix it. Not to mention, the Post reports, the new vote heaps pressure on the AKP because a second loss would confirm and highlight Erdogan’s fading aura of strongman inevitability. Even if the AKP wins, the thinking goes, it will look like the government cooked the books to get the result it wanted. Either way, Erdogan is entering a new phase where his leadership is more openly being questioned—even within his own party."
New NRA president says Georgia Democrat only won her seat in Congress because she’s black.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/new-nra-president-meadows-says-georgia-democrat-mcbath-seat-congress-because-minority-black.html,"Hundreds of Former Federal Prosecutors Say Trump Committed Obstruction of Justice Felonies It didn’t take long for newly minted National Rifle Association president Carolyn Meadows to roll up her sleeves, assume the mantle of the NRA, and stoke the embers of a culture war that the organization she now leads likes to elide with gun ownership to keep its members frothing, tweeting, and voting. In an interview with the Marietta Daily Journal, Meadows, a Georgia resident, discussed the gun politics of the state’s 6 th Congressional District, which the NRA and other conservative groups are targeting in 2020. In the Georgia 6 th , Democrat Rep. Lucy McBath managed to upset GOP incumbent Rep. Karen Handel in 2018 in what was former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s old seat in the north Atlanta suburbs. McBath, who is black, ran in the district that is two-thirds white on a gun control platform born out of her own experience with gun violence. McBath’s 17-year-old son Jordan Davis was shot and killed in 2012 in a gas station parking lot by a 45-year-old white man who complained about the volume of the rap music coming from his car. “[I]t is wrong to say, like McBath said, that the reason she won was because of her anti-gun stance,” Meadows explained. “That didn’t have anything to do with it—it had to do with being a minority female. And the Democrats really turned out, and that’s the problem we have with conservatives—we don’t turn out as well.”"
