"‘All or most’ of PH’s 100-day promises fulfilled, says Kula | Free Malaysia Today",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Vinodh Pillai,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/06/all-or-most-of-phs-100-day-promises-fulfilled-says-kula/,"‘All or most’ of PH’s 100-day promises fulfilled, says Kula By April 6, 2019 10:53 AM Human Resources Minister M Kula Segaran.
SEREMBAN: Human Resources Minister M Kula Segaran last night claimed Pakatan Harapan (PH) has fulfilled most or all of the 10 election promises it had pledged to do in the first 100 days of its administration.
This, he said, was a sign the coalition was governing the country well.
Saying critics were helping keep PH in check to ensure its promises were carried out, Kula said there was no such pressure during the days of the Alliance and Barisan Nasional (BN).
“Do you still remember the BN manifestos?” he asked at a ceramah in Kampung Sawah.
“From 1957 until now, there have been about 13 manifestos (by the BN) but do the people remember if these were fulfilled? They don’t. Many things they promised have not been fulfilled.
“What is important for us (PH) is that what we promised, we must fulfil. We just need a little bit more time.
“But the promises that we pledged in our first 100 days, most of them or all have been carried out.”
Kula said the PH government wanted to fulfil all of its 60 pledges by the end of its five-year term.
“This is Pakatan Harapan, the new government. There is new hope, a fresh breath of air, in the government, believe it,” he told the crowd of about 250, comprising mostly Chinese voters.
Observers said, however, PH had yet to fulfil all of the 10 promises it said it would carry out in the first 100 days of government.
They said some pledges, like abolishing the goods and services tax (GST), had been carried out but the abolition of highway tolls or increasing the oil royalty payment to Sabah and Sarawak, for example, had yet to be fulfilled.
Another promise yet to be fulfilled is requiring PTPTN defaulters to start paying back their student loans once their monthly salaries reach RM4,000. This was initiated but later revoked, pending a new study.
Kula later told FMT the 10 election promises for PH’s first 100 days in power had been fulfilled “more or less within the time frame”. “Even for minimum wage, we couldn’t do it within 100 days but we did this in about 110 days. We have five years. Other things will be fulfilled in time,” he said.
Kula was campaigning for the PH candidate in the by-election, Dr Streram Sinnasamy. Other PH top guns present included DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng and PKR’s Dr Lee Boon Chye.
The by-election on April 13 will see a four-cornered fight among Streram, Barisan Nasional’s Mohamad Hasan and two independents – housewife Malar Rajaram and former lecturer Mohd Nor Yassin. "
Democratic Congressman Who Wants Trump’s Tax Returns Won’t Release His Own,www.whitehousedossier.com,Keith Koffler,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.whitehousedossier.com/2019/04/05/democratic-congressman-who-wants-trumps-tax-returns-wont-release-his-own/,"I use Aweber for my email marketing and I like it. Democratic Congressman Who Wants Trump’s Tax Returns Won’t Release His Own Posted on by Keith Koffler • 10 Comments
It’s an abuse of power that the Congress is asking for an individual’s tax returns for political purposes.
Democratic Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts is dressing up raw political action as some kind of principled oversight. It’s a dangerous precedent.
This is an obvious fishing expedition by the House Ways and Means chairman. It serves to confirm President Trump’s frequent claims that he is the victim of a witch hunt.
Trump is right about one thing. Clearly, the Democrats are not concerned about political backlash from continuing their investigations. Not only does the Democratic leadership want to proceed despite Robert Mueller coming up empty-handed, but they are forced to anyway by their base.
The Democrats will never be satisfied until the day Trump leaves office. It’s a factor of his presidency, and one that distracts him from keeping the country safe and making life here better. Democrats ought to add that to their calculations as they pursue “oversight,” now that a basically independent investigation has finished.
The MSM will continue to participate in this, doubling and tripling down. They too will never get enough of investigating Trump and trying to be the next Woodward and Bernstein. Where was all the investigative reporting into Barack Obama’s background in machine-politics Chicago? Just didn’t seem as exciting to them.
What do they actually think they are going to find in his tax returns? How likely is it that he decided to submit information to the government that could get him indicted? But they know they’ll find information with which they can try to humiliate him.
According to the Washington Times , Neal is not going to be demanding his own tax returns anytime soon:
The Democratic chairman who’s demanding to see President Trump’s tax returns says he’d have no problem releasing his own returns — later.
“Oh, sure — down the road, sure, that’s nothing,” Rep. Richard Neal said Thursday when asked if he would commit to releasing some of his personal returns. “I’ve done that in the past, by the way.” Neal’s office didn’t respond to a question about when that might have been, and a Roll Call survey in 2017 found no record of a previous release of his tax returns.
New England Public Radio also tried to pry loose his tax returns in 2017, asking five separate times for copies. The congressman rebuffed each request."

Beto Says Trump is Suited for the Third Reich Posted on
According to the Washington Examiner :
Beto O’Rourke, former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential hopeful, compared President Trump’s comments on immigration to language used in Nazi Germany at a campaign event in Iowa.
“When the president of the United States has called Mexican immigrants ‘rapists’ and ‘criminals.’ He then went on to call asylum seekers ‘animals’ and an ‘infestation,’” said O’Rourke.
“Now we would not be surprised if in the Third Reich other human beings were described as an infestation, as a cockroach or a pest that you would want to kill. But to do that in 2017 or ‘18 in the United States of America, doesn’t make sense,” added O’Rourke.
Is he competing with @AOC for silliest comments posted? He is in second place – maybe a “distant second” but seems like he is working very hard to close that gap.

I don’t get this guy at all. Arms flailing about, yelling, name calling, and the man looks deranged. It’s hard to imagine him sitting in the Oval Office, or any office for that matter. If these Nazi name callers had any idea of how brutal, how murderous, how evil the Hitler regime really was, and how it caused the death of millions of innocents across the world, they might think twice. I didn’t know any of the survivors of Hitler’s evil, but I did hear first hand from someone who witnessed it.
enough.
He is the one to watch. His only problem is he is white, but he is gay, so that makes everything ok.
His father was a Marxist and that’s even better. April 5, 2019, 3:15 pm at 3:15 pm
Not sure Robert O’Rourke, full Irish, ever got off the drugs. Of course the msm thinks it’s cute he has a DWI, etc. He certainly seems jacked up, arms flailing. Dauum. And not sure he’s ever held a job;) April 5, 2019, 5:20 pm at 5:20 pm
One of the best outcomes of the Trump Administration is that it has caused the craziest of the fanatic Democrats to come out of hiding and reveal themselves in full public view. Beto is just the latest example. AOC is another. That whole list of unknown Democrats who have declared they want to run for President in 2020 is just the tip of the iceberg. April 5, 2019, 10:36 pm at 10:36 pm
The Jews and other people murdered or persecuted by the Nazis were citizens of Germany.
Illegal aliens are invaders who have no right to be in our nation. Identifying and deporting them is nothing like the Nazis.
But the comparison gives that righteous rush of feeling so prized by Progs, so he goes ahead and says it.
Let’s see – because I support Trump – I’m a Nazi, a racist, a sexist, a bigot and I hate puppies.

VAWA has been reauthorized and strengthened by strong bipartisan majorities in 2000, 2005, and 2013. The law is seen today as one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

"Trash Tutorial: For plastic recycling, 'container' is key word",www.providencejournal.com,Krystal Noiseux Special to The Journal,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/trash-tutorial-for-plastic-recycling-container-is-key-word,"Trash Tutorial: For plastic recycling, 'container' is key word By Krystal NoiseuxSpecial to The Journal Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 9:31 PM
While Krystal Noiseux is on vacation, we're running a column that originally appeared in the newspaper on July 20, 2016.
Q: I recently started getting prescription meds in blister packs. Can they be recycled? They are a container and hold consumable goods.
— M.Z., Cranston
A: When Rhode Islanders know our state’s bin/cart recycling rule for plastic (like you clearly do, Mary!) and do their best to apply that rule, I’m a happy camper. The key word to remember when it comes to plastic recycling in your bin or cart is container, and I can’t say it enough — container, container, container.
If you’re sticking to only placing plastic containers up to five gallons in size in your recycling bin or cart, then breathe easy because you’re doing a good job. There’s no need to squint and look for numbers inside of little triangles. You just need to remember and apply this simple rule. (In fact, let’s test it out: How about a plastic hanger? It’s plastic, yes, but it’s not a container so it doesn’t belong in your recycling bin or cart.)
Most plastic containers are fairly easy to identify: bottles, jugs, jars, cups, tubs, and buckets are all classic examples. I’m frequently asked, however, to weigh in on the blister packaging that Mary is curious about. In this case I’m happy to report that blister packing is, indeed, a plastic container. It’s molded into the shape of the product it contains, and yes, you can put it in your recycling bin or cart. Some blister packaging has a plastic container front and a cardboard back. In this case, simply pull off the cardboard backing and recycle both the plastic container and the cardboard, separately. Other blister packaging has plastic on both sides, with a paper insert sandwiched between that surrounds the product. It usually requires scissors (and a whole lot of patience) to open, but once you do you can remove the paper insert and recycle both the plastic container and the paper, separately.
Now, are there any exceptions to this plastic container rule? Sure — and I’d like to ask you to remember three: No plastic bags (or bags of bags, or recycling inside of bags for that matter), no polystyrene foam (“Styrofoam”) containers, and no plastic containers that once held thicker hazardous fluids like motor oil, paint stripper, or pesticides. When the latter are empty to your eye they are safe for the trash, but they are not safe for the Materials Recycling Facility, where they can catch fire.
And for you Super Recyclers out there, you can learn about a few more minor exceptions to the plastic container rule, and get information about special drop-off programs for plastic bags, foam, and plastic containers larger than 5 gallons at www.recycletogetherri.org.

Setting up home in a small apartment poses all sorts of challenges.
First, there's the floorplan: With small rooms come issues like storage, and where to put the bed.
Then there's the furniture: Will it fit up the stairs, and will you need a toolbox and an engineering degree to put it together?
Retailers and design services have answers. Design-your-space websites can give you accurate floor plans and helpful decor suggestions. Cleverly designed furniture is scaled for smaller footprints, and might come to the door in easy-to-assemble formats, or with assembly service as part of the package. There are now more options than ever for the diminutive nest.
Floorplan
Sites like Modsy and Havenly give you a thorough questionnaire to pinpoint your style preferences. You can choose or attach pictures of favorite spaces, as well.
Then designers will come up with a few plans from which you can choose. At Modsy, for example, you can get a 3-D rendering based on your photos and measurements. Click on furnishings throughout the layout to see if you want to buy them or switch them out for other options. You can also include pieces you already own or are thinking of getting, and your designer will position them in the plan for you.
Fiona Byrne , an interior designer in New York City, says one way to tackle the challenging, long but shallow living rooms so common in the city is with space-saving furniture.
""Look for narrower pieces such as console tables instead of deep credenzas, and instead of a coffee table, get end tables for either side of the sofa,"" she advises. ""Dual-purpose pieces are great — side tables that can double as stools when guests come over, a console table that doubles as a desk, etc. Plug-in wall sconces eliminate the need for additional side tables and don't require any wiring. All you need is a screwdriver.""
She also likes wall-mounted televisions: ""People can install the cable box vertically slotted behind the TV so there's no need for a piece of furniture under the TV.""
Furnishings
""Small spaces are tricky,"" says designer Alison Pickart of Larkspur, California, who has done several apartment projects. ""When I want a small space to feel larger, I keep the color palette monochromatic. The eye is less 'distracted' and the space feels more seamless.""
""Mid-century pieces work well in tight spaces because their scale is more petite,"" she says. Check out small-space collections from West Elm, Crate & Barrel and Pottery Barn.
Sebastian Brauer, Crate & Barrel's vice president of product design and development, says small-apartment living is about striking a balance between function and style.
""Consider pieces that contribute to a light and airy visual vibe, as well as options that maximize your vertical space,"" he says. ""And don't shy away from bold color; especially if your space has limited light. Bright colors can bring warmth and energy to your space.""
If you're not quite ready to invest in furniture, consider renting it. In New York and San Francisco, Feather offers ""furniture freedom"": rentals of three months or longer for couches, chairs, tables and other furnishings from name-brand furniture partners. You can renew the lease, or buy something if you fall in love with it.
West Elm has just launched a partnership with Rent the Runway, where subscribers can choose from 26 bundles of soft furnishings for the bedroom and living room, curated by style, print, texture and color.
Inside Weather lets you try out a piece of furniture for a year and return it if things just aren't working out.
They've got a selection of contemporary pieces, like apartment-size sofas, midcentury modern chairs, credenzas and tables of all sizes. Everything ships for free. Inside Weather tells you how your purchase is going to arrive — the number and weight of boxes — and how long it's likely to take to put together. The company has a signature snap assembly feature that means a sofa can come out of its two boxes and be ready in about 10 minutes.
Developments in memory foam technology have been a boon to the home shipping market. Instead of big, bulky mattresses that might not fit through apartment doorways, some companies are sending mattresses and pillows tightly rolled in compact boxes. Coddleme.com, Lull.com and Ghostbed.com are among the options.
Detroit-based furniture company Floyd was started by friends Alex O'Dell and Kyle Hoff, who noticed that millennials were mobile and less inclined to acquire major pieces of furniture. They offer just a few basic, easy-to-assemble pieces — a sofa, platform bed, some tables — and ship them free to select cities. They've also got a kit of four white or black metal legs and a roll of sturdy strapping material, so you can turn whatever you like into a bespoke table.
If you need help putting something together, consider hiring a service like TaskRabbit.com. It finds local pros for tasks like assembly or breakdown of furniture, or pickup, delivery and moving, and repair/install jobs. First-time renter Lea Nesdale and her friends used the service in their new Manhattan flat.
""We had two IKEA dressers, and the directions were really confusing,"" she says. ""On TaskRabbit, you can see the potential builder's skill set, so we booked someone who builds these often. He did it all in two hours."" "
Gardening: Recalling advice from the High Line garden designer,www.providencejournal.com,Henry Homeyer Special to The Journal,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/gardening-recalling-advice-from-high-line-garden-designer,"Gardening: Recalling advice from the High Line garden designer By Henry HomeyerSpecial to The Journal Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 9:31 PM Piet Oudolf, a Dutch garden designer who works all over the world, loves decorative grasses and uses them often, including in the High Line Gardens that he designed in New York. I had a chance to meet him and tour his personal gardens outside of Amsterdam in 2007, and I recently re-visited my notes from that time.
I was out in my garden recently and noticed that my tall decorative grasses are looking quite bedraggled. I have a clump of fountain grass (Miscanthus sinensis) a variety called ""Morning Light."" It’s time to cut back all stems and flowers that stood up, largely, to the winter winds.
Looking at it made me think of Piet (pronounced Pete) Oudolf, a Dutch garden designer who works all over the world. Oudolf loves decorative grasses and uses them often, including in the High Line Gardens that he designed in New York. I had a chance to meet him and tour his personal gardens outside of Amsterdam in 2007, and I recently re-visited my notes from that time.
Oudolf primarily designs gardens on a grand scale. The High Line project in New York City transformed a mile and a half of abandoned elevated railway into a garden. He is the designer of the memorial gardens — just blocks away from the former site of the World Trade Center — in Battery Park at the tip of New York, at The Gardens of Remembrance. He has done gardens in Chicago, Stockholm and elsewhere. He is the author of several books, including “Planting Design: Gardens in Time and Space.”
I visited him at his home in Humelo, Holland, and we talked about gardening. Asked about his philosophy of gardening, Oudolf told me that he doesn’t have one, but, he said, “I know what I like.” Early on, he said he had felt trapped by English gardening, “I’m not a color gardener,” and he tried to find a way to escape. Tall decorative grasses and prairie plants appealed to him. We walked through his personal gardens, and his love of plants that provide winter interest was obvious.
Oudolf has a couple of acres of gardens surrounding his house. I visited in January, a time when only a few early hellebores were blooming. I noticed that he used sharply clipped evergreen hedges as counterpoints to the tall grasses that waved in the wind, and to the array of summer plants that had been left to show off their seedpods during the winter. I wondered aloud what he would do in an urban setting, say something 30 meters (100 feet) square.
First, he said you need to plan a space that is comfortable year round — some place where you’d like to spend time. Start by taking up most of the sod, and getting a soil test done before doing any planting. Amend the soil with compost and minerals as needed. Select easy-to-care for plants, things that are tolerant of a variety of conditions. It’s important, he noted, that you choose plants that need the same basic conditions if they are to grow together and do well. So, for example, don’t try to plant heather (which needs acidic soil) right next to lavender (that needs slightly sweet soil).
Oudolf believes in mass plantings, not a hodge-podge of individual plants of many different species. He pointed out that you also need to have an array of plants that bloom in different seasons. He suggests 30% spring plants, 40-45% summer bloomers, and 25-30% plants that are best in autumn. And he believes in cleaning the garden in late winter or early spring so that those tall grasses and perennials will be interesting all winter long.
It is important to separate your garden space from that of your neighbors, according to Oudolf, either by planting a woody hedge or by building a fence. He likes iron fences that can be used as support for climbing plants like clematis, or be used to train woody plants into shaded tunnels. In his own gardens he created raised beds to change the level of the flat garden, building 30-inch tall brick circles filled with soil and planted with tall decorative grasses.
Pathways are important for gardens, Oudolf explained, as they lead the viewer through the garden. He believes that you shouldn’t be able to see the entire garden at once. You can create tension by placing tall plants and hedges in the front of a garden, he said. He likes hard surfaces for walkways in small gardens, either stone or brick, but grass as the path in larger gardens. Obviously in public gardens he uses concrete or stone to keep the foot traffic from wearing down the grass.
Places to sit should be included whether in a public or private garden, Oudolf said. His own gardens have benches for relaxing, though I suspect he has little time to use them. One of my favorite features in his garden was the sheep. No, not live sheep. He has a sense of humor, and has nice carved marble sheep resting on the lawn. Unfortunately my photos have all disappeared.
I have been to the High Line Gardens a couple of times and they are definitely worth a visit. I understand they are now one of the most-visited tourist attractions in New York City. Meander along the path and you will see how Oudolf incorporates all the design principles mentioned above. Go see the High Line and incorporate some of his ideas in your own gardens.

Projects to increase home safety,www.providencejournal.com,Jenna Schuster HomeAdvisor,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/projects-to-increase-home-safety,"Projects to increase home safety Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 9:31 PM
Whether you've just moved to a new neighborhood, have experienced a break-in or simply want to feel safer, you may be thinking that it's time to upgrade your home's security features. Luckily, it only takes a few changes to make your home more secure. Consider these five solutions.
Make smart home upgrades
Now that smart home technology is more attainable, it's easier than ever to keep your home safe from intruders. Take advantage of all the digital age has to offer by installing a Ring doorbell or similar product. These high-tech gadgets have video capability and motion sensors that alert you when someone is at your front door. A camera connects straight to your phone, so you can see that person in real time. You can also use smart home technology to set timers for your lights and TV. Setting them to turn on and off randomly throughout the day makes it appear as though you're home when you're not, further deterring would-be intruders.
Reinforce your doors
Have you been living with a hollow-core front door? While these doors are a good option for interior spaces, they don't offer much security in entryways. Consider switching to solid exterior doors instead. They're heavier, sturdier and much harder to kick in. While you're at it, update your locks and strike plates. If you get a longer deadbolt, for example, it will hold your door steady against force. And securing strike plates with larger screws, like those longer than an inch, will guard your entry even further.
Increase privacy
If your windows are uncovered, it's easy for potential intruders to see inside your home, where they can scope out valuables and other points of entry. Avoid exposure by having blinds, shutters or curtains installed over your windows. This will help keep your possessions out of sight and make it harder for an intruder to tell whether you're home or away. A bonus? Window treatments can help insulate your home and lower your monthly energy bill. According to HomeAdvisor's True Cost Guide, it costs around $700 to install blinds or shades.
Get a fence
To make it more difficult for would-be intruders to access your home, have a fence installed on your property. Whether it guards just the backyard or wraps all the way around to the front of your home, this barrier will act as a deterrent. Choose a tall privacy fence with pointed tops and no handholds for the best defense. Or, choose a metal fence with spiked tops to make climbing difficult. And don't forget to purchase a lock for your gate for added security.
Upgrade your windows
Don't leave your windows defenseless. If you're worried about a break-in, upgrade from regular glass to tempered glass or acrylic sheet material. Though these materials are more expensive, they are far more difficult to break. Keep in mind that acrylic sheet material is tricky to install. Hire a pro to make sure the installation goes smoothly. And remember to check the locks on your windows to see if they could also use an upgrade.

Gardening: Help bees by planting flowering herbs,www.providencejournal.com,Dean Fosdick The Associated Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/gardening-help-bees-by-planting-flowering-herbs,"Gardening: Help bees by planting flowering herbs By Dean FosdickThe Associated Press Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 9:30 PM
Herbs are among the most useful plants in nature. They can tantalize the taste buds, help cure what ails you, oil the body, perfume the air, and attract bees, butterflies and hummingbirds.
""People are getting more into herbs, with herb sales definitely on the rise,"" said David Trinklein, an Extension horticulturist with the University of Missouri. ""They're using fresh herbs from the garden for culinary purposes, but another important reason is to help pollinators.""
Many gardeners are trying to help declining pollinator populations by providing them with the plants they need to thrive.
Herbs appeal to a great variety of bee species, said Francis Drummond, a professor of insect ecology and insect pest management at the University of Maine.
""It is mostly the abundant nectar that brings the bees in,"" he said. ""Some of the more attractive herbs to bees are thyme, comfrey, borage, oregano, bee's friend, lemon balm, rosemary, hyssop, sage, lavender and chives.""
Most flowering herbs are attractive to pollinators, but some, like cilantro and basil, tend to lose other qualities when they blossom or bolt, said Ed Spevak, curator of invertebrates at the St. Louis Zoo. ""So use the leaves earlier (for your own purposes) but then allow the plant to flower to support pollinators,"" he said.
Some herbs, like cilantro, fennel and dill, produce very small blossoms that attract very small bees, Spevak said. ""Fennel and dill also serve as host plants for black swallowtail caterpillars,"" he said.
Bees find flowers by way of their color, not their scent, said David Salman, founder and chief horticulturist for High Country Gardens. ""Particularly honeybees, although some native bees will feed on them as well,"" he said. ""But herbs primarily have Old World origins, so their primary interest is (for) honeybees which also were imported here.
""In general, annual herbs tend to be more important for butterflies, primarily swallowtails,"" Salman said.
Pollinators as a whole are necessary for a huge amount of the world's food production, but the European honeybee is a critical species, Trinklein said.
""They're the king of the pollinators,"" he said. ""They are morphologically designed to be pollinators, while other species are more accidental pollinators. They're also greater in number and activity level than other species of pollinators.""
Bees need to collect syrup and pollen from early spring through late fall to support a healthy hive, Trinklein said. That means gardeners should plant a variety of flowers and herbs to prolong the bloom season.
Many beekeepers maintain that the herbs used for attracting pollinators should be natives, but Trinklein disagrees.
""I don't think a bee minds if an herb is native or non-native,"" he said. ""Lavender and anything in the catnip family are particularly attractive to bees.""
Gardeners seeking to support pollinators might consider planting scent gardens made up entirely of herbs. They would provide pleasing fragrances around the home as well as nutrition for the bees, he said.
""However, it is advisable to avoid (wearing) strong-smelling perfumes, hairsprays or other fragrances which might attract to the gardener confused bees seeking out nectar,"" Trinklein said.

5 top home improvement trends for 2019,www.providencejournal.com,Dan DiClerico HomeAdvisor,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/5-top-home-improvement-trends-for-2019,"5 top home improvement trends for 2019 Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 9:31 PM
If you want to know where home design is headed, there's no better source than Design & Construction Week, the industry's biggest trade show, which took place Feb. 19-21 in Las Vegas. HomeAdvisor's team was among the 85,000-plus attendees, including designers, builders, manufacturers and other home pros. Here are five trends we spotted for your next remodel.
High-tech kitchens and baths
Smart home technology has largely focused on other parts of the home, with devices such as video doorbells and smart thermostats. But most of the coolest connectivity at this year's show was aimed squarely at the kitchen and bath. Case in point: Kohler and Delta both launched Alexa-enabled kitchen faucets that let you fill specific volumes of water by voice command.
In the bathroom, designers are betting big on high-tech solutions such as connected leak detectors and smart toilets with built-in bidets, according to the National Kitchen & Bath Association's 2019 Bathroom Design Trends report.
Then there's smart cooking, a hugely popular theme with appliance manufacturers. GE, LG and Whirlpool all touted versions of ""guided cooking technology,"" whereby the range or cooktop automatically adjusts temperatures and cooking times depending on the recipe.
Luxury laundry rooms
The laundry room has come out of the basement shadows. In fact, an upstairs laundry room topped the list of specialty rooms that a home must have to sell, according to the National Association of Home Builders' 2019 edition of its What Home Buyers Really Want report. Manufacturers are responding with sleek, stylish laundry appliances that demand to be seen. One of the biggest head-turners at this year's show was a washer/dryer set from Samsung in an alluring champagne finish.
Black is back
You couldn't walk 20 feet at this year's show without running into another black-hued product or fixture _ an indication of the growing interest in contemporary design. Black bathrooms are particularly hot, as evidenced by the bounty of faucets with an ebony finish. Brizo's Atavis Bath Collection, with its rugged matte finish, was a real showstopper.
In the kitchen, black stainless steel continues to come on strong as a fingerprint-resistant alternative to traditional stainless. Finally, black was the favorite window cladding color, with brands such as Andersen, Marvin and Ply Gem all decking out their booths in the hue.
Smart ways to conserve water
Rising water costs and water shortages in many municipalities are making water conservation every bit as important as energy efficiency. Water-saving toilets and showerheads were all over the show floor. One of the most innovative examples was the Nebia Spa Shower 2.0, which atomizes water to reduce usage by 65 percent without sacrificing pressure.
Several manufacturers, including GE, Moen and Phyn, showcased water-monitoring technologies that give homeowners real-time consumption data for every fixture in the home. That transparency helps households reduce their water use by 15 percent, according to a company spokesperson with Phyn. In addition to improved water efficiency, the systems can identify leaks big and small throughout the home. In the event of a major incident, like a burst pipe, they will even turn off the water at the main line, eliminating the risk of catastrophic water damage.
Bringing the outdoors in
Builders and designers are finding new ways to integrate homes with their natural surroundings. Glass is the go-to material, including doors that do the work of windows by flooding interiors with natural light while providing expansive views.
Many of the latest glass wall systems come with the option of automated control, allowing homeowners to bring the outdoors in with the flick of a switch. We didn't see any versions with integrated voice control, but given the expansion of digital assistants all over the home, from appliances to toilets to showerheads, Alexa-enabled windows and doors are sure to be a feature at next year's Design & Construction Week.

When kids come out of college more ignorant than when they went in, and tens of thousands of dollars in debt to boot, there's a problem in higher ed.
And I'd say the problem is the push for ""diversity"" and ""inclusion"" and ""equality"" where all voices must be given equal time and equal weight and you wind up going to college for 6 or 8 or 10 years and you can name 6 different left-handed lesbian Chicana poets but you have no idea who Shakespeare or Dostoyevsky or Hemingway are. When all you're taught is the ""marginalized voices"" and the ""alternative truths"" you have no idea what it is they're marginalized from and alternatives to. I dare say you walk around some of these colleges and ask the kids to name 3 facts about Thomas Jefferson and ""He was a slave owner"" will be the #1 answer and I'm not sure ""He wrote the Declaration of Independence"" would even make the top 3. It's one thing to be taught the ""warts and all"" version of history, but these kids are only being taught the warts."

NEW YORK (AP) "" A western New York man has been charged with threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
Federal prosecutors announced Friday that Patrick Carlineo Jr. was arrested after placing a threatening call to Omar's office in Washington D.C. last month.
Authorities did not say when Carlineo was arrested.
Omar is among the first of two Muslim women to serve in Congress.
The FBI said in a criminal complaint Carlineo called her a ""terrorist"" and threatened to shoot her.
The bureau said that Carlineo sounded angry during the call but ""spelled his name correctly and provided contact information"" to a staffer.
Carlineo told the FBI that he is a patriot, ""loves the president and that he hates radical Muslims in our government,"" the criminal complaint says.
Carlineo's defense attorney declined to comment on the charges Friday.
Omar was met with backlash for remarks she made earlier this year on Israel, including comments that American supporters of Israel are pushing people to have ""allegiance to a foreign country ."" Some people perceived Omar's comments were anti-Semitic. She later apologized, saying ""anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.""
Omar, a Somali-American, has also received anti-Semitic and racists comments. Never miss a story

Jury rejects Harry Reid lawsuit against fitness band maker,www.providencejournal.com,"Ken Ritter, The Associated Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190405/jury-rejects-harry-reid-lawsuit-against-fitness-band-maker?rssfeed=true,"Jury rejects Harry Reid lawsuit against fitness band maker Ken Ritter, The Associated Press Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 10:23 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 10:23 PM
LAS VEGAS (AP) "" A jury in Las Vegas flatly rejected former U.S. Sen. Harry Reid's lawsuit against an exercise band maker he blamed for injuries "" including blindness in one eye "" he suffered when the stretchy device slipped from his grasp and he fell face-first a little more than four years ago.
After eight days of testimony, the eight-member civil trial jury deliberated about an hour before declaring that Reid never proved the first of 10 questions they were asked to decide: that the device Reid used that day was a TheraBand made by Ohio-based Hygenic Corp.
Jurors never saw the actual device because Reid's adult son, attorney Leif Reid, disposed of it soon after Harry Reid was injured.
Reid and his wife, Landra Gould, weren't in the courtroom when the verdict was read. The 79-year-old former Democratic Party leader used a wheelchair throughout the two-week trial, following treatment for pancreatic cancer and back surgery.
Their lawyer, James Wilkes II of Tampa, Florida, said he respected the Nevada jury's decision. ""I may not agree with the outcome, but I agree with the way we got there,"" Wilkes said.
TheraBand lawyer Laurin Quiat was subdued in victory.
""My client always believed in the product, believes that the product is safe, is not unreasonably dangerous for anyone, and they stand behind it,"" he said. ""That's all I have to say.""
Reid and his wife sought unspecified monetary damages because they said the product was defective and the company failed to warn the public it was dangerous for elderly people like Reid to use.
Reid's attorneys dropped a negligence claim after several days of testimony that began March 27.
Reid testified last week his injuries were ""the main factor"" why he decided not to seek a sixth Senate term in 2016. Quiat, however, showed the jury a 2015 video news release in which Reid said his decision not to run had ""absolutely nothing to do with my injury.""
Reid, the Democratic Party leader in the Senate when President Barack Obama was in the White House, testified he wanted Senators and voters to know he wasn't incapacitated.
Quiat reminded jurors during closing arguments on Friday that they would never know for sure if the device Reid was using was made by Hygenic. The company attorney also raised questions about Reid's truthfulness.
He noted that Reid at first said the band broke, not that it slipped his grasp, and that it had been attached to a metal hook in the wall of the bathroom in his suburban Las Vegas home.
On the witness stand, Reid testified he looped a band through a shower door handle, not a hook, and that he spun around and fell face-first against hard-edged bathroom cabinets when it slipped from his grip on New Year's Day 2015.
Company experts and witnesses testified that Reid misused the device, making him responsible for blindness in his right eye, broken facial bones, fractured ribs, a concussion and bruises.
""This is not a complicated case. Resistance bands are not complicated,"" Quiat said. ""This case is about taking responsibility for one's own actions.""
He said Reid used the wide flat resistance bands for several years without mishap after being given a band by congressional exercise therapists. Quiat said they then tried for months to get Reid to improve his stance, balance and technique when using the device in a rowing-style upper body fitness regimen.

Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner ordered to register as sex offender,www.providencejournal.com,The Associated Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/zz/news/20190405/ex-rep-anthony-weiner-ordered-to-register-as-sex-offender/2?rssfeed=true,"Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner ordered to register as sex offender Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 10:10 PM He's nearing the end of a 21-month prison sentence for having illicit online contact with a 15-year-old girl.
NEW YORK — Former Rep. Anthony Weiner was ordered Friday to register as a sex offender as he nears the end of a 21-month prison sentence for having illicit online contact with a 15-year-old girl.
A New York City judge designated Weiner a Level 1 offender under the state's version of what's known as Megan's Law, meaning that he is thought to have a low risk of reoffending.
Weiner, a once-rising star in the Democratic Party who served nearly 12 years in Congress, has been living in a halfway house since February after serving most of his sentence at a prison in Massachusetts.
He's due to be released May 14 but still faces three years of court supervision.
Weiner, 54, must register for a minimum of 20 years. He is required to verify his address every year, notify the state within 10 days of moving and visit a police station every three years to have a new picture taken.
Because of his low-level designation, Weiner's information won't show up in the state's online sex offender registry but will be available via a toll-free telephone number.
Weiner didn't attend Friday's court hearing. Messages seeking comment were emailed to his lawyers.
Weiner pleaded guilty in May 2017 to transferring obscene material to a minor.
Prosecutors said he had a series of sexually explicit Skype and Snapchat exchanges with a North Carolina high school student and encouraged the teen to strip naked and touch herself sexually.
At his sentencing, Weiner said he'd been a ""very sick man for a very long time"" and said he had a sex addiction.
Weiner's lawyer said the former lawmaker likely exchanged thousands of messages with hundreds of women over the years and was communicating with up to 19 women when he encountered the teenager.
It wasn't the first time Weiner had been caught acting inappropriately.
After sending a lewd picture of himself to a college student in 2011, Weiner claimed his account had been hacked, then admitted online interactions with at least six other women while married to top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.
Weiner resigned from Congress, only to try for a political comeback with a run for New York City mayor in 2013. Then came the revelation that Weiner had used the alias ""Carlos Danger"" to send explicit photos to at least one woman after resigning from Congress.
Weiner received less than 5% of the Democratic primary vote.
Abedin filed for divorce from Weiner in 2017. But the two, who have a young son together, later agreed to discontinue the case in order to negotiate their separation privately.
The investigation into Weiner's contact with the 15-year-old roiled the 2016 presidential campaign because emails Clinton had sent to Abedin were found on a laptop computer FBI agents seized from him.
That led then-FBI Director James Comey to announce just days before the election that that agency was reopening its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state.
Days later, Comey said nothing in the new emails changed his view that Clinton could not be charged with a crime.
Nevertheless, Clinton felt damage was done and said Comey shared blame for her loss to Republican Donald Trump.
Comey has said he made the announcement because he feared the news would leak, and he didn't want it to appear that the FBI was covering anything up. Never miss a story

Andrade Journal Staff Writer Kevprojo 10:07 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 12:09 AM Following two weeks of dispute over the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility's decision to house immigrant detainees, the Central Falls Detention Facility Corporation board of directors voted 4 to 0 to suspend its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 90 days. The board also directed Warden Daniel W. Martin to return the remaining immigrant detainees — there are 62 or 63, according to City Council President Maria Rivera — to ICE custody within seven days.
CENTRAL FALLS — Following two weeks of dispute over the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility's decision to house immigrant detainees, the Central Falls Detention Facility Corporation board of directors voted 4 to 0 to suspend its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 90 days.
The board also directed Warden Daniel W. Martin to return the remaining immigrant detainees — there are 62 or 63, according to City Council President Maria Rivera — to ICE custody within seven days.
According to the board's newly elected chairman, immigration attorney Joseph Molina Flynn, Martin on Jan. 9 signed an agreement amending a federal contract to reserve 225 beds for ICE detainees without the approval of the directors.
""This board has the authority to enter into and terminate all contracts,"" said Flynn, who is also president of the Rhode Island Latino Political Action Committee. ""This modification was never vetted or approved by the board.""
During the next 90 days, provisions will be drawn up to ensure that immigrant detainees' rights are being respected before the board considers renewing the contract.
Board member Agostinho Silva recused himself from the proceedings due to his position on the City Council, which has been leading the charge against the facility.
Silva also recused himself on Wednesday when the council voted to disassociate Central Falls from Wyatt after several of its members led protests against the housing of ICE detainees.
The city's Wyatt board came to its decision after a 90-minute closed-door session with Warden Daniel W. Martin and legal counsel Kerry F. Walsh, a partner at Panone, Lopes, Deveraux, and O'Gara, LLC, which represents the facility.
Flynn said the city board saw no evidence that pro bono legal services, mental health services or religious services were being provided to the detainees, raising concern over due process rights and human rights.
""Many of the detainees currently being held are [visibly] under the age of 18,"" he said, adding later that there was no proper age-verification protocol in place at the facility.
The agreement, signed by Martin, said that the request for beds was in relation to ongoing zero tolerance policies at the southern border.
Flynn said the board was not consulted before the decision to accept the detainees was made.
Wyatt held immigrant detainees for several years until ICE withdrew them in 2008 following the death of detainee Jason Ng at the facility after signs that he was suffering from liver cancer were ignored by attending staff.
Flynn on Friday also ordered Wyatt spokesman Christopher D. Hunter to not send out any communications without his approval following his discovery that Hunter had sent out statements in coordination with the lawyers for a group of Wyatt bondholders, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, LLC.
Flynn also directed the institution's lawyers to not contact the bondholders' firm without Wyatt board approval, a condition that Walsh agreed to.
Martin declined comment on the board's decision regarding the detainees.
""It is bittersweet,"" said City Council member Jessica Vega, who along with most of the council members, wants Wyatt shut down completely. ""I just feel like this is a Band-Aid solution.
""I am happy and sad at the same time,"" she added. ""It is very concerning to me that we don't know what will happen to them after they are transferred to ICE.""
Vega added that Wyatt's existence sends the wrong message to city youth about their futures.
""The ball field is right across the street,"" she said. ""Our children look up when they're playing and see barbed wire.""
When asked whether there was any concern about legal moves by bondholders, Flynn said he was not overly concerned.
""The bondholders want what the bondholders want,"" he said, meaning money. ""I don't think that us taking the time to vet this contract modification is unreasonable [in that regard].""

On the one hand, you could call it thin: Talking about a decision made by Michigan's governor to halt work on a controversial pipeline on Wednesday's ""Frank Beckmann Show"" on Detroit's WJR-AM 760 (Hi, Frank!) Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, said that decisions about the Great Lakes should be based in ""in sound science ... we can’t be driven purely by emotion."" On the other hand: There's a long and tiresome history of men calling women ""emotional"" in order to undermine our decisions and discredit our leadership, and when it happens, it's important to call it out, not least because publicly framing a woman's choices as emotional rather than rational or reasoned works. Women, particularly female politicians, successfully cast as ""emotional"" often find it difficult to shed the label, researchers say. So that's a problem. Here's what happened: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats and both, you know, women, made no bones about their opposition to Line 5 during last year's campaigns. The aging pipeline runs through the Straits of Mackinac, and has become the target of environmental concerns because it's not in great shape, its location means that any spill or leak could imperil large swathes of the Great Lakes, and because it's owned by Canadian energy company Enbridge, a company with a terrible track record of transparency and environmental safety.

"“In This Difficult Time for the United States, it’s Perhaps Well to Ask What kind of a Nation We Are…” Bobby Kennedy’s Words on the Assassination Of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.",padresteve.com,padresteve,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://padresteve.com/2019/04/05/in-this-difficult-time-for-the-united-states-its-perhaps-well-to-ask-what-kind-of-a-nation-we-are-bobby-kennedys-words-on-the-assassination-of-dr-martin-luther/,"“In This Difficult Time for the United States, it’s Perhaps Well to Ask What kind of a Nation We Are…” Bobby Kennedy’s Words on the Assassination Of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Friends of Padre Steve’s World,
Fifty-one years ago yesterday a bullet killed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. while he was in Memphis supporting Sanitation Workers who were being subjected to unsafe working conditions without the same rights, protections, pay, or benefits of white Sanitation workers. As always there were threats on King’s life and he knew that he was a target. The night before his assassination Dr. King spoke at Mason Temple the international headquarters of the Church of God in Christ, the largest historically Black denomination in the United States.
That speech is now known as the “I have been to the mountaintop” speech. Dr. King had flown into Memphis earlier in the day, on a flight delayed by a bomb threat. King like many Civil Rights leaders of his day lived under the constant threat of physical violence, intimidation and assassination. After the heady days of the great march in Washington and the I Have a Dream speech and the award of the Nobel Prize his positions on social and economic justice and his opposition to the Vietnam War had made him a pariah of sorts, even in the Black community. He had place himself in the gunsights of his opponents as he pressed on in spite of the opposition.
Life was precious to him, but he like many others understood that it could be cut short at any moment for simply speaking the truth about racial discrimination, prejudice and violence. King himself had been accosted at different times and spent time in jail for “breaking” laws that enforced and enabled institutions and individuals to discriminate against Blacks with no consequences whatsoever. He was called a radical, a Communist and anti-American by those that opposed any changes to the status quo. He knew that his life was always in danger.
In that speech Dr. King seemed to understand the threat but he was determined to go on and to do God’s will. Dr. King understood that the Christian faith required more than intellectual assent to a doctrine. He understood the words of the German martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer: We are not to simply bandage the wounds of victims beneath the wheels of injustice, we are to drive a spoke into the wheel itself.”
At Mason Temple Dr King proclaimed:
“And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats…or talk about the threats that were out… What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well I don’t know what will happen now. We’ve got some difficult days ahead. but it doesn’t matter with me now. Because I been to the mountaintop. And I don’t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over.and I have seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land! And so I am happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I am not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of The Lord.”
It was April 4th 1968. The United States was divided by the Vietnam War and numerous social crises. President Lyndon Johnson had just done the unthinkable, he had announced that he was withdrawing from his reelection bid. In many places despite the integration of the Armed Forces, Baseball, the repeal of many Jim Crow laws and the passage of the 1964 Voter’s Rights Act African Americans still felt the sting of individual and institutional racial prejudice. In Vietnam the effects of the Tet Offensive still lingered even as American cities burned.
His speech at Mason Temple was almost prophetic in its message. The words of the thirty-nine year old Baptist Preacher from Atlanta echoed through the sanctuary of the church to the applause of those present even as a heavy spring thunderstorm rocked the city.
The following evening, King with a number of other Civil Rights leaders including Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, and Jessie Jackson were at the Lorraine Motel, where King often stayed. King was standing on the balcony outside of his room, Room 306 when at 6:01 PM he was cut down and mortally wounded by a single shot fired from a Remington 760 rifle. The bullet struck him in the right cheek, traveled down his spine and severed his jugular vein and several major arteries before it came to rest in his shoulder. He still had a heartbeat when the ambulance arrived and on his arrival at St Joseph’s Hospital. Efforts to revive him by opening his chest and attempting cardiac massage were unsuccessful and at 7:05 PM Dr King was pronounced dead.
Witnesses reported a man named James Earl Ray fleeing the area after the shooting. The Remington rifle and a pair of binoculars with Ray’s fingerprints were found at the scene. Ray was apprehended at London’s Heathrow Airport two months later. Ray was tried and convicted of Dr King’s murder. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison and died in 1998. During the trial Ray recanted his confession, implicated an unknown man named “Raul” who he had supposedly met in Montreal as being involved and said that “he personally did not kill” Dr King hinting at a conspiracy. Ray plead guilty to avoid the death penalty.
Other theories were postulated about the murder and Lloyd Jowers who owned a restaurant across from the Lorraine Motel claimed in a 1993 interview that the US Government and the Mafia were complicit in the killing, that Ray was a scapegoat and that Memphis Police Lieutenant Earl Clark was the shooter.
Jowers’ story is disputed but it was believed by King’s widow Coretta Scott King. She filed a wrongful death lawsuit in which a jury found that Jowers and others including government agencies were guilty of the plot to kill Dr King on December 8th 1998. Though Jowers’ story was contradicted by much of his own testimony during the trial the results have caused a divide in who experts believe killed Dr King. As for the King family they reconciled with Ray before his death.
Regardless of who killed Dr King the result was a shock to much of the nation and in many places riots broke out despite the pleadings of most Civil Rights leaders to continue in Dr King’s path of non-violence.
Senator Robert F Kennedy, then running for the Democratic Party nomination for President learned of Dr King’s shooting just before flying to Indianapolis for a campaign rally. On his arrival he learned of Dr King’s death. Warned by police that he could be in danger he made an impromptu speech from the back of a flat bed truck. The speech was short, under 5 minutes but its message is applicable even today.
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
I’m only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this evening, because I have some — some very sad news for all of you — Could you lower those signs, please? — I have some very sad news for all of you, and, I think, sad news for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world; and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.
Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it’s perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in. For those of you who are black — considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible — you can be filled with bitterness, and with hatred, and a desire for revenge.
We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization — black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand, and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion, and love.
For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with — be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.
But we have to make an effort in the United States. We have to make an effort to understand, to get beyond, or go beyond these rather difficult times.
My favorite poem, my — my favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote:
Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.
What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.
So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King — yeah, it’s true — but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love — a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke .
We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times. We’ve had difficult times in the past, but we — and we will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it’s not the end of disorder.
But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land.
And let’s dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.
Thank you very much.”
Two months later Kennedy was shot and mortally wounded by Sirhan Sirhan after winning the California Primary.
The loss of Dr King and later Senator Kennedy was profound. So tonight take the time to remember and pray that we all will be able to go to the mountain and see the promised land where in a more perfect Union we will heal the wounds that so divide our country.
Today the rights that Dr. King and so many others fought for dating back to the days of Frederick Douglass are being rolled back at the local, state and Federal level. The administration of President Trump and Republican led statehouses have been working overtime to silence dissent, discredit opposition, and through unjust laws and policies upend the civil rights not only of Blacks, but other people of color, immigrants, women, LGBTQ people, and Muslims. These are dark days when it comes to civil rights and freedom.
Dr. King noted the night before he was slain that “we’ve got some difficult days ahead” but as he told his staff in January 1968 “Hope is the final refusal to give up.” But we also must take seriously the words of Bobby Kennedy, “ it’s perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in. ”
I think that we really need to ask and answer that question before all those things that Dr. King and Senator Kennedy fought for are taken away by leaders who do not respect the principles of the Declaration , the Constitution, or the institutions and laws they were elected or appointed to uphold.
Peace"

Him claiming that he didn't know he was being offensive is ludicrous and then saying that he isn't sorry for anything he's ever done is a clear admonition he plans on continuing this behavior in spite of peoples outrage.
