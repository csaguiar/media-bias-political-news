This is an offshoot of the Mueller investigation.
I am an old broken record on the subject, often recounting here how the ""Ukrainian"" natural gas company
Burisma (with hdqts on Cyprus and in Kiev) profitably sell gas to Germany which is starving for energy because green energy policies there have shut down coal and nuclear facilities.
The problem may be this: does Burisma's gas really originate in the Ukraine? It's gas producing fields are in the Eastern region, the part controlled by pro-Russian elements. Ukraine has always had to bolster its own production with Russian gas just for its own needs. Germany needed to avoid appearing to buy gas directly from Moscow because it was supposed to be honoring sanctions at the time
Hunter Biden is somehow on the board of Burisma. In 2016 when Ukrainian President Poroshenko tried to investigate who really controls Burisma, Joe Biden forced Poroshenko to fire his chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin and cease the investigation. Biden threatened cut off of all U.S. loans.
Come on, inheritors of the Mueller leads, there is some real Russian collusion afoot. You can find it!"

I admit it. I haven't seen it yet, but I want High Life to be a great movie. I want to believe!
I appreciate the accusation that it's boring, but Solaris (1972) was like that. Part of it was that Solaris clocked in at around two hours and 45 minutes. Still, its themes and imagery haunted me long after I saw it--and isn't that the mark of a great science fiction film? High Life clocks in at under two hours. I can take that if there's a pay off.
In regards to the physics acting unlike they would in space, could that possibly be a literary effect, say, perhaps, dramatic irony? I haven't seen the film. I want to believe! Is the director telling us that the universal principles we're observing in space work the same way on earth?
