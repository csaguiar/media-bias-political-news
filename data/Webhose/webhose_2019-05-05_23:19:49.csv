Then right after that, just a few days ago, his wife tells the World, on Intstagram, that she had a miscarriage. Alec's wife told the World about her recent miscarriage & showed a pic of herself in her undies. Seems just s appropriate. Liberalism is definitely a Mental Disorder & it's Killing Us!!

Jussie Smollet’s Lawyer Says He Won’t Be “Intimidated” Into Paying Back Chicago Police For Overtime | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Kassy Dillon,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45642/jussie-smollets-lawyer-says-he-wont-be-intimidated-kassy-dillon,"Jussie Smollet’s Lawyer Says He Won’t Be 'Intimidated' Into Paying Back Chicago Police For Overtime Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images April 6, 2019 views After Jussie Smollett missed the Thursday deadline to pay back the Chicago police department for expenses involved in investigating the claim that he was the victim of a hate crime, the city of Chicago threatened a lawsuit. Smollett’s lawyers responded in a letter on Thursday claiming Smollett would not be paying back the police department the $130,000 requested. ""Mr. Smollett vehemently denies making any false statement to the City of Chicago, or to any individuals investigating"" the alleged attack, attorney Mark Geragos said in a statement to ABC News . ""All criminal charges against Mr. Smollett from this incident have been dismissed and his record has been sealed.”​ Geragos said that Smollett will “not be intimidated” by “threats that were made maliciously,” adding that it was “defamatory” for the police department to claim Smollett “filed a false police report and orchestrated his own attack.” The Associated Press reported that Geragos also said if Chicago follows through, he will demand the police chief testify under oath, depositions from the two brothers who claimed Smollett paid them to stage the hate crime, and all of the paperwork from the investigation.​ In response to missing the deadline, Bill McCaffrey, a spokesperson for the Department of Law, said that the city will be taking legal action. ""Mr. Smollett has refused to reimburse the City of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report on January 29, 2019,” McCaffrey said. “The Law Department is now drafting a civil complaint that will be filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County.""
On Thursday, The Daily Wire reported that the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police and dozens of suburban police chiefs called for the resignation of Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx whose officer dropped all 16 felony charges against Smollett.​ ""People standing around me can give you countless examples of how Ms. Foxx’s lack of prosecution has cost our members and police officers … an enormous amount of problems,"" Chicago FOP President Kevin Graham told reporters. ""Not to mention the fact that the people in Cook County are depending on prosecutors to put people in jail and charge them accordingly.""
""We need to have a prosecutor who is going to charge people when they commit a crime,"" Graham added. ""If there’s no charges and nobody goes to jail, then obviously the law doesn’t mean anything."" In response, Foxx said she has no plans to step down. ""I was elected by the people of Cook County to pursue community safety, prevent harm, and uphold the values of fairness and equal justice. I'm proud of my record in doing that, and I plan to do so through the end of my term and, if the people so will it, into the future,"" said Foxx, reported the Chicago Tribune .​ The court file for the case has reportedly been sealed and a judge will weigh whether to unseal the file next month after several media organizations requested access, according to the Associated Press."
