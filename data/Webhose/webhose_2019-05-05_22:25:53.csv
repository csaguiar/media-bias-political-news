Emerging artists converge on World Art Dubai,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/middle-east/emerging-artists-converge-on-world-art-dubai-586939.html,"Emerging Artists Converge On World Art Dubai Sumaira FH 1 day ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 07:00 PM
(UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 05th Apr, 2019) DUBAI , 5th April , 2019 (WAM) – Emerging solo artists from more than 30 countries, including the UAE , have descended upon World Art Dubai , the region’s most accessible and affordable annual art fair, now in its fifth year.
The line-up represents a fascinating look at up-and-coming artists who could become major international Names in the years to come.
Making his debut at this year’s fair is China ’s Li Lei, who has practised art for 20 years. Li is showcasing a 26-strong portfolio of acrylic and oil works, with prices ranging from US$1,000 to $10,000.
""I have exhibited in Bangladesh , Singapore and Greece , but World Art Dubai is my most important show to date ,"" said Li. ""I found out about the fair from some artists friends in Bangladesh that exhibited here last year. I did some research and the event is widely known amongst emerging artists in China . I am hoping to sell all my works and build a profile in the UAE .""
Dubai resident Saeedeh Keshvari is taking part for the first time after attending as a visitor in 2018 , ""I was really envious of the artists last year, so I decided to sign up. I believe World Art Dubai is the right stage to get my art seen on a wider international scale,"" said Keshvari.
Keshvari’s distinctive style involves reimaging the textual passages in calligraphy form entwined with simple, abstract self-portraits. Each work lives on homemade paper created by the artist herself.
Among the new artists joining the show this year is 11-year-old Shriya Mishra, who opted for World Art Dubai to make her debut after only starting to paint two years ago.
Talking about her nature-inspired art, the self-taught Dubai resident said, ""I like how art can tell you the expressions of a person without using words. Nature is really close to all the emotions we have in real life, so I find it easier to depict our emotions using nature rather than through more abstract styles of painting.""
Supporting both emerging and the next generation artists, World Art Dubai is hosting a number of competitions and awards to recognise those of particular note. Rove Emerging Artists Exhibition, a new feature of the show, is showcasing a shortlist of 10 artists’ work in partnership with Rove Hotels, with two pieces being selected on the final day (Saturday, 6th April ). Inspiring youth, World Art Dubai has worked with numerous schools across Abu Dhabi and Dubai to encourage students to pursue their artistic career.
The Sustainable Art school Competition will see chosen students from across the quintet of schools judged by experts.
Entry to World Art Dubai is AED25 for a daily pass when purchased on site at DWTC’s Sheikh Saeed Halls 2 and 3. The show remains open from 14:00 to 21:00, till Saturday, 6th April ."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project will be implemented even with the introduction of amendments to the EU Gas Directive, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters Friday.
On Thursday, the European Parliament approved amendments to the EU Gas Directive, which relate to the rules of operation of offshore sections of gas pipelines in the European Union . Now the amendments should be finally approved by the Council of the European Union .

The Nord Stream 2 project is a joint venture of Gazprom and five European companies: France 's ENGIE, Austria 's OMV, British-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, and Germany 's Uniper and Wintershall. The 745-mile-long pipeline is set to run from Russia to Germany to deliver Russian gas to European consumers.
The pipeline project has been welcomed by some countries in Europe and opposed by others who raise concerns over the alleged danger of Europe 's dependence on Russia and subsequent diminished transit role of Ukraine . Moscow has repeatedly reiterated that the pipeline is a purely commercial project."
US Will 'Never' Allow Saudi Arabia to Become Nuclear Power - Pompeo,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/us-will-never-allow-saudi-arabia-to-become-586931.html,"US Will 'Never' Allow Saudi Arabia To Become Nuclear Power - Pompeo Umer Jamshaid 1 day ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 06:55 PM
WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The United States will never allow Saudi Arabia to become a nuclear power and threaten its security and that of Israel , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on Friday.
""We will never write a $150 billion check to the Saudis and hand them over the capacity to threaten Israel and the United States with nuclear weapons. Never,"" Pompeo said in an interview with CBS news .
The $150 billion figure is a reference to the Iran nuclear agreement negotiated by the administration of President Barack Obama .
US President Donald Trump alleges that the Iran nuclear agreement , which provided sanctions relief in return for Iran 's pledge to keep its nuclear program peaceful, has cost US taxpayers $150 billion .
On May 8, Trump announced the United States ' withdrawal from the nuclear agreement and the reinstatement of US sanctions against Iran . The sanctions target Iran as well as anyone who chooses to continue trading with it.
The US move has been slammed by the remaining parties to the nuclear agreement - Iran , China , Russia , France , Germany , the United Kingdom and the European Union - who insist that Iran was honoring the deal.
On Wednesday, satellite images revealed that Saudi Arabia is nearing the completion of its first nuclear reactor.
US Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Fernandez urged Energy Secretary Rick Perry in a letter on Tuesday to not supply any nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia given Riyadh 's troubling record, which includes the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi .
The United States lacks any framework pact, or ""123 Agreement "" for any bilateral nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia , yet the Energy Department has already approved multiple licenses for US companies to sell nuclear energy technologies, Rubio and Fernandez said.

ISLAMABAD, Apr 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :More than 600 theatre personalities have signed a letter asking people to defeat BJP and its allies in elections, arguing that the idea of India and its constitution are under threat.
According to Kashmir Media Service (KMS) , the letter, which was issued in 12 languages on the Artist Unite India website, said the upcoming Lok Sabha elections are the most critical in the history of the country.
Among those who have signed the letter include Amol Palekar, Naseeruddin Shah, Girish Karnad, Usha Ganguli, Shanta Gokhale, Mahesh Elkunchwar, Mahesh Dattani, Arundhati Nag, Kirti Jain, Abhishek Majumdar, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah, Lillete Dubey, Mita Vashisth, M K Raina, Makarand Deshpande and Anurag Kashyap.
""Today, the very idea of India is under threat. Today, song, dance, laughter is under threat. Today, our Constitution is under threat,"" they said. The government has suffocated the institutions where argument, debate and dissent were nurtured, the letter stated. ""A democracy must empower its weakest, its most marginalised. A democracy cannot function without questioning, debate, and a vibrant opposition . All this is being concertedly eroded by the current government . ""The BJP, which came to power five years ago with the promise of development, has given free hand to Hindutva goons to indulge in the politics of hate and violence,"" it added.
In an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the letter stated that he had destroyed the lives of many people through his government 's policies and had failed on the promises he made. The letter does not refer to the prime minister by name. ""He promised to bring back black money; instead, rogues have looted the country and run away. The wealth of the rich has grown astronomically, while the poor have become even poorer.""The letter asked people to protect the ""Constitution and our syncretic, secular ethos"" and vote ""bigotry, hatred, and apathy"" out of power. ""We appeal to our fellow citizens to vote for love and compassion, for equality and social justice, and to defeat the forces of darkness and barbarism,"" the letter read. "" Vote to empower the weakest, protect liberty, protect the environment, and foster scientific thinking. Vote for secular democratic, inclusive India ,"" it added.
A few days ago, over 200 prominent Indian writers including Arundhati Roy signed a joint petition against the politics of hate being pursued by Bharatiya Janata Party urging the Indian voters to defeat the BJP in upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Bucharest, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Eurozone finance ministers said darkening clouds in Germany and Italy posed a danger to the European economy as France pushed for a common budget to buck the tide.
The eurozone economy is struggling, with export powerhouse Germany suffering from the slowdown in China and rising protectionism sparked by the United States .
Italy meanwhile has been in recession since the second half of last year, caught under a mountain of public debt, fragile banks and diving investor confidence.
France has also seen growth slow as ""yellow vest"" protesters disrupted business .
""We are concerned about the situation in Germany , we are concerned by the recession in Italy ,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on the sidelines of a meeting of eurozone and EU finance ministers in Bucharest .
""I think that the current economic situation clearly proves that there is a need now for decisions,"" he said.
At the heart of France 's thinking is the idea of a eurozone budget that would deliver fresh financial firepower to the 19 countries using Europe 's single Currency .
But ministers have struggled for months with the idea, first introduced by French President Emmanuel Macron. Northern European countries, spurred on by the Netherlands , have been reluctant to sign on.
Discussions begun in 2017 have produced little, with ministers stuck in disagreements over the size of the budget , how it will be financed and the conditions for payouts.
Divisions are so great that ministers officially refer to the proposal not as a budget , but as a something called an instrument in order to not ruffle feathers.
""We are making useful progress in this discussion, which is not simple either from a political or technical point of view,"" said EU Economics Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici after talks with ministers in Bucharest .
The ministers, who meet every month, have agreed to strike a compromise on the proposal in time for an EU leader's summit in June .
But any sense of urgency was not shared by the Dutch.
""I'm not in a hurry at all ,"" said Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra.
The Netherlands has ""clear conditions... If we can make it work all the better. If it doesn't, it is unlikely that we would take part,"" he said.
The EU's new economic forecasts come out on May 7 and few expect a turnaround from the gloominess.
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde last week warned that the eurozone was ""not resilient enough"" to withstand another crisis. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

ISLAMABAD, Apr 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Pakistan Sports board (PSB) Friday expressed surprised over National Olympic Association (POA) President Lt. General (R) Syed Arif Hasan for using media as a medium to air his grievance instead of taking-up the issue with the Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) minister regarding the forthcoming 13th South Asian Games.
PSB rebutted a story published in a national daily on March 19 regarding preparation of Pakistan sportspersons for participation in the Games, scheduled at Kathmandu ( Nepal ) from December 1 to 10.
PSB said it was premature to lodge such complaints though media reports while avoiding a formal meeting with the IPC minister Dr. Fehmida Mirza to chalk out necessary modalities. ""POA president met IPC minister in the last week of February and intimated about the forthcoming Games for which the modalities were yet to be discussed with him by the minister,"" PSB said.
PSB said the IPC minister tried to contact POA president but he was out of reach and a message was sent by him that he would be available to call on the minister by the last week of March . ""On one hand, POA claims to be an independent body affiliated with International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) getting grants from it while on the other hand POA is seeking government 's assurance for the Games,"" it said.
""National Sports Federations elect POA president and the government has no role in it, despite the fact that government provides grants to federations with no significant performance of the teams participating in international events,"" PSB said.
PSB said the government has been providing financial grants to the federations in the past for holding training camps at different venues. ""PSB will also hold meeting with the minister, concerned federations and POA to chalk-out effective preparation and participation plan for the forthcoming Games,"" it said.
PSB and IPC ministry are fully aware of the event and an in-house meeting is scheduled to be held shortly to finalize the way forward. ""The incumbent government is taking concrete measures by revamping and restructuring of sports structure in the country,"" PSB said.
It may be mentioned here that the Games were earlier scheduled in March but were postponed to December in a meeting held in Bangkok on March 1. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

US Admits 2 Civilian Casualties in Somalia Airstrike - AFRICOM,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/us-admits-2-civilian-casualties-in-somalia-ai-586923.html,"US Admits 2 Civilian Casualties In Somalia Airstrike - AFRICOM Zeeshan Aziz (@imziishan) 1 day ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 06:40 PM
WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) A US military review has concluded that two civilians were killed in an airstrike in Somali last year, United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) said in a press release on Friday.
""During a commander-directed review of airstrikes conducted in Somalia since 2017 , US Africa Command learned an April 1, 2018 airstrike killed two civilians,"" AFRICOM said.
AFRICOM ordered a review of all of the airstrikes it conducted in the country since 2017 due to an increase in its attacks, as well as continued interest by Amnesty International and the US Congress in information on civilian casualties, the release added.
US forces conducted the deadly airstrike near the Somali city of El Burr on April 1, 2018 , in a bid to degrade the al-Shabab terrorist group.
AFRICOM said in an initial assessment after the attack that its strike had caused no civilian casualties and had left five militants dead .
However, the additional review found several mistakes in those conclusions.
""On March 30, 2019 , the command was notified about the results of a post-strike internal assessment conducted in April 2018 that found credible evidence of the two civilian casualties,"" AFRICOM said. ""Unfortunately, the finding was not properly reported to US Africa Command headquarters.""
The review found that four al-Shabab militants were killed in the airstrike, along with the two civilians.
""Because of the reporting error, US Africa Command was not informed of the assessment's conclusion and subsequently the information was not reported to external authorities, such as the host nation and [US] Congress ,"" AFRICOM said.
The US military has notified the Somali government of its new findings, the release said. AFRICOM has executed 28 airstrikes so far in Somalia in 2019 , compared to 47 in 2018 , and 35 in 2017 , it added.
Al-Shabab emerged in Somalia in 2006 and has claimed numerous terrorist attacks throughout the region. The group has sworn allegiance to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization (banned in Russia ) and is trying to overthrow Somalia 's Western-backed central government .

DONETSK (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Shelling by the Ukrainian forces killed five people and left seven others injured in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) over the past week, a spokesperson for the DPR ombudsman said on Friday.
""Between March 29 and April 4, 2019 , seven people, including four DPR servicemen, were wounded ... and five servicemen of the republic were killed in the Donetsk People's Republic as a result of an armed aggression by Ukraine ,"" the spokesperson told reporters.
The DPR ombudsman's office noted that a total of 41 people were injured and 42 others were killed as a result of the hostilities since the beginning of the year. Since the start of the armed conflict in 2014, 4,771 people, including 81 children, were killed in the DPR.
The conflict in Donbas started in 2014, when Ukrainian authorities launched a military operation against the self-proclaimed republics that refused to recognize the new government in Kiev , which came to power after what they considered to be a coup.
In February 2015 , the warring parties signed the Minsk peace accords to end the hostilities in the region, but the situation has remained tense, with both parties accusing each other of ceasefire violations."

According to the source, Haftar's troops advanced in the western direction capturing, in particular, the city of Gharyan , and then entrenched in the checkpoint area 27 kilometers (some 17 miles) from Tripoli .
""However, last night, the [pro-government] forces arriving from Tripoli and Az-Zawiyah launched a counterattack and encircled them,"" the source said, adding that at least 150 people from Haftar's units, as well as about 60 vehicles , were captured.
As a result of years-long civil conflict, there is no single central government in Libya , and the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament , elected in 2014 and backed by the Libyan National Army , governs the east of Libya , while the UN-supported interim Government of National Accord (GNA) controls Libya 's western parts from Tripoli .
On Wednesday, the GNA declared a general military alert after Haftar-led eastern forces announced they were moving to western parts of the country."

BRUSSELS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Eurogroup has agreed a grant for Greece to the tune of $1 million to reward it for delivering on its budget commitments, according to Mario Centeno, the head of the 19-nation single Currency club.
""At this stage, Greece has taken the necessary actions to deliver on its commitments,"" Centeno said after the Eurogroup meeting in Bucharest , noting that debt-reduction measures and other incentives added up to a grant of 970 million Euros .
The money will come from reduction to zero of the step-up interest margin on certain EU loans to Greece as well as from measures that concern the transfer to Greece of profits made by European central banks on Greek government bonds , Centeno said.
""It... sends investors a positive signal of continued ownership of the reform agenda in Greece , and you can see this already going on in the markets today,"" he stressed.
Last August , Greece emerged from an eight-year bailout program after repaying debts to the International Monetary Fund and EU creditors. It was forced to amend its high-spending 2019 budget to implement austerity measures and keep its debt sustainable. Eurogroup has been monitoring its compliance."

Bucharest, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Eurozone finance ministers released long delayed debt relief to Greece on Friday, saying the government had implemented reforms promised during the massive bailout that ended last year.
Greece exited its third and final international bailout in August , a turning point in its progress out of the catastrophe that engulfed the country during the debt crisis.
But the Greek government had failed to complete politically sensitive reforms such as changes to housing foreclosure rules that spooked families struggling with mortgages on their homes.
"" All in all , Greece has done what was necessary to respect its commitments. The decision gives a new, very strong signal to the markets ,"" said EU Economics Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici after talks with ministers in Bucharest .
In a statement, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers accepted the view that "" Greece has taken the necessary actions to achieve all specific reform commitments."" This meant that the ""conditions are in place"" to unlock debt relief measures worth 970 million Euros ($1.1 billion ), the statement said.
The debt relief measures are mainly profits made by the European Central Bank (ECB) and other EU central banks on Greek government bonds during the bailout period.
The decision comes as hopes rise that Greece has turned the economic corner. Last month Athens issued a 10-year bond , the first major borrowing effort since its debt crisis.
Greece's deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis on Friday said the country's next aim ""should be to repay some of our IMF loans that carry a high interest rate"".
Dragasakis added that Greece was keen ""to exploit market opportunities"" as borrowing rates are falling.
Greece owes the global lender, which paid into the first two of the country's three bailouts, an estimated 12 billion euros.
Showing the IMF the door has been a consistent aim of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' leftist government .
""We have a plan to stop having the IMF here, and soon we will carry it out,"" Tsipras said last month.
The country hopes to raise a total of around nine billion euros in the markets this year to boost investor confidence in the Greek economy.
Growth is expected to reach 2.4 percent in 2019 after an estimated 2.1 percent in 2018 , according to the latest International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) projections. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

CAIRO (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has began its advance on Tripoli from several directions simultaneously, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said on Friday.
""We are next to Al-Swani. This is a heavily populated settlement about 25 kilometers [15 miles] south of Tripoli . We are also advancing toward Tripoli from other directions. In addition, we are conducting an operation in Janzur, but unfortunately, we have had to withdraw a little from there,"" Mismari told Sputnik.
The spokesman added that the LNA was advancing slowly, but confidently and according to Haftar's plan.
Mismari also said that despite the LNA conducting operations in Al-Swani, which is close to Tripoli , it had not reached the capital as of yet.
Mismari also said that he could not predict when the operation would conclude due to the conditions under which the operation was being carried out.
On Thursday, Haftar announced that he had ordered his troops to launch an offensive on Tripoli to ""liberate the city from terrorists"" after his army took control over cities of Surman and Garyan near Tripoli . His announcement sparked international concern over the escalation of tension in Libya .
As a result of years-long civil conflict, there is no single central government in Libya , and the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament , elected in 2014 and backed by the LNA, governs the east of Libya , while the UN-backed Government of National Accord, established in 2015 , controls Libya 's western parts from Tripoli ."

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said he's ""confident"" that there will be a third summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
""I'm confident there will be,"" Pompeo said in an interview with CBS news when asked about the potential for a third meeting between the two leaders.
The secretary of state noted that he doesn't know when this potential third summit might take place, but said he hopes that it will be soon.
""Chairman Kim has promised me, he's promised President Trump he will denuclearize. Now it's the mission of my team to make sure that happens,"" Pompeo said.
On March 22, Trump said in a statement that he had ordered the withdrawal of additional large-scale US sanctions against North Korea that the US Treasury Department tried to impose on that country.
Trump said his decision not to implement additional sanctions on North Korea does not mean he may not impose more sanctions later on, however, he noted that is focused at present on maintaining a good relationship with Kim.
At their first historic summit in Singapore last June , Trump and Kim agreed that North Korea would make efforts toward complete denuclearization in exchange for freezing of US-South Korean military exercises and gradual removal of sanctions.
While an agreement was expected to be signed at the second summit in Hanoi , Trump walked away from talks, as Kim demanded full removal of sanctions without pledging to denuclearize the sites that the United States had specified."

TAL-KURDI (Syria) (UrduPoint news / Sputnik - 05th April , 2019 ) KURDI ( Syria ), April 5 (Sputnik) - Chinese carmakers have been setting up manufacturing plants in Syria following the withdrawal of Western investors, while local business also hopes to see the opening of the Russian car production factories in the middle Eastern country.
""This plant was built in 2012, just before the start of the war. We were forced to evacuate soon after we started the manufacturing [business]. In 2016 , the area was liberated [from militants], but when we came back, we found out everything had been destroyed. Chinese investors offered their assistance in rebuilding the plant,"" Bilal Shammout, the executive director of the car factory, said, adding that now the plant produces about 10 cars a day.
""The assembly technology is very simple: the frame goes first, then the engine, then the transmission, the gas tank , the electrical engineering,"" Mager Halyawe, a factory worker, explained.
The car production process is organized according to Syrian and Chinese standards.
""We assemble more of certain [car] models in response to demand. Everything you see in the showroom, at the workshop, is the cars that were assembled here,"" Shammout said.
For example, a small pickup truck with a manual gearbox and a load capacity of up to a tonne is in demand among farmers and traders. Its market price is about $5,000, including customs fees.
""After the assembly , we drive the cars to the test site at the neighboring workshop ... Then the cars are tested on the street, and if there are no complaints from inspectors a car is put up for sale ,"" he added.
A model of a Chinese off-road car looks like an Audi , but is way cheaper, with a cost of about $20,000. Still, not many people in Syria can afford it.
SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED SPECIALISTS
Syrian authorities are providing support to car manufacturers as they are interested in the growing car market .
""We were provided with a constant power supply as well as fuel supplies to be able to fully test the cars. Moreover, when we send a request to the chamber of industry in Damascus , it is never rejected ... and we do not have to deal with bureaucracy,"" the plant director noted.
However, according to Shammout, the shortage of qualified specialists is one of the problems his company is currently facing.
""Now we really need more workers, both specialists and handymen. We are ready to hire both refugees and foreigners ... We have sent letters to the chamber of industry multiple times to help us find qualified workers,"" Shamut said.
He said a qualified specialist can earn up to $500 a month in his factory, while the average monthly salary in today's Syria is $120-$130.
At the moment, Shammout's factory employs 70 people.
""I worked as a mechanic in a small car repair shop before the war, and I also had my own shop selling auto parts. But they were looted by militants . I lost my job , could not feed my family . When I found out that they were recruiting here, I immediately applied [for the job]. The salary here is decent,"" Halyawe told Sputnik.
The last batch of modern cars came to Damascus at the end of 2011. The car dealerships that the capital's suburb of Harasta was once full of were destroyed during the fighting. Government forces regained control of this suburb in early 2018 , but the car dealerships did not reopen because international carmakers stopped cooperating with Syria due to sanctions.
The Chinese business has immediately taken advantage of the situation, but Shammout hopes to see Russian manufacturers such as Lada also opening their plants in Syria . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
