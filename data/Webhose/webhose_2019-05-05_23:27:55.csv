Natural News is now de-platformed by Twitter, YouTube and Google, with 99% shadowbanning on Facebook: We depend on YOU to share our stories and lifesaving messages with the world
“....Even more importantly, the fact that Twitter selectively de-platforms pro-America, pro-Trump voices transforms Twitter into a publisher, not an open platform, meaning Twitter should enjoy no protection whatsoever under the CDA Sec. 230 that currently grants tech companies legal immunity on all the content they host but only if they function as open, public platforms.
By silencing conservative, pro-America voices, Twitter has abandoned any claim to Sec. 230 protections. This means Twitter can now be sued for all the content that appears on its platform, since Twitter as actually a publisher that engages in aggressive, politically-oriented censorship of whatever content it doesn’t like.
It’s time for Twitter to be sued and for Jack Dorsey to be arrested for racketeering, election meddling, contract fraud and for carrying out repeated violations against the civil rights of Americans Google, for example, has become the propaganda ministry for Big Pharma’s lies about medications and vaccines. Use Google to search for “MMR vaccine,” and you get nothing but CDC propaganda, Big Pharma lies and dishonest websites and blogs that rave about the safety and efficacy of MMR vaccines. Google has systematically suppressed all websites that dare talk about vaccine ingredients, vaccine side effects, vaccine propaganda, CDC quack science or corruption and fraud throughout the vaccine industry.
All these tech giants hide their fascist de-platforming activities under the dishonest banner of “removing hate speech,” but their definition of “hate speech” is deceptive from the start. As PJ Media explains:
Facebook and other social media platforms have rules against “hate speech,” which increasingly has come to mean speech that liberals in Silicon Valley disagree with. If you criticize a woman who brags about her abortion on social media, you’re engaging in hate speech. If you insist that there are only two genders or that marriage should be limited to one man and one woman, you’re guilty of hate speech, according to our moral betters who run the social media platforms.
“Hate speech,” in other words, is anything lunatic Leftists don’t want to hear. Leftists are now even equating their censorship with “freedom,” claiming that anyone who contradicts their twisted worldview is engaged in taking away their freedom, and thus censoring, banning and de-platforming all political opponents is how they “protect freedom.” We are currently working with attorneys and lawmakers to help challenge the speech monopolies of the tech giants...”...
Censored.news is our alternative to Google News. It aggregates, in real time, news headlines from across the internet’s most heavily censored websites.
Brighteon.com is the alternative to YouTube. This free speech video site hosts 100,000+ videos from thousands of channels, many of which have been banned by YouTube. Brighteon was recently under severe attack by upstream infrastructure providers, but it survived the attack and is being engineered for a “Brighteon 2.0” release later this year, which will insulate the service from censorship threats in the future.
NewsTarget.com is our politics and culture news website. There, you’ll find original stories each day that aren’t always on Natural News.
The Natural News email newsletter brings you a daily email summary of that day’s most important news headlines. Subscribing is free, and our email subscriber list is kept strictly confidential to us.
Counterthink.com is a video commentary and analysis website featuring episodes of the Counterthink broadcast. Here, you’ll find my analysis of current events, civil war, survival strategies and the globalist agenda for human depopulation.

Science.news – All about scientific discoveries, nearly all articles cite science journals.
Medicine.news – Covers more mainstream medicine, including medical technology and medical studies about prevention and longevity.

Research.news – All about research into nutrition, science, medicine, environment and more.
Robots.news – Breaking news about robotics, AI systems and automation systems that are increasingly replacing human workers.
