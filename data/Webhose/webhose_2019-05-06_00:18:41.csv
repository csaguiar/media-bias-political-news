1st Living HIV-Positive Organ Donor Wants To Lift 'The Shroud Of HIV Related Stigma',wcqs.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/1st-living-hiv-positive-organ-donor-wants-lift-shroud-hiv-related-stigma,"/
Nina Martinez just became the world's first living HIV-positive organ donor.
In a medical breakthrough, surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital late last month successfully transplanted one of her kidneys to a recipient who is also HIV positive.
""I feel wonderful,"" Martinez, 35, said in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, 11 days into her recovery. The patient who received her kidney has chosen to remain anonymous, but is doing well, Martinez is told.
""They're doing wonderfully and they got an organ they desperately needed to get and that's all I could ask for,"" Martinez said.
HIV advocates are celebrating the achievement as an important step towards lifting the stigma around a disease that affects some 1.1 million Americans . In 2017, an estimated 18 patients died each day while waiting for an organ transplant. Many of these deaths involved HIV positive patients who have traditionally had access to a much smaller pool of potential organ donors. The decision to donate
Martinez contracted HIV through a blood transfusion when she was an infant in the early 1980s.
""I do think that my lack of discomfort in talking about HIV does make people more comfortable with the idea, and I do attribute that to being diagnosed at such a young age,"" she said. ""I didn't know HIV was supposed to be something that I was ashamed of.""
She said she first looked into becoming a donor last year, when Johns Hopkins became the first hospital in the United States to announce plans to perform organ transplants for HIV patients from donors who are HIV positive. Previously, doctors had only transplanted organs to HIV-positive recipients from deceased HIV donors.
""Like most living kidney donors, I did start this process for a friend that I knew who needed a kidney,"" said Martinez.
Then her friend died in November, when Martinez was in the middle of a rigorous evaluation process. ""I knew that this was a lot of medical spending not to try and do something with,"" she said. So Johns Hopkins found another recipient.
Explaining why she felt compelled to share her story, Martinez pointed to when Johns Hopkins performed the first transplants from deceased HIV-positive donors to two anonymous patients in 2016.
""It was important to me to be able to put a name and a face to that story to show that the need for HIV-positive organs is real and actually benefits everybody,"" she said. ""My taking somebody off the deceased donor waitlist who is HIV positive means that everyone moves up the waitlist whether they're HIV positive or not.""
Currently, more than 113,000 people in the U.S. ‚Äî including those living with HIV ‚Äî are waiting to receive an organ transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). A years-long drive
Last month's surgery marked the culmination of a years-long drive to expand access to organ donors for patients with HIV.
In 2016, UNOS gave Johns Hopkins approval to carry out the first transplant from an HIV positive donor to an HIV positive patient, capping a two-year push by Martinez's surgeon, Dorry Segev, to legalize such procedures.
Before that, Segev, an associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, helped draft the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act signed by President Obama in 2013. The measure reversed a 1988 law preventing doctors from procuring HIV-infected organs regardless of the recipient's HIV status.
Segev, speaking with NPR in 2016 , said he was motivated to address the ""antiquated law"" when he saw that the need for organ transplants among HIV patients had swelled since the start of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s.
Segev said he grew frustrated as he watched potentially life-saving organs going to waste. In one 2011 study , he and his colleagues projected that an estimated 500 to 600 would-be organ donors with HIV die each year. Had they been allowed to donate while they were alive, they could have been saving more than 1,000 lives annually.
""We were throwing away organs that were infected with HIV that could be used to help people with HIV,"" Segev said.
Today, an HIV diagnosis is no longer the death sentence it once was. ""People live their lives with it,"" said Segev. ""They just need to take antiretroviral medication.""
But patients who use those antiretroviral treatments ‚Äî along with other drugs used to treat the disease ‚Äî are also at higher risks of kidney and liver failure and often end up on the organ waiting list. Keeping transplants safe
Given the risk of kidney disease that's associated with HIV, the medical community has until relatively recently considered it unsafe to leave a would-be donor with just one kidney.
But newer medications are thought to be both more effective and safer, and to guard against potential complications, Martinez was made to go through months of rigorous testing to ensure success for her and her recipient.
""They determined that my future risk of kidney disease was really, really, small,"" Martinez said.
Martinez hopes her visibility and openness about her disease encourages others to realize they can be a part of advanced new treatments that allow HIV-positive people to live a healthy life.
""I hope that people who are not living with HIV who wouldn't normally consider themselves to be potential living kidney donors would actually consider it in earnest, as well as people living with HIV who are on great treatment.""

Mummified Mice And Falcons Found In Newly Unveiled Egyptian Tomb,wcqs.org,Jenny Gathright,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/mummified-mice-and-falcons-found-newly-unveiled-egyptian-tomb,"By Jenny Gathright ‚Ä¢ 5 hours ago An archeologist holds an ancient mummified bird that was found in a burial site unveiled on Friday.

The recent discovery of mummified cats in a well-preserved tomb probably shouldn't be surprising. It's a long-established fact that ancient Egyptians loved cats .
What's perhaps more remarkable, however, is the fact that a tomb unveiled on Friday contained a sort of mummified menagerie of 50 animals ‚Äî and there were mummified mice and falconsin addition to the cats. The Tomb of Tutu in Sohag contained mummified mice and falcons. Mohamed Abd El Ghany / Reuters
The tomb is colorfully painted and well-preserved ‚Äî and Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, called it ""one of the most exciting discoveries ever in the area.""
Waziri told Reuters the tomb contains a lobby and a burial room with two stone coffins. It is said to have been built for a man named Tutu and his wife. The area outside the burial chamber also contained mummies of a woman and a boy between 12 and 14 years old. The newly discovered site also contains well-preserved wall paintings. On the walls of the tomb are depicted funeral processions; images of the owner, Tutu; and his family genealogy. Mohamed Abd El Ghany / Reuters
This animal-filled tomb is part of a series of recent archaeological discoveries in Egypt. According to Reuters, the tomb was one of seven burial sites found near the Egyptian town of Sohag last October. Smugglers had been illegally digging for artifacts in the area.
Another tomb was unveiled in Saqqara , outside of Cairo, in December. Dozens of cat mummies and 100 cat statues were also found in Saqqara in November. February 2018 saw the unveiling of another 4,400-year-old tomb .
As NPR's Laurel Wamsley reported, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities sees the announcement of new discoveries as a way to attract tourists.
Tourism in Egypt slowed for years after the 2011 revolution. In December, The Associated Press reported that the industry has yet to recover, even though visits are gradually increasing.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Fritz Hollings has died, the former South Carolina governor and six-term U.S. senator. He was 97. Here's Fritz Hollings giving his farewell speech on the Senate floor in 2004.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
FRITZ HOLLINGS: And if you really ought to be enriched - your life, period, right across the board - the best postgraduate course and everything you can possibly take is to run and be in the Senate.
SIMON: Mr. Hollings also ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984. We're joined now by Kirk Victor, who collaborated with Fritz Hollings on a memoir. And he covered him as a correspondent with National Journal. Thanks very much for being with us, Mr. Victor.
KIRK VICTOR: It's an honor to be with you, Scott. I've listened to you for years. Although, very sad circumstances.
SIMON: He was - well, the word colorful doesn't quite cover it, does it?
VICTOR: It really does not. He was quick-witted, sharp. His acerbic tongue, I think, sometimes got more coverage than his accomplishments. Just as an example, in one of his Senate races back in '86, his opponent, a guy named McMaster, challenged him to a drug test. And Senator Hollings said, I'll take a drug test if you will take an IQ test.
SIMON: (Laughter) Mercy. Well, and you point out there's obviously a couple of other instances in which maybe he was just a little too colorful, right?
VICTOR: A little too colorful, yes, indeed.
SIMON: He - when he first ran for governor of South Carolina, he campaigned against desegregation. But he changed his mind in public, in office, didn't he?
VICTOR: He did. I mean, one of the most remarkable things he did actually was at the end of his gubernatorial term, when he didn't have to, but he gave an address to the state legislature and said we have run out of courts. The rule of law is supreme. We cannot essentially stand in the courthouse door. We can't support segregation anymore.
And this is when African-American Harvey Gantt was seeking and had been admitted to Clemson. And of course, there was great resistance throughout the South.
SIMON: It's impossible to sum up 38 years in the Senate, but I put you in that position anyway.
VICTOR: Well, that is a very difficult position to be in because he did so much. He was a deficit hawk. He spoke his mind. He was just - he fought hunger, helped create the the WIC program - Women, Infants and Children program. He was a proud protectionist in some ways on trade. So it's very difficult to sum up what a remarkable career he had.
SIMON: And there was a courthouse named for him. He took an unusual position in his later years, didn't he?
VICTOR: He did. That was just four years ago in 2015 with the Hollings Judicial Center in Charleston. And he wanted to have it renamed for a courageous judge, Judge Waring, who in the '40s and '50s ruled against segregation and got death threats and was shunned in Charleston and throughout the state. And Hollings took - and Senator Hollings took the unprecedented move of urging that courthouse be renamed. Stunning. And Senator Lindsey Graham, vice president - then Vice President Biden - and others spoke and just were very moved by an incredible gesture by, really, a very great senator.
SIMON: Kirk Victor on the death of former South Carolina governor and six-term U.S. senator Fritz Hollings. Thanks so much for being with us.
VICTOR: Thank you so much for having me on, Scott. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. ¬© 2019 BPR"
U.N. Urges An End To Fighting In Libya As Opposition Army Heads Toward Tripoli,wcqs.org,Jenny Gathright,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/un-urges-end-fighting-libya-opposition-army-heads-toward-tripoli,"By Jenny Gathright ‚Ä¢ 7 hours ago Gen. Khalifa Hafter is Libya's former top army chief. He now leads the Libyan National Army, which is advancing toward the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli.

Updated at 3:48 p.m.
International concern is mounting over the situation in Libya. The Libyan National Army, led by Khalifa Haftar, says it has now advanced into the southern outskirts of the capital Tripoli, where the U.N.-backed government is located.
G7 foreign ministers have urged an end to the fighting. ""We urge all involved parties to immediately halt all military activity and movements toward Tripoli,"" the body, which is composed of the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. wrote in a statement.
The U.N. Security Council, which met behind closed doors on Friday, has also called on Libyan National Army forces to cease their advances.
The fear, according to The Associated Press, is that the Libyan National Army's advances toward the capitol could lead to ""a major showdown with rival militias."" Both the Libyan National Army and the U.N.-backed government have various militias supporting them.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres left Libya on Friday . He met with Gen. Haftar and then told journalists he was leaving Libya ""with a deep concern and a heavy heart."" Guterres has insisted that Libya needs a political solution, not a military one, and said the U.N. is available to facilitate a peace process.
The U.N. is still planning to hold a previously scheduled conference on elections in Libya, Reuters reported. The event, scheduled to begin April 14 in the country's southwestern town of Ghadames, is a set-aside time to consider whether elections could provide a path towards peace in the country.
""We know that holding the conference in this difficult time of escalation and fighting is a difficult matter,"" U.N. special envoy Ghassan Salame told reporters in Tripoli on Saturday. ""But we are determined to hold it on time unless compelling circumstances force us not to.""
Libya has been extremely unstable since NATO-backed forces deposed its former dictator Moammar Ghadafi in 2011.
In a 2016 interview with Fox News, former President Barack Obama called his handling of the aftermath of that revolution the worst mistake of his presidency. Obama has said the U.S. should have done more to fill the vacuum left by Ghadafi.
By 2014, Libya had devolved into a civil war, and ISIS had become increasingly influential there. According to Reuters, the U.S. provided air support to Libyan forces fighting ISIS in 2016 and continued to launch strikes on suspected militants there after the end of that campaign.
A study conducted by the New America Foundation found that at least 2,158 airstrikes and drone strikes were conducted by foreign and domestic powers in Libya between September 2012 and June 2018. According to the study's estimates, between 242 and 395 civilians were killed in the strikes, and between 324 and 524 were wounded.
New America found that the Libyan National Army, led by Haftar, conducted 1,112 of those airstrikes. The United States conducted 524 of them.
In addition to political and military chaos in Libya, there have also been reports of gross human rights violations there. Last year, the United Nations human rights office found that the country contained ""open slave markets"" where migrants were bought and sold . According to Reuters, various armed groups control many of the country's ports and beaches. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ¬© 2019 BPR"

Breaking The Cycle Of Disinvestment In Lower-Income Communities,wcqs.org,Claire Trageser,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/breaking-cycle-disinvestment-lower-income-communities,"Breaking The Cycle Of Disinvestment In Lower-Income Communities By Claire Trageser ‚Ä¢ 9 hours ago Project Reo Collective is a coffee shop in San Diego's Paradise Hills neighborhood that had trouble getting a bank loan to expand after a year of operation. Claire Trageser / KPBS
It's not uncommon for people who want to start businesses in lower-income neighborhoods to have trouble getting bank loans. But increasingly, there are investors looking specifically to help businesses in those areas, with the aim of reversing the cycle of disinvestment.
""There's always reasons to say no to a borrower. We are looking for reasons to say yes,"" says Lauren Grattan, a founder of the San Diego-based investment company Mission Driven Finance . She explained that her company doesn't look at personal credit scores. ""We instead look at the validity of the business and how well can you repay from the business earnings.""
Her company's goal is to fill the gap between more traditional profit-motivated investing and philanthropy that focuses on economic development.
One business that could have used help like this is Project Reo Collective , a coffee shop in Paradise Hills, a lower-income neighborhood of San Diego.
The coffee shop is situated in a small strip mall near a Mexican restaurant and a cell phone store. On most days, the cafe is filled with people working on laptops or hanging out while drinking Mexican mochas or lavender lemonades. Two specialties of the Project Reo Collective coffee shop are its lavender lemonade and Mexican mocha. Claire Trageser / KPBS
""Project Reo Collective started out as five families who got together ... cleaning up the neighborhood here,"" says Tommy Walker, one of the owners. ""A lot of people in the neighborhood said, 'We wish we had somewhere to hang out, somewhere we grab a cup of coffee, meet our neighbors, do some homework or study.' "" You have a cycle that kind of perpetuates that neighborhood being less friendly to business. Businesses don't get started. So employment stays depressed. The job opportunities aren't there in the neighborhood. Businesses that are there don't expand. - Spencer Cowan, Woodstock Institute
Walker says that after a successful first year, he went to a bank asking to borrow $4,000 for an espresso machine. But, he didn't have any luck.
""They said, 'No, you guys don't qualify because you haven't been around long enough,' "" he says.
A problem of disinvestment
Having trouble getting a small-business loan like this is typical, according to data compiled by the nonprofit Woodstock Institute in a report titled ""Patterns of Disparity."" It shows that between 2012 and 2016, only about one in five businesses in low-income areas across the United States received bank loans or even business credit cards. That's compared with almost three in five businesses in higher-income areas.
""You have a cycle that kind of perpetuates that neighborhood being less friendly to business,"" says Spencer Cowan, the researcher who compiled the data. ""Businesses don't get started. So employment stays depressed. The job opportunities aren't there in the neighborhood. Businesses that are there don't expand.""
He says it can also drive businesses to predatory lending. I had two years of experience with profit, but I got rejected for every loan I tried for. - Natalie Gill, small-business owner
That's what happened to Natalie Gill. After running her flower-arranging business out of her home, she wanted to expand to a flower shop and cafe called Native Poppy .
""I had two years of experience with profit, but I got rejected for every loan I tried for,"" she says.
A normal small-business loan has 5 to 10 percent interest, but she took a loan from an online company. ""It was at 18 percent interest, and I had to pay it within three years, which was a risk I was willing to take because I had no other options,"" she says.
Bank investment vs. community investment
Banks are restricted in whom they can choose for loans, says Carty Davis, an investment banker with C Squared Advisors.
""A bank can't just say, 'I really like this person. I'm going to take a flier on them because I know they're going to be successful,' "" he says. ""They have a good business plan, but if they don't have equity to put into the deal or cash to put into the deal, it's going to be very difficult to get a loan approved.""
Davis says banks have certain criteria that must be met, such as a good credit history. He suggests that if potential borrowers don't have that, they can go to the federal Small Business Administration.
But here's the issue for lower-income communities: Those loans still require big cash down payments or home equity, which business owners may not have.
There are alternative ways of getting financing, such as from a company like Mission Driven Finance. In addition to investing in small community businesses, Mission Driven Finance also helps people looking for small-business loans better understand the technicalities of borrowing money to open or expand businesses.
The point, founder Lauren Grattan says, is to invest in neighborhoods that really need it. Because when businesses succeed, they hire locally and the entire community reaps the benefits. Copyright 2019 KPBS Radio. To see more, visit KPBS Radio . ¬© 2019 BPR"
"Former Sen. 'Fritz' Hollings, 97, Has Died",wcqs.org,Jenny Gathright,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/former-sen-fritz-hollings-97-has-died,"By Jenny Gathright ‚Ä¢ 10 hours ago Former Sen. Ernest ""Fritz"" Hollings, pictured here in 2003, died early Saturday, according to a former staffer. Mary Ann Chastain / AP Originally published on April 6, 2019 11:57 am
Former Sen. Ernest Hollings has died at the age of 97. Known as ""Fritz,"" the South Carolina Democrat served more than 38 years in the Senate and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984.
Steve Hartell, who was Hollings' Legislative Director from 1998 to 2003, told NPR he heard the news early Saturday morning.
""He was kind of ahead of his time,"" Hartell said. ""He was always focused on the essential needs of the country: competitiveness of the economy, the balance sheet of the country from a budget perspective. And as someone who was a World War II veteran who served his country as a 20-year-old in North Africa and Europe, above everything a patriot.""
Hollings was born on Jan. 1, 1922 in Charleston, SC. He graduated from The Citadel Military College in South Carolina and served as a combat soldier in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945. After returning home and earning a law degree, Hollings was elected to the South Carolina legislature in 1948.
Hollings went on to serve as governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1962, during a time when school desegregation was a major issue for the state. Hollings, according to The Washington Post , originally ran on a platform opposing desegregation but ended his term by urging the state legislature to accept integration of public schools.
According to the Charleston Post and Courier , Hollings defended South Carolina's pro-segregation position as a lawyer in a case that would later become the state's entry into Brown vs. Board of Education .
Later, in 2015, he asked for his name to be removed from Charleston's federal courthouse, to be replaced by J. Waties Waring , a judge who declared forced segregation to be unconstitutional when few others in the Deep South were willing to do so.
After he finished his gubernatorial term, Hollings returned to politics in 1966 when he ran for Senator in a special election. He won that election, and went on to serve in the Senate for just over 38 years, which makes him the eighth longest-serving senator ever. But he was actually an extremely senior ""junior senator"" for much of that time, because he served alongside South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, a segregationist whose Senate career lasted 48 years.
Hollings is known for his work on hunger: He wrote a book on the topic, toured the country to speak about the issue and also co-authored the legislation that created the Women, Infants and Children program in 1972. WIC was piloted in that year as a supplemental food program aimed at improving the health of pregnant mothers, infants and children and was later expanded.
""He was the father of South Carolina's technical school system, which is the envy of the nation,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said in a statement Saturday. ""He led our state through the travails of the Civil Rights Movement with dignity and went on to become one of the most effective Senators to ever serve.""
Kirk Victor, who collaborated with Hollings on his memoir, told NPR's Weekend Edition the Senator's ""sharp, ascerbic tongue sometimes got more coverage than his accomplishments."" Hollings spoke his mind about people ‚Äî often to their faces.
On live TV, during a debate for the 1986 Senate campaign, Republican candidate Henry McMaster asked Hollings if he would be willing to take a drug test. Hollings famously fired back in his memorable southern drawl, ""I'll take a drug test if you take an IQ test.""
And it seems like Hollings preferred for others to be direct, too. He told The Herald of Rock Hill, S.C. that his 1998 Republican challenger Bob Inglis was ""so oozing and goozing and such a nice little choirboy and so pleasant, and everybody's rude, and he wants to be courteous.""
Then Hollings added, ""He is a goddamn skunk. I can tell you that right now.""
Sometimes his attacks were offensive. The Associated Press reported that he once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, the ""senator from the B'Nai B'rith."" Hollings also reportedly used the racist term ""wetbacks"" to refer to campaign supporters of Alan Cranston, a former Democratic Senator from California.
Hollings did not retire from the Senate quietly. In his 2004 farewell address, he scolded his colleagues for deficit spending.
""Rather than seeking the truth, we've been obscuring it,"" Hollings said. ""We're spending $6oo billion more than we're taking in.""
In that same speech, Hollings decried the influence of money in politics.
""The cancer on the body of politics,"" he said, ""is money. Money, money, money.""
""I'm sick of raising money to get re-elected,"" he told 60 Minutes before he retired . ""So I'm going home to Charleston."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ¬© 2019 BPR"
'We Don't Have Enough Women In Power': Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw Goes Viral,wcqs.org,James Doubek,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/we-dont-have-enough-women-power-notre-dame-coach-muffet-mcgraw-goes-viral,"By James Doubek ‚Ä¢ 11 hours ago Originally published on April 6, 2019 2:59 pm
Muffet McGraw, the two-time championship-winning head coach of women's basketball at University of Notre Dame, was dancing a jig and celebrating Friday night after leading her team to victory over the University of Connecticut.
The NCAA women's basketball championship game is now set for Sunday ‚Äî setting up a possible third win for McGraw ‚Äî with the reigning national champion Notre Dame's Fighting Irish taking on No. 1 seed the Lady Bears of Baylor University.
But this past Thursday, McGraw's mood was more serious when answering a question about her recently reported commitment to never hire another male coach for her staff.
She began talking about the decades that the Equal Rights Amendments has gone without ratification: ""We need 38 states to agree that discrimination on the basis of sex is unconstitutional. We've had a record number of women running for office and winning. And still, we have 23 percent of the House and 25 percent of the Senate."" Muffet McGraw: A voice for women. ‚Äî NCAA WBB (@ncaawbb) April 4, 2019
McGraw was responding to a question about being the ""voice"" of female coaches in college athletics after University of Tennessee coach Pat Summitt, who won 1,098 games with the Lady Volunteers for more than 38 years, died in 2016.
McGraw's two-minute response, touching on the long history of sexism in many American institutions, went viral.
""I'm getting tired of the novelty of ... the first female governor of this state. The first female African-American mayor of this city,"" she said. ""When is it going to become the norm instead of the exception? How are these young women looking up and seeing someone that looks like them, preparing them for the future? We don't have enough female role models. We don't have enough visible women leaders. We don't have enough women in power.""
She said girls are socialized to think ""men run the world."" Where better to counter that narrative than in sports, she asked.
""When you look at men's basketball and 99 percent of the jobs go to men, why shouldn't 100 or 99 percent of the jobs in women's basketball go to women? Maybe it's because we only have 10 percent women athletic directors in Division I. People hire people who look like them. And that's the problem.""
In 1972, Title IX enacted gender equity policies in student athletics as part of a law. Two years later, more than 90 percent of women's teams in college sports had female coaches, according to the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota.
That number has fallen drastically. The center's newest report based on data from last year found the percentage of female head coaches had increased slightly from previous years, but only to 41.8 percent. The group took data from 86 institutions that were part of the NCAA Division I ""big time"" conferences.
In basketball specifically, the percent of women coaching women was 59.3 in 2018.
Notre Dame player Jessica Shepard responded to McGraw, ""Talk that talk then coach."" Notre Dame forward Brianna Turner , who scored her 2,000th career point Friday, just wrote on Twitter: ""Take notes.""
Samantha Brunelle, a high-profile incoming recruit to Notre Dame, tweeted the video of McGraw's answer, saying it was ""one of the many reasons why Notre Dame was the place for me.""
""I aspire to be like her one day,"" Brunelle told the South Bend Tribune of South Bend, Ind. ""She stands for women so much. She has a huge voice to help give us women more of a platform."" Clarification: 4/06/19
In an earlier version of this story, we quote Muffet McGraw as saying the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced in 1967. A version of the amendment was first introduced in 1923, and it was reintroduced in subsequent years. The draft of the amendment approved by Congress in 1972 remains just shy of full ratification by the states. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ¬© 2019 BPR"

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
""Fosse/Verdon"" premieres next week on FX, a miniseries based on what is all at once an enduring love, a toxic relationship and a persisting partnership in work, love and life between Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOSSE/VERDON"")
MICHELLE WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) You know, I didn't realize that you'd started as a dancer.
SAM ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Sure, sure.
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) That must have been difficult.
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) What's that?
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Giving up dancing.
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) I still dance a little, you know?
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Well, you're not going to cast yourself in this show, are you?
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) If they'd let me, I'd play your part.
SIMON: Sam Rockwell is Bob Fosse, the genius director and choreographer. Michelle Williams is Gwen Verdon, the legendary dancer and actor who gave life to works that include ""Damn Yankees,"" ""Sweet Charity"" and ""Chicago.""
Thomas Kail is one of the executive producers and one of the directors of ""Fosse/Verdon."" He's also directed many Broadway productions, including ""In The Heights,"" ""Lombardi"" and a little show called ""Hamilton"" with Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also is a co-producer of ""Fosse/Verdon."" Thomas Kail joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us.
THOMAS KAIL: I'm delighted to be here.
SIMON: Taken from Sam Wasson's biography ""Fosse,"" but why is this miniseries pointedly ""Fosse/Verdon""?
KAIL: Because this felt like an opportunity to have a conversation about how things are actually made. And this was a partnership, and Gwen's contribution has been overlooked. And when we started talking about this 2 1/2 years ago, one of the questions we kept on asking was, why do we know his name but we don't know hers? And we wanted to explore and examine the relationship and ask that question.
SIMON: It opens with the story of ""Cabaret,"" the film that made so much of the Bob Fosse legend and was that rare thing in the business, a risk in all ways - a musical set inside the rise of Nazism and an unfulfilled love story. And there were doubts about him as a director. How did all of the elements combine, and the two of them, to make this a success?
KAIL: Well, ""Cabaret"" was, you know, a relatively groundbreaking show, to say the least, in 1967 when Harold Prince directed it.
And around that time, Bob, who had already established himself as a very in-demand choreographer, decided that he wanted to go out West and make a movie. So he made a movie of ""Sweet Charity."" But he didn't cast the woman who originated the role of ""Sweet Charity,"" his wife Gwen Verdon. It was Shirley MacLaine who actually could get the movie made, so Gwen taught Shirley the part. They went out, and they made this thing together. And the movie, which many people were incredibly excited about, was a total bomb. And it was a disaster. So Bob was back to zero.
And this ""Cabaret"" movie was one that felt like it would allow him to access some of the parts of himself that were not accessed in ""Sweet Charity."" He got in there. He started making this movie, and he realized that he needed his, you know, his partner. And so Gwen came over and spent a lot of time on set with him, as well as in the edit room.
SIMON: And she's not even in the credits, is she?
KAIL: No, she's not.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOSSE/VERDON"")
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) It'd be great to get you here for a few days, maybe get your eyes on some of the numbers.
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Am I going to be unhappy when I get there?
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) No, of course not. Why would you be unhappy? I need you.
SIMON: You know, Bob Fosse was one of my artistic heroes until I saw this miniseries (laughter).
KAIL: You're welcome.
SIMON: But I think it's important to understand not just how much Gwen Verdon was a part of his success and what is still hailed as his genius, but - forgive me - what an utter ass he was.
KAIL: Well, you know, this kind of behavior that was accepted and has now been brought to light over these last few years felt like a conversation we wanted to be a part of, and this felt like an opportunity to take this kind of behavior out of the darkness and keep it in the light.
And having Nicole Fosse, the one child of Bob and Gwen, was an enormous resource and asset. She's a producer on the show. She was involved in the smallest things and the largest things, from what somebody might be wearing to how we were going to reconstruct these dances with real specificity and authenticity. And it felt like she was providing us so much insight into Gwen's life. And I think it gave us a lot of confidence to examine the darkest places because she felt it was necessary and essential, just like we did.
SIMON: Did Gwen Verdon just tolerate too much from Bob Fosse?
KAIL: What I know is the two of them found something in each other they couldn't find anywhere else. You know, Gwen was someone who is a survivor, and she was a fighter, and she was just as ambitious and as profoundly talented as Bob was.
This was someone - when she did a show called ""New Girl In Town"" in the late '50s, she took to bed one time - this is in the Wasson book - because Bob was being mistreated. And so she, in protest, stepped out of the show. And they had to bring in four people to play her part - four people - two people to dance it, one to act it and one to sing it.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ON THE FARM"")
GWEN VERDON: (Singing) You put me on the farm far away from harm. All kids need to grow up nice as milk.
SIMON: I mean, look; I love every minute of it, but you take us through breakdowns, heartbreak, deceptions, drunkenness, pill-gobbling. I thought at one point, wait; show business is supposed to be fun (laughter).
KAIL: I don't know who told you that. As we say, it ain't called show fun.
But, you know, show business both elevated and got Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon out of their respective childhoods and took them to places they probably couldn't have dreamed of. But it also is an addiction. And you can become addicted to the applause. You can become addicted to that feeling of the great unknown of the audience. And the question is, what do you do when that goes away?
One of the other questions we thought about a lot was, what does the dancer do when the dancer stops dancing? The dancer dies twice. The dancer dies when they stop dancing, and then they die when it's all over. And Bob was someone who wanted desperately to be Fred Astaire. But at age 25, with his hair balding and his shoulders slouched and his look not what the studio wanted, he was fired. So to have the thing that you want to do taken away from you, how do you reconcile that?
SIMON: Generation from now, will how the talents who got there and what they went through and made other people go through count as much as the work of art?
KAIL: What I know is great work does not justify foul behavior. And there's a way that people that make things must be viewed when we have a greater context for how they made them or for what they did. But I feel like that's an incredibly subjective thing. And I just know that the who matters more than the what. And that's something that I learned years ago and I keep very present when I'm trying to make something. What we did is important. How we did it and who I did it with matters the most.
SIMON: Thomas Kail - he's one of the executive producers of ""Fosse/Verdon,"" set to premiere on FX. Thanks so much for being with us.
KAIL: It's my pleasure. Thank you for having me.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""IF MY FRIENDS COULD SEE ME NOW"")
VERDON: (Singing) If they could see me now, that little gang of mine. I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine. I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact the kind of top-drawer, first-rate chums I attract. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. ¬© 2019 BPR"
Opinion: Can Stonehenge Offer A Lesson For Brexit?,wcqs.org,Scott Simon,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/opinion-can-stonehenge-offer-lesson-brexit,"By Scott Simon ‚Ä¢ 12 hours ago Related Program: Recent isotopic analysis of pig remains from several ceremonial sites in the Stonehenge area show that the swine and celebrants sometimes came from as far as what is now Scotland and Wales.

It has not been uplifting for Americans to look across the ocean the past few years and see Great Britain's Brexit imbroglio.
Almost three years ago, a slim majority, 51.9 percent, voted in a referendum to leave the European Union. But breaking up is hard to do.
Three times, Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed an exit plan. Parliament has rejected it each time. The March 29 deadline to depart has come and gone; Parliament has asked the EU for delay after delay.
More than 6 million people have signed a petition calling on Parliament to revoke Britain's exit. Millions have marched to hold a second referendum, hoping the result might be different the second time around. From across the ocean, it doesn't look as if a lot of Britons are eager to Brexit at all.
This week, a leak in the roof of the House of Commons forced MPs to suspend debate. Between drips, Labour Party Member of Parliament Justin Madders told a nearly vacant chamber: ""I think there is probably some kind of symbol about how many people view how broken Parliament is going on there.""
Perhaps there is a lesson in a report this week in the journal Science Advances , about new findings from ceremonial sites around Stonehenge. Something in the standing stone slabs in that ancient ceremonial site seems to signify stony British steadfastness.
The Neolithic builders of Stonehenge held large feasts where the celebrants roasted huge pigs and ‚Äî every now and then ‚Äî a cow. Whatever may be written on the slabs of Stonehenge, it probably wasn't ""Vegan Options Available.""
Scientists had always assumed the doomed swine were local. Farm-to-table cuisine ‚Äî or in those days, ""herd-to-hut""? ‚Äî was kind of necessary in the Neolithic period.
But recent isotopic analysis of pig remains from several ceremonial sites in the area show that the swine and celebrants sometimes came from as far as what's now Scotland and Wales. In the Neolithic era, that must have seemed like the ends of the Earth.
Richard Madgwick of Cardiff University, lead author of the study, says, ""These gatherings could be seen as the first united cultural events of our island, with people from all corners of Britain descending on the areas around Stonehenge to feast on food that had been specially reared and transported from their homes.""
What this might mean in our times is that even when the slabs of Stonehenge were being raised, people understood they were stronger together than apart.
And when they found a way to come together, it was something to celebrate. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.

Crowds Linger On The Slopes With Cheaper Ski Pass ‚Äî But Locals Aren't Happy,wcqs.org,editor,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/crowds-linger-slopes-cheaper-ski-pass-locals-arent-happy,"Crowds Linger On The Slopes With Cheaper Ski Pass ‚Äî But Locals Aren't Happy By editor ‚Ä¢ 12 hours ago Related Program: A crowded opening day at Arapahoe Basin Ski Area in Keystone, Colo.

On a recent 50-degree bluebird day at Big Bear Mountain outside Los Angeles, skiers in short sleeves partied with loud music and beer and bragged about how many days they have spent at the mountain this season.
""It's been at least 10,"" said Daniella Gogatz.
""This is day 31,"" said Ken Ryan. ""It's cost me about $20 or less a day at this point.""
While the prices of ski lift passes have been skyrocketing, the industry has been embracing new multiresort season passes that are cheaper than ever. They've proven popular though also controversial.
Gogatz and Ryan are able to afford to ski so much because they bought Ikon passes, which were just introduced this season by the the Alterra Mountain Company.
Ikon is priced starting at around $600 and includes access to dozens of resorts and some of the most famous ski mountains in the world, including Aspen, Jackson Hole and Deer Valley.
Ikon, and its main competitor, The Epic Pass, which was introduced a decade ago, have made it possible to ski for an entire season for what you could spend on a three-day lift ticket, as long as you commit early.
But some locals complain the passes are destroying the character of their beloved mountains. Mammoth Mountain is one of the 38 destinations accepting the Ikon pass, which has led to some locals complaining about the crowds. Ben Bergman / NPR
""We're seeing more people on the hill and longer lift lines and whenever you're waiting in one of those lines you'll hear some local quip about the Ikon passholders,"" said Matt Maydick, who lives in Carbondale, Colo., right outside Aspen.
Maydick, himself an Ikon passholder, says he is happy more people are getting to enjoy his favorite sport but he is frustrated by the growing pains.
Ikon passholders have been accused of not only making the mountain too crowded but also of being in over their heads.
There has been more hostility in Jackson Hole. When Joe Cascia of New Jersey visited recently, he encountered a local who griped about Ikon passholders for being cheap and not spending enough at local restaurants.
""I'm not sure why he would seen that as a negative, because I think everybody should be trying to save money,"" said Cascia, who said he pointed out that he had just spent almost $200 on dinner.
Cascia's girlfriend usually proudly displays her Ikon pass on her helmet but at Jackson Hole he thought it would be better for her to hide it.
""I even told her you might want to put that in your pocket here because it just didn't feel 100 percent welcome,"" Cascia said.
Resorts have tried to ease tensions by pointing out that Ikon passholders are not the only reason for overcrowding and that resorts gain valuable revenue from the pass.
Taylor Middleton, the general manager of Big Sky Resort in Montana, even penned an open editorial to local residents ordering them to be nicer.
""Recently, local social media channels are revealing a rash of really negative postings, shunning new visitors and treating new arrivals differently than we were treated ourselves,"" wrote Middleton. ""We were all new at some point; these guests are our newest visitors.""
In fact, Ikon passholders only account for a small increase in the number of visitors at most resorts this season. The biggest reason for the crowds is this season's heavy snow, according to resort owners.
""I think the Ikon pass is somewhat unfairly blamed by some,"" said Middleton.
Like it or not, the pass is here to stay, according to Erik Forsell, Alterra chief marketing officer.
""We definitely launched with the idea of disrupting in a positive way the ski industry and we did,"" said Forsell.
Forsell says resorts like locking in guaranteed revenue in case of a bad snow year.
Next season's pass went on sale last month, starting at $649.

Skiing's long been an expensive sport. It's not uncommon for a lift ticket to set you back upwards of $200 a day.

They've proven to be popular but also controversial, as Ben Bergman reports.

Here's What To Know About Israel's Upcoming Elections,wcqs.org,Larry Kaplow,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/heres-what-know-about-israels-upcoming-elections,"By Larry Kaplow ‚Ä¢ 13 hours ago Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, is escorted by security guards during a visit to the Hatikva market in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Oded Balilty / AP
Israel will hold parliamentary elections Tuesday that are largely a referendum on the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The country has seen a decade under Netanyahu. It's been a time of dramatic economic growth, sporadic conflict with neighbors and the formation of what is probably the most solidly right-wing coalition in Israel's history.
Netanyahu, who has an edge in most polls, has allied closely with President Trump and attracted increased criticism from left-wing Americans and even pro-Israel organizations.
His government has passed laws banning entry to foreigners who support boycott s and targeting activist groups ‚Äî largely those supporting Palestinians ‚Äî that receive international funding .
He was prime minister for three years in the 1990s, was elected again in 2009 and won re-election twice. With another victory now, he could ‚Äî this summer ‚Äî pass David Ben-Gurion as the longest-serving Israeli premier.
Netanyahu's main challenger is retired Gen. Benny Gantz. New to politics, he has positioned himself as a centrist alternative to Netanyahu. He heads a new party cobbled together with former senior officers ranging from the center to the right. If he wins enough seats to form a government, it's conceivable that he could form a ruling coalition with the center-left Labor Party as well as with right-wing parties.
How it works
The country's 6.3 million registered voters are choosing the 120 lawmakers in the parliament, or Knesset. There are about a dozen main candidate lists to choose from, made of single parties or groups of parties. There are some 30 other lists, too. So the new government will be chosen as parties form coalitions and make deals with each other. Former Israeli army chief of staff Benny Gantz dances with ultra-Orthodox Jewish men at the Western Wall, in Jerusalem's Old City, on March 28. Gantz is running in opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sebastian Scheiner / AP
Israel's president sets that process in motion by choosing a candidate with the best chance of gathering the 61 seats for a majority ‚Äî generally the leader from the party with the most votes.
A wide array of parties
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party currently holds the biggest bloc in parliament, with 30 seats . Second is the center-left Labor Party ‚Äî now in the opposition ‚Äî with 18. That leaves a lot of other seats held by smaller parties.
Netanyahu's main challenger, Gantz, leads the Blue and White alliance, including a collection of military figures and an existing centrist party that now has 11 seats in the parliament.
Netanyahu's current coalition comprises his Likud and mostly Jewish religious parties that take a hard line on relations with the Palestinians.
One party making an unexpected splash with young voters is called Zehut (Identity), whose leader favors legalizing marijuana and ‚Äî in what would be an extreme-right position ‚Äî annexation of the occupied West Bank, land populated mostly by Palestinians that Israel captured in 1967.
There's one main left-wing party, Meretz (Vigor), which has lost ground over the years and now holds five seats in the parliament.
There are two lists from Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, which hold 13 parliamentary seats. They seek to provide representation for their 20 percent of the country's population but rarely join any government coalition ‚Äî meaning they don't usually factor in deciding who becomes prime minister.
Focus on Netanyahu
Israeli politics traditionally revolves around security, economics and the role of religion in government. But this campaign has hinged largely on Netanyahu himself.
There's some Netanyahu fatigue after 10 years of his combative style and an accumulation of scandals around him. In February, the country's attorney general said he was preparing indictments against Netanyahu over cases concerning gifts he's accepted and favors he's allegedly done for media moguls to win positive coverage.
Netanyahu's pitch in the campaign is that Israel has never been in better shape. ""We have brought an unprecedented diplomatic flowering,"" a Likud party ad states.
The economy has grown steeply over the last decade, with unemployment down and incomes way up. The government has increased trade around the region and the world. And though there has been conflict with neighbors ‚Äî a 2014 war with Hamas in Gaza that the United Nations said left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead , rocket attacks from Gaza and Lebanon ‚Äî the toll for Israelis has been relatively low and the impact on daily life has been minimal.
But Netanyahu's critics worry about the health of the country's democracy. They note passage of a law declaring Israel as the ""nation state of the Jewish people,"" which could undermine the standing of the country's 1.6 million Palestinian Arab citizens. Netanyahu says everyone has equal rights but recently also said, ""Israel is the nation state not of all of its citizens, but only of the Jewish people.""
He has highlighted his close relationship with Trump, which has led to Washington backing Israeli claims to sovereignty in the Golan Heights and Jerusalem (where the U.S. opened its embassy last year). He has also met with other nationalist leaders in the run-up to the vote, from Brazil's Jair Bolsanaro to Russia's Vladimir Putin.
The alternative
Benny Gantz served as chief of staff of the Israeli military ‚Äî the country's highest-ranking officer ‚Äî and retired in 2015. He has little political record but has cast himself as the clean alternative to Netanyahu's embattled administration. ""There's no more left and right. Israel before all,"" says his campaign.
His campaign promises new laws barring people who have been convicted of crimes from holding office and he favors term limits for prime ministers. Gantz's critics have accused him of using his connections to get government contracts for a private company he headed after leaving the military. Netanyahu's campaign questions his mental fitness .
Meanwhile, Gantz casts himself as someone ready to use overwhelming force against Israel's enemies. An early campaign ad touted his leadership of Israel's war against Hamas in 2014 and showed video of airstrikes.
Gantz has also promised to make peace but speaks without much specificity about a ""separation"" from the Palestinians. He says he'll also reduce religious influence over Israeli law. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ¬© 2019 BPR"
"As 2020 Candidates Pitch Scrapping The Electoral College, Voters Are Intrigued",wcqs.org,Britta Greene,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/2020-candidates-pitch-scrapping-electoral-college-voters-are-intrigued,"By Britta Greene ‚Ä¢ 14 hours ago Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., left, speaks at a campaign house party, last month in Salem, NH. Warren has proposed abolishing the Electoral College. Elise Amendola / AP
At a time of deep disenchantment with the political system, dramatic proposals to upend how politics are conducted are starting to resonate with voters.
So far, Democrats running for president have endorsed proposals to abolish the Electoral College , expand the number of Supreme Court justices along with overhauling the role of money in politics. Some voters want them to go even further.
At a recent event at a high school in Littleton, New Hampshire with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., one attendee praised Warren for backing proposals to scrap the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote ‚Äî then asked if she would support passing laws based on citizen petitions and national referendums.
Warren laughed. ""You come to New Hampshire and you hear about democracy,"" she said. ""I love this.""
While the idea of a national system for citizen petitions isn't mainstream, Democratic voters aren't rejecting ideas that would have been unthinkable a decade or two ago.
That shift in sentiment comes at a time when just a third of Americans think the country is headed in the right direction, according to a recent Gallup poll .
But even as the Democratic presidential candidates keep throwing out different ideas ‚Äî term limits for Supreme Court justices, restrictions on redistricting to prevent gerrymandering ‚Äî voters are trying digest the proposals.
Two attendees in the crowd for Warren's event, Jimmy Darden and Brian Romeo, were conflicted about abolishing the Electoral College. Both live just over the state line in neighboring Vermont.
Surveys suggest Democratic voters strongly support a national popular vote but Darden worried it would penalize voters in states with small populations like Vermont and New Hampshire.
""I think, even still, that just shows that everyone's vote is not equal,"" Romeo argued. ""I feel like it should be, regardless of where you live.""
For those voters concerned about making big changes to the political order, South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who recently argued that additional justices should be added to the Supreme Court, argues experimentation can be healthy.
""In a country that changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink, and then realized that that was a bad idea and changed it back, we have the mechanisms to do this responsibly but boldly,"" Buttigieg told New Hampshire voters.
One open question is whether this talk of overhauling the political system will draw voters to a candidate in both the primary and general elections?
""I think these ideas are further down the list than what seems to me to be more important issues,"" argued Maynard Goldman of Grantham, NH. ""You know, jobs and the economy, immigration.""
His neighbor Dave Wood agreed, but said political gridlock had prevented recent Congresses and presidents from addressing those issues.
""If we can't deal with healthcare and climate change and the big issues because we're so partisan,"" he said, ""then fixing the partisan divide is the primary objective so that we can deal with the things that really matter.""

Dangerous Art: A Stark But Inspiring New Exhibit,wcqs.org,Diane Cole,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/dangerous-art-stark-inspiring-new-exhibit,"Dangerous Art: A Stark But Inspiring New Exhibit By Diane Cole ‚Ä¢ 14 hours ago Those aren't birds ‚Äî they're mini-missiles made of foam, from ""Hellfire II,"" a piece by Pakistani-American artist Mahwish Chishty. It's part of the ""Perilous Bodies"" exhibit at the Ford Foundation Gallery in Manhattan. Yana Paskova for NPR
A rickety-looking wooden boat is piled high with overstuffed bags covered in colorfully patterned African fabrics. Hanging overboard: a collection of toy plastic teapots and gasoline cans. Instead of floating on water, this ark is adrift on an ocean of green glass bottles.
The boat is actually a piece of art called ""Road to Exile,"" by the Cameroonian artist Barth√©l√©my Toguo, part of a series of works examining migration and colonialism. Poised at the entrance to ""Perilous Bodies,"" the initial exhibit at the Ford Foundation Gallery in Manhattan, it is the first stop on a journey through the perils of living in the 21st century. The boat is a piece of art called ""Road to Exile"" and was created by Cameroonian artist Barth√©l√©my Toguo. It sits on a sea of green glass bottles. Yana Paskova for NPR
Go through the gallery doors, and swarming overhead is what at first appears to be a flock of blackbirds. Look again: These are miniature foam, laser-cut replicas of air-to-surface Hellfire missiles. Pakistani-American artist Mahwish Chishty conceived the piece, ""Hellfire II,"" as the trajectory of a drone strike, she says.
These are but two of the 19 artists whose paintings, photographs, videos and mixed-media installations fill the gallery's two rooms. Their works, from small to large-scale, all illustrate the perils of living in a world of inequality, conflict and injustice. The curators are Jaishri Abichandani and Natasha Becker.
""The works here are visceral,"" says Abichandani. ""You don't necessarily have to read the labels.""
But you do have to take a closer look to fully comprehend the artist's intention. An oversized tapestry at first glance resembles a planet-filled space-blue backdrop for a planetarium show. But what ""The Weight of Scars"" by the Nigerian-Belgian artist Otobong Nkanga actually maps is a Namibian landscape marred by the mining of minerals. Artist Tiffany Chung constructed 31 wooden lightboxes displaying ""found images"" of war-torn homes in Syria ‚Äî a work she titles ""finding one's shadow in ruins and rubble."" Yana Paskova for NPR
Bold white rope-like lines connect black-and-white photographic discs depicting images of abandoned mine shafts and cracked, fragmented land. Holding up the ropes on either side are mechanical, headless human figures.
""This is a reference to the physical bodies involved in the extraction of minerals,"" says Becker. The tapestry as a whole, she says, evokes the scars left on the human body, the land and the abandoned communities.
A separate work nearby consists of three larger copper plates, in each of which a photo of an anonymous Dalit woman from 19th-century India is superimposed against a backdrop of legal texts from the era. The purpose of the juxtaposition is to show the women's double exclusion from the legal system as both women and as members of society's lowest caste, the so-called untouchables. A piece showing portraits of three unnamed Dalit women is called ""We are still here."" Their images are juxtaposed against legal texts from the 19th century governing their lives as women and as the lowest caste in Indian society. Yana Paskova for NPR
The series is called ""We are still here,"" explains artist Thenmozhi Soundararajan. ""I did these as a testament to the courage of Dalit women, to return their dignity and put these women into an ancestral place of honor.""
Some of the art reflects ongoing protests against injustices. A photograph of a woman sleeping in a public park is part of ""Meet to Sleep/I Never Ask for It"" an ongoing safety campaign started by Jasmeen Patheja, a human rights activist and artist from India. Women volunteer to sleep outside, at different times of day and night, usually in groups, then log the time and place to emphasize their right to be safe in open spaces.
A potted ""cactus,"" sculpted out of border patrol uniform fabric, is embroidered with figures and landscapes that tell the stories of immigrants crossing the border from Central America and Mexico to the United States. It is one of many such cactus sculptures created by ""Space in Between,"" workshops across the country organized by Mexican artist Margarita Cabrera. She began the project in Houston nine years ago and now has about 700 collaborators, who participate in workshops in which they embroider scenes from their personal stories of crossing the border onto the fabric leaves. The fabric cactus is one of many created by artist Margarita Cabrera, who collaborates with women to embroider their immigration stories on the leaves. Yana Paskova for NPR
The idea is to use traditional Mexican embroidery crafts to allow people to tell their stories. Thus, on one cactus leaf here you see the embroidered outlines of mountains, sun, and clouds ‚Äî and a trailer-truck filled with people. Another leaf unfolds to reveal a brightly colored human hand, symbolizing the hold of family. A detail from artist Mohamad Hafez's ""Damascene Athan Series 2017"" showing bombed-out Syrian cities. Yana Paskova for NPR
The need to connect to one's past is also present in the work of Syrian-born architect Mohammed Hafez. In ""Damascene Athan Series 2017"" he creates miniature streetscapes and interiors of bombed-out cities. ""These works reflect my nostalgia for Syria but these scenes can apply to many cities in the Middle East, inn Europe and in North Africa,"" he says. Adding another layer of meaning, each work is backed by an elaborate mirror frame. ""The concept is that instead of seeing our reflections in the mirror, we are seeing our emotional baggage. We cannot escape our past,"" or history, he says. ""It pops out at us every single day when we look at our own mirrors."" The artist known as Dread Scott is called ""The Blue Wall of Violence. He shows six shooting targets showing what six unarmed black men were holding when shot by the police: keys, a squeegee, a candy bar, a toy gun, a wallet and nothing. Yana Paskova for NPR
Artists should ""document their societies,"" he says. ""They are ringers of bells of danger and warning"" ‚Äî a vision brought to life in ""Perilous Bodies.""

Pastoring A Purple Church: 'I Absolutely Bite My Tongue Sometimes',wcqs.org,Tom Gjelten,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/pastoring-purple-church-i-absolutely-bite-my-tongue-sometimes,"By Tom Gjelten ‚Ä¢ 16 hours ago White Memorial Presbyterian Church in Raleigh, N.C., is thriving, with about 4,000 members, at a time when other mainline Protestant congregations are struggling. Just as impressively, it brings together worshippers with disparate political views. Tom Gjelten / NPR
At a time when Americans are moving apart in their political and religious views, worshippers at White Memorial Presbyterian Church in Raleigh, N.C., have learned to avoid some subjects for the sake of maintaining congregational harmony.
""You wouldn't run up to a stove and touch a hot burner,"" says DeLana Anderson, a church deacon. ""So, I'm certainly not going to do that here.""
White Memorial is thriving, with about 4,000 members, while other mainline Protestant congregations are struggling. Just as impressively, it brings together worshippers with disparate political views, both red and blue.
""Raleigh is a purple city. North Carolina is a purple state,"" notes Christopher Edmonston, the church's senior pastor. ""Many of the people who have come to church here in the last 25 years are from other parts of the country, and they bring their ideas, their politics, their viewpoints, with them. So we almost have to be purple if we're going to continue to be open and welcome to any person that wants to come."" ""We're trying to build a community that puts into practice what it really means to love your neighbors,"" says Christopher Edmonston, White Memorial Presbyterian Church's senior pastor. Tom Gjelten / NPR
With that as its mission, White Memorial is fighting an uphill battle. A recent report by the Barna Group, a faith-based research organization, highlighted a growing tendency for people to seek ""communities that look and believe as they do"" and noted that the trend was especially evident among the most frequent churchgoers.
""One of the features we see in our research is that congregations aren't as politically diverse as they used to be,"" says Barna Group President David Kinnaman. ""That's not to say that they were ever bastions of political diversity, but at least there was a sense in which you could worship together with people who were very different from you politically.""
At White Memorial Presbyterian, Edmonston preaches often on the importance of civility, even when it means treading carefully around those subjects on which his congregants are likely to disagree. Congregations aren't as politically diverse as they used to be. - David Kinnaman, president, Barna Group
""I absolutely bite my tongue sometimes,"" he says. ""There are things that I resist.""
Clergy often speak about the need to minister both in a ""pastoral"" manner, addressing the personal needs of their congregants, and in a ""prophetic"" manner, addressing their congregants' responsibilities in social, cultural and political settings.
In Edmonston's case, the hot-button issues have included North Carolina's ""bathroom bill,"" which limited gender-segregated restrooms to users with the corresponding biological sex, and state-imposed restrictions on voting rights.
""That's a place where I've tended to be more pastoral than prophetic,"" Edmonston says. ""And that's a choice I've got to live with, whether it's wise or not.""
Some of his more progressive congregants are ready to support Edmonston if he decides to be more outspoken politically.
""We're on the blue side of purple,"" says Anderson. ""I have a harder time being with people who are Trump supporters."" I can't be part of a community if I'm not talking with and listening to people around me, especially those who feel differently than I do about religion or political issues. - Christopher Edmonston, senior pastor, White Memorial Presbyterian Church
""Sometimes I wish the church was more forceful,"" adds her husband, Scott. ""But Christopher is a dear friend and a wonderful pastor.""
It is a challenge that Edmonston has considered carefully.
""People are coming to our churches with their political ideas already formed,"" he says. ""That puts pastors in a precarious place, because when you speak against that, given the options for people to practice their Christian faith, they will simply go and find a place where the pastor will agree with them."" Under such circumstances, Edmonston says, discord inevitably takes the place of discourse, a trade-off he cites repeatedly in conversations, sermons and commentary.
""I can't be part of a community if I'm not talking with and listening to people around me, especially those who feel differently than I do about religion or political issues,"" he says. ""I'm not really part of the community if I'm only hearing the same voices over and over again.""
The Presbyterian way
The promotion of discourse over discord may strengthen civic culture in an era of political polarization, but for Edmonston, the mission is more a reflection of Presbyterian theology than it is a commitment to democratic process. By tradition, the denomination emphasizes the development of a worshiping community, whereas evangelical churches focus more on an individual's personal relationship with God.
""I think that's important,"" Edmonston says. ""I just don't emphasize it as much, because that's not the thrust I see in Scripture. The thrust in Scripture [to me] is, 'I'm calling you to be builders of the kingdom of God.' We're trying to build a community that puts into practice what it really means to love your neighbors and welcome them into our spaces.""
That welcoming approach includes a major commitment to children's and education programs plus extensive outreach activities, including weekly community suppers and a speakers series, all of which Edmonston says have contributed to his church's membership growth in recent years.
That growth has not come without difficulty, however.
LGBTQ issues the most problematic
In 2015, the Presbyterian Church (USA) informed local congregations that they would have to decide on their own whether to accommodate same-sex weddings. It was a question that White Memorial had previously managed to avoid and is one of the most difficult challenges a congregation can face. Members of White Memorial Presbyterian Church receive ashes on Ash Wednesday. Tom Gjelten / NPR
""I have never known a day in the church, from the day I was ordained in 1999 until that summer, when it wasn't an active conversation and an argument,"" says Edmonston.
Indeed, the Barna Group report found that Christian clergy rated LGBTQ-related issues as by far the most problematic of any they faced, with 44 percent of surveyed pastors saying they felt reluctant to speak about such issues, as opposed to just 18 percent who felt limited in speaking about abortion and 7 percent who had difficulty addressing questions about immigration and poverty.

When Presbyterian churches were informed in 2015 that they should decide on their own whether to accommodate same-sex marriages, no gay or lesbian members at White Memorial had yet asked to be married at the church. But Edmonston and other church leaders felt the congregation needed to address the question without reference to any particular request by a member, so as not to personalize the issue.
Rather than making an executive policy decision, Edmonston and the church's governing board (in Presbyterian terminology, a ""session"") sought to involve the congregation. A series of public meetings were scheduled, with speakers for and against same-sex marriage. Members with strong feelings, pro and con, were invited to send letters to the church leaders expressing their viewpoints. Most were opposed to a more inclusive wedding policy, according to Carol Vassey, a church elder who read all the letters and responded to each one personally.
""I wanted them to know that sometimes in our family, we agree to disagree,"" she says, ""but that I loved them and I cared how they felt. Some of the people came to the meetings trying to convince us that we were not looking at it correctly. Some just wanted to be heard.""
In those meetings, Vassey did not hide her own advocacy for a new church policy to allow same-sex weddings. ""I have a grandson who's gay,"" she says. ""I have a nephew who's gay. I have many friends who are gay. We're all children of God.""
Choosing to stay together
In the end, the church session voted to allow same-sex weddings, although the margin by which the measure passed was not announced and remains a secret to this day. Edmonston says it was for strategic reasons.
""If you would have reported that it was 56 to 2 for marriage inclusion, the people who didn't want it to happen would have gotten the message 'We really are out of step here.' And if we would have reported that the vote was 30 to 26, the people who were really for it may have thought, 'This place isn't as open-minded as I thought it was.' ""
In either case, congregational solidarity could have been damaged ‚Äî the prospect Edmonston feared most. In his sermon on the Sunday following the vote, he pleaded with his congregation to stay united.
""If you were overjoyed by the session's conclusions, I humbly ask that you respect that there are others who are not there and some who might not ever get there,"" he said. ""If you are one of those who are dismayed, I ask you to remember that the strength of our congregation remains secure and that our love for one another and our devotion to this church family is greater than any single issue.""
Among those who were troubled by the decision was Gregg Thompson, a former Republican member of the North Carolina legislature who was raised in what he calls ""a very conservative rural district"" of the state.
""Growing up Southern Baptist, I struggled with it,"" he says of the same-sex wedding issue. ""I had to do a lot of soul-searching and a lot of praying about it. But the way it was handled within our congregation helped put me at ease some.""
Thompson stayed at the church, but more than 40 members who opposed the same-sex wedding decision left for a more like-minded congregation.
""They did exactly what happens with a culture of discord,"" Edmonston says. ""They went to a place where there was someone who agreed with the position they had."" We all come together in the grace of God. - Jim Brown, member of White Memorial Presbyterian Church
The loss of a few dozen members out of a congregation of more than 4,000 was a relatively minor development, however, and the process of working through the marriage decision may actually have left the church stronger.
One longtime White Memorial member who left, Jim Brown, later regretted his decision.
""We had a gentleman in our Sunday school class who really talked all of us into moving to another church,"" Brown recalls. ""And I got there, and I realized I just missed this church too much. So I came back.""
What brought him back was the very quality that the church staff has worked so hard to maintain: its strong sense of community.
""Now everybody is rallied back around, together,"" Brown says. ""I mean, [we're] probably closer as a church than I've ever seen us. We all come together in the grace of God.""
Edmonston acknowledges that his church's experience may not be easy for other congregations to emulate. The White Memorial membership is almost entirely white and upper middle class, so there may be fewer tensions in the church arising from racial and economic injustice.
""Homogeneity certainly helps,"" he says. ""When you ask for civility, you have to be aware that some of the people you're calling to the table come with some pretty significant wounds.""
Against that reality, Edmonston is asked to make the case for civility as powerfully as he can.
""To me, it's always an argument for the long game,"" he promptly answers. ""No matter how right my position may be, if I tear you down while I'm making it, [if I say], 'I'm right, you're wrong, you're stupid,' at the end of that, you and I still have to be neighbors. We still have to live with each other, once the votes are counted."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ¬© 2019 BPR"
Boeing To Slow Production Of 737 Max Jets As It Works On Flight Control Software Fix,wcqs.org,editor,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/boeing-slow-production-737-max-jets-it-works-flight-control-software-fix,"Boeing To Slow Production Of 737 Max Jets As It Works On Flight Control Software Fix By editor ‚Ä¢ 21 hours ago A Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplane sits on the assembly line on March 27, in Renton, Wash. Boeing is slowing production of its grounded Max airliner while it works on fixing flight-control software in the wake of fatal crashes. Ted S. Warren / AP Originally published on April 5, 2019 9:36 pm
Boeing says it is reducing production of its 737 Max planes, and the temporary slowdown will begin in mid-April.
CEO Dennis Muilenburg says the company will build 42 of the planes per month, down from the current 52, while keeping the same number of workers. Boeing still has an enormous backlog of orders ‚Äî about 4,600 ‚Äî for the Max planes. That will take years to fill.
Muilenburg says he now knows that two deadly crashes within five months of each other, involving Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, had a common link of a malfunctioning flight-control software called MCAS.
He says he has asked Boeing's board of directors to create a committee to review company policies for airplane development and recommend improvements.
Ethiopian Airlines released a preliminary report Thursday on the crash of its plane on March 10. Investigators say the pilots used procedures provided by Boeing but couldn't stop the plane's repeated nose dives. All 157 people on board died in the crash just after takeoff from Addis Ababa.
A Lion Air 737 Max jet crashed in a similar way on Oct. 9, with pilots frantically trying to stop the nose from dropping. The plane went down off the coast of Java, killing 189 people.

Settler Colonialism Lurked Beneath the Christchurch Massacre,truthout.org,Azeezah Kanji &,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://truthout.org/articles/settler-colonialism-lurked-beneath-the-christchurch-massacre/,"In the commentary connecting the bloody dots between the mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the 2017 one in Quebec, Canada ‚Äî an association made by the Christchurch attacker himself, by inscribing the name of the Quebec mosque shooter on one of his weapons ‚Äî the fact that both acts of carnage occurred in white supremacist, settler-colonial states has received scant attention.
Emergent critiques of Islamophobia as a systemic, transnational phenomenon have tended to stop short of any truly materialist analysis and any deep historical reading of the conditions that support these mobilizations of anti-Muslim sentiment in settler societies like Canada and New Zealand (known to the Indigenous MƒÅori people as Aotearoa) ‚Äî in which the racism deployed to rationalize European genocide against Indigenous nations has long been intertwined with anti-Muslim as well as anti-Black, anti-Asian and anti-Jewish discourses. For example, the Doctrine of Discovery that continues to constitute the foundations of colonial sovereignty in settler states emerged from papal edicts permitting the seizure of non-Christian lands and property during the Crusades.
The relationship between Islamophobia and settler colonialism means that anti-Muslim violence cannot be addressed simply as a problem of ‚Äúhate crime,‚Äù or ameliorated by more draconian immigration restrictions or anti-terrorist measures ‚Äî the very types of measures through which the white settler state has been constructed. Indeed, our fear is that such initiatives have (and will continue to) fan the flames of Islamophobia, with the combined arsenal of both formal and informal state apparatuses and private and ad hoc vigilante-type violence."

MINNEAPOLIS ‚Äî For those who thought Texas Tech only plays defense, it's time to meet Matt Mooney.
While the Red Raiders were locking down Michigan State on one end, the graduate transfer shooting guard was raining in 3s on the other, lifting Tech one win away from the title Saturday night with a 61-51 victory over the Spartans in the Final Four.
Mooney matched his season-high with 22 points, including three 3-pointers over the span of 3 minutes to give Texas Tech a 13-point lead midway through the second half that, under these circumstances, was too much to overcome.
Mooney's first two shots in the stretch capped a 5-for-5 hot streak by Texas Tech that stood as the game's only true blast of offense.
The Red Raiders (31-6) move onto Monday's final to face Virginia, a 63-62 winner over Auburn in the earlier game.
VIRGINIA 63, AUBURN 62: Hard to call Virginia basketball boring after the last two games. And the Cavaliers have pretty much put the choker label to rest, too.
From one-and-done to NCAA Tournament miracle men, Virginia will play for the national title for the first time after pulling off another last-second stunner. Kyle Guy made three free throws with 0.6 seconds left, steadily swishing each one as debate immediately started over the sequence that sent him to the line, and Virginia beat Auburn 63-62 Saturday in the Final Four.
A year after becoming the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16, these top-seeded Cavaliers now look like destiny's team.
""It's a great story,"" Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. ""It is.""
The Cavaliers (34-3) will face Texas Tech on Monday night.
Bennett has built a powerhouse in 10 years in Charlottesville on a style of play that is often about as exciting as a trip to the campus library. The Cavaliers have gotten straight A's in the regular season with stingy defense and walk-it-up offense, but NCAA success has been hard to come by. Blown leads and early exits have been their story ‚Äî never more than when the Cavaliers lost to UMBC, a school known for chess, not hoops.
Something has gotten into these Wahoos the last two weeks, though. They reached the Final Four for the first time since 1984 with a wild buzzer-beater by Mahmadi Diakite to send their Elite Eight game against Purdue to overtime. Beating the Tigers took an even crazier finish.
Fifth-seeded Auburn (30-10) had erased a 10-point deficit in the final five minutes and taken a 4-point lead. Heartbreak was again at hand for Virginia.
The Tigers led 61-60 after Guy made an off-balance 3 with 7.6 seconds left. The shot snapped a drought of more than five minutes by the Cavaliers, who then immediately sent Jared Harper to the line.
Harper made one and Auburn, with fouls to give, did so twice. On one of them, it looked as if Ty Jerome might have double-dribbled into a decisive turnover. Jerome also might have been fouled before the mishandle. But there was no whistle for either.
""We knew there was a disruption,"" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said.
With 1.5 seconds left and in need of some magic, Virginia got the ball to Guy in the corner. He turned and fired and Samir Doughty, hands straight up in the air, bumped into Guy's hip. The shot was short, bouncing off the rim. Game over? Auburn started to celebrate and the PA announcer in U.S. Bank Stadium even announced the Tigers had won.
Guy pulled his jersey over his face. But not in angst. He said he exactly knew why official James Breeding had blown his whistle.
""I heard him call it right away,"" Guy said. ""That was me focusing.""
Meanwhile, Pearl lost it on the sideline, pumping his fist and screaming.
""We kind of thought we had it sealed,"" said Bryce Brown, who led the Auburn comeback with three 3s in the final 4:30. ""It's not why we lost the game. I just didn't agree with the call.""
Pearl said he didn't want the final call to define a great game, but he did say the officials seemed to be letting physical play go throughout.
""My advice ... if that's a foul, call it,"" Pearl said. ""Call it at the beginning of the game, call it in the middle of the game, call it at the end of the game. Don't call it any more or less at any other time during the game.""
Guy swished the first two free throws to tie it and Auburn called a timeout to ice him. Didn't work. He hit one more for the lead.
""I just literally told myself that we dream of these moments, and to be able to make one happen was special,"" Guy said.
Auburn threw a long inbound pass to Brown, but his desperation 3 was short.
The Cavaliers mobbed Guy on one end. Brown sat on the court, head hanging on the other. Auburn, in the Final Four for the first time, had its 12-game winning streak and season end in a most painful way.
NCAA national coordinator of officials J.D. Collins declined comment on the potential double dribble, but said Breeding's call was correct.
The foul violated the rule that ""verticality applies to a legal position and also to both the offensive and defensive players,"" Collins said. ""The defender may not 'belly up' or use the lower part of the body or arms to cause contact outside his vertical plane or inside the opponent's vertical plane.""
Jerome scored 21 points for Virginia and De'Andre Hunter had 10 of his 14 in a stellar second half.
Doughty led Auburn with 13 points and Brown had 12 for Auburn, which survived the first round against New Mexico State when Terrell Brown of the Aggies missed two of three free throws with 1.1 seconds remaining in the Tigers' 78-77 victory.
Auburn wasn't so fortunate this time, and Virginia, the team that made UMBC a household name ‚Äî at least for a little while ‚Äî in the first round of last year's tournament would not be denied. Being on the receiving end of maybe the most humbling NCAA Tournament upset ever has been Virginia's cross to bear all season. Even after beating Auburn, the Cavaliers had to recall the feeling of their offseason routine starting unexpectedly early last year.
""I feel like I get asked this question every single round, every round we advance, and every round I say the same thing almost,"" Jerome said, ""and it feels a little bit sweeter, a little bit sweeter.""
Then Guy said: ""Not much to add. Just you guys can ask that question again on Monday."" Never miss a story

Virginia prevails after disputed foul call on late 3 - ESPN - BPC News,britishpakistanis.online,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://britishpakistanis.online/virginia-prevails-after-disputed-foul-call-on-late-3-espn/,"admin 11:55 PM ET
MINNEAPOLIS ‚Äî A controversial foul call on a 3-point attempt by Virginia ‚Äòs Kyle Guy in the final seconds of Saturday night‚Äôs Final Four game against Auburn allowed the Cavaliers to pull out a dramatic 63-62 win and left at least one member of the Tigers fuming.
Virginia‚Äôs Kyle Guy has not had a great tournament. On Saturday, his three (controversy-marred) free throws were all that mattered.
Auburn coach Bruce Pearl implored fans to remember a ‚Äúgreat game,‚Äù but Virginia and Auburn‚Äôs Final Four matchup will be tied to a foul call.
Kyle Guy‚Äôs free throws after being fouled on a last-second 3-pointer advanced the Cavaliers to Monday‚Äôs title game.

Auburn junior guard Samir Doughty made contact with Guy on the desperation heave in the corner and was whistled for the foul by official James Breeding. Guy coolly sank all three free throws with 0.6 seconds left, sending Virginia to Monday‚Äôs championship game and Auburn home for the season.
‚ÄúNCAA needs to get some new refs,‚Äù Auburn senior guard Bryce Brown said repeatedly as he walked in the tunnel to the locker room after the game.
Brown was more measured in his reaction when he spoke with reporters afterward.
‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt think it was a foul,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe refs thought otherwise, so ‚Äî can‚Äôt go back and rewind it.‚Äù
Doughty said he disagreed with the call, but that he ultimately ‚Äútrusted their decision.‚Äù
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel no contact. I didn‚Äôt think I fouled him, but ‚Ä¶ the refs thought otherwise,‚Äù Doughty said. ‚ÄúAnd like I said ‚Äî I trust their decision, man, all the time. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre reffing the Final Four. But I‚Äôll get a chance to look at that myself and I‚Äôll judge it myself.

Down by two points with 1.5 seconds left, Virginia inbounded the ball to Guy in the corner, and he turned and missed a 3-pointer but was bumped by Doughty, who had jumped toward him and made contact with his torso. Guy made two free throws before Auburn called a timeout. He then stepped to the free throw line and made the last to give Virginia the one-point win.
‚ÄúI heard them call it right away,‚Äù Guy said of the foul. ‚ÄúThey were asking me, did I know, because I put my face into my jersey, but that was me focusing. I knew they called a foul. I knew that I got behind the line for three shots because I practiced that. I just literally told myself that we dream of these moments, and to be able to make one happen was special.‚Äù
‚ÄúVerticality applies to a legal position and also to both the offensive and defensive players. The basic components of the principle of verticality are: The defender may not ‚Äòbelly up‚Äô or use the lower part of the body or arms to cause contact outside his vertical plane or inside the opponent‚Äôs vertical plane.‚Äù
Auburn coach Bruce Pearl didn‚Äôt say whether he agreed with the foul call.
‚ÄúMy advice, as an administrator of the game, is if that‚Äôs a foul, call it,‚Äù Pearl said. ‚ÄúCall it at the beginning of the game, call it in the middle of the game, call it at the end of the game. Don‚Äôt call it any more or less at any other time during the game. That was the call.‚Äù
J.D. Collins, the NCAA‚Äôs national coordinator of officiating, issued a statement explaining that the foul was called because Doughty ‚Äúmoved into the airborne shooter, making contact with Guy while taking away his landing spot.‚Äù
Collins cited Rule 4, Section 39.i, which states, ‚ÄúVerticality applies to a legal position and also to both the offensive and defensive players.

Seth Greenberg explains that the foul call on Virginia‚Äôs Kyle Guy was definitely a foul, but the referees missed a crucial double-dribble call on Ty Jerome.
Virginia players mobbed Guy on the court and Cavaliers fans celebrated wildly, continuing their rise from the rubble following an unprecedented 16-versus-1 upset loss to UMBC last season.
Auburn and some of its fans, however, were irate.
Auburn assistant coach Steven Pearl, son of head coach Bruce Pearl, ran part of the way across the court after the buzzer, shouting at the officials before departing. The officials soon sprinted off to the tunnel for their exit amid a few obscene gestures and insults hurled their way from the nearby Auburn student section, where shock had given way to fury.
Police escorted away a few of the most unruly fans.
The scene inside U.S. Bank Stadium was quite a bit different from the one on the Auburn campus, where a number of fans celebrated at Toomers Corner before realizing the game wasn‚Äôt over. Words can‚Äôt describe the emotional roller coaster that we just witnessed‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/RWmXNVP1Dl

The foul against Doughty wasn‚Äôt the only controversial call in the final seconds.
Moments before Brown fouled Virginia guard Ty Jerome with 1.5 seconds left, Jerome appeared to commit a double-dribble violation. He dribbled behind his back and the ball hit the back of his right foot. Jerome then picked up the ball and dribbled again. The infraction went uncalled, and Brown fouled Jerome to force an inbounds play with 1.5 seconds left.
‚ÄúWe were in a situation late where we had some fouls to give, and I knew there was a disruption there,‚Äù Pearl said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just got to get on to the next play.‚Äù

As the old saying goes, it‚Äôs not what‚Äôs illegal that‚Äôs the scandal ‚Äî it‚Äôs what‚Äôs legal. Or in this case, what the State of Rhode Island deems ‚Äúethical.‚Äù
Consider the case of state Sen. Frank Ciccone. Mr. Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, is chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, a body that oversees, among other items, matters relating to wages, workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. There‚Äôs just one problem: Mr. Ciccone is simultaneously on the payroll of a union representing public government employees. He works as a consultant for Rhode Island Judicial, Professional and Technical Employees Local Union 808.
This presents a blindingly obvious conflict of interest; the same person responsible for overseeing the Labor committee should not also be involved in taking money from a union that negotiates contracts with the government. Especially given that Mr. Ciccone even admits that he ‚Äúassists with the negotiation of municipal contracts.‚Äù
Or at least that‚Äôs how it seems to those who possess common sense.
Not to the Rhode Island Ethics Commission, however. In an advisory statement issued late last month, the commission argued that ‚ÄúThe Ethics Commission has previously determined there was no inherent conflict of interest under the Code of Ethics where an individual served on a board before which that individual‚Äôs private employer might have a matter, provided the individual recused from participation in any such matter.‚Äù
If that‚Äôs the case, Mr. Ciccone will have a lot of recusing to do. As The Providence Journal reported (""R.I. ethics panel: Lawmaker with union job can head Senate Labor Committee,"" news, March 27): ‚Äúseveral bills relating to municipal contracts that [Ciccone] sponsored are in his committee, including one ‚Äî vehemently opposed by city and town administrators ‚Äî to automatically extend the terms of expired municipal police contracts or a firefighters contract ‚Äòuntil a successor agreement is reached or an interest arbitration award is rendered.‚Äô Also in his committee this year: a version of the so-called ‚Äòevergreen contracts‚Äô bill that would apply to other municipal employees and public school teachers, and a perennially controversial proposal to give teacher and municipal employee unions the right to seek binding arbitration on financial matters when contract negotiations hit a wall.‚Äù
Given the thicket that Mr. Ciccone finds himself in, rather than simply insist on frequent recusals, it would seem to us a better idea to either have him forgo his contract with the union, or give up his role on the Labor Committee. Meanwhile, the state should update its ethics code to eliminate conflicts such as this one.
One of the grave problems afflicting Rhode Island is the dominance of special interests in its government. People who stand to gain financially from the government take part in the government. The state Board of Education, for example, includes highly conflicted members of teachers unions who arguably do not have the students' or public's interests at heart. As we pointed out in our March 18 editorial (""Balanced board, not kangaroo court""), the state Labor Relations Board, which can impose significant costs on taxpayers and businesses, is tilted heavily toward labor interests.
In many other states, believe it or not, taxpayers do not put up with this sort of thing.
Rhode Islanders are cynical about their government. The Ciccone episode is just another reason why.

UK's May warns deal with opposition only way to secure Brexit,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/uks-may-warns-deal-with-opposition-only-way-587915.html,"UK's May Warns Deal With Opposition Only Way To Secure Brexit Faizan Hashmi 20 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 08:55 AM
London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Theresa May on Saturday defended her decision to turn to Britain's main opposition to get her EU divorce deal approved, warning without cross-party consensus Brexit could ""slip through our fingers"".
The beleaguered leader opened talks this week with the Labour Party in a bid to break months of stubborn opposition in parliament to the withdrawal agreement she struck with European leaders last year.
MPs have rejected three times her deal finalised with the bloc last November to end 46 years of membership.
May's overtures to Labour came ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday where she must secure another Brexit extension, until June 30, to prevent Britain crashing out the bloc at the end of next week with no accord.
The country's original March 29 departure date was delayed to April 12 last month.
""We must deliver Brexit and to do so we must agree a deal,"" May said in a statement released by Downing Street, adding the two main parties agreed on major aspects of Brexit .
""That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit .
""The longer this takes, the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all . It would mean letting the Brexit the British people voted for slip through our fingers."" However after several days of negotiations with Labour , its leader Jeremy Corbyn complained he had not ""noticed any great change in the government 's position so far"".
""I'm waiting to see the red lines move,"" he added.
Meanwhile EU members, who must give unanimous backing to any further Brexit delay, are growing increasingly impatient at the dysfunction in Westminster.
They could offer just a shorter postponement -- or a longer period of up to a year.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters at a G7 meeting in France on Saturday that it was time for the Brexit crisis to end.
""The British authorities and the British parliament need to understand that (the EU) is not going to be able to constantly exhaust itself with the ups and downs of domestic British politics ,"" he said.
However Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar cautioned it was ""extremely unlikely"" a member would veto another extension, while revealing he now favoured a lengthy delay. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
Tokyo's Prosecutors Ask Court to Question Wife of Ex-Nissan Chair Ghosn - Reports,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/tokyos-prosecutors-ask-court-to-question-wif-587914.html,"Tokyo's Prosecutors Ask Court To Question Wife Of Ex-Nissan Chair Ghosn - Reports Muhammad Irfan 20 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 08:55 AM
TOKYO (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Tokyo 's prosecutors asked a court to question a wife of former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was rearrested in Japan 's capital on Thursday amid investigation into his financial misconduct, local media reported on Sunday .ÔøΩ
Prosecutors suspect that Ghosn conducted a part of payments via a company , where Carole Ghosn is one of executives, to buy a yacht, according to the NHK broadcaster.
The broadcaster reported that the prosecutors had already asked Ghosn's wife for voluntary questioning as unsworn witness, but she refused that request. This time, the prosecutors sent request to a Japanese court , which has the power to call and question a witness, who refused to voluntarily testify in a prosecutor's office.
Ghosn was originally arrested in Japan in late November 2018 for underreporting around $44 million worth of his income and misusing company assets. He was released on bail in early March to be rearrested a month later on new suspicions. The new arrest was motivated by prosecutors' claims that Ghosn had inflicted a $5 million loss to Nissan by transferring a part of money , which Nissan 's subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates paid to an Omani distributor, to a firm that he effectively owned."

NEW YORK, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Pakistani-American actor Kumail Nanjiani is in talks to join top Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to star in Marvel Studios' ""The Eternals"" in what would be Nanjiani's first venture into the superhero realm, according to Variety, a US entertainment weekly magazine.
Details about the movie and what characters Nanjiani and Ms. Jolie would play are being kept under wraps, it said.
The Marvel Studio is an American media franchise that is centered on a series of superhero films based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
Created by Jack Kirby in 1976, the story of ""The Eternals"" is set millions of years ago when the cosmic beings known as the Celestials genetically experimented on humans to create super-powered individuals known as the Eternals along with the villainous Deviants.
The two groups went on to battle each other throughout history. The Eternals also warred with Greek, Roman, and Norse deities before leaving Earth to explore the stars.
Chloe Zhao, whose helming credits include ""The Rider"" and ""Songs My Brothers Taught Me,"" became attached in September to direct ""The Eternals"" from a script by Matthew and Ryan Firpo. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige is producing.
Karachi-born Nanjiani came on board earlier this year to star in Valparaiso Pictures' ""No Glory,"" a spy comedy that will be produced by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell . Nanjiani and his wife , Emily Gordon, received an Oscar nomination for writing ""The Big Sick."" He will next be seen in Columbia Pictures' ""Men in Black: International"" and Universal Pictures' ""The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle."" Production on a sixth season of HBO's ""Silicon Valley,"" in which he stars as Dinesh Chugtai, is expected to take place this summer.
Marvel had no comment about Nanjiani's possible casting in ""The Eternals."" It also has not confirmed whether Angelina would join.

Washington, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Hundreds of thousands of children are listed as missing in the US every year, the vast majority quickly turning up. But for parents whose children remain missing for months -- or even years -- the wait is almost unspeakably agonizing.
So when an impostor appears, raising false hopes -- as happened this week when a young man claimed to be Timmothy Pitzen, who disappeared in 2011 at the age of six -- the shock is particularly horrific.
Still, these families are unanimous about one thing: you can never give up hope.
""Unfortunately, this child is not our beloved Timmothy,"" his aunt Kara Jacobs said, once the truth became clear. ""We know that you are out there somewhere, Tim, and we will never stop looking for you, praying for you and loving you. "" Like Jacobs, Patty Wetterling clung to hope for decades after her son was kidnapped in 1989 at the age of 11.
She said she was encouraged by the examples of Shawn Hornbeck, who was found in 2007 after four years in captivity; of Jaycee Dugard, who turned up in 2009, 18 years after her abduction; and of the three young girls freed in 2013 from kidnapper Ariel Castro after a dozen years in his hands.
""They are living proof even in the worst of situations, when all leads are dry and it feels like all hope is lost, we must never, never give up looking for our missing children,"" she wrote in the foreword to a 2016 guide for police on how to handle missing child cases."

Seoul, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Twice as many foreigners as last year gathered in Pyongyang Sunday for the city's annual marathon , tour firms said, as reduced tensions see visitor numbers rise in isolated North Korea .
The event -- part of the celebrations for the anniversary of founder Kim Il Sung's birth in 1912 -- is the highlight of the North's tourism Calendar and offers the chance to run or jog through the streets of the tightly-controlled city.
Around 950 Westerners entered the event , according to market leader Koryo Tours , compared to some 450 last year when numbers slumped.
That brought participation almost back to the levels of 2017 , before tensions soared as the North carried out a series of missile launches and leader Kim Jong Un traded threats and personal insults with US President Donald Trump .
The same year, Washington also banned its citizens from visiting the North following the death of Otto Warmbier, a US student jailed for trying to steal a propaganda poster who died in a mysterious coma days after his release.
Several other countries subsequently raised their travel warnings, a combination of events that dealt a significant blow to the North's tourism industry .
The US ban remains in place but more Western tourists signed up for the marathon this time, tour operators said, following a year of high-level diplomacy between Trump and Kim.
""As political tensions have subsided, tourism demand has increased,"" said Elliott Davies, director at Uri Tours , another operator, adding: ""You could plot a graph in this direct relationship."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

""This morning, an armed group tried to enter my home, my personal life, this is a serious situation that does not comply with the principles of law.

Lopez Obrador, in turn, wrote on Twitter that he instructed Luis Cresencio Sandoval, the Mexican secretary of defense, to create a security guard, which would effectively protect Fox and his family .
After taking office in December 2018 , Lopez Obrador sharply reduced his own security costs, abolished a general staff, which was responsible for security of heads of the state, as well as refused to use presidential air fleet, switching to regular commercial flights.

Former Middle School Teacher Claims She Felt Pressured To Give Oral Sex To Teenager,thelibertarianrepublic.com,Guest Post,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/former-middle-school-teacher-claims-she-felt-pressured-to-give-oral-sex-to-teenager/,"0 comments

A former California middle school teacher said she felt pressured to kiss and give oral sex to a student Wednesday.
Justine Nelson, 33, a former teacher at Tenaya Middle School, said an eighth grade student threatened to expose their relationship to school officials unless she was intimate with him, the Fresno Bee reported. She was afraid of not only losing her job, but also her child. Married teacher 'spent lunch breaks in classroom romping with student, 13'|crime news
Deputy District Attorney Liz Owen asked Nelson where in the nearly 100 pages of Instagram messages did the boy threaten the former teacher. Nelson said the threat happened in person, according to the Bee.
Nelson said in one instance, the boy allegedly walked into her classroom and kissed her after pushing her onto a desk in between classes. He left after Nelson screamed his name.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a natural instinct to kiss a child who just pushed you down on a desk?‚Äù Owen asked.
Nelson said yes, according to the Bee. She also admitted to giving the boy oral sex after he reportedly pressured her constantly.
‚ÄúDid you have [the student‚Äôs] penis in your mouth, was he aroused, did he ejaculate and was he in the eight grade when you did that?‚Äù Owen asked.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct,‚Äù Nelson replied, the Bee reported.
Nelson added she was ‚Äúsick and tired‚Äù and ‚Äúwanted to get it over with,‚Äù the New York Post reported.
The student, however, said in a separate testimony that Nelson allegedly started the relationship and the sex act occurred multiple times, according to the Post.
The alleged offenses happened on school grounds in 2016, when the teen was 13-years-old. He is currently 16-years-old, according to the Bee.
Nelson faces felony charges of lewd or lascivious acts with a minor and oral copulation and faces a prison sentence of eight years and eight months if convicted, according to the Bee.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to comment on the matter but can confirm Ms. Nelson was hired as a teacher in August of 2013,‚Äù Fresno Unified School District public information officer Vanessa Ramirez told The Daily Caller News Foundation over email Friday. ‚ÄúHer last day with Fresno Unified was November 10, 2016.‚Äù"
Supreme Court Rebuffs Gun Rights Groups In Fight Against Bump Stock Ban,thelibertarianrepublic.com,Guest Post,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/supreme-court-rebuffs-gun-rights-groups-in-fight-against-bump-stock-ban/,"0 comments

The Supreme Court rejected another last-ditch bid to stop the Trump administration‚Äôs bump stock ban, denying a gun rights coalition a temporary exemption from the new regulation early Friday afternoon. Bump Stock Ban & Dodging Mueller: VICE News Tonight Full Episode (HBO)
Friday‚Äôs order was the third application relating to the bump stock ban that the Supreme Court has rejected in recent weeks.
The plaintiffs in Friday‚Äôs case were five individuals and three gun rights organizations, including the Firearms Policy Foundation, the Madison Society Foundation, and Florida Carry. They sought a temporary reprieve from the ban for themselves and their members.
‚ÄúAbsent a stay, applicants and their members will be required to surrender or destroy their property or face felony charges for possession of devices that were unquestionably legal under ATF‚Äôs construction of the statute for the past 85 years and ATF‚Äôs prior written rulings stating as much,‚Äù their petition reads.
Neither the vote count nor the Court‚Äôs reasoning was disclosed, as is typical of orders of this nature, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch noted their dissent.
Bump stocks are an accessory that increase a semiautomatic rifle‚Äôs rate of fire. The Department of Justice says the appendage effectively turns a semiautomatic weapon into a machine gun, which the government can aggressively regulate under the Firearms Act of 1986.
The Supreme Court has separately dismissed two other bids to delay implementation of the new bump stock rule: Chief Justice John Roberts rejected one such application in late March, and the full Court turned away a second one on March 28.
The administration promulgated a new rule banning the possession and distribution of bump stocks after the Harvest music festival massacre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gunman Stephen Paddock outfitted more than a dozen AR-15 rifles with bump stocks to perpetrate the massacre. 58 people died, and hundreds were injured. Bump stock ban is a second amendment overreach: RW Arms Ltd. co-founder
The ban took effect on March 26. There are 500,000 bump stocks in circulation, according to Gun Owners of America. The new rule requires any person or entity in possession of bump stocks to destroy or surrender them to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).
There is one man in America who can legally own bump stocks as of this writing. Utah Shooting Sports Council chairman Clark Aposhian obtained a temporary stay of the ban from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on March 21. The stay applies to him only."

As debate about the act‚Äîwhich would extend federal nondiscrimination laws to LGBTQ people nationwide‚Äî began in earnest , I learned that I and other transgender women are tricksters and frauds intent on supplanting ‚Äúreal‚Äù women throughout public life. I learned I‚Äôm a threat to women‚Äôs sports , a topic many committee members only seem to care about when it can be wielded as a cudgel against transgender people. And perhaps most shockingly, I learned that the well-documented crisis of violence transgender people face across this country is, in the words of one witness at the hearing, a ‚Äúmyth.‚Äù
Just a few days before the hearing and a few miles away from where it took place, Ashanti Carmon had been shot and killed near the line dividing D.C. and Maryland. Ashanti is the second known Black transgender woman to be murdered in 2019; Dana Martin was the first, in January in Montgomery, Alabama.

Muellergate & The Discreet Lies Of The Bourgeoisie | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/muellergate-discreet-lies-bourgeoisie,"Via CraigMurray.co.uk,
This cartoon seems to me very apposite...
The capacity of the mainstream media repeatedly to promote the myth that Russia caused Clinton‚Äôs defeat, while never mentioning what the information was that had been so damaging to Hillary, should be alarming to anybody under the illusion that we have a working ‚Äúfree media‚Äù.
There are literally hundreds of thousands of mainstream media articles and broadcasts, from every single one of the very biggest names in the Western media, which were predicated on the complete nonsense that Russia had conspired to install Donald Trump as President of the United States.
I genuinely have never quite understood whether the journalists who wrote this guff believed it, whether they were cynically pumping out propaganda and taking their pay cheque, or whether they just did their ‚Äújob‚Äù and chose to avoid asking themselves whether they were producing truth or lies.
I suspect the answer varies from journalist to journalist. At the Guardian, for example, I get the impression that Carole Cadwalladr is sufficiently divorced from reality to believe all that she writes. Having done a very good job in investigating the nasty right wing British Establishment tool that was Cambridge Analytica, Cadwalladr became deluded by her own fame and self-importance and decided that her discovery was the key to understanding all of world politics. In her head it explained all the disappointments of Clintonites and Blairites everywhere. She is not so high-minded however as to have refused the blandishments of the Integrity Initiative.
Luke Harding is in a different category. Harding has become so malleable a tool of the security services it is impossible to believe he is not willingly being used. It would be embarrassing to have written a bestseller called ‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù, the entire premiss for which has now been disproven, had Harding not made so much money out of it.
Harding‚Äôs interview with Aaron Mate of The Real News was a truly enlightening moment. The august elite of the mainstream media virtually never meet anybody who subjects their narrative to critical intellectual scrutiny. Harding‚Äôs utter inability to deal with unanticipated scepticism descends from hilarious to toe-curlingly embarrassing.
In general, since the Mueller report confirmed that $50 million worth of investigation had been unable to uncover any evidence of Russiagate collusion, the media has been astonishingly unrepentant about the absolute rubbish they have been churning out for years.
Harding and the Guardian‚Äôs story about Manafort repeatedly calling on Assange in the Ecuador Embassy is one of the most blatant and malicious fabrications in modern media history. It has been widely ridiculed, no evidence of any kind has ever been produced to substantiate it, and the story has been repeatedly edited on the Guardian website to introduce further qualifications and acknowledgements of dubious attribution, not present as originally published. But still neither Editor Katherine Viner nor author Luke Harding has either retracted or apologised, something which calls the fundamental honesty of both into question.
Manafort is now in prison, because as with many others interviewed, the Mueller investigation found he had been involved in several incidences of wrongdoing. Right up until Mueller finalised his report, media articles and broadcasts repeatedly, again and again and again every single day, presented these convictions as proving that there had been collusion with Russia. The media very seldom pointed out that none of the convictions related to collusion. In fact for the most part they related to totally extraneous events, like unrelated tax frauds or Trump‚Äôs hush-money to (very All-American) prostitutes. The ‚ÄúRussians‚Äù that Manafort was convicted of lobbying for without declaration, were Ukrainian and the offences occurred ten years ago and had no connection to Trump of any kind. Rather similarly the lies of which Roger Stone stands accused relate to his invention, for personal gain, of a non-existent relationship with Wikileaks.
The truth is that, if proper and detailed investigation were done into any group of wealthy politicos in Washington, numerous crimes would be uncovered, especially in the fields of tax and lobbying. Rich political operatives are very sleazy. This is hardly news, and if those around Clinton had been investigated there would be just as many convictions and of similar kinds. it is a pity there is not more of this type of work, all the time. But the Russophobic motive behind the Mueller Inquiry was not forwarded by any of the evidence obtained.
My analysis of the Steele dossier, written before I was aware that Sergei Skripal probably had a hand in it, has stood the test of time very well. It is a confection of fantasy concocted for money by a charlatan.
We should not forget at this stage to mention the unfortunate political prisoner Maria Butina, whose offence is to be Russian and very marginally involved in American politics at the moment when there was a massive witchhunt for Russian spies in progress, that makes The Crucible look like a study in calm rationality. Ms Butina was attempting to make her way in the US political world, no doubt, and she had at least one patron in Moscow who was assisting her with a view to increasing their own political influence. But nothing Butina did was covert or sinister. Her efforts to win favour within the NRA were notable chiefly because of the irony that the NRA has been historically responsible for many more American deaths than Russia.
Any narrative of which the Establishment does not approve is decried as conspiracy theory. Yet the ‚ÄúRussiagate‚Äù conspiracy theory ‚Äì which truly is Fake News ‚Äì has been promoted massively by the entire weight of western corporate and state media. ‚ÄúRussiagate‚Äù, a breathtaking plot in which Russia and a high profile US TV personality collude together to take control of the most militarily powerful country in the world, knocks ‚ÄúThe Manchurian Candidate‚Äù into a cocked hat. A Google ‚Äúnews search‚Äù restricts results to mainstream media outlets. Such a search for the term ‚ÄúRussiagate‚Äù brings 230,000 results. That is almost a quarter of a million incidents of the mainstream media not only reporting the fake ‚ÄúRussiagate‚Äù story, but specifically using that term to describe it.
Compare that with a story which is not an outlandish fake conspiracy theory, but a very real conspiracy.
If, by contrast, you do a Google ‚Äúnews search‚Äù for the term ‚ÄúIntegrity Initiative‚Äù, the UK government‚Äôs covert multi million pound programme to pay senior mainstream media journalists to pump out anti-Russian propaganda worldwide, you only get one eighth of the results you get for ‚ÄúRussiagate‚Äù. Because the mainstream media have been enthusiastically promoting the fake conspiracy story, and deliberately suppressing the very real conspiracy in which many of their own luminaries are personally implicated.
Furthermore ‚Äì and this is a truly tremendous irony, which relates back to the cartoon at the start ‚Äì only two of the top ten news results for ‚ÄúIntegrity Initiative‚Äù come from the Western corporate media.
And this next fact comes nearly into the ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù category for my argument. Those two MSM mentions, from Sky News and the Guardian, do not complain of the covert anti-Russian propaganda campaign that is the Integrity Initiative. They rather complain that it was an alleged ‚ÄúRussian hack‚Äù that made the wrongdoing public!! You could not make it up, you really could not.
According to the mainstream media, it is not Hillary Clinton‚Äôs fault for conspiring with the DNC to cheat Bernie out of the nomination, it is Russia‚Äôs fault for allegedly helping to reveal it. It is not the British government‚Äôs, or their media collaborators‚Äô, fault for running a covert propaganda scheme to dupe the public of the UK and many other countries, it is the Russians‚Äô fault for allegedly helping to reveal it!
Which brings us full circle to the DNC leak that sparked Muellergate and the claims that it was the Russians who lost Hillary the election. Robert Mueller repeats the assertion from the US security services that it was Russian hackers who obtained the DNC emails and passed them on to Wikileaks. I am telling you from my personal knowledge that this is not true.
Neither Mueller‚Äôs team, not the FBI, nor the NSA, nor any US Intelligence agency, has ever carried out any forensic analysis on the DNC‚Äôs servers. The DNC consistently refused to make them available. The allegation against Russia is based purely on information from the DNC‚Äôs own consultants, Crowdstrike.
William Binney, former Technical Director of the NSA (America‚Äôs US$40 billion a year communications intercept organisation), has proven beyond argument that it is a technical impossibility for the DNC emails to have been transmitted by an external hack ‚Äì they were rather downloaded locally, probably on to a memory stick. Binney‚Äôs analysis is fully endorsed by former NSA systems expert Ed Loomis. There simply are no two people on the planet more technically qualified to make this judgement. Yet, astonishingly, Mueller refused to call Binney or Loomis (or me) to testify. Compare this, for example, with his calling to testify my friend Randy Credico, who had no involvement whatsoever in the matter, but Mueller‚Äôs team hoped to finger as a Trump/Assange link.
Randy Emerges From His Evidence Session Displaying A Great Taste in Reading Material
The DNC servers have never been examined by intelligence agencies, law enforcement or by Mueller‚Äôs team. Binney and Loomis have written that it is impossible this was an external hack. Wikileaks have consistently stressed no state actor was involved. No evidence whatsoever has been produced of the transfer of the material from the ‚ÄúRussians‚Äù to Wikileaks. Wikileaks Vault 7 release of CIA documents shows that the planting of false Russian hacking ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù is an established CIA practice . Yet none of this is reflected at all by Mueller nor by the mainstream media.
‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù may be dead, but the ‚ÄúRussiagate‚Äù false narrative limps on.
I should add it seems to me very probable Russia did make some efforts to influence the US election. I worked a a British diplomat for 20 years and spent a lot of time trying to influence political outcomes in the country in which I was posted, in Eastern Europe and in Africa. It is part of the geopolitical game. The United States is of course the world leader by a long way in attempting to influence elections abroad, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to that effect in countries including Ukraine, Georgia, Ecuador and Venezuela recently, and pretty well everywhere in Africa. It is a part of normal diplomatic life.
Mueller uncovered some high level influence-broking meetings. This is what states do. He uncovered some sleazy deals. This is what rich people do. He uncovered some US $110,000 of Facebook ad spending from Russia targeted on the USA, some of which promoted sex toys, some of which was post-election, but some of which was apparently trying to assist Trump against Clinton. Compared to the amount the USA pumps into similar arms length assistance to Putin opponents in Russia alone, it was negligible. That this tiny bit of Facebook advertising crucially impacted the US $13,000,000,000 PR campaigns of the candidates is a ludicrous proposition.
That every country stay out of every other country‚Äôs politics is arguably desirable. It is not however the status quo, and the United States is in the worst position of all to complain.

"Banning Buybacks Would Crash The Market, Goldman Warns | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/banning-buybacks-would-crash-market-goldman-warns,"Few topics prompt as powerful (and violent) a response from financial professionals as what the role of financial buybacks is in determining stock prices. One group, largely those bulls who after a decade of central bank manipulation still believe that markets are efficient and unrigged, and in hope of increasing their AUMs claim that they are financial geniuses for riding the world's biggest financial bubble in history, argue that stock buybacks have no impact on stock prices. Others, those who actually understand that if there is a trillion dollars in price indiscrimiante stock bids (as was the case in 2018 and will again happen in 2019) is the single most effective way to boost stock prices (and management's incentive-linked comp, linked to higher stock prices), know - correctly - that corporate buybacks, which until not too long ago were banned, and which over the past decade emerged as the single biggest source of stock purchases, are one of the two most important factors behind the all time highs in the stock market (the other being the Fed, whose policies have allowed companies to issue debt with record low yields, allowing them to fund these trillions in buybacks).
And with the debate raging, either side happy to ""convince"" others in its echo chamber while hurling insults at the other, few have been as vocal in their defense of stock buybacks as Goldman Sachs.
One month ago, the firm's chief equity strategy David Kostin wrote a report - let's call it the carrot - seeking to debunk ""misconceptions"" about stock buyabcks, which he claimed had gotten an unfair rap in the US. Specifically, Kostin said that ""one of the greatest misconceptions in the public discourse surrounding corporate buybacks is the belief that managements repurchase stock in an attempt to inflate earnings per share and meet incentive compensation targets,‚Äù Goldman wrote. And while Goldman tried, to demonstrate that ""executives whose compensation depends on EPS, did not allocate a higher proportion of 2018 total cash spending to buybacks than companies where management pay is not linked to EPS"", the bank was forced to admit that last year buybacks did surpass capex as the biggest use of capital allocation.
Goldman's valiant effort to halt regulatory and legislative focus on buybacks - which also included Goldman‚Äôs ex-CEO Lloyd Blankfein issuing a rebuttal defending the practice on Twitter , saying the money ‚Äúgets reinvested in higher growth businesses that boost the economy and jobs"" did little however to stem the tide and as a result buybacks have been getting increasing scrutiny in the wake of the tax reforms in late 2017, when companies used money saved from the lower taxes as well as repatriated cash to return money to shareholders in record amounts, with total announced buybacks surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in 2018.
As a result, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida released a plan last month that would curb buyback incentives. Democratic Senator Chris van Hollen of Maryland may propose legislation curbing executive share sales after repurchase announcements. The culmination - so far - was the US Senate convening hearings and introducing legislation to prohibit public companies from repurchasing their shares on the open market.
This was too much for Goldman, which realized that the carrot approach is not working, and late on Friday went all ""stick"", when one month after his first report exposing buyback ""misconception"", Goldman's David Kostin doubled down, effectively warning that a ban on buybacks would likely result in a market crash, as ""eliminating buybacks would immediately force firms to shift corporate cash spending priorities, impact stock market fundamentals, and alter the supply/demand balance for shares.""
And just to underscore his dire warning, Kostin said that from a portfolio strategy perspective, ""the potential restriction on buybacks would likely have five implications for the US equity market: (1) slow EPS growth; (2) boost cash spending on dividends, M&A, and debt paydown; (3) widen trading ranges; (4) reduce demand for shares; and (5) lower company valuations.""
Kostin then breaks down these core points into the detail components, all of which have dire consequences for the market if the single biggest buyer of stocks is forced to step aside:
1. Slow EPS growth.
From a fundamental perspective, removing buybacks would have a negative effect on EPS growth. Aggregate earnings growth trails EPS growth because buybacks boost earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding. During the past 15 years, the gap between EPS growth and earnings growth for the median S&P 500 company averaged 260 bp (11% vs. 8%). In 2018, the spread equaled 200 bp (20% vs. 18%). Another approach to estimating the boost to EPS growth in excess of earnings growth is the net buyback yield [(share repurchases - share issuance) / starting market capitalization]. This yield reflects the percent of market cap repurchased during the trailing 12 months. The S&P 500 net buyback yield averaged 2.6% during the past five years, close to the actual 290 bp gap between median EPS and earnings growth (10% vs. 8%).
2. Shift cash spending priorities.
S&P 500 firms allocated an average of 25% of their annual cash spending to buybacks since 2009. Eliminating repurchases would compel firms to find new uses for that cash. Some firms might choose to make formal tender offers for their shares, which firms employed to retire stock prior to 1982. But most managements would probably redirect cash that was previously spent on buybacks towards dividends (both regular and special) and funding more M&A. Spending on capex and R&D would probably not change if buybacks ceased, according to Goldman. During the past decade, capex and R&D have accounted for an average of 45% of S&P 500 annual cash spending which has consistently equaled about 8% of sales. Investment spending has always been the first priority for corporations, at least until 2018 when spending on buybacks surpassed CapEx for the first time . Simply put, to Goldman this means that without new investment opportunities firms are unlikely to suddenly spend more than 8% of sales on capex and R&D, and firms would be forced to hoard the case. This means that in a world without buybacks, companies would almost certainly increase dividend growth and raise cash M&A spending. Dividends have accounted for 18% of annual cash use during the past decade and growth has averaged 6%. The S&P 500 dividend payout ratio currently equals 34%, below the 30-year average of 38%. Cash M&A spending would also jump. During the past decade, cash M&A spending accounted for 13% of corporate cash use and growth averaged 16% annually (Ex. 2). More than 75% of mergers involve some cash consideration. Firms might also choose to redirect cash spent on buybacks to reduce debt outstanding.
3. Widen trading ranges.
Removing or limiting buybacks would lead to a greater amplitude of index moves, a wider distribution of individual stock returns, and higher volatility: in short many more market crashes, both flash and otherwise . Worse, Goldman notes that prohibiting buybacks would reduce downside support for equity prices since companies could no longer step in to repurchase shares if their stock prices tumble. A case study of the potential impact of eliminating buybacks can be seen each quarter around the time the buyback blackout rolls in, about five weeks prior through two days after a company releases earnings. During these periods, firms are restricted from executing discretionary buybacks.
And here is the clearest indication just how much of an impact buybacks have no stock prices: during the past 25 years, the 20th percentile return for stocks within the S&P 500 has averaged -27% (annualized) in buyback blackout periods compared with -16% when companies can freely repurchase their shares. The average (11% vs. 5%) and 80th percentile (61% vs. 40%) stock returns are also higher during buyback blackouts likely due to the boost from quarterly earnings releases. Return dispersion (16 pp vs. 14 pp) and volatility (16.4 vs. 15.8) during blackout windows have also been higher compared with non-blackout periods (Exhibit 3).
4. Reduce demand for shares
This is where Goldman's warnings start to get especially dire, because as Kostin cautions, without company buybacks, demand for shares would fall dramatically. Repurchases have consistently been the largest source of US equity demand. Since 2010, corporate demand for shares has far exceeded demand from all other investor categories combined. Net buybacks for all US equities averaged $420 billion annually during the past nine years. In contrast, during this period, average annual equity demand from households, mutual funds, pension funds, and foreign investors was less than $10 billion for each category ‚Äì despite the fact these categories collectively own 83% of corporate equities. Buybacks represented the largest source of equity demand in 2018.
According to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs most recent Financial Accounts quarterly report, corporate demand for stocks, measured as gross repurchases minus share issuance plus M&A, totaled $509 billion last year. Households were the only other net buyer of stocks (+$191 billion). Pensions, mutual funds, and foreign investors sold $243 billion, $124 billion, and $94 billion of equities in 2018, respectively. High equity exposure among major investor categories increases the importance of buybacks as a source of equity demand. Equity allocations for each of the major investor categories are elevated vs. history. Aggregate equity allocation totals 44% across households, mutual funds, pension funds, and foreign investors (86th percentile relative to the past 30 years). In contrast, we estimate that allocation to debt and cash are only at the 39th and 3rd percentiles, respectively.
5. Lower valuations
A decline in expected earnings growth could also lead to P/E multiple contraction. In a world without buybacks, forward EPS growth could be trimmed by 250 bp, close to the impact of net buybacks on company-level EPS growth. During the past 30 years, a 250 bp lower expected FY2 EPS growth has corresponded with a one multiple point lower forward P/E multiple for the median S&P 500 stock. And since Goldman already warned liquidity would be even more dire, one can expect that 1x PE multiple shrinkage to have dire consequences on stock prices.
Finally, prohibiting buybacks could also apply downward pressure to equity prices if it increases the supply of equities relative to demand at current prices, as eliminating the largest source of equity demand could lower the demand curve if other investor categories do not replace the corporate bid from buybacks. And since buybacks have been the go-to backstop for the market - along with the Fed - the probability of another ""investor category"" stepping up to buy stocks when the buyer of last reserve is gone, is virtually nil.
* * *
So as Goldman turns from a carrot to a stick approach, one can summarize the latest Goldman report by observing that very bad things will happen if Congress proceeds with its intentions to ban buybacks. There is a silver lining: while Goldman previously sided with the generally clueless segment of ""financial experts"", claiming that the impact of buybacks on stocks is at best muted, now that buyback legislation is becoming an increasingly greater threat by the day, Goldman can finally admit the truth: without buybacks the market will crash.
And with Goldman's abrupt and honest reversal, we are confident that the debate whether buybacks influence stocks or not, can finally be laid to rest.

Anti-vaxxers use Nazi yellow Star of David patch for their cause,www.jpost.com,JOSEFIN DOLSTEN/JTA,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Antisemitism/Anti-vaxxers-use-Nazi-yellow-Star-of-David-patch-for-their-cause-585929,"Yellow badge Star of David. (photo credit: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/DANIEL ULLRICH)
Anti-vaccination activists are using the yellow Star of David that Nazis forced Jews to wear during World War II to promote their cause. Activists are using a star that has the words ‚ÄúNo Vax‚Äù in Hebrew-stylized letters on social media, while others are wearing yellow stars at events, according to a Friday report by the Anti-Defamation League. Del Bigtree, CEO of the anti-vaccination group ICAN, wore a yellow star last week at a rally in Austin, Texas, and activists in suburban New York‚Äôs Rockland County likened a ban on unvaccinated children in public spaces to combat a measles outbreak to Nazi treatment of Jews, The Washington Post reported. The anti-vaccine crowd has evidently decided their persecution can only be expressed in Holocaust metaphors. At a rally in Texas yesterday anti-vax media personality Del Bigtree pinned a yellow star on himself mid-speech. pic.twitter.com/m672NNiEzY ‚Äî Anna Merlan (@annamerlan) March 29, 2019 The ADL slammed the comparisons.‚ÄúIt is simply wrong to compare the plight of Jews during the Holocaust to that of anti-vaxxers,‚Äù Jonathan Greenblatt, the group‚Äôs national director, told the Post. ‚ÄúGroups advancing a political or social agenda should be able to assert their ideas without trivializing the memory of the 6 million Jews slaughtered in the Holocaust.‚ÄùThe anti-vaccination movement has risen in popularity in recent years. Recent measles outbreaks have been traced back to Orthodox Jewish communities, where some parents are refusing to vaccinate their kids.

AMSTERDAM (JTA) ‚Äî A pro-Israel activist was beaten near an anti-Israel rally in Amsterdam by a crowd of men shouting ‚ÄúJew.‚ÄùAt least 20 pro-Palestinian protesters were filmed mobbing Michael Jacobs at the Dam Square while he was wearing an Israeli flag around his shoulders. They called out ‚ÄúJew‚Äù and ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù as several of them beat Jacobs. Police intervened and removed Jacobs from the scene with minor injuries, the NIW weekly reported Friday. He is retired and lives in Amsterdam.In recent years, pro- and anti-Israel activists have often faced off on Dam Square. In the past, the iconic square had only an anti-Israel presence.In a separate incident last month, Jacobs filmed himself with a body camera standing alone on the Dam. An anti-Israel protester called two horse-mounted police officers on him, who told him he was disturbing public order.Jacobs argued in that video that whereas staging rallies required permits under Dutch law, individuals may express their beliefs without prior approval.‚ÄúThe Jew will not move aside,‚Äù Jacobs said.One of the officers then is seen advancing with his horse at Jacobs‚Äô direction, telling him, ‚ÄúThe Jew won‚Äôt move aside? I will make him move aside.‚Äù The officers rode on after the exchange.Jacobs has been arrested several times for demonstrating in favor of Israel at Dam Square, at times amid violence by the anti-Israel crowd and antisemitic hate speech. The municipality last year introduced a time and space sharing schedule to minimize friction between the two parties.

Trending Stimulating Simulations: Evidence for God, Not Hackers
The 2020 Democratic Party primary reminds me of the movie Zoolander . In Zoolander , two male models engage in a ‚Äú walk off ,‚Äù a contest to see which vapid vessel can do the same standard model moves better than the other. It ends when Owen Wilson is able to remove his underwear one-handed without taking off his pants first. Derek Zoolander then gives himself an atomic wedgie trying to duplicate it. But for the presidential campaign, instead of the nearly two dozen Democrat running (so far) attempting to remove their tighty-whities and granny panties in a walk off, they‚Äôre engaged in the ultimate ‚Äúwoke off.‚Äù
The problem with the Democratic field, aside from their generally bad and un-American ideas, is they‚Äôre all the same person in different packages. There is no disagreement on the major issues or the vast majority of minor issues. It‚Äôs like coming down to the tree on Christmas morning, seeing 20 boxes in different wrapping paper and each one of them being filled with tube socks. It doesn‚Äôt matter which one you open or how pretty the wrapping paper is, it‚Äôs all socks.
Single-payer health care? Check. Universal pre-K? Check. Reparations for slavery? Check. You name the left-wing fever-dream and they all check the same boxes, only differing slightly on fringes.
That leaves the Democratic primary to be a choice about which wrapping paper you want for your socks.
The Washington Post wrote a story about the field that opens this way, ‚ÄúMore than a third of the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president are women. There are two black men, a Mexican American man, a Taiwanese American man and a gay man. Yet in the initial phase of the 2020 race, two straight white men have emerged as the fastest fundraisers. Another has jumped to a lead in recent polls, before even announcing his candidacy.‚Äù View Cartoon
Each one of those characteristics listed are completely irrelevant to whether or not any of them are qualified to be president, yet that‚Äôs what a disturbingly large percentage of the media coverage has focused on. The Post continues, ‚ÄúDemocrats said they view Biden, O‚ÄôRourke and Sanders as credible and compelling contenders best equipped to defeat Trump. The conflicting opinions revealed Democratic divisions touching on race, gender and identity that could shape the nomination fight.‚Äù
The campaign thus far has been so devoid of seriousness that many of the candidates haven‚Äôt bothered to have an issues list on their webpages.
They list stores where supporters want to buy t-shirts, hats, lawn signs, etc. (Remember when lawn signs were free?) But when it comes to what they‚Äôll do if they were to be elected, many of them come up blank.
Normally, this would be a point of ridicule from the other candidates and a handicap with voters. But what‚Äôs the point of saying what you‚Äôll do when you‚Äôll literally do anything, and you‚Äôre willing to change any belief you swore you previously held in order to win support? Beto O‚ÄôRourke and Kirsten Gillibrand have disavowed many of the positions on which they were first elected because they won‚Äôt play in the modern Democratic Party. Even Bernie Sanders changed his tune on reparations when he went to kiss the ring of Al Sharpton last week because different opinions are not the key to winning Democratic primary votes.
It‚Äôs a sad commentary that a major political party exists purely on group-think and the hatred of their opponents. What each candidate stands for doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs a race to see whether liberals want to nominate a person with this skin tone or that one, this gender or the other, a straight woman or a gay man, etc. If a transgender Native American woman or a bi-sexual black man who liked to cross dress entered the race they‚Äôd immediately be a frontrunner. Recommended Conservative Abroad: My Experience As A Trump Fan In Germany Michael Malarkey
Think I‚Äôm making this up? There was a serious discussion on the left about whether or not South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was ‚Äúminority enough‚Äù because while he‚Äôs gay, he‚Äôs white and grew up in a well-to-do household. The concept of ‚Äúintersectionality,‚Äù where the more boxes someone can check on a sliding scale of victimhood makes them more appealing, is now an important unit of measure on the left for candidates for office.
It used to be candidates trying to appeal on issues, now that they‚Äôre all the same immutable characteristics are all that matter, because there is zero diversity of thought on the left.
Whoever they come up with will, eventually, have to answer specifics on the issues and explain how the failures of big government can only be fixed by imposing bigger government. But there‚Äôs a better than average chance whoever they nominate will not have answered a policy question with any more depth than ‚Äúwhat they said.‚Äù Instead, they will be celebrated for their skin color or who they sleep with. It‚Äôs no way to pick a potential president. Hell, it‚Äôs not even a good way to pick a pair of socks.

Osorio helps Toronto FC to 2-2 tie with Chicago Fire,www.nationalnewswatch.com,Associated Press,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/osorio-helps-toronto-fc-to-2-2-tie-with-chicago-fire/,"By Associated Press ‚Äî Apr 6 2019
TORONTO ‚Äî Jonathan Osorio scored in the 76th minute, lifting Toronto FC to a 2-2 tie with the Chicago Fire on Saturday.
Toronto (3-0-1) was the only MLS team with a perfect record coming into the day. It extended its undefeated streak against Chicago to 10 dating to Sept. 26, 2015.
Jozy Altidore scored for Toronto in the first half and set up Osorio's tying score. Positioned on the flank near the Chicago penalty box, the burly striker twisted and turned Jeremiah Gutjahr before delivering a perfect cross for Osorio to head in.
C.J. Sapong and Nemanja Nikolic scored for Chicago (1-2-2) before 26,256 at BMO Field.
Spanish playmaker Alejandro Pozuelo, who dazzled in his MLS debut last week with two goals and an assist, set up Altidore's goal in the 31st minute. He made a perfect cross to the American, who headed it in at the far post for his third of the season.
Chicago drew even in first-half stoppage time after Gutjahr's long ball found Sapong, who held off Chris Mavinga and then beat goalkeeper Alex Bono.
A Toronto giveaway set the scene for Chicago's go-ahead goal in the 62nd minute. Richie Laryea lost the ball in midfield and Aleksandar Katai raced through the area where the Toronto fullback was supposed to be. With no one closing him down, he headed toward the penalty box and sent in a cross that Nikolic tapped in as Toronto defenders watched.

Senators end horrible season with one-sided loss against Blue Jackets,www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Lisa Wallace, The Canadian Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/senators-end-horrible-season-with-one-sided-loss-against-blue-jackets/,"By Lisa Wallace, The Canadian Press ‚Äî Apr 6 2019
OTTAWA ‚Äî The Ottawa Senators capped an awful season with an ugly performance.
A 6-2 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday finished a campaign in which Ottawa finished last in the standings for the first time in 23 years.
""It's been a tough year win and losses wise, but as a group we tried to stand up and make an identity for ourselves,‚Äù said defenceman Thomas Chabot.
""I think we did a pretty good job of that. I think when (interim head coach Marc) Crawford took over, everybody kind of took a step and we always stuck together as a group whether we were winning or losing and I think that's a big step.""
Whether Crawford is back remains to be seen, with the coaching decision one of the biggest to come this off-season for Ottawa after its second straight playoff miss.
The Senators traded their first-round pick to the Colorado Avalanche in this year's draft, which could end up being No. 1 in the lottery on Tuesday night.
""It's a disappointing feeling right now,"" said forward Zack Smith. ""At the same time, we've done a lot of good things, especially in the last month. We've come a long way. Now it's just get some rest and start getting excited about next year because we have a long time to think about it.""
Pierre-Luc Dubois scored two goals to lead the Blue Jackets, who clinched a playoff berth Friday. Alexandre Texier, Riley Nash, Oliver Bjorkstrand and Markus Nutivaara also scored for the Blue Jackets, while Joonas Korpisalo made 27 saves.
The Blue Jackets, who clinched a playoff berth with a 3-2 shootout win against the New York Rangers on Friday, finished with a 47-31-4 record and the second wild card in the Eastern Conference. They'll face the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round of the playoffs.
""I wasn't sure how we were going to be,"" said head coach John Tortorella. ""You have an emotional letdown after what happened and the crazy game (Friday) night.
""I don't think we played badly. I don't think we played great. The game played out the way I thought it would be.‚Äù
While the Blue Jackets came into the game with an opportunity to move up in the standings, there was still some concern how players would react after clinching their ticket to the playoffs Friday. Carolina's win over Philadelphia, however, locked Columbus into the second wild-card spot.
""I think if anything it let us play looser and just enjoy this moment, too,"" said Columbus captain Nick Foligno. ""We worked hard to get to this point so I think for our group it's just about feeling good about ourselves going into the playoffs.""
Chabot and Mikkel Boedker scored for the Senators (29-47-6). Anders Nilsson stopped 17 shots after replacing starter Craig Anderson, who was pulled midway through the first after giving up three goals on seven shots.
Players were disappointed Anderson‚Äôs season ended the way it did and felt he deserved much better.
""Unfortunately, we left him out to dry,"" said Smith. ""That's tough. He‚Äôs battled all season and we wanted a better performance for him and give him a little more help back there.""
Nilsson started the third period with a great save on Cam Atkinson, which seemed to fire up his teammates briefly.
The Senators cut the Jackets' lead to 4-2 as Boedker, standing at the top of the crease, took a pass from Chris Tierney and wristed it past Korpisalo.
But a bad turnover by Boedker led to Bjorkstrand's second goal and Nash added an empty-net goal.
Trailing 3-0, the Senators finally got on the board midway through the second as Chabot beat Korpisalo with a backhand shot.
However, the Blue Jackets regained their three-goal lead as Texier scored his first career goal in just his second game.
Columbus opened the scoring just three minutes into the game as Dubois took a pass from Artemi Panarin and beat Anderson up high.
Midway through the first, Bjorkstrand slipped a puck through Mark Borowiecki's legs and dished it off to Nutivaara for his fifth of the season. Just over a minute later, some bad defensive coverage allowed Dubois to dig the puck out of the crease and beat Anderson for his second of the game.
NOTES: Ottawa's Ben Harpur missed his third straight game. The Blue Jackets opted to make goalie Sergei Bobrovsky a healthy scratch to give him the night off.

Trudeau hears from Toronto black business leaders about helping city‚Äôs youth,www.nationalnewswatch.com,Ross Marowits,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/trudeau-hears-from-toronto-black-business-leaders-about-helping-citys-youth/,"By Ross Marowits ‚Äî Apr 6 2019
TORONTO ‚Äî Expanding opportunities for Toronto's youth was the focus of a meeting between prominent black business leaders and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday.
""Most people expressed some of their concerns, some of their struggles and some of their successes,"" said Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri, who helped host the event as well as a practice for youth with some members of the playoff-bound basketball team.
Ujiri said the discussions have to continue to create more opportunities for more youth by examining the needs in different communities rather than taking a generalized approach.
Joining in on the practice was Xavier Trudeau, the Liberal leader's 11-year-old son, who did basketball drills inside the Raptors' practice facility.
Ujiri told the 20 invited youth they can succeed in life even if they don't become professional athletes.
""Somewhere, somehow one day you're going to remember this day and it's going to inspire you, not because of maybe the people that are here but maybe the moment that you have,"" he said.
Trudeau applauded the efforts to break down barriers. He also noted a lot of thoughts were focused Saturday about the importance of teams, since the day marked the first anniversary of the Humboldt Broncos tragedy.
Sixteen people were killed and 13 were injured after the Saskatchewan hockey team's bus collided with a semi driven by a novice trucker who had blown the stop sign at a rural intersection.
""We know that 16 people lost their lives and a community was devastated but it was also an opportunity to see how strong communities come together, how the town of Humboldt, as devastated as it was, was supported by 37 million Canadians right across the country who came together,"" he said.
""Support is there through tragedies, but it's also there for youth in communities around and across the country.""
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Ahmed Hussen said the black leaders talked about public-private partnerships, entrepreneurship and access to money for innovation and startups.
""We heard some really good ideas in there and really good feedback on what more we can do,"" he told reporters.
""They just want to make sure that our investments in the tech sector, in AI, in the incubation industry, some of the policies we have as a government to really push forward an innovation agenda includes everyone, including members of the black community.""
Asked whether that message can get through to voters heading into the fall election in light of the recent political turmoil prompted by the SNC-Lavalin affair, Hussen said that's the Liberal party's obligation.
""Canadians will have an opportunity to decide who's best placed to grow our economy, create jobs, but also deal with existential issues like climate change,"" he said before criticizing the Conservatives for their lack of climate plan and desire to return to policies of tax breaks for the rich.
""We've seen with the cuts in Ontario. That's a preview of what's going to happen federally if Andrew Scheer becomes prime minister. It's a slash-and-burn approach. They'll try to balance the budget on the backs of Canadians and what we need now is further investments to solidify the growth that we've seen in the last number of years.""
