Felicity Huffman and 12 wealthy parents plead guilty in college admissions scam,edition.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/felicity-huffman-guilty-admissions/index.html,"(CNN) Thirteen wealthy parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, and one coach will plead guilty to using bribery and other forms of fraud as part of the college admissions scandal , federal prosecutors in Boston said on Monday.
Huffman, the ""Desperate Housewives"" star, pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to a fake charity associated with Rick Singer to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs, the complaint says. She faces up to 20 years in prison. In exchange for Huffman's plea, federal prosecutors will recommend incarceration at the ""low end"" of the sentencing range, a $20,000 fine and 12 months of supervised release. They will not bring further charges. A federal judge will have the final say on the outcome for Huffman and the other defendants. ""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" she said in a statement. Read More ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly. Cheat. Bribe. Lie. Here's how the college admissions scam allegedly worked ""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty,"" she said in the statement. Huffman, Gregory and Marcia Abbott, Jane Buckingham, Gordon Caplan, Robert Flaxman, Agustin Huneeus Jr., Marjorie Klapper, Peter Jan Sartorio, Stephen Semprevivo and Devin Sloane were all charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and have agreed to plead guilty, prosecutors said. Bruce Isackson and Davina Isackson will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Bruce Isackson will also plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the IRS for taking a tax deduction for the bribe. Finally, Michael Center, the former men's tennis coach at the University of Texas, agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Prosecutors recommended a range of sentences for those pleading guilty, from 12 to 18 months and unspecified ""low end"" amounts such as Huffman's recommended sentence. More than a dozen guilty pleas Actress Lori Loughlin arrives at federal court in Boston on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, to face charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal. Rick Singer, who ran a college prep business, masterminded what prosecutors called the largest college admissions cheating scheme ever prosecuted in the United States. Singer helped wealthy parents cheat on standardized tests for their children, and he bribed college coaches to falsely designate the children as recruited athletes, smoothing their path to admission. The scheme helped the students get into highly selective universities like Yale, Stanford, University of Southern California and UCLA. Several of the central figures in the case have already pleaded guilty, including Singer. Yale women's soccer coach Rudy Meredith, who accepted a bribe to help a student get admitted, and Mark Riddell, who cheated for the students on the SATs and ACTs, have agreed to plead guilty and are cooperating witnesses for the prosecution. The outrageous steps parents allegedly took to get their kids into elite schools John Vandemoer, Stanford University's former sailing head coach, has also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering. But a number of the defendants in the case have given no signs of a coming guilty plea, including ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli. Loughlin and Giannulli allegedly agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team, easing their acceptance to the school. What Huffman did The criminal complaint says Huffman and Singer exchanged multiple emails about how to get extra time on her daughters' SAT. They then arranged for Huffman's daughter to take the SAT at a location controlled by an administrator who had been bribed by Singer, the complaint states. Riddell, the brains of the operation, then flew from Tampa to California to cheat on the test for Huffman's daughter. How 34 recorded phone calls helped prosecutors bring down the college admissions scam Huffman's daughter received a score of 1420 out of a maximum of 1600 on the SAT, a score about 400 points over her Preliminary SAT exam a year earlier. Huffman later discussed the scheme in a recorded phone call with Singer, the complaint says. In court last week, Huffman acknowledged her rights, charges and the maximum possible penalties. She waived a pretrial hearing, signed conditions of her release and then was free to leave. Her husband, the actor William H. Macy, is not charged in the case. Prosecutors will be asking for jail time for all defendants, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. The defendants are facing anywhere between six to 21 months in prison if convicted or if they plead guilty, the official added, though the exact sentence would depend on a number of factors. USC, Georgetown University and other schools implicated in the scheme have said they are reviewing the admissions of students accused of participating. Yale and Stanford have each expelled students associated with the scam."
Chicago's first warm weekend of 2019 ends with 24 shootings and 5 murders,edition.cnn.com,From Bill Kirkos and Ryan Young,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/chicago-violence-weekend/index.html,"(CNN) It was the first warm weekend in Chicago, and just as feared, violence spiked, with 24 shootings across the city and five murders, police said.
The count began Friday at 6 p.m. and ran though Sunday. In one incident, two children were among several people injured at a baby shower, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. The children were in stable condition midday Monday. ""We know that two men in dark clothing approached the family gathering which we believe was a baby shower and opened fire,"" Guglielmi said. ""The shooters fled the area on foot,"" he added. ""Cooperation has been very limited with detectives, and based on victim profiles we suspect this could have been a possible retaliatory shooting from an earlier incident that stemmed from an ongoing gang conflict in that neighborhood."" Read More Mayor-elect warns of 'summer violence season' In the same time frame last year, there were 18 shootings and four murders, police spokesman Michael Carroll said. While many candidates in Chicago's mayoral election have called for Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson's badge, Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot promised a more patient approach, predicting warmer weather would again usher more violence into the city. ""We're going to be heading soon into the summer violence season,"" she told CNN. ""After that's over, we'll evaluate at that point, but I'm going to be working closely with the superintendent and with his executive team to make sure that we keep our neighborhoods safe."""
The analyst that called GE's downfall is predicting more trouble,edition.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/investing/ge-stock-downgrade-jpmorgan/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The JPMorgan analyst who foretold General Electric's downfall is warning of more trouble for the storied American conglomerate.
C. Stephen Tusa Jr. downgraded GE ( GE ) to ""underweight"" on Monday and predicted the stock will nearly get cut in half to $5 by the end of the year. In a withering, 123-page research report, the influential JPMorgan ( JPM ) analyst argued the ""risk/reward"" for owning GE has ""tilted back negative"" because the stock's 2019 spike hasn't been based on underlying change. ""We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE,"" Tusa wrote to clients, ""while overestimating the value of small positives."" GE's stock plunged 8% to $9.15 on the downgrade, making it the biggest loser in the S&P 500. The maker of light bulbs and jet engines is in jeopardy of suffering its worst day since last fall. GE was up 38% on the year as of Friday's close. Read More Tusa's GE calls are powerful because he presciently went negative on the iconic company in May 2016, when the stock was trading at $30. GE would eventually lose three-quarters of its value because of a cash crisis sparked by mounting debt and poorly timed acquisitions. The company even got kicked out of the exclusive 30-stock Dow. The JPMorgan analyst upgraded GE to ""neutral"" in December and spelled out a path for reviving the company. Even though Tusa voiced skepticism in that research report, his upgrade helped send the stock skyrocketing. Nightmare recession scenario While Wall Street is betting the GE crisis is over, Tusa is urging extreme caution. He pointed to GE's ""stubbornly heavy debt,"" GE Power's ""weak"" results, the need to pump GE Capital with more cash and overexuberance about the health of the aviation division. The nightmare scenario is that the next recession arrives before GE has repaired its debt-riddled balance sheet. GE would be ""vulnerable to liquidity issues in the event of a recession,"" Tusa said. GE bets on offshore wind as fossil fuels business stumbles An economic downturn wouldn't just prolong GE's turnaround plan. The ensuing market turmoil would add stress to GE's pension program, which is already facing a massive shortfall. A decline in asset values, along with rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, would increase GE's pension liabilities by more than $30 billion, JPMorgan estimates. GE's stock could plummet ""substantially lower"" than $5 if the company doesn't raise more cash and there is a recession, he said. Other analysts have expressed confidence in GE's turnaround under Larry Culp, who has moved with a sense of urgency since becoming CEO last fall. Last month, RBC analyst Deane Dray raised his price target on GE to $13 and kept an ""outperform"" rating on the stock. ""There is still much to fix at GE, but the market can now have confidence in the senior leader at the helm,"" Dray wrote in a report to clients. 'Where is all the money going?' Even though investors turned uber-bullish on GE this year, the company's management team has preached caution. Culp recently warned that 2019 will be another brutal year , marked by up to $2 billion of negative free cash flow from its industrial businesses. That would be a sharp reversal from the $4.3 billion generated in 2018. ""GE's challenges in 2019 are complex but clear,"" Culp said in a statement last month. ""We are facing them head on as we execute our strategic priorities to improve our financial position."" GE warns of bleak 2019 but promises a brighter future John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, predicted Monday that GE could likely lose about $2.5 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter. Anything worse than that would raise concern about GE's financial health. ""Both the bond markets and ratings agencies would not be pleased,"" Inch wrote in a report. Inch expressed dismay over GE's worsening debt ratios in the face of efforts to raise cash by selling long-held businesses. ""Where is all the money going?"" Inch asked. ""The company appears to be approaching the end of the runway of obvious assets it could sell."" GE gave EU officials 'incorrect information' Meanwhile, GE landed in hot water with regulators for a recent renewable energy acquisition. The European Commission on Monday fined GE 52 million euros ($59 million) for providing authorities ""incorrect information"" about its 2017 takeover of LM Wind. Regulators said GE initially said it was not developing any high-power offshore wind turbines beyond its existing 6 megawatt turbine. The commission later discovered from an unnamed ""third party"" that GE was ""simultaneously"" offering a 12 megawatt offshore wind turbine to potential customers. GE corrected the error a few weeks later and regulators later approved the $1.7 billion LM Wind acquisition . GE said in a statement that it is reviewing the European Commission decision before determining its next steps."
Sanders says he's open to letting convicts vote from prison - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/bernie-sanders-incarcerated-voting-iowa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont signaled openness over the weekend for the nation at large to follow his home state's example and allow people to vote from prison.
While campaigning for president in Iowa on Saturday, Sanders took a question from someone who said they had recently had their right to vote restored. The question referenced Vermont's approach to the issue, which according to the National Conference of State Legislatures allows felons to vote, even while incarcerated. Asked if he would support that on a nationwide scale, Sanders said, ""I think that is absolutely the direction we should go."" He went on to explain that in many states, when people are convicted for felonies, in addition to serving time, they lose their ""right to participate in a democratic society."" He pointed to Florida as an example of change, where a ballot measure passed last year that called for the state to allow felons, except those convicted of murder or felony sexual offenses, to have their right to vote restored after their sentences were served. Read More ""In my state, what we do is we separate -- you're paying your price, you committed a crime, you're in jail, that's bad, but you are still living in American society, and you have a right to vote,"" Sanders continued. ""I believe in that, yes, I do."" His comments in Iowa on Saturday built on increased calls in recent years for expanded voting rights for felons, while going further than many: Florida's ballot measure applies to voting rights for people after release from prison, while Vermont's approach applies to people still in prison. While many have vouched for the former approach, Sanders' comments contrasted with those of President Donald Trump, who railed against an attempt in 2016 for Virginia to expand voting rights to some convicted felons who had completed their sentences."

An earlier statement from the military said the wounded service members had been evacuated and were receiving medical care. The Taliban claimed credit for the attack, which involved a car bomb targeting a US military convoy near one of America's largest military facilities in Afghanistan. ""We feel and mourn the loss of these Americans with their families and loved ones. They volunteered to protect their country. We will continue our mission,"" Gen. Scott Miller, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement on Tuesday. Read More The US military initially said that the contractor was also killed in the attack, however on Tuesday it issued a statement saying that the contractor, an Afghan citizen, was wounded in the incident and treated on the scene along with injured Afghan civilians. Seven US service members have been killed in Afghanistan this year. The US has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, where they primarily advise Afghan forces battling the Taliban and the local ISIS affiliate. While US officials have said that peace talks with the Taliban have made progress, they have yet to finalize any agreements and intense fighting between the government and the insurgency continues. The US envoy to the peace talks, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, left Afghanistan on Sunday following meetings with Afghan president Ashraf Ghani.

Allison Mack pleads guilty to charges relating to sex trafficking case - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Sandra Gonzalez,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/entertainment/allison-mack-guilty-plea/index.html,"(CNN) Actress Allison Mack has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and racketeering relating to her alleged role in a sex trafficking case.
John Marzulli, Public Information Officer for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York confirmed Mack's plea, which was entered Monday. As part of her guilty plea, Mack admitted to state law extortion and forced labor. Attorneys for Mack did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mack was arrested in April 2018 and charged for her alleged involvement with an organization called Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ium), a group that claimed to be a self-help program but was, in reality, a pyramid scheme in which some recruits were exploited ""both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,"" according to U.S. attorney Richard P. Donoghue. Read More Mack is accused of recruiting women to join what she told them was a female mentorship group when, in fact, it was an organization created and led by Nxivm's founder, Keith Raniere, also known within the group as Vanguard. Last year, Mack, best known for her role as Clark Kent's clever confidant Chloe on CW's ""Smallville,"" was indicted on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy, according to a statement released by the Justice Department. She pleaded not guilty at the time. Officials said Mack, 36, was the co-creator of a program within Nxivm, which was targeted toward actors. What happened to Allison Mack? Mack's charges stemmed from what officials said were activities that took place as part of a secret society within Nxivm called ""DOS,"" in which women recruited and groomed others under false pretenses to be sexual partners for Raniere, according to an indictment. Several women, whose identities were withheld in court papers, claim they were blackmailed into complying and told DOS had compromising information about them. Raniere was the sole male in DOS and the leader. He has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Until women recruited others, they were called ""slaves."" Those who successfully recruited were called ""masters."" The indictment released last year claimed many so-called slaves were branded on their pelvic areas using a cauterizing pen with a symbol which, unbeknownst to them, incorporated Raniere's initials. Mack was released on a $5 million bond days after her arrest last year. Marzulli and Mack's attorneys did not respond to CNN's questions regarding whether Mack's plea was entered as part of a deal with prosecutors. Mack faces a maximum of 40 years in prison -- 20 years on each count. She is set to be sentenced on September 11, 2019."
"Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told agents not to admit migrants and to resume family separations - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Jake Tapper,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/trump-family-separation-el-paso-kirstjen-nielsen/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has been pushing to reinstate broader family separation policies and sought to close the US-Mexico border at El Paso, Texas, as his conflict with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reached a boiling point.
Three Thursdays ago, in a meeting at the Oval Office with top officials -- including Nielsen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, top aides Jared Kushner, Mercedes Schlapp and Dan Scavino, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and more -- the President, according to one attendee, was ""ranting and raving, saying border security was his issue."" Senior administration officials say that Trump then ordered Nielsen and Pompeo to shut down the port of El Paso the next day, Friday, March 22, at noon. The plan was that in subsequent days the Trump administration would shut down other ports. Nielsen told Trump that would be a bad and even dangerous idea, and that the governor of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, has been very supportive of the President. She proposed an alternative plan that would slow down entries at legal ports. She argued that if you close all the ports of entry all you would be doing is ending legal trade and travel, but migrants will just go between ports. Read More According to two people in the room, the President said: ""I don't care."" Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security Ultimately, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney seemed to have been able to talk the President out of closing the port of El Paso. Trump, however, was insistent that his administration begin taking another action -- denying asylum seekers entry. Nielsen tried to explain to the President that the asylum laws allow migrants from Central America to come to the US and gain entry. She talked to the White House counsel to see if there were any exceptions, but he told her that her reading of the law was correct. Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to official requests for comment. Told agents not to let migrants in Last Friday, the President visited Calexico, California, where he said, ""We're full, our system's full, our country's full -- can't come in! Our country is full, what can you do? We can't handle any more, our country is full. Can't come in, I'm sorry. It's very simple."" Behind the scenes, two sources told CNN, the President told border agents to not let migrants in. Tell them we don't have the capacity, he said. If judges give you trouble, say, ""Sorry, judge, I can't do it. We don't have the room."" After the President left the room, agents sought further advice from their leaders, who told them they were not giving them that direction and if they did what the President said they would take on personal liability. You have to follow the law, they were told. More widespread family separations policy Senior administration officials also told CNN that in the last four months or so, the President has been pushing Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy -- not just the original policy started by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and undone by the President once it was criticized -- that called for the prosecution of individuals crossing the border illegally between ports of entry, resulting in the separation of parents from children. According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers. The President wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming. Sources told CNN that Nielsen tried to explain they could not bring the policy back because of court challenges, and White House staffers tried to explain it would be an unmitigated PR disaster. ""He just wants to separate families,"" said a senior administration official. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster exposes Trump's immigration crisis Last night, on the second floor of the East Wing of the White House residence -- in a room called the yellow oval -- Nielsen, Mulvaney and the President met. Nielsen tried to present a path forward that was legal and in compliance with US laws but the President said to her, ""This isn't working."" And Nielsen did not disagree. ""At the end of the day,"" a senior administration official said, ""the President refuses to understand that the Department of Homeland Security is constrained by the laws."" CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect that the Oval Office meeting to discuss closing the border occurred on Thursday, March 21."
A couple from New York has been missing for almost two weeks since visiting the Dominican Republic - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lauren del Valle,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/americas/missing-americans-dominican-republic/index.html,"(CNN) Cheryl Freeman shared just a day of vacation bliss in the Dominican Republic with Orlando Moore and Portia Ravenelle.
But her memories could help determine the whereabouts of the missing couple. Moore and Ravenelle were supposed to return to New York from the Dominican Republic on March 27, Moore's half-sister said. But Moore's family has not heard from him since he left for the Dominican Republican on March 23 from Newark Liberty International Airport, Lashay Turner said. The couple left a car at the airport. Portia Ravenelle, left, went sightseeing with Canadians Carter Warrington, center, and Cheryl Freeman, right. Police on the island have not publicly confirmed the identities of the missing couple. Manuel Mateo, the captain of the Dominican Republic's National Police, said the agency is investigating the disappearance of a couple from New York. Read More Investigators are meeting Monday night to gather details to release to the public, National Police spokesman Col. Frank Felix Durán Mejia told CNN. It is not clear when the information will be released. In the meantime, Freeman and her boyfriend are believed to be among the last people who spent time with the couple on their final day in Samana, a resort town about 2.5 hours from the capital of Santo Domingo. Freeman fondly remembers the couple, whom she had hoped to keep in touch with after she returned to Canada. ""They were very sweet people,"" said Freeman, an accountant in Halifax, Nova Scotia. ""Orlando is so friendly he could make friends with anyone."" This is Freeman's account of the time she spent with the missing couple. Carter Warrington, left, met Orlando Moore at the resort where they were both staying. A chance encounter on a cart ride Freeman and her boyfriend Carter Warrington stayed at the same all-inclusive resort as Moore and Ravenelle, the Grand Bahia Principe Cayacoa. On the morning of March 25, the two couples met on a cart ride from their villas to the breakfast buffet, Freeman said. Immediately, the couple was friendly and invited Freeman and Warrington to eat breakfast with them. After breakfast, the couple parted ways and exchanged emails so they could meet up the next day, Tuesday, March 26. Horseback riding and waterfalls After breakfast Tuesday, the foursome sat by the pool, drinking piña coladas until it started to rain, Freeman said. They agreed to meet in the lobby at 12:30 p.m. to find a waterfall, Freeman said. Moore told them he had made friends with the hotel bartender the night before, Freeman said, and the bartender sent them to a friend in El Limón for sightseeing. Moore drove the four in a white Kia rental car to El Limón, where they met the bartender's friend. Orlando Moore told fellow resort guests that the hotel bartender recommended a guide for horseback riding. For $20 per person, the friend took them horseback riding up a mountain and down to a valley where they spent the afternoon by a waterfall. Freeman shared gleeful photos of the couples sharing toasts and sipping drinks from pineapples. In one photo, they smiled and hugged as they posed in front of a waterfall. Another photo captured Moore on horseback. Concerns arise about driving At some point in the day, Freeman said she learned that the couple had a flight around 2 a.m. out of Santo Domingo, located roughly 100 miles from their resort. Ravenelle told Freeman that they got a good deal on the airfare, but she had not realized how far it was from their hotel. To make it to the airport on time, the couple had rented the car they used for sightseeing, Freeman said. But Ravenelle expressed anxiety about the prospect of driving at night, Freeman said. Throughout the day, Freeman said Ravenelle was on her phone talking to the rental company about what time they would return the car. Ravenelle also said she was talking to her daughter, according to Freeman. Portia Ravenelle and Cheryl Freeman spent a day together sighseeing with their partners. On the drive to El Limón, Freeman said Ravenelle told them that the rental company warned them to not stop and open their windows for anyone because the locals know which cars are rentals, and try to mug tourists. During the drive, Ravenelle told Moore not to roll down his window for the men on speed bikes driving up next to their car, Freeman said. On the way back to the hotel, Ravenelle repeatedly asked Moore if he was sure they had enough gas to make it to the airport. She kept checking to make sure their phones were charged enough to use the GPS, Freeman said. A disco excursion After returning to the hotel, the couples separated for dinner, Freeman said. They agreed to meet around 8:30 p.m. to go to a disco in Samana. At the bar, the couples split a bottle of rum. They also saw the hotel bartender and his wife there, Freeman said. Again, Freeman said Ravenelle appeared nervous, wanting to leave because she was worried about traveling to the airport and returning the car. Freeman said she was nervous, too, as a tourist in Samana. Locals ""harassed you constantly and there were always people trying to get you to follow them and do stuff,"" she said. ""I would not recommend it."" They returned to the resort between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tuesday. They hugged goodbye in the lobby and promised to exchange photos over email and keep in touch. ""They invited us to come see them in New York and we invited them to Nova Scotia for later in summer."" Freeman said the last thing the couple said to them was that they were going upstairs to pack up and check out. That was the last they heard from them After the couple left, Warrington, Freeman's boyfriend, sent Moore an email wishing them a safe flight. He never heard back from him. Freeman said she did not realize the couple had gone missing until she returned to Halifax on March 31 and discovered several emails from Ravenelle's family. Freeman said no law enforcement agencies have contacted her about their disappearance. Now, details about the resort stick out in Freeman's mind. She noted that there was a security guard armed with a rifle guarding her villa every night at the hotel. She also said the public could access the resort via the beach. In the brief time she knew her, Freeman said Ravenelle came off as ""very cautious, adding that she would be surprised if Ravenelle would have let Moore stop even for directions. Meanwhile, Moore's family is also searching for answers. His sister said she filed a police report with Mount Vernon Police on March 29. But the office of the chief said no report was filed about Moore, and the department is not conducting an investigation. Turner said she has been trying to call law enforcement in the Dominican Republic, but has struggled to get information. ""I'm scared, I don't know what's going on,"" Turner told CNN. ""My brother's not the type to just run off, and not tell anybody."""
Montana bear attack: Teen was pinned to a tree but eventually deployed bear spray - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliott C.

He turned to find a bear charging at him.
The 17-year-old was unable to grab his bear spray, according to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks, and the bear pinned him against a tree and held him there. ""When the bear let go, the teen fell over and attempted to crawl between two trees and protect his head and vitals. The bear then pinned him face-down on the ground,"" the department said in a statement recounting the Sunday attack.

Here's who could be the next DHS secretary - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Maegan Vazquez,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-replacements-department-of-homeland-security-secretary/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced Sunday that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen would be leaving her role in the Trump administration.
The departure comes as department and immigration officials have claimed that an influx of migrants attempting to come in to the US has pushed their systems at a breaking point, leading Trump to declare a national emergency and threaten to shut down the southern border earlier this month. While Trump said Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan will fill Nielsen's role in an acting capacity, a number of names are being floated for the agency's permanent replacement. Though, as one White House official told CNN's Pamela Brown, there's also concern no one will want to serve as Nielsen's replacement. And whoever is picked will surely face a tight confirmation vote in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control. Ken Cuccinelli Ken Cuccinelli Read More Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general and Republican gubernatorial candidate, is one of the hardliners being considered for the position. He is also among the individuals being floated to fill a new role being considered by the White House: immigration czar . As Virginia's attorney general, Cuccinelli signed onto an amicus brief which supported SB 1070, an Arizona immigration law which permitted law enforcement to inquire about someone's immigration status when they're stopped, detained or arrested. He also issued a legal opinion which argued that Virginia law enforcement could also inquire about someone's immigration status when they're stopped. While serving as a state legislature in Virginia, Cuccinelli worked on legislation that would have established someone's inability or refusal to speak English on the job as a form of misconduct that would bar them from receiving unemployment benefits, and would amend the Constitution to deny citizenship to children born in the US whose parents are undocumented immigrants. Last fall, Trump told the press he'd like to end birthright citizenship . Cuccinelli is a CNN political commentator.

He announced his plans to retire in 2018, and shortly after leaving the agency, he jumped to Fox News to be a contributor on the network. He was formally nominated for the ICE director role in 2017, but he was never confirmed. With the recent withdrawal of Ron Vitiello's nomination to lead ICE , the agency has remained without a permanent director for more than two years. Homan has been a steadfast defender of the President's immigration enforcement policies. Most recently, Homan defended Trump's decision to name McAleenan to lead the Department of Homeland Security as acting secretary.

The former Texas governor is well acquainted with immigration policy having led the large border state for years. But he railed against Trump during the 2016 Republican presidential primary, calling the Trump a ""cancer"" on conservatism and a ""carnival barker."" As an opponent in the presidential race, he also criticized Trump's call for a border wall and said he had a "" fundamental misunderstanding "" of immigration issues. He also said a physical border wall was never going to happen . But Trump seems to have forgiven those words when he tapped Perry to lead his Energy Department. An Energy Department official, however, pushed against the idea that Perry could be switching departments. ""Secretary Perry is very happy where is, leading the Department of Energy,"" the official said. Emilio Gonzalez Gonzalez is currently the city manager and chief administration officer of Miami. He served in many several immigration and national security roles during George W. Bush's presidency. He was the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the office within the Department of Homeland Security, which works on federal immigration and naturalization processes, from 2005-2009. He also served as director for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the National Security Council during the Bush administration. Nielsen's departure comes as the White House also considers removing the current director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Lee Cissna, from his post.

Last year, Kobach was defeated in a run for Kansas governor. Kobach previously spearheaded a Trump White House committee on election integrity. The commission, started during the first year of the Trump administration, was disbanded when it became ensnared with legal challenges. Kobach is also among the list of people being floated to become the White House immigration czar . He told Fox Business Network Monday morning that ""it's possible that the White House might want a border czar in addition to a new ... Homeland Security secretary,"" but also conceded that the czar position might not be necessary if the right person was leading the department. ""If (the President) decides that it'd be right for the country for me to serve, I'd be honored to do so,"" Kobach said, when asked if he would take the czar position. During the presidential transition, Kobach's name was being floated to lead the Department of Homeland Security. While he didn't ultimately get the job, he was photographed with the President, holding a paper which appeared to reveal his plans for the department.

Boeing is about to reveal just how much the 737 Max crisis hurt its business - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/boeing-737-max-deliveries/index.html," The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a tragedy that has cost 346 lives. On Tuesday, investors will start to find out what it means for Boeing's bottom line.
Boeing is set to report the number of planes it delivered during the quarter. The company didn't deliver any of its bestselling 737 Max planes in the last two weeks of the quarter, because it halted those deliveries following the global grounding of the 737 Max planes on March 13 . Investors will be waiting to see if Boeing forecasts the costs of the grounding and halt of deliveries. Boeing ( BA ) doesn't normally give any dollar figures as part of its deliveries report, but this is not a normal time. It is one of the greatest crises in the company's history. Boeing is scheduled to report first quarter results on April 24, and then meet with shareholders April 29. But Tuesday's report is an early look at the financial costs of its 737 problem. The company could also provide some details on whether the grounding hurt orders for the plane, although the first quarter report generally focuses only on deliveries, not orders. So far only one airline, Indonesia's Garuda, has disclosed that it has canceled an order for 50 of the jets. Although that order was worth $4.9 billion, it's a fraction of the backlog of 5,000 737 Max orders that Boeing has on its books. Read More Boeing boasted about streamlined approval for the 737 Max. Now it's cleaning up the mess The 737 problem will extend far beyond first-quarter results. Boeing is scrambling to come up with a software fix for the automatic safety system, which is the focus of investigations into two fatal crashes. Boeing also announced last week that it was scaling back production of the 737 Max. ""The 737 delay could last longer than previously expected,"" wrote Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein in a note to investors Monday, in which he downgraded his recommendation on the stock. Epstein estimates the disruption to Boeing's business could last between six and nine months. He had previously forecast three to six months of disruption. He said he now predicts it will take Boeing until 2021 to catch up on promised aircraft deliveries. That's a big deal: The 737, which is Boeing's most profitable program, accounts for about 40% of the company's operating profit. While there are plenty of traditional 737 models in service, nearly all of the new planes that Boeing is selling as part of the program are Max models. Aviation world faces moment of reckoning after 737 MAX crashes Over the weekend American Airlines ( AAL ) , which has 24 of the Max planes, announced it was canceling flights through June because of the grounding. Cowen aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr said he now believes Boeing won't be able to make deliveries to US airlines — American, Southwest Airlines ( LUV ) and United Airlines ( UAL ) — until June. And he said that foreign aviation regulators, who were quicker to ground the planes than the US Federal Aviation Administration, may take longer to allow those deliveries to resume. He projects the foreign carriers won't start getting the planes until the third or possibly even the fourth quarter. Overall, he expects Boeing to deliver just 500 737 planes in 2019. Before the crisis, he believed Boeing would deliver 630. But he admits his best guess could be way off if Boeing's problems deepen. ""It comes at a sizable, albeit still hard to quantify, financial penalty to 2019 results,"" wrote von Rumohr."
Nancy Pelosi just trolled Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Again. - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/nancy-pelosi-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-twitter/index.html,"(CNN) Nancy Pelosi didn't get to where she is without learning how to troll with the best of them. And in an interview with USA Today released Monday , the speaker of the House again turns her gaze to the most famous/infamous freshman House member in recent memory: New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Asked about the difficulties of governing a caucus in the House that is being challenged at every turn by AOC and others like her -- liberals elected in the past few cycles who are deeply skeptical of the party establishment -- Pelosi said this: ""While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what's important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
Now, Pelosi didn't mention AOC by name. But you'd have to be a real dummy to not understand who she was talking about. Ocasio-Cortez has 3.9 million Twitter followers , by far the most of any House member -- including Pelosi ( 2.4 million followers ). And AOC is an active Twitter user -- often employing the social media site to call out what she believes to be unfairness within the Democratic Party or to push back on media stories about her. Pelosi's not-so-subtle shot at AOC isn't an isolated event either. In February, she was asked about the ""Green New Deal,"" a sweeping legislative proposal that Ocasio-Cortez has been closely aligned with that aims to address the challenges of climate change. ""It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,"" Pelosi said dismissively. ""The green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it, right?"" Ye h. Read More If you think Pelosi's comments on AOC are accidental and not meant to send a very clear message to AOC, you don't know much about Pelosi. What message is she sending? This one: Look, I have been a liberal's liberal for longer than you've been on earth. But not everyone House Democrat represents districts like we do. And we need to understand that they are governed by a different set of political realities. The most important thing we do isn't score ideological points. It's pass legislation as a united caucus --to show all Americans we are doing the work, not just playing partisan games. Pelosi's comments come amid a broader showdown between the party establishment and the newly-energized liberal wing. The leading edge of that fight is a decision by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of the party, to ban giving any business (aka money) to consultants who work for candidates who primary sitting incumbents . The goal is simple: The threat of losing business will keep top consultants away from primary challengers. That will, theoretically, mean fewer primary challengers. Which establishment Democrats -- led by DCCC Chair Rep. Cheri Bustos -- believe is a very good thing. AOC, who herself ousted an incumbent to claim her seat in 2018, took to Twitter to protest the move. She called the policy ""extremely divisive & harmful to the party"" and recommended that small-dollar donors ""pause"" on making contributions to the DCCC and instead focus on giving to vulnerable incumbents in swing seats. These fault lines within the House Democratic caucus are, in some ways, the natural result of winning the majority. The more seats you control, the more likely it is that you have people from all over the ideological spectrum -- each of whom wants their way to be the way. It's also part of an even broader fight happening within the Democratic Party at the moment as activists and candidates navigate a post-Obama and post-Clinton landscape. At the presidential level you have Joe Biden, the former vice president as the ur-establishment figure while Bernie Sanders -- and a number of other candidates -- are offering a more liberal, outsider perspective. Pelosi, for her part, is matter-of-fact when it comes to the political realities facing the party -- and the challenges from liberals to move the center of gravity further to the left. ""As I say to my own district, 'You go out and elect 218 people, just like San Francisco, then we can talk,'"" she told USA Today."

UK lays groundwork to participate in European Parliament elections - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliza Mackintosh,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/uk/uk-brexit-european-parliament-elections-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) The British government has laid groundwork that would enable it to participate in the European Parliament elections next month, should the UK still find itself in the EU by the time the vote takes place.
The move signals a possibility that Brexit could be delayed beyond the May 23 election date -- nearly three years after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU -- locking the UK into participating in the European poll. But the Cabinet Office cautioned that taking the legal steps did not mean elections were ""inevitable,"" saying they would be canceled if the UK has quit the EU by the eve of the vote. ""It remains the government's intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before 22 May, so that we do not need to participate in European Parliamentary elections,"" a Cabinet Office spokesperson told CNN. Theresa May gambles it all in last-ditch bid to deliver Brexit ""As a responsible government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate."" Those steps include tabling the Day of Poll Order, which sets the date for elections to take place in the UK on May 23. Read More ""The Day of Poll Order provides Returning Officers with a date to hold potential European Parliamentary elections, but it does not make these elections inevitable, as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part,"" the Cabinet spokesperson said. Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Berlin and then Paris on Tuesday in a final bout of Brexit diplomacy ahead of an emergency EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday. Leaders of the remaining 27 EU member states are due to decide on May's request for a further extension to the Brexit process, to June 30, at the summit. Theresa May admits she can't pass her Brexit deal without Labour Unless the EU agrees to a delay, the UK will leave without a deal on April 12, a scenario that business leaders and economists have warned would trigger chaos. Having failed three times to get lawmakers to back her Brexit deal, May changed tactics last week to focus on winning support from the opposition Labour Party, a decision that has roiled the Brexiteer wing of her Conservative Party. The Prime Minister and Labour were in talks on Monday, staging a last-ditch effort to agree a withdrawal deal after negotiations broke down. A Downing Street spokesman told CNN on Monday that the Prime Minister wants to reach an agreement with Labour ""as soon as possible."""
'Fosse/Verdon' choreographs FX's latest look at old Hollywood - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/entertainment/fosse-verdon-review/index.html?utm_source=twitter_dangotest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_showbiz+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Entertainment%29,"(CNN) If concept and casting are half the battle, ""Fosse/Verdon"" earns a curtain call before the overture. Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams play director Bob Fosse and star Gwen Verdon, whose tumultuous relationship and partnership provides another delicious window into what amounts to an FX niche chronicling the big personalities of old Hollywood.
The allure of the subject matter is surely helpful, since this handsomely produced eight-part series -- which counts Lin-Manuel Miranda and daughter Nicole Fosse among its many producers -- gets off to a slow start, choreographing the story out of sequence, in a manner that's initially as disorienting as some of those scenes in ""All That Jazz."" Stick with it, though, and this limited series provides not only a fascinating snapshot of its time but of the unique qualities of the central duo's relationship, with Fosse wooing Verdon, cheating on her and divorcing her, but never losing his reliance upon her as a creative muse and confidant. The depth of that interaction proves vital, since Fosse alone represents a virtual cliché in terms of a tortured artist -- someone who can't sit through the premiere of ""Cabaret,"" his breakthrough film, muttering, ""All I see is the s**t I should have fixed."" Through quick-cut flashbacks, there are glimpses of Fosse as a performer, someone who dreamed of becoming Fred Astaire. He instead became a choreographer and director, meeting Verdon while devising her routines for ""Damn Yankees,"" after she won her first Tony Award. Read More Both were with other people at the time, a foreshadowing of things to come. In a way, though, ""Fosse/Verdon"" doesn't really begin to find its footing until the second and third episodes, proceeding to provide glimpses of their early lives, hardships and sacrifices that provide significant context. Until then, students of the era can simply enjoy the parade of stellar characters that pass through their orbit, in what feels like a fitting follow-up to FX's ""Feud: Bette and Joan."" Like that Hollywood yarn, this one is a virtual master class of name-dropping. The playbill includes writers Paddy Chayefsky (Norbert Leo Butz) and Neil Simon (Nate Corddry) along with Simon's wife Joan (Aya Cash), all of whom marvel at how Fosse can't seem to enjoy his success. There is also the spectacle of Fosse brazenly bedding actresses who are working for him, luring them to his place with transparent invitations to come watch a rough cut of his TV special. Those who balk risk losing roles, a demonstration of the way the casting couch openly operated during his heyday. Both Fosse and Verdon were titans on their own, but they clearly needed each other, even if they frequently appeared to be ""in competition,"" as one of their friends observes. In terms of the performances, it's a somewhat easier lift for Rockwell, a master of playing unlikable characters with roguish qualities, than Williams, who wrestles with Verdon's distinctive voice -- an element that serves as a bit of a distraction before settling into a deeper portrait. One device employed in ""Fosse/Verdon"" involves chyrons that refer to how much time -- years, days -- is ""left,"" without identifying specifically to what the chyron refers. It's a way of signaling, as the narrative flits about, the time the two had, while the greatest virtue in this limited series involves shining a spotlight on what they accomplished with it. ""Fosse/Verdon"" premieres April 9 at 10 p.m. on FX. "

Susan Collins of Maine last year, the Justice Department announced Monday.
A criminal complaint against Suzanne Muscara dated Friday accused the Maine woman of violating a federal law against mailing threats by sending a letter last October to Collins shortly after her vote in favor of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Court documents said Muscara's initial appearance was held in Bangor, Maine, on Monday afternoon and that Muscara was ""ordered temporarily detained"" with a preliminary hearing set for next week. Halsey Frank, the US attorney for Maine, announced Muscara's arrest and charging in a statement Monday morning, and an attorney listed in the federal court system for Muscara did not immediately return a request for comment. The statement from Frank's office said if convicted, Muscara ""faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine."" Read More Collins' office confirmed the arrest on Monday. ""Senator Collins and Mr. (Tom) Daffron greatly appreciate the extraordinary efforts made by state and federal law enforcement agencies which culminated in an arrest in this case,"" said Collins' spokeswoman, Annie Clark. Last October, Collins' spokesperson said Daffron, Collins' husband, ""received a threatening letter that the writer claimed was contaminated with ricin,"" a highly toxic substance. The complaint against Muscara cited FBI agent Michel Verhar, who said in an affidavit that an initial letter sent to Daffron said, ""Good luck to you and Susan in the next life"" and that the letter claimed to be coated in ricin, but that tests showed ""no hazardous materials were present."" Verhar said after the initial letter, a postal inspector was assigned to screen all mail sent to Collins' residence and that inspector observed ""a fine white powder"" leaking from an envelope addressed to Collins. Tests showed the envelope tested negative for toxins, according to Verhar, and contained a flyer inside that read, ""AnthRAX!!! HA HA HA!!!"" along with a stick figure ""with the letter 'X' for eyes, the tongue sticking out, and with 'You' and an arrow pointing at the stick figure face."" The FBI determined the white powder was starch and found a fingerprint that matched Muscara, whose prints were in the FBI's database after a 2013 arrest in Pennsylvania, according to Verhar. Verhar said he and another FBI agent approached Muscara last Friday, who waived her Miranda rights and told them ""she had sent an envelope by mail to Senator Susan Collins that contained a white powder"" and recalled ""using the word 'anthrax.'"""

The turnover among the President's so-called ""A-Team"" of senior level advisers is record setting: roughly two out of three. As for Cabinet-level jobs, almost one half have turned over so far. Stunning, I'd say. And the purge of the Department of Homeland Security leadership is equally remarkable. As for replacements for those no longer on Team Trump, there seems to be a presidential preference for ""acting"" leaders, no matter how crucial the jobs. Read More Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security ""I like acting because I can move so quickly,"" Trump said in January. ""It gives me more flexibility."" It also gives him no controversial confirmation hearings — for jobs like secretary of defense, homeland security and interior. Besides, Trump likes to run things himself. So why put anyone who might disagree in a position of power? As someone who has known Trump for decades reminds me, ""He never liked having anyone higher than the equivalent of a vice president"" in his own organization. Sure, some folks had titles, but as far as Trump was concerned, ""that didn't matter. They knew who was the boss."" But the boss operates on his very own chaos theory. It's not new to Trump, but its new to the Oval Office. And it's a disturbing -- even frightening -- way to govern. Trump's version of chaos, according to this longtime associate, ""has to do with his level of entertainment of himself. That means doing the opposite of what everyone suggests and then showing that I was right."" His instincts, this source says, ""are not well thought out or researched,"" but he has ""found this place of doing the remarkable unexpected thing and, at the end of the day, sometimes he gets lucky."" In his mind, at least. At the outset of the administration, even Trump thought he needed to learn the ropes. So he hired an insider like former Republican Party boss Reince Priebus to be his chief of staff, but that didn't last long. Trump doesn't like anyone else running things -- or even trying to run things. ""This is the voraciousness he has always had,"" says this source. ""But there's no loyalty. If you ever need him, you're finished...The minute you work for him, it's over. He lured you in so he can crush you."" And that's exactly what he does. That's why there's no deep bench in Trumpworld, just Trump, a few folks he made rich and his family. Consider what became of his casinos in Atlantic City, more specifically the Taj Mahal in 1990 -- the iconic demonstration of Trump dysfunction that has not changed in decades. ""Donald always operated with a very thin group,"" says Alan Lapidus, Trump's architect, adding there were about six people running the whole endeavor. When one-third of the slot machines were shut down because they didn't pass muster, it was chaos. ""It was a breakdown of monumental proportions,"" says Jack O'Donnell, one of Trump's casino managers. And what did Trump do to try and solve the problem? He decided to ""shame and belittle, and berate, and to threaten to fire, and demand firings in the midst of the chaos."" Gee, does that sound familiar? Allow me to spell it out: Immigration policy and border security aren't going the way he wants, and he decided to fire Kirstjen Nielsen, the head of the Department of Homeland Security. CNN's reporting recounts that she dared to oppose the President's desire to possibly reinstate the family separation policy or listen to Trump ideas on denying asylum that were potentially illegal. Presidents are supposed to be islands of calm in the middle of chaos. Not this one; he is the chaos. When the Taj Mahal was at a breaking point, says O'Donnell, ""what the place needed was calm, a clear thinker. And in the midst of chaos, Donald Trump could not provide that in any way."" Because that's not how he rolls -- not now, or in the past. ""Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something that no one ever expected him ever to say, upend the entire meeting, leave everybody agog...and control every situation that way. By the time he leaves the room ... he owns the store,"" says former Trump Organization Vice President Louise Sunshine. Yep, he owns the store. We are reminded of that every way, with every whim, with every flip flop on policy and personnel. And if he succeeds with one whim or idea, there's another that ""fuels the next absurdity,"" as the source who has known Trump puts it. ""He continues to believe that he has proven he is immune to consequences."" Yet there is one thing about chaos theory: Instability and turbulence can backfire. And it's those unintended consequences that can get you. Especially when you're not paying much attention."
"CNN sports anchor Coy Wire loses bet, dresses up as Tinker Bell - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Jodi Upchurch and Brandon Griggs, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/coy-wire-bet-tinker-bell-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) In his career Coy Wire has experienced countless wins on and off the field. He was a star running back at Stanford University. In the NFL, he became a team captain for the Buffalo Bills and the Atlanta Falcons.
But it's probably safe to say he's never before dressed up as Tinker Bell. For the second year in a row, the CNN sports correspondent made a March Madness bracket bet with Elizah, 4, the daughter of a family friend. Elizah picked teams based on the colors and mascots that she liked best. The bet? If Coy's bracket won, Bert Weiss, host of radio's ""The Bert Show"" -- and the boyfriend of Elizah's mom -- would post a ""man crush Monday"" photo of Wire every week for a month. If Elizah won, Coy agreed to dress up as her favorite Disney character. Coy Wire's daughter served as Tinker Bell's friend, Peter Pan. And that's how Wire -- a man of his word -- ended up wearing a green dress, a blond wig and angel wings, and holding a magic wand. Read More ""It just further shows that anything can happen in March Madness. That even a 4-year-old toddler can make better picks than a seasoned sports pro,"" Wire said in an interview. ""And that's why we all love Madness. That's why it's one of the greatest sporting stages in the United States."" Wire staged a Tinker Bell photo shoot and even enlisted the help of his 11-month-old daughter, Wrenn, to act as his Peter Pan. ""Being a new dad of a precious baby girl has made this the best year of my life,"" said the former NFL player, who anchors Bleacher Report segments and appears on CNN and HLN. ""Someday she will look back at this and have a good laugh!"" Wire says he's ready for another March Madness bet next year. The NCAA men's tourney wraps Monday night when Virginia meets Texas Tech in the final. Meanwhile, Wire predicts he and Elizah will have another rematch next year. They have each won once. ""So it almost sets up this epic trilogy,"" he said. ""In sports, there always has to be an equalizer, a grand finale."""
Will another 'bomb cyclone' hit the central US this week? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jennifer Gray,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/bomb-cyclone-blizzard-midwest-plains-wxc/index.html,"(CNN) While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter isn't over until it's over.
The potential is there for a "" bomb cyclone "" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less, two. Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week.

Blizzard vs snow storm explained 01:20 This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard-like conditions to the Plains on Wednesday. Winter storm watches are already posted for parts of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota. Arctic air will dive south, bringing frigid temperatures and possible blizzard conditions for portions of the Rockies, Plains and even Great Lakes. Up to 18 inches of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-50 mph in the Dakotas, along with white-out conditions. Thursday the bottom drops out Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop 40 degrees in just 12 hours. Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow. Ten inches of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis. While an April snowstorm seems like a punch in the gut, April snowstorms do happen. Just last year, the Twin Cities experienced their top April snowstorm with 15.8 inches of snow April 13-16, 2018. Air travel will be drastically slowed, and road travel will be treacherous. The snow is not the only hazard from the storm. In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee.
Tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are likely with some of the storms. The storm will exacerbate flooding concerns through the Midwest Additional flooding in the Plains by the weekend is likely. We've already seen significant flooding along the Red River because of melting snow. Now with additional rain and snowmelt, more flooding will be expected. In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the James and Elm rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding. Extreme weather The latest weather stories and extreme weather videos making headlines around the globe.
Any additional rain and snow will cause these rivers to rise even higher. There's also the threat of ice jam flooding through the weekend. Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry and stay."
'Fosse/Verdon' choreographs FX's latest look at old Hollywood - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/entertainment/fosse-verdon-review/index.html,"(CNN) If concept and casting are half the battle, ""Fosse/Verdon"" earns a curtain call before the overture. Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams play director Bob Fosse and star Gwen Verdon, whose tumultuous relationship and partnership provides another delicious window into what amounts to an FX niche chronicling the big personalities of old Hollywood.
The allure of the subject matter is surely helpful, since this handsomely produced eight-part series -- which counts Lin-Manuel Miranda and daughter Nicole Fosse among its many producers -- gets off to a slow start, choreographing the story out of sequence, in a manner that's initially as disorienting as some of those scenes in ""All That Jazz."" Stick with it, though, and this limited series provides not only a fascinating snapshot of its time but of the unique qualities of the central duo's relationship, with Fosse wooing Verdon, cheating on her and divorcing her, but never losing his reliance upon her as a creative muse and confidant. The depth of that interaction proves vital, since Fosse alone represents a virtual cliché in terms of a tortured artist -- someone who can't sit through the premiere of ""Cabaret,"" his breakthrough film, muttering, ""All I see is the s**t I should have fixed."" Through quick-cut flashbacks, there are glimpses of Fosse as a performer, someone who dreamed of becoming Fred Astaire. He instead became a choreographer and director, meeting Verdon while devising her routines for ""Damn Yankees,"" after she won her first Tony Award. Read More Both were with other people at the time, a foreshadowing of things to come. In a way, though, ""Fosse/Verdon"" doesn't really begin to find its footing until the second and third episodes, proceeding to provide glimpses of their early lives, hardships and sacrifices that provide significant context. Until then, students of the era can simply enjoy the parade of stellar characters that pass through their orbit, in what feels like a fitting follow-up to FX's ""Feud: Bette and Joan."" Like that Hollywood yarn, this one is a virtual master class of name-dropping. The playbill includes writers Paddy Chayefsky (Norbert Leo Butz) and Neil Simon (Nate Corddry) along with Simon's wife Joan (Aya Cash), all of whom marvel at how Fosse can't seem to enjoy his success. There is also the spectacle of Fosse brazenly bedding actresses who are working for him, luring them to his place with transparent invitations to come watch a rough cut of his TV special. Those who balk risk losing roles, a demonstration of the way the casting couch openly operated during his heyday. Both Fosse and Verdon were titans on their own, but they clearly needed each other, even if they frequently appeared to be ""in competition,"" as one of their friends observes. In terms of the performances, it's a somewhat easier lift for Rockwell, a master of playing unlikable characters with roguish qualities, than Williams, who wrestles with Verdon's distinctive voice -- an element that serves as a bit of a distraction before settling into a deeper portrait. One device employed in ""Fosse/Verdon"" involves chyrons that refer to how much time -- years, days -- is ""left,"" without identifying specifically to what the chyron refers. It's a way of signaling, as the narrative flits about, the time the two had, while the greatest virtue in this limited series involves shining a spotlight on what they accomplished with it. ""Fosse/Verdon"" premieres April 9 at 10 p.m. on FX."
Trump naming career Secret Service member to take over agency - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/secret-service-james-murray/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has chosen a ""career member"" of the Secret Service to be its new director starting in May, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced Monday afternoon.
Sanders' announcement of the selection of James Murray followed the news that Trump was removing the current director of the Secret Service, Randolph ""Tex"" Alles, amid a shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security. In her statement announcing the move, Sanders described Murray as ""a career member"" of the US Secret Service. A brief biography of Murray provided by the Secret Service said he is a New Jersey native who attended the University of Scranton and Seton Hall University before starting a career as an Army Reserve officer and a special agent in the Department of Transportation. Murray has been in the Secret Service since 1995, according to the biography, beginning in New York before joining the presidential protective division in 2001. He held various positions in the agency from there, including as a liaison to Congress, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Washington field office and the agent in charge of the agency's training center in Maryland. Read More Alles said in an email to Secret Service employees obtained by CNN that his incoming successor ""is a consummate professional"" and that he was confident in Murray, whom he referred to as the agency's assistant director of the office of protective operations. Murray wrote a letter to the National Park Service under that title last year requesting a closure for sidewalks under the Park Service's jurisdiction around the White House complex during a white nationalist protest that was scheduled to take place in Washington. Justice Department news releases in 2016 named Murray as a special agent in charge at the Secret Service's Washington field office, and repeated releases from the Justice Department showed Murray joining with federal officials in that role to announce sentences for people convicted of financial crimes in the Washington area. The announced choice of Murray contrasted with Trump's choice earlier in his presidency to name Alles, a retired Marine general and Customs and Border Protection official, to head of the agency responsible for the security of himself and his family."

The Netflix nature series premiered on April 5, and the dazzling footage has prompted some on social media to question whether computer-generated imagery was used to accomplish certain visuals. The producers have stressed that no computer enhancement was involved with the eight-part project, which features a central environmental message and is hosted by the venerable British naturalist David Attenborough. Nature documentaries have clearly upped their game, thanks in part to technological advancements and innovations. In the case of ""Our Planet,"" that included filming over the course of four years, in 50 countries, with over 600 crew members. The producers of ""Our Planet"" have attributed some of the rare or previously uncaptured footage, such as the calving of a glacier -- that is, huge chunks of ice breaking off -- to planning and preparation. In that case, they told Huffpost U.K . that the effort included setting up at the location with a team of six people who waited three weeks for something to happen. Read More "" allowfullscreen> Tom Hugh-Jones, the producer of another current nature series, National Geographic's ""Hostile Planet,"" noted in a recent interview with CNN that the proliferation of streaming services and appetite for international content have created ""a huge market"" for such documentaries, which at one point were the near-exclusive province of the BBC. Hugh-Jones added that producers start out with a plan for each program but usually spread their resources across multiple locales, realizing that some will deliver the kind of spectacular footage that viewers have come to expect and others won't pan out.

Facebook and Google will face Congress over white nationalism - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Donie O'Sullivan,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/tech/facebook-youtube-white-nationalism/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Representatives from Facebook and Google will be on Capitol Hill Tuesday to face questions from lawmakers about how their platforms are used by white supremacists.
The hearing, which is being held by the House Judiciary Committee, comes just a few weeks after a terror attack in New Zealand that was streamed live on Facebook. Fifty people at two mosques were killed in the attack. The representatives from the two big tech companies' policy teams will appear on an eight person panel that will also include representatives from civil rights groups such as the Anti-Defamation League, and Candace Owens of the conservative group Turning Point USA. Google has received criticism for the role online search plays in spreading hateful ideologies, but its video sharing site YouTube has increasingly been slammed for hosting such content and its algorithms surfacing it. The New Zealand attack ""underscores the urgency"" of addressing the white supremacy problem on social media, Kristen Clarke, the head of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told CNN Business. Facebook says it's policing its platform, but it didn't catch a livestream of a massacre. Why? The attack, Clarke said, is ""exhibit A in how violent white supremacists abuse the Facebook platform to promote their dangerous, fatal activities."" She will be part of the panel testifying on Tuesday. Read More The mass shootings in New Zealand highlighted two key challenges for the social media platforms: The way in which they are used to spread extremist ideologies and rally people to those ideologies, and how people who commit violence on behalf of those extremist ideas use the platforms to promote their actions. Two weeks after the massacre, Facebook announced that it would ban all ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on Facebook and Instagram. Previously, the company had banned white supremacy, but had viewed white nationalism differently. The company said it had decided to ban white nationalism after months of consultation with civil rights groups. Neither YouTube nor Twitter have enacted similar blanket bans of white nationalism but both companies say they have policies to fight hate and the incitement of violence on their platforms. Despite investments in human moderators and artificial intelligence, Facebook failed to interrupt the video stream of the mass murder as it was streamed live. Facebook and YouTube said they spent the days after the attack removing millions of reuploads of the video. Facebook said it had stopped the upload of 1.2 million versions of the video, but that 300,000 copies had made it onto the platform and were later removed. A statement from the House Judiciary Committee said Tuesday's hearing ""will examine hate crimes, the impact white nationalist groups have on American communities and the spread of white identity ideology. The hearing will also foster ideas about what social media companies can do to stem white nationalist propaganda and hate speech online. """
A firefighter ran a half marathon while wearing 50 pounds of gear to make a point about his job - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Michelle Lou and Brandon Griggs, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/firefighter-gear-half-marathon-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Running a half marathon is hard enough. But one Pennsylvania man did it while wearing 50 pounds of firefighting gear, including an air tank.
Firefighter Ryan Robeson ran 13.1 miles Sunday in boots, a turnout coat and pants, a hood, gloves, a face piece and a helmet. In addition, he wore a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) cylinder, which rescue workers use to breathe when in dangerous air. Robeson, 28, ran the race in his native Scranton to bring attention to the demanding work firefighters do -- and to try to set a Guinness World Record. ""This was to raise awareness for how hard firefighters work and the stress that's put on their bodies,"" Robeson told CNN Monday. ""The half marathon yesterday is probably equivalent to what a firefighter goes through on a really intense day."" Robeson, a firefighter in York, Pennsylvania, is no stranger to strenuous tasks. He's also competed in the Spartan Death Race , a grueling competition that combines a marathon with an obstacle course.

He first worked as an engineer after college but hated sitting in a cubicle and wanted something more active. His dad was a firefighter and the profession was always something he had in the back of his mind. Last September, he applied to set a Guinness World Record for running a half marathon in full firefighter gear. When Guinness approved his application, they set three and a half hours as the time for him to beat. After months of training, Robeson finished the Scranton Half Marathon in 3:36:11, missing a record-setting time by a mere 6 minutes.

I had worked so hard and was close to it, and just came up a little bit short."" During the marathon, the firefighter had a team that helped him with logistics such as switching out his air tank, which ran out about every mile. But with two miles to go in the race, Robeson knew his pace wasn't fast enough to get the record. ""In the end, I gave everything I had,"" he said. But he reached another goal Still, Robeson surpassed his fundraising goals. He raised $5,800 for two worthy causes: Foundation 58, which helps rescue workers with cancer, and Operation Unite Scranton, a joint project between Scranton's fire and police departments to provide winter coats to children in need. Robeson said he is considering another attempt at setting the world record. ""Right now I'm a little beat up,"" he said.

"Iran's Revolutionary Guards, explained - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Tamara Qiblawi,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/middleeast/iran-revolutionary-guards-explainer-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The United States put Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist groups on Monday. The unprecedented move against another country's armed forces is bound to rachet up tensions with Tehran. Here's what you need to know.
What is the Revolutionary Guard and what does it do? The IRGC is an elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country's revolution in 1979. The unit is at the forefront of Iran's military operations in the region -- it has a significant presence in Iraq and Syria, where its troops and advisors have played a major role in the fight against ISIS , and have sometimes been within miles of US military positions. There are more than 150,000 troops in the IRGC, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. These include ground forces, naval and air forces, as well as intelligence and special forces. Their primary role is internal security but experts say that the group -- considered Iran's dominant military force -- assist Iran's regular army, which has roughly 350,000 soldiers, with external defense. Trump backs Netanyahu, but will voters? Your guide to Israel's elections Read More In 2009, the Guards' Basij branch -- one of five IRGC subgroups-- cracked down hard on anti-government demonstrations in the wake of a contested election, helping to secure the position of hardline then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The Revolutionary Guard chief, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, reports to directly to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is not only Iran's most powerful military institution, it holds deep influence over domestic politics and the economy, with interests extending to and beyond the construction, telecommunications, auto and energy industries The IRGC and the United States The Revolutionary Guards have long been in the crosshairs of successive US administrations. In 2007, the US Treasury Department designated the Quds Force -- a Revolutionary Guards unit in charge of foreign operations -- as a supporter of ""terrorism,"" describing it as Iran's ""primary arm for executing its policy of supporting terrorist and insurgent groups."" After US President Donald Trump took office, he withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and set about clamping down on Tehran's influence in the Middle East, re-imposing a strict sanctions regime that was designed in part to curb the influence of the Guards. US allies in the region also consider the Revolutionary Guards a major security threat, and Bahrain and Saudi Arabia added the IRGC to their terror lists last year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently railed about the Guard's military activity in the region. Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the IRGC's Quds Force. The US claims that the Revolutionary Guards' presence in Syria -- where it helps support the armed forces of the Syrian government -- is a direct threat to Israel. ""Under the cover of the Syrian war, the IRGC is now trying to plant military roots in Syria and establish a new strategic base to threaten Syria's neighbors such as Israel,"" Brian Hook, the State Department's special representative for Iran, told reporters last Tuesday. Hook also said that Iran was responsible for the deaths of at least 608 US service members in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq. ""This accounts for 17 percent of all deaths of US personnel in Iraq from 2003 and 2011. This death toll is in addition to the many thousands of Iraqis killed by the IRGC's proxies,"" he added. What impact will the terror designation have on Iran and the rest of the region? Experts believe the designation could bring the US and Iran ever closer to a direct military confrontation and dash any hopes of reviving talks over the 2015 nuclear deal. The move had also been met with internal resistance in the Trump administration because of concerns about US troops in the Middle East. ""The impact (of the terror designation) could be a heightening of barriers to dialogue with Iran,"" said Al Monitor Associate Editor Mohammad Ali Shabani. ""It displays an ambition by proponents of confrontation with Iran to restrict Trump's deal-making instinct, and also to make it as difficult as possible for the next US president to engage with the Islamic Republic."" The designation also risks impacting US relations with countries in the region that have direct relations with the Iranian government, including Lebanon and Iraq, where Shia-led armed groups are supported by the IRGC and are represented in the governments of those countries. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend the group photo at the Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East on February 14, 2019 in Warsaw, Poland. ""In the shorter term, (the terror designation) also represents an attempt to impose an 'either with us or against us' approach to several governments in the region, namely Lebanon and Iraq,"" said Shabani. Revolutionary Guards chief Jafari has already promised retaliation. ""If reports prove to be true that the stupid US administration intends to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization, then the IRGC will also specify the US army as a group (and target) like [ISIS] in all parts of the world, especially the Middle East,"" the commander was quoted as saying in the semi-official Fars News agency. The Trump administration's move has already drawn praise from Israel, one of Iran's biggest regional rivals. On Monday, Netanyahu tweeted, ""Thank you for responding to another one of my important requests, that serves our interests and the interests of regional countries."""
Uganda kidnapping: US tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott freed from abductors,rss.cnn.com,"Susannah Cullinane, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_africa/~3/6_UXG_tJyJk/index.html,"(CNN) It was Kimberly Sue Endicott's dream to go on an excursion to see gorillas in their natural habitat.
That dream looked more like a nightmare last week when the California woman and her tour guide were kidnapped in a Ugandan national park, taken by gunmen who later used their hostages' cell phones to issue ransom demands. But the ordeal ended Sunday when Ugandan security forces rescued Endicott and her Ugandan guide, Jean Paul Mirenge. They were freed unharmed from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders the Queen Elizabeth National Park -- the scene of their abduction during a game-watching drive Tuesday evening. Four other people taken at the same time were previously released, officials said. Abducted US tourist and guide rescued in Uganda, officials say Endicott is from Orange County and lives in Costa Mesa, working as an esthetician there, CNN affiliate KABC reported Thursday. Read More Endicott's friends told KABC that she had been enthusiastic about her trip to Uganda. One -- neighbor Pascale Douglas -- said that hearing the news that her friend had been abducted was like a ""punch to the gut."" ""She had mentioned when I met her one of her big dreams was to go see the gorillas,"" Douglas told KABC. ""At the time she asked me if it was something I would consider doing also, but time went by and she ended up going on her trip."" Friends were elated at the news of Endicott's release, said Andrea Glasgow, who worked with Endicott at Platino Salon and Suites. ""Everyone was overjoyed that she was returned safely and that no harm came to her,"" Glasgow said. ""Everyone was very concerned at our work for her safety."" Sandy Benton, who said she was formerly Endicott's hairdresser and has known her for 8 years, was ""very happy"" she was rescued. ""I can't imagine what she is going through. I hope she is coming home soon,"" Benton said. ""She has a love for animals. She has always been like that."" Freddie Medina and Shawn O'Hearn work at an advertising design company a couple doors down from Endicott's office. ""We are relieved she is safe,"" O'Hearn said. ""It's crazy,"" said Medina. ""You just don't think this would happen to someone so close to you."" Kimberly Sue Endicott, right, and her tour guide after their release. Armed gang demanded a ransom Ugandan police said Thursday that an armed gang had kidnapped Endicott and her guide, and made frequent demands for a ransom of $500,000 using their victims' cell phones. Police had said they would not offer the money. Ugandan security forces eventually rescued Endicott and the guide, although officials released few details about how the rescue unfolded. Endicott at Ishasha Wilderness Camp after her rescue. ""Both were rescued from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are safely back in Kanungu district in Uganda,"" government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said Sunday. Endicott arrived in the Ugandan capital of Kampala on Monday. Mike Rourke, the manager of Wild Frontiers Uganda, told CNN that Endicott was in the custody of personnel from the US Embassy. Wild Frontiers is the tour company Endicott was with when she and her tour guide were kidnapped. Opondo said the kidnappers fled the scene of the rescue when law enforcement officers and soldiers moved in. A US defense official told CNN that the US military had provided support to Ugandan security forces. The support included intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets and liaison officers, the official said. Uganda's Minister for Tourism Ephraim Kamuntu said in a televised address Sunday that authorities had been ""under pressure"" over the abduction. ""We can now put the anxiety to rest,"" he added. Kamuntu praised communities near the park where Endicott was taken, saying: ""The media and the communities surrounding the national park were cooperative and sympathetic. They helped the security operatives in rescuing the abducted tourist and driver."" 'A quiet and peaceful' handover A ransom was paid to free Endicott and Mirenge, a source with knowledge of the exchange told CNN on Sunday. The handover was ""quiet and peaceful,"" the source said.

'Fosse/Verdon' choreographs FX's latest look at old Hollywood,rss.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/kKVzmACJO7k/index.html,"(CNN) If concept and casting are half the battle, ""Fosse/Verdon"" earns a curtain call before the overture. Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams play director Bob Fosse and star Gwen Verdon, whose tumultuous relationship and partnership provides another delicious window into what amounts to an FX niche chronicling the big personalities of old Hollywood.
The allure of the subject matter is surely helpful, since this handsomely produced eight-part series -- which counts Lin-Manuel Miranda and daughter Nicole Fosse among its many producers -- gets off to a slow start, choreographing the story out of sequence, in a manner that's initially as disorienting as some of those scenes in ""All That Jazz."" Stick with it, though, and this limited series provides not only a fascinating snapshot of its time but of the unique qualities of the central duo's relationship, with Fosse wooing Verdon, cheating on her and divorcing her, but never losing his reliance upon her as a creative muse and confidant. The depth of that interaction proves vital, since Fosse alone represents a virtual cliché in terms of a tortured artist -- someone who can't sit through the premiere of ""Cabaret,"" his breakthrough film, muttering, ""All I see is the s**t I should have fixed."" Through quick-cut flashbacks, there are glimpses of Fosse as a performer, someone who dreamed of becoming Fred Astaire. He instead became a choreographer and director, meeting Verdon while devising her routines for ""Damn Yankees,"" after she won her first Tony Award. Read More Both were with other people at the time, a foreshadowing of things to come. In a way, though, ""Fosse/Verdon"" doesn't really begin to find its footing until the second and third episodes, proceeding to provide glimpses of their early lives, hardships and sacrifices that provide significant context. Until then, students of the era can simply enjoy the parade of stellar characters that pass through their orbit, in what feels like a fitting follow-up to FX's ""Feud: Bette and Joan."" Like that Hollywood yarn, this one is a virtual master class of name-dropping. The playbill includes writers Paddy Chayefsky (Norbert Leo Butz) and Neil Simon (Nate Corddry) along with Simon's wife Joan (Aya Cash), all of whom marvel at how Fosse can't seem to enjoy his success. There is also the spectacle of Fosse brazenly bedding actresses who are working for him, luring them to his place with transparent invitations to come watch a rough cut of his TV special. Those who balk risk losing roles, a demonstration of the way the casting couch openly operated during his heyday. Both Fosse and Verdon were titans on their own, but they clearly needed each other, even if they frequently appeared to be ""in competition,"" as one of their friends observes. In terms of the performances, it's a somewhat easier lift for Rockwell, a master of playing unlikable characters with roguish qualities, than Williams, who wrestles with Verdon's distinctive voice -- an element that serves as a bit of a distraction before settling into a deeper portrait. One device employed in ""Fosse/Verdon"" involves chyrons that refer to how much time -- years, days -- is ""left,"" without identifying specifically to what the chyron refers. It's a way of signaling, as the narrative flits about, the time the two had, while the greatest virtue in this limited series involves shining a spotlight on what they accomplished with it. ""Fosse/Verdon"" premieres April 9 at 10 p.m. on FX."

John Marzulli, Public Information Officer for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York confirmed Mack's plea, which was entered Monday. As part of her guilty plea, Mack admitted to state law extortion and forced labor. Attorneys for Mack did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mack was arrested in April 2018 and charged for her alleged involvement with an organization called Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ium), a group that claimed to be a self-help program but was, in reality, a pyramid scheme in which some recruits were exploited ""both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,"" according to U.S. attorney Richard P. Donoghue. Read More Mack is accused of recruiting women to join what she told them was a female mentorship group when, in fact, it was an organization created and led by Nxivm's founder, Keith Raniere, also known within the group as Vanguard. Last year, Mack, best known for her role as Clark Kent's clever confidant Chloe on CW's ""Smallville,"" was indicted on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy, according to a statement released by the Justice Department. She pleaded not guilty at the time. Officials said Mack, 36, was the co-creator of a program within Nxivm, which was targeted toward actors. What happened to Allison Mack? Mack's charges stemmed from what officials said were activities that took place as part of a secret society within Nxivm called ""DOS,"" in which women recruited and groomed others under false pretenses to be sexual partners for Raniere, according to an indictment. Several women, whose identities were withheld in court papers, claim they were blackmailed into complying and told DOS had compromising information about them. Raniere was the sole male in DOS and the leader. He has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Until women recruited others, they were called ""slaves."" Those who successfully recruited were called ""masters."" The indictment released last year claimed many so-called slaves were branded on their pelvic areas using a cauterizing pen with a symbol which, unbeknownst to them, incorporated Raniere's initials. Mack was released on a $5 million bond days after her arrest last year. Marzulli and Mack's attorneys did not respond to CNN's questions regarding whether Mack's plea was entered as part of a deal with prosecutors.

Last month, PSG somehow managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory against Manchester United in the Champions League. Fast forward to Sunday and the French club had been widely expected to be basking in the glory of its sixth Ligue 1 title in seven seasons. Instead all the talk after a 2-2 draw with Strasbourg -- ensuring PSG's title celebrations were put on ice -- was arguably the worst miss in the history of football courtesy of Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. With the score at 1-1, Choupo-Moting's teammate Christopher Nkunku had produced a wonderful piece of skill to chip Strasbourg goalkeeper Matz Sels and his shot looked to be rolling harmlessly over the line. Then Cameroon international Choupo-Moting needlessly took a touch and somehow diverted the ball onto the foot of the post from less than a yard out to prevent his side from regaining the lead.

That's 78 more cases than the number reported last week and includes cases reported to the CDC by state health departments as of April 4; it therefore does not include cases reported since then. Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts and Nevada reported their first cases of measles this year, bringing the total number of states reporting cases to 19. The other states that have reported measles cases this year are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington. The total number of measles cases nationwide this year ""is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000,"" the CDC says. That threshold was reached last week when the national total for the year surpassed last year's total of 372. The largest outbreak was in 2014, when there were 667 cases reported nationwide due to several large outbreaks.

Indiana health officials reported the first case of measles there on Friday. Massachusetts health officials also reported that state's only 2019 case last week. Washington state reported 78 cases in an outbreak that began in January. That includes individuals in Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and Georgia who all became infected in Washington.

""Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn and Rockland County ,"" the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene website says. According to case counts from local health departments, at least 468 cases of measles have been reported in the state since October as part of this outbreak. On Monday, the New York City health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, ordered all yeshivas, which are Orthodox Jewish schools, in Williamsburg to prohibit unvaccinated students from attending. In December, Barbot issued the same order for yeshivas in affected parts of Brooklyn. Also on Monday, Rockland County Executive Ed Day released a statement to ""vehemently disagree"" with a judge's order issued late Friday that prohibits the county from enforcing a ban put in place last month barring unvaccinated children from public places. The ban was established in an effort to contain the outbreak there. ""I absolutely do not agree with the judge's opinion that this measles crisis does not rise to the level of an emergency, when, in fact, we are facing the longest lasting current outbreak in the nation, and the largest outbreak in New York State in 30 years,"" Day said in a statement.

These firms have an outsize influence on Corporate America. The SEC needs to regulate them - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Radhakrishnan Gopalan, Todd Gormley and Todd Milbourn for CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/perspectives/proxy-advisory-firms-sec-regulate/index.html,"Radhakrishnan Gopalan is a professor of finance at Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis. Todd Gormley is an associate professor of finance there, and Todd Milbourn is the Hubert C. & Dorothy R. Moog professor of finance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.
Increasingly, investors are relying on proxy advisory firms to help them decide how to vote their shares during shareholder meetings. The research these firms provide can help a pension fund decide whether to vote its shares in favor of appointing a certain board member, or an asset manager to vote her stake for or against a corporate takeover.
But the proxy advisory industry's rapidly growing popularity poses a problem. The industry is currently dominated by two key players — Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis — giving these firms immense power over some crucial votes in Corporate America. The growing reliance on this industry and the concentration of power within it has increased calls for greater regulation. Indeed, the SEC needs to regulate proxy advisers and require more transparency and accountability from the industry. Proxy advisers' booming growth is thanks to a 2003 SEC rule that requires institutional investors to disclose and offer a rationale for their votes in shareholder meetings. Often, institutions, particularly smaller ones with fewer assets under management, find it more cost-effective to use proxy advisers' recommendations to justify their votes than to have an in-house research department that analyzes and offers recommendation on proposals. Proxy advisers belong to a class of institutions that produce financial research for investors, which include auditors, credit rating agencies and security analysts. These industries tend to be dominated by a few key players (Moody's, S&P and Fitch in the credit rating industry, for instance) because of how expensive it is to set up shop — which deters new entrants.

Why the US would never win a trade war with China
An important disciplining device that keeps these institutions on the straight and narrow is their focus on reputation. When institutions do a poor job (inflated ratings or voting recommendations based on sloppy analysis, for instance), their ultimate concern becomes about tarnishing their reputation. And that concern gets greater the more one has to lose — i.e., the large market shares with fat profit margins associated with a concentrated industry. This focus on reputation deters competition, as the market is less likely to trust new, potential ""fly-by-night"" operators that lack these incentives. Read More Research on the credit rating industry shows that increased competition isn't always beneficial for investors. The same could be true for the proxy advisory industry if increased regulation pushes the industry toward greater competition. But there are areas where the entire industry could benefit from stricter oversight. The first is in terms of proxy advisory firms' recent foray into corporate governance consulting, which is a troubling trend. This new line of business provides potentially significant conflicts of interest, i.e., hire us to consult on your governance, and you will get favorable recommendation on your shareholder proposals. Such conflicts of interest are not new. They arose when auditing firms branched into consulting, which contributed to the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals and subsequently leading to regulation prohibiting such practices. The SEC needs to use its power to eliminate such conflicts of interest. That might entail forcing the proxy advisors to divest their consulting businesses altogether. The second area the SEC needs to regulate is in ensuring greater transparency about the rationale for these advisers' recommendations. This will serve two purposes. First, companies often complain that proxy adviser recommendations are based on faulty data. Whether these complaints are legitimate or simply reflect companies' unhappiness with the adviser's recommendation is unclear. But what is clear is that greater transparency will allow companies to more easily challenge faulty data, if it exists. Second, greater transparency will shed light on whether proxy advisory firms are using a ""one-size-fits-all"" policy to arrive at their recommendations. For example, advisers may think that classified boards — wherein not all directors are due for election in a year — is bad for shareholders, and because of this, always recommend against proposals that classify a board. But, research shows that optimal governance arrangements are often much more nuanced and that one size does not fit all. Greater transparency will allow firms to challenge recommendations based on such policies and put forth their arguments as to why their case is unique. Given the ever-increasing reliance on the few players in the proxy advisory industry, we believe we are past due for some increased oversight, accountability and transparency in this space."
Chuck E. Cheese will be a public company again - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Danielle Wiener-Bronner,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/chuck-e-cheese-public-trnd/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Chuck E. Cheese has been quietly making a comeback. Now the company thinks it's ready to show off to Wall Street.
After going private five years ago, Chuck E. Cheese will be public once again. The chain's parent company is merging with a publicly traded acquisitions firm. That combined company will start trading under the CEC symbol on the New York Stock Exchange this year. Over the course of the past five years as a private company — out of the view of investors who expect consistent profit growth — CEC Entertainment has made significant investments to its menu, stores and entertainment to help modernize the brand. It replaced tokens with RFID cards and introducing an ""all you can play"" model that lets parents pay for entertainment by time. Like other food chains, Chuck E. Cheese has also launched a loyalty program and partnerships with delivery platforms so that kids can eat Chuck E. Cheese food at home. Those improvements have paid off. Sales at CEC stores — which include Chuck E. Cheese and the smaller Peter Piper Pizza — open at least a year grew 3.3% in the fourth quarter of last year, the company reported, and are projected to grow 7.7% in the first quarter of 2019. Read More Now, the plan is to ""continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in the next stage of our company's evolution,"" CEC CEO Tom Leverton said in a statement announcing the merger. The brand will remodel stores, introduce new products and continue to expand internationally. The chain, which is owned by Queso Holdings, will merge with Leo Holdings. ( LHC ) Once the deal goes through, Leo will change its name to Chuck E. Cheese Brands Inc. ""This is a perfect time for Chuck E. to get back into the public market,"" Leverton told CNN Business. As a private company , the chain was able to make changes without worrying about quarterly improvements, he noted. ""We could take a little bit more of a long-term view on some of these big-ticket dollar spends,"" he said. CEC's leadership team will continue to run the business once the deal closes. Leo CEO Lyndon Lea called Chuck E. Cheese a ""part of Americana,"" and said that CEC is ""extremely attractive acquisition."" Lea noted that the company has continued to perform well even in economic downturns. There are more than 600 Chuck E. Cheese stores globally. CEC also owns over 140 Peter Piper Pizza locations in the United States and Mexico. Apollo Global Management will remain CEC's largest shareholder — it owns about 51% of the company."
Obama's 'circular firing squad' remarks may not persuade 2020 Democrats - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Nayyera Haq,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/obamas-circular-firing-squad-remarks-may-not-persuade-2020-democrats-haq/index.html,"Nayyera Haq is a host on SiriusXM Progress and CEO of an international communications firm.

View more opinion articles at CNN .
(CNN) In Berlin, the city famous for once dividing itself in two with a wall, former President Barack Obama tackled the issue of division in politics and his worries for the Democratic Party's future: ""Among progressives in the United States ... is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be.'"" Obama argued, at an Obama Foundation event on Saturday, that party infighting usually leads to the weakening of a movement by ""creating what's called a 'circular firing squad' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.""
Nayyera Haq He's not wrong when it comes to the traditions of governing in a democracy, where, as he put it, you have ""to take into account people who don't agree with you."" Democrats, who represent the party of diversity, have historically been challenged when it came to herding cats in their coalition, even as the public discourse has been one of tolerance for a variety of ways to help working families. But the Democrats' Big Tent is teetering as the party sees its left flank publicly bucking leadership to primary their own seated members. The Twitter takedown — a harsh online reckoning meted out for those who stray from the performance of progressivism — has translated into a very real takedown in the field. The goalposts for campaigning have shifted since Obama's era, leaving the former President and his cohort grappling with a party that might not nominate him today. The purity test Obama references is not an easy points system to navigate. It is one in which your past behavior is always up for scrutiny and weathering the test of time is not a virtue. It's the same system that rallies feminists against both Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Sen. Al Franken, with the former gaining the Supreme Court because Republicans don't hold the same standards, and the latter resigning in disgrace because of criticism from his fellow Democrats. And now this scorecard is being used to ding two people close to Obama — his own former vice president, Joe Biden, who just can't seem to stop touching people and then cracking jokes about it ; and one of Obama's earliest supporters and current aenator, Kamala Harris, whose record as a prosecutor supporting ""three strikes"" laws has called into question her ability to confront racism in the criminal justice system. Read More Being the anti-Trump isn't enough for Democratic candidates The rise of the progressive left is just as much a reaction to Republicans as it is to Obama. The millennials who grew up under Obama don't see the election of a black man to the White House as earth-shattering, it is simply the reality of how they grew up. What millennials do see is crippling student loan debt that prevents them from becoming homeowners , a social safety net they pay into but may be bankrupted by the borrowing of older generations, and incarcerations for weed smoking but not for rape . This cohort has come of political age with the reality of being the first generation that possibly will not out-earn their parents and a wealth gap the likes of which our country hasn't seen since the 1920s. These progressives blame incrementalism — the willingness to compromise around the edges — for their current plight. They see in Obama a president who had the health care policy of Mitt Romney, the foreign policy of John McCain, and the rhetoric of Reagan and still could not get Republicans in Congress to work with him. The next president: the polar opposite of Trump? We can debate what the rise of the tea party has done to the norms of our democracy, but this generation is looking at Republicans as a model for success in achieving core policy objectives: seating judges across the board who will reject any social engineering, passing tax cuts that benefit corporations and the top 1% of the country, limiting women's abortion rights in dozens of states, and implementing draconian immigration policies. While this iteration of the Republican party has made no gains in battles for civility or kindness, it has won the war of changing the landscape of the country. It is no surprise then that progressives are looking to think like Democrats and play like Republicans when it comes to eliminating corporate welfare, changing gender norms, and correcting for systemic racism. This is not the era of the beer summit , where a Democratic leader can respond to a black intellectual elder getting arrested for trying to get into his own house with a diplomatic coming together of both sides. This is the era of ""both-sides-ing"" being The Problem. Lines have been drawn for the 2020 nomination and progressive voters are not looking for compromise; they are looking for the nominee who will take no prisoners. The challenge in following the tea party's example of gaining seats or a nomination is converting enough people to the cause to make governing viable without making millions of people miserable in the process. Tradition holds that an elected official is responsible for representing all of their constituents and governing accordingly; Trumpists have taken the easy way out and thrown those traditions of civil society out the window.

Progressives have an opportunity to be better — to be diplomats and not destroyers — but the work of peace-building and stabilization is much harder than tearing things (and people) down. By holding true to basic principles of equal opportunity and access; by accepting that people don't wake up woke but evolve; by bringing the passion for politics to new voters, Democrats have the opportunity to bring people along with them to implement progressive social change."
"Sen. Amy Klobuchar raises $5.2 million for White House bid, campaign says - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Fredreka Schouten,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/amy-klobuchar-first-quarter-fundraising-numbers/index.html,"WASHINGTON (CNN) Sen. Amy Klobuchar raised more than $5.2 million in the first seven weeks of her presidential bid, the Minnesota Democrat's campaign announced Monday.
Her fundraising haul appeared to edge her just past another senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Cory Booker, who raised about $5 million. But Klobuchar, now in her third Senate term, ranks behind the early leaders in fundraising -- led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who collected $18.2 million during the first 41 days of his campaign, and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who raised $12 million in the first quarter. Klobuchar's fundraising also lagged behind that of former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, who entered the race more than a month after the Minnesotan and collected $9.4 million in just 18 days. He benefited from an enormous donor base built during his 2018 Senate bid. His strength as a small-dollar fundraiser helped him collect a record-smashing $80 million on his way to losing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Klobuchar coasted to re-election in Minnesota last fall and ended her Senate campaign with more than $3 million in leftover funds. Those reserves helped her start April with $7 million remaining in the bank. Two other Democratic contenders have announced how much money they have remaining in their bank accounts: Sanders with $28 million and Booker with $6.1 million. Read More The fundraising totals offer an early snapshot of the financial strength of candidates in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump in the general election. Some of Klobuchar's fundraising has included higher-dollar events where she raised money for both the primary and general elections. Money raised for the general election would not be available to her until she received her party's nod. Her campaign's news release did not break out how much money specifically was raised for the primary. ""Since that snowy day we launched in February, the outpouring of support has been incredible,"" Klobuchar said Monday on Twitter, referring to her outdoor campaign announcement in the middle of a Minnesota snowstorm. She said her campaign had received donations from every state. With at least 17 contenders already declared and others waiting in the wings, no Democratic candidate is posting record-breaking totals. Democrat Hillary Clinton, for instance, raised an eye-popping $47.5 million during her first quarter of the 2016 presidential race. Given the intense competition for the nomination in 2020, candidates' ability to draw in new, small-dollar donors who can contribute repeatedly will be a key test of their staying power ahead of the Iowa caucuses, which are nearly 10 months away. Klobuchar's aides said she attracted nearly 100,000 online donors with an average online donation of $40. In addition, 85% of all donors contributed less than $100, her campaign said. Klobuchar did not disclose how many people in total contributed to her campaign. In the news release, her campaign aides said Klobuchar's bid would be ""homegrown"" and emphasized that she already has visited 10 states and met with ""thousands of voters"" in her fight for the nomination."

Judge blocks policy forcing some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/asylum-seekers-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration's policy of returning some asylum seekers to Mexico to await their immigration court hearing, delivering a major blow to the administration just a day after the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign.
The preliminary injunction from Richard Seeborg of the Northern District of California is slated to go into effect nationwide on April 12. The Migrant Protection Protocols program, informally known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" was initially rolled out at the San Ysidro port of entry in January. Nielsen recently ordered that the policy be expanded along the southern border in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants to the border. Up to 400 people have been returned to Mexico under the policy, according to a DHS official. 'I don't want to return to Mexico, your honor': Asylum seekers make their plea to immigration judges READ: Judge's order blocking 'remain in Mexico' policy Seeborg found that the provision on which the government was relying was never intended to permit the return of asylum seekers to Mexico, and even if it did, the current screening procedures were not adequate, Melissa Crow, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement. Read More ""Today's victory is especially important amidst reports that the Trump administration is planning to move toward even more extreme immigration policies,"" Crow said. ""The decision will prevent incredibly vulnerable individuals from being trapped in dangerous conditions in Mexico, but it's only a step in a much larger fight."" The White House immediately criticized the ruling. ""A liberal activist judge in San Francisco ruled the United States and Mexico can't work together to address asylum issues at the border.

— Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) April 9, 2019 Trump has fumed over the legal challenges that have kept his administration from implementing a series of controversial policies. It's almost become so common that Trump publicly griped about the challenges his national emergency declaration would face. ""We will have a national emergency and we will then be sued,"" Trump said in the Rose Garden in February. ""We'll possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling, and then we'll end up at the Supreme Court and hopefully we'll get a fair shake."" A judge also blocked the administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy that resulted in the separation of parents and children. Senior administration officials told CNN that in the last four months or so, the President has been pushing Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy. In February, a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups asked a federal judge for a restraining order that would block the so-called Remain in Mexico policy. Eleven migrants who are seeking asylum in the United States and were returned to Mexico under the policy are also plaintiffs in the case. If the ruling takes effect, the government will have two days to allow those 11 migrants into the US. Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security Some have already attended their first hearing in removal proceedings at the San Diego immigration court.

Trump's latest Iran decision sets a dangerous precedent (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jonathan Cristol,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/trump-irgc-terrorist-organization-dangerous-precedent-cristol/index.html,"Jonathan Cristol is a research fellow in the Levermore Global Scholars Program at Adelphi University and senior fellow at the Center for Civic Engagement at Bard College.

(CNN) On Monday, President Donald Trump formally designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). This designation will do nothing to limit the IRGC's malign activities, but it may criminalize the activities of millions of Iranians and foreign tourists -- and set a precedent that Washington may come to regret.
According to the White House statement, this is the first time that the US has designated a unit of a foreign government as a ""terrorist organization."" In response, Tehran has already designated US Central Command as a terrorist organization. And it's not hard to imagine other adversarial governments designating American individuals or military units as ""terrorists"" for political reasons. Jonathan Cristol For background, shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Ayatollah Khomeini established the IRGC as a parallel military to Iran's ""regular"" military. The existing military could not be dismantled, both because putting over 400,000 armed Iranians out of work was clearly a bad idea, and because the old guard knew how to operate advanced American and European military equipment. So, Khomeini created a new military, with its own army, navy and air force -- and a distinct set of responsibilities. This parallel military would be loyal to the Islamic Government, rather than to the Iranian people. Over time, according to a Congressional Research Service report, the IRGC permeated Iran's economy. It now owns businesses ranging from construction firms to shipping companies to shopping malls and bazaars, some of which are already subject to US sanctions. In 2017, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo estimated that the IRGC might control 20% of Iran's GDP, but the actual number is unknown . Read More Iran's Revolutionary Guards, explained Inside Iran, it is difficult to avoid doing business with the IRGC, IRGC-controlled or IRGC-linked entities. The White House's Monday statement says that, ""If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism."" Does this apply to a produce vendor who rents his stall from an IRGC-linked bonyad (a cross between a charitable foundation and a private equity fund)? What about the vendors' customers, who might be Iranian locals or foreign tourists? Are all visitors to Iran now responsible for determining the precise ownership of every hotel, restaurant and store that they patronize? The designation of the IRGC as an FTO will also do little to reverse Iran's influence in Iraq. But it will make life more difficult for American forces and diplomats in Iraq, which is why many inside the State Department and Defense Department have opposed this decision. And while the United States may not work directly with Iran in Iraq, the two states have a shared interest in ensuring that ISIS does not reemerge and that other radical groups do not gain a foothold. Even if the United States has accounted for this necessity in how it intends to use this designation, if Iraqis need to choose between doing business with the United States, or doing business with Iran -- and risk the US accusing them of ""material support for terrorism"" -- they may well decide to maintain a good relationship with the regional power that isn't going anywhere, rather than with a Washington that seems eager to withdraw from the region. Foreign Minister Zarif's risky gamble wins the Iran deal more time Moreover, Shia militias trained by and connected to the IRGC are now being integrated into, and paid by, the Iraqi government. IRGC-Quds Force commander Qassam Soleimani is a frequent visitor to Baghdad. In short, the Iraqi government officials have little choice but to work with the IRGC. Of course, it's critical to acknowledge that the Iranian government uses the IRGC to spearhead its most malign actions across the Middle East. Thus far, the IRGC has helped to establish and support Hezbollah in Lebanon. It aids Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It fights on behalf of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and supports the Houthis in Yemen. And it is responsible for the deaths of dozens of American soldiers in Iraq. At home, its Basij militia attempts to violently suppress protests, and its businesses and entities distort the local economy. The United States does need to counter the IRGC -- and it has already acted appropriately by sanctioning dozens of individuals and entities connected to, or part of, the IRGC. Sanctions allow the US to target those individuals and entities directly responsible for actions to which we object -- and while they impact the broader population, they do not make them susceptible to criminal charges.

And if the Trump administration thinks that it is easy to avoid dealing with the IRGC, I'd suggest it ask the Trump Organization , which, according to the New Yorker, worked with an IRGC-linked family on a building in Azerbaijan. The building suffered major damage in an April 2018 fire, and the story was quickly overtaken by the myriad other Trump administration controversies. Maybe now the House of Representatives can, in the spirit of Monday's designation, investigate American firms that may knowingly have done business with the IRGC -- starting with the Trump Organization."

"Children who live near major roads are more likely to have developmental delays, study says - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Susan Scutti,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/highways-children-cognition-study/index.html,"(CNN) Highways often cause parents to worry about their children's physical safety, yet there may be other important concerns. Young children who live near a major roadway are twice as likely to score lower on tests of communications skills than those who live farther away, new research indicates.
""We know that living close to major roadways -- interstate highways or state highways -- is associated with high air pollution,"" said Sandie Ha , lead author of the study and an associate professor in the Department of Public Health at the University of California, Merced. Research has shown that children who lived near a major roadway at birth had lower nonverbal IQ, verbal IQ and visual motor abilities in mid-childhood compared to their peers living farther away. Because many children in the United States live near major roadways -- estimates suggest that 30% to 45% of people residing in large North American cities live within 0.3 miles of a highway or a major road -- Ha and her colleagues wanted to learn more about links to childhood development. Prenatal exposure to air pollution linked to autism risk, study says Their analysis included more than 5,000 children who underwent repeated screening with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire , an evaluation of five areas of development: fine motor skills, large motor skills, communication, personal social functioning and problem-solving ability. Along with measuring proximity to major interstate and state highways -- not local, neighborhood or rural roads -- the researchers estimated each child's exposure to ozone and fine inhalable particles (PM2.5), two pollutants produced by car traffic. Ozone can affect the lungs, causing the muscles in the airways to constrict. Fine inhalable particles , which are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair, cause lung irritation and in some cases lead to respiratory and heart problems. Read More About 23% of the children (1,329 kids) failed any of the five domains tested by the questionnaire, the analysis showed. Psychosis in teens may be linked to an unlikely culprit: air pollution ""We found that living closer to a major roadway such as an interstate highway or a state highway is associated with almost two times the risk of having a communication delay by the time the baby is 3 years old,"" Ha said. ""Closer"" was defined as less than 500 meters (about 0.3 miles or half a kilometer), compared with those living more than a kilometer (or 0.6 miles) from a major roadway, she explained. ""We also found that exposure to high concentration of air pollution, especially ozone, during pregnancy as well as during early life is also associated with the risk of having any developmental delay,"" Ha said. The research, published Monday in the journal Environmental Research, did not show cause and effect. Prenatal exposures to elevated levels of PM2.5 led to a possible 3.2% higher risk of failing any developmental testing domain, while higher-than-usual ozone exposure led to a possible 1.7% higher risk of failing a domain. Slashing fossil fuel use could save millions of lives at risk due to air pollution, study says ""It seems that the postnatal exposure is even more important than the exposure during pregnancy,"" Ha said. Babies exposed to higher concentrations of ozone had about a 3.3% higher risk of failing any domain of the developmental screening at 8 months, a 17.7 % higher risk of overall screening failure at 24 months and a 7.6% higher risk of overall screening failure at 30 months. ""We are not sure why that's the case,"" she said. She and her co-authors speculate that once the baby is born, air pollution is no longer filtered through the mother's superior defense mechanisms. ""This study didn't specifically measure that, so we cannot say why, and I'm really interested in the why part,"" Ha added. What remains to be answered is: How does air traffic pollution produce developmental delays? More research is needed, she said. Because the study was conducted in upstate New York, which has relatively low air pollution, Ha wonders whether the effects would be stronger if the same research were conducted in areas of the country with higher pollution levels, such as central California. Due to wildfires, California now has the most polluted cities in the world Breda Cullen, a lecturer in the Institute of Health and Wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, said the strengths of the study include the large number of participants and the use of different types of exposure data (both proximity to a major road and measures of pollutants). However, Cullen, who was not involved in the research, added that the authors did not account for all of the sociodemographic factors that may influence child development. ""Had they been able to take these into account, the strength of the association between road proximity and child development is likely to have reduced,"" she wrote in an email. Because pollution exposures for most kids are, at worst, not far from average, the measurements used by the researchers more or less inflate the appearance of a small risk increase, she explained: ""Even the tiny risk increases they report would only be observed in participants at the most extreme end of the exposure spectrum."" In her own research, Cullen has found that higher exposure to outdoor particulate matter and nitrogen oxide gases was associated with very small reductions in performance on tests of reaction time and memory among middle-age and older adults.

Traffic intensity in cities means pollution there may be similar in ways to pollution found near a major road outside the ciy. Still there are differences, Cullen said: ""They are not interchangeable, however, because cities tend to have many other sources of air pollution in addition to road traffic."" Other sources of pollution include waste incineration and tobacco smoke. Ultimately, the increases in risk reported in the new study are ""extremely small,"" Cullen said. Even so, Ha said, ""given that the proportion of people exposed to this risk factor is large, it is very important to do something about it."""
Half the women are gone from Trump's Cabinet - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/trump-women-cabinet-gone/index.html,"(CNN) He's had three national security advisers, three chiefs of staff and three attorneys general and he hasn't even been in office for three years. One other result of the chaotic churn in President Donald Trump 's Cabinet is that he has fewer women -- down to just three.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out over the weekend because her boss wanted a more hardline immigration policy. The repercussions of her departure have already led to what one source described to CNN's Kaitlan Collins as a "" near-systematic purge "" at the agency that oversees immigration and the nation's borders, among many other things. It comes after the announcement less than two weeks ago that Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon is leaving her position to join Trump's outside political group . McMahon, who made a fortune as the executive in charge of the WWE, which at one point featured Trump, will stay in his orbit as she tries to raise money for the super PAC that will try to help him win reelection. The current commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Kevin McAleenan, will temporarily take on the duties of homeland security secretary. It's not clear who will take over for McMahon. They were preceded by UN Ambassador Nikki Haley , whose position has gone unfilled since her departure months ago. Read More Depending on who permanently replaces Nielsen and McMahon, Trump will have just three women sitting at the table for Cabinet meetings. Haley's UN position -- one that has been filled by a succession of women -- was downgraded, leaving 23 Cabinet-level positions. Counting the vacated roles, that leaves women as just 13% of Trump's Cabinet-level officials, a lower percentage than either Barack Obama or George W. Bush and the lowest in decades , according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. It's not clear that the remaining women in Trump's Cabinet are in any danger, though Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been under scrutiny recently for her department's short-lived proposal to cut funding for the Special Olympics, which briefly put her on the wrong side of Trump. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- and CIA Director Gina Haspel, Trump's replacement for his now-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, are the other two. Turnover in top positions But the shrinking number of women in Trump's Cabinet is just one symptom of the remarkable changeover among his top staffers, something that's been chronicled throughout his presidency . He's had five communications directors, for instance, which is not a Cabinet-level position but has been a central role for previous White Houses. That position is currently vacant, essentially filled by Trump and his Twitter feed. There is also not currently a permanent chief of staff, supposedly the president's right hand, and a position that does not require Senate approval, although it does have Cabinet rank. Reince Priebus came first, the Republican insider who lasted a little more than six months in the role. John Kelly lasted longer, a year and half, from July of 2017 through the end of 2018. Rather than give his successor the title outright, Trump made Mick Mulvaney, who is still technically the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a sort-of promotion to acting chief of staff. A deputy of Mulvaney's is now acting OMB director. Acting leaders And that's another key theme of Trump's presidency. He'll fire or push out a Cabinet secretary who frustrates him and then wait months to nominate a permanent successor, even in crucial roles. That's what happened with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the nation's top lawyer. Trump pushed Sessions out of the role after more than a year of venting his frustration that Sessions had recused himself from the Russia election interference investigation. The President waited a month to nominate William Barr in Sessions' place. At the Pentagon, Patrick Shanahan has been acting secretary of defense for nearly four months and it's still not clear if Trump will nominate him as a permanent replacement . Turnover in national security, diplomacy positions Shanahan isn't the only key national security official to be left hanging. Trump forced out his first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , who he routinely disagreed with on policy, and elevated his then-CIA director, Mike Pompeo. His first defense secretary, James Mattis, wrote a letter outlining his opposition to Trump's plans to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan . The mainstay of Trump's national security team is Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, although he has publicly disagreed with Trump. Who's left the Trump administration? Working closer to the President on a daily basis is his national security adviser, which is also not a Cabinet role but is key to national security policy. Trump's had three. Michael Flynn was fired after he lied to Vice President Mike Pence. H.R. McMaster left after policy disagreements with the President. Now in the role is John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk who has disagreed with Trump on Syria. Nielsen herself had been on thin ice with Trump for months even though she had defended his controversial positions, like separating the children of undocumented immigrants from their parents at the border. She had been brought to the role by her predecessor, Kelly, a former Marine who left his position as homeland security secretary to become Trump's second chief of staff, before being supplanted by Mulvaney. Trump has already had more turnover among his Cabinet in a little more than two years than recent presidents have had in four years, according to research by Brookings. That turmoil extends to top staffers in government who are outside the Cabinet. On the website outlining top leadership for the Department of Homeland Security , for instance, which is the umbrella agency in charge of everything from border policy and immigration enforcement to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Secret Service, there are 14 ""acting"" or ""vacant"" positions. And that's not including Nielsen or Secret Service Director Randolph Alles, who are on their way out. Trump has said he might prefer to keep some of these positions open because, as he said in January, it gives him more "" flexibility ."" But he hasn't chosen a single woman for an acting Cabinet secretary role yet."
14 tons of pangolin scales seized in Singapore in a single smuggling bust,edition.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/asia/singapore-pangolin-smuggling-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Authorities in Singapore have seized one of the largest ever shipments of pangolin scales en route to Vietnam, worth an estimated $38.7 million.
In a statement , customs officials said they inspected a 40-foot container passing through Singapore from Nigeria and labeled as ""frozen beef."" Inside was over 14 tons of pangolin scales, packed in 230 bags, along with almost 180 kilograms (around 400 pounds) of cut up and carved elephant ivory. Fourteen tons is around the same weight as two to three African elephants, or around eight Toyota Camrys. A scale-covered, cat-sized nocturnal mammal that survives on ants and termites, pangolin are among the most trafficked animals in the world. In China and Vietnam, they are eaten as a delicacy and used in traditional medicine, with their keratin rich scales believed to have a host of positive benefits -- including aiding breastfeeding and curing asthma or cancer -- none of which is supported by science. Pangolin scales seized by customs officials in Singapore this month. This demand has put multiple pangolin species on the endangered list , with the Chinese Pangolin listed by the International Union for Conservation as ""critically endangered,"" one step above being extinct in the wild. Read More All eight pangolin species are protected under national and international laws, but smuggling pangolin scales and meat remains highly lucrative and efforts to crack down on the trade have had limited success. For some Indian farmers, pangolin poaching is too lucrative to resist In India, which has a domestic pangolin species, the scales from a single pangolin can provide a ""life-changing sum of money"" for people living in some of the country's poorest communities. The pangolin's defense mechanism against predators -- rolling itself into a scaly ball -- unfortunately makes it easy prey for human hunters. Pangolin poaching is illegal in India, but is nevertheless widespread in Assam, a state in the country's northeast, near the border with Myanmar and China. A single pangolin can be worth a year's salary for hunters, making prevention difficult. Poaching also occurs in Africa, which has four native species of pangolin. The animals are also hunted for bush meat. Scales are often seized as they pass through major Asian shipping hubs such as Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which have stepped up efforts to crack down on illegal animal smuggling. In February, authorities in Hong Kong seized $8 million worth of smuggled endangered species in one of the biggest busts the city has ever recorded. The haul included 8.3 tons of pangolin scales and 2.1 tons of ivory, also from a shipment of supposed ""frozen beef"" from Nigeria."
Zhang hearing exposes Secret Service weaknesses at Mar-a-Lago - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/secret-service-mar-a-lago-zhang/index.html,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) The Chinese national Yujing Zhang's hearing in a Florida federal courthouse Monday afternoon highlighted missteps by the Secret Service at virtually the same time news broke that the Secret Service director was being fired.
In all, it amounted to a bumpy afternoon for the agency that protects the President. As word spread Monday that Secret Service director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was leaving, a Secret Service agent took the stand to testify about the woman who had allegedly gained unauthorized access to President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club on March 30 and could be engaged in a spying operation. Zhang faces two criminal charges, for lying and for entering the restricted grounds while Trump was there. She has not entered a plea and is being held in a Florida jail. The hour of court testimony Monday from agent Samuel Ivanovich, guided by Zhang's defense attorney Robert Adler, revealed just how serious the security breach around the President that day had been. Read More Adler, through his questioning, prompted Ivanovich to admit the following details about the Secret Service's process with Zhang and at the private club. Malware began downloading automatically The Secret Service had confiscated a thumb drive (and several other electronics) from Zhang that she had carried into Mar-a-Lago. When an agent went to run an analysis on the drive, inserting it into a computer, it immediately began downloading a file. The Secret Service had called it ""malicious malware."" Woman accused of illegal entry to Mar-a-Lago had numerous electronic devices, thousands in cash It was ""very out of the ordinary"" -- an authorized download they had never seen before, Ivanovich testified. The agent looking at the drive immediately stopped analyzing it and shut down his computer when he realized what was happening. In a statement, a law enforcement official speaking on background said that anytime the agency does a forensic analysis on an electronic device, it is done in a controlled environment and on a stand-alone computer, not a Secret Service network computer. Those protocols were followed in this case, the official said. No video surveillance at Secret Service entry checkpoint Audio and video surveillance at Mar-a-Lago didn't catch Zhang's entrance to the club -- because those surveillance devices weren't used by the Secret Service at the entry checkpoint. They did check two passports she carried, though. Even 7-Eleven convenience stores have video cameras, the defense attorney pointed out. Did not record audio during interview When the Secret Service questioned Zhang at the agency's office after removing her from Mar-a-Lago, the agency videotaped her interview. But unbeknown to the agent who led the questioning, the office didn't record audio of the interview. The room where she was interviewed didn't have that capability. Audio recording capability, the agent had thought, was a standard practice in Secret Service offices. Mar-a-Lago staff determines who gets in The Secret Service appeared to rely on Mar-a-Lago staff to determine whether people should be admitted through the security perimeter into the club when the President was there, allowing for the issue of whether Zhang was related to a club member to arise, according to Ivanovich's testimony. It's up to a ""host committee"" to decide who accesses a site that's under Secret Service restrictions, the agent said. The President was not on the club grounds during the time Zhang allegedly attempted to enter. No protocol for flagging multiple phones The agency also didn't have a protocol to flag the amount or types of electronics Zhang carried with her -- even though one had malware that even an agent performing an analysis on the device found to be unusual. ""We don't deny someone for having so many cell phones. That's not a direct violation of our restricted access,"" Ivanovich told the judge. Zhang had four phones and other devices -- plus she left several more, including a radio signal detector, in her hotel room nearby. Trump is removing US Secret Service director Language barrier Zhang was clearly a Chinese national, with two Chinese passports, her first language Mandarin. But Ivanovich and others in the Secret Service took hours to bring in an available agent who spoke Mandarin and could help translate during her interview. The Secret Service spoke with her -- and she answered them -- in English during more than four hours of questions, Ivanovich said. Her facility with reading English and responses led them to believe she had no trouble with the language. But language, the Secret Service had said, had led to the confusion over her relation to a Mar-a-Lago member. Once the Mandarin-speaking agent was involved, he would speak with her to give her ""further understanding"" in the interview, Ivanovich said. Zhang used a translator in court on Monday to listen to the proceedings, but answered questions from the judge in English. The breach has led Democrats in Congress to ask for more information about security at Mar-a-Lago. The criminal complaint filed by prosecutors and the Secret Service against Zhang last week highlighted how a Mar-a-Lago beach club manager erroneously thought Zhang was related to a member. The President, whose family business owns the club, has called Zhang's entrance onto the property a fluke and said he wasn't concerned."
Pilots shouldn't have to battle their planes for control (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Les Abend,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/pilots-shouldnt-have-to-battle-their-planes-for-control-abend/index.html,"Les Abend recently retired after 34 years as a Boeing 777 captain for American Airlines. He is a CNN aviation analyst and senior contributor to Flying magazine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) For those who remember the original 1973 movie ""Westworld, "" it can seem that the possibility of machines going rogue may be close to reality. Yul Brynner played the robot Gunslinger, who started shooting humans after being infected by some unknown computer virus and suffering a program breakdown.
Les Abend Could a version of such human vs. machine science fiction happen with today's highly technological, automated airplanes? No doubt, the continuing saga of Boeing's 737 Max tragedies has raised such a concern, as it continues to create angst for anyone about to climb aboard a commercial jetliner. After two crashes in five months claimed the lives of 346 people, Boeing acknowledged the role of the 737 Max MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), which automatically lowers the nose to prevent an aerodynamic stall. Boeing has grounded the 737 Max and is cutting the production rate on the plane as the company works to return it to flight. Read More But the nagging question remains: Can I trust that the airplane I am about to fly is not going to override its pilots? Indeed, in some ways the 737 Max seems to have experienced a Westworld-like situation -- although the flaw that overtook the planes was not a computer virus. According to the preliminary accident investigation report , it appears a design flaw contributed to the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March. Let me explain. The larger and more powerful engines of the 737 Max had to be mounted farther forward on the wings. At lower speeds, the airplane has a greater tendency to pitch the nose up when pilots step on the gas. A higher pitch of the nose could potentially lead to an aerodynamic stall, meaning the airplane would no longer have enough lift to fly. JUST WATCHED Foreman: Early report shows plane dove at nearly 600 mph Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Foreman: Early report shows plane dove at nearly 600 mph 01:29 To prevent the airplane from stalling, Boeing designed the MCAS, which pushes the nose down automatically without input from pilots. This system is only active when pilots are hand-flying the airplane. But if MCAS receives a bad signal from a faulty sensor that the airplane is stalling when it's not, the nose keeps pitching toward the ground, overriding the pilot's input to do otherwise. Unfortunately, it only takes one faulty sensor to activate the system, and that's a major problem. This is unprecedented for Boeing. I have flown this manufacturer's airplanes for over three decades; their systems (electrical, hydraulics, etc.) always have at least one additional backup in case of failure. And none of the systems take complete control away from pilots. We call it redundancy in the airline world. Now it appears that before the Ethiopian Airlines crash , the pilots tried to rectify the erroneous activation of the MCAS with a checklist procedure that Boeing had recommended to all airlines after investigators found that the Lion Air crash was caused by similar circumstances back in October. But the checklist procedure failed to save the airplane, a contention I made early in the field investigation . In my opinion, fixing this catastrophic flaw will require not only a software update to revise how MCAS reacts, but also a hardware update to correct the lack of redundancy when only one faulty sensor can cause such tragedy.

Former NTSB official on final actions of pilots before Boeing plane crashed 02:27 Getting back to the original question of whether pilots will henceforth have to battle modern-day airplanes and their automated systems for control: The answer should be a resounding no. Although manufacturers have different philosophies, airplanes are designed to work with pilots, not against them. That said, the systems have to be designed properly: If they fail, pilots always must have the capability to safely land the plane without the automation. For the past couple of decades, my colleagues have often discussed whether automation degrades basic pilot skills. To be sure, automation has become increasingly reliable, and pilots have grown increasingly dependent on automation features because they are incorporated into standard airline operations. After a long red-eye, for example, many older and more experienced pilots find it safer to use the autopilot for the approach rather than hand-flying the airplane all the way to touchdown on the runway. Additionally, aspiring airline pilots are training with flight schools at unprecedented rates , and students may be funneled quickly to major airlines. The training is intense and usually specific to modern-day, automated cockpit technology. It's a necessary part of the learning process, but it only affords a relatively short period to focus on basic flying skills. Once the pilot trainee reaches the minimum threshold qualifications required by the airline, she or he can work as a co-pilot on a regional jet, becoming more immersed in the world of cockpit automation. JUST WATCHED Former analyst says Boeing mandate made him uncomfortable Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Former analyst says Boeing mandate made him uncomfortable 01:43 It should be incumbent upon the airline to design training that allows pilots the opportunity to maintain proficiency in hands-on flying. Some airlines have already incorporated such training into their recurrent curriculums. For example, before I retired from my airline last year, my last three recurrent training sessions in the 777 simulator involved a scenario of taking off, flying a visual traffic pattern, and landing back on the runway with no automation aids, no auto throttles, and no autopilot -- similar to the practice I performed as a student pilot in small airplanes. Although seemingly simple, the scenario involves basic flying skills that every pilot should practice. Regardless, we have to maintain the highest standards in safety, but accept the fact humans design these machines. And humans make mistakes, whether they are pilots or aeroengineers. Let's allow the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing time to ensure that the 737 Max can be flown safely. In the meantime, rest assured that your pilots are not in a perpetual struggle of man versus machine."
She lived for 99 years with organs in all the wrong places and never knew it - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/99-year-old-backward-organs-medical-oddity/index.html,"She lived for 99 years with organs in all the wrong places and never knew it By Sandee LaMotte, CNN Updated 7:10 PM EDT, Mon April 08, 2019
(CNN) On an early spring day in 2018, the faint smell of formaldehyde floating in the air, 26-year-old medical student Warren Nielsen and four of his classmates prepped a cadaver in the chilly dissection lab at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.
Similar groups of five gathered around bodies on the other 15 tables in the anatomy class, all eager to explore the mysteries of the human body they had seen only in textbooks.
The cadaver assigned to Nielsen's team was a 99-year-old woman who had died of natural causes. Her name was Rose Marie Bentley, but the students didn't know that then. To honor and respect the privacy of those who offer their bodies to science, no further details are given medical students about the person who had once inhabited the body lying on the silvery slab before them. Rose Marie Bentley, not long before she died and donated her body to science.
But as the students and their professors were soon to find out, Bentley was special, so special she deserved her own unique spot in medical literature and history books.
The reason? A condition called situs inversus with levocardia, in which most vital organs are reversed -- almost like a mirror inside the body. That, along with a host of other weird but wonderful abnormalities, made Bentley a sort of medical unicorn.
""I think the odds of finding another person like her may be as remote as one in 50 million,"" said assistant professor Cameron Walker, who teaches the Foundations of Clinical Anatomy class at Oregon Health and Science University. ""I don't think any of us will ever forget it, honestly."" 'This is totally backwards'
On this March day, the assignment was to open the body's chest cavity to examine the heart. It wasn't long before Nielsen's group began to question their fledgling medical knowledge.
""Her heart was missing a large vein that's normally on the right side,"" Nielsen said.
Bewildered, he and his team called the professors over and asked: ""Where's the inferior vena cava? Are we missing it? Are we crazy?""
""And they kind of rolled their eyes,"" Nielsen said, ""Like, 'how can these students miss this big vessel?' And they come over and that's when the hubbub starts. They're like 'Oh, my God, this is totally backwards!' ""
A typical body has a large vein called the vena cava that follows the right side of the vertebral column, curving under the liver and emptying deoxygenated blood into the heart.
Bentley's vein was on the left, and instead of terminating directly into the heart, which is typical, ""her vein continued through her diaphragm, along the thoracic vertebrae, up and around and over the aortic arch and then emptied into the right side of her heart,"" Walker said.
""Normally speaking, none of us have a vessel that does that directly,"" he added.
That wasn't the only irregularity Walker and his students found in Bentley's body.
Numerous veins that typically drain the liver and other parts of the chest cavity were either missing or sprouting from an unusual spot. Her right lung had only two lobes, instead of the standard three, while the right atrium of her heart was twice normal size.
""And instead of having a stomach on the left, which is normal, her stomach was on the right,"" Walker said. ""Her liver, which normally occurs predominantly on the right, was predominantly on the left. Her spleen was on the right side instead of its normal occurrence on the left. And then the rest of her digestive tract, the ascending colon, was inverted as well.""
The mutations in situs inversus with levocardia occur early, Walker explained, possibly between 30 and 45 days into the pregnancy. No one knows why.
The condition occurs in only 1 out of 22,000 babies and is invariably associated with severe congenital heart disease. Because of the heart defects, only 5% to 13% live past the age of 5; case reports mention one 13-year-old boy and a 73-year-old who at the time was the second-longest survivor.
But Bentley was an anomaly, one of the few born with the condition that didn't have heart defects, Walker said.
""That is almost certainly the factor that contributed most to her long life,"" he said.
And that, along with all her other exceedingly rare anatomical abnormalities, is what makes Bentley 1 in 50 million, Walker estimated. 'Mom would have been so tickled'
Rose Marie Phelps was born in 1918 in Waldport, a small town on the Oregon coast. The youngest child of four, ""she was babied,"" said daughter Patti Helmig, who at 78 is the oldest of her five children. ""She would admit she was spoiled.""
A hairdresser by trade, Bentley was always fascinated by science, Helmig remembered, and she believes her mother would have made a fine nurse if she had been given the opportunity to train.
""She volunteered during World War II for one of the nurse's aid corps,"" Helmig said. ""And she was thrilled when someone reached out to her about doing a study on smallpox survivors, which she had as a child."" Rose Marie Bentley with a big catch.
Despite chronic heartburn (which would have been explained by her unusual gastric anatomy), Bentley never showed any negative effects from her flip-flopped innards, said 76-year-old Ginger Robbins, the third of Bentley's children.
""We had no reason to believe there was anything like that wrong,"" Robbins said. ""She was always very healthy. She was always doing something, taking us to Campfire Girls, fishing, swimming. She was an excellent swimmer.""
The only clue anything might be unusual came when Bentley's appendix was removed, said 66-year-old Louise Allee, the fourth-born child and youngest of the daughters.
""The surgeon made a note that her appendix wasn't in the right spot when they took it out,"" Allee said, ""but never said anything to us. Nobody said a thing when they took her gallbladder out and did a hysterectomy, either.""
The decision to become a body donor began with Jim Bentley, Rose Marie's husband, but she too ""thought it was the greatest thing,"" Allee remembers.
""There was a poem that my dad found, and it was all about donating your parts,"" she said. ""You know, 'give my eyes to a man who has never seen the sunrise' and the like. He kept showing us the poem. It was really important to them.""
The poem, written by Robert Test, opens with the line: ""Give my sight to the man who has never seen a sunrise, a baby's face, or love in the eyes of a woman,"" and ends with ""If, by chance, you wish to remember me, do it with a kind deed or word to someone who needs you. If you do all I have asked, I will live forever.""
The couple's beliefs about donation made an impact. All three daughters plan to donate their bodies for research. Rose Marie Bentley, a one in 50 million gal.
Jim Bentley kept his promise and donated his body when he died of pneumonia more than a dozen years before his wife's death. His daughters know that he would have loved to have known about his wife's peculiar insides so he could have teased her about it.
""He also would have been tickled they could teach medical students something so different and really make some great use of her body,"" Allee said.
And what would Bentley have said about being a one in 50 million kind of gal?
""She would've just thought it was funny,"" Robbins said.
Allee agreed: ""She would have had a big smile on her face."" "
Adam Schiff rejects Michael Cohen bid for help delaying prison term - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Manu Raju,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/adam-schiff-michael-cohen/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff is signaling he has no intention of helping Michael Cohen's quest to delay his upcoming three-year prison sentence after attorneys for President Donald Trump's former fixer informed lawmakers he had just gained access to troves of new records and could provide even more information to investigators.
""I don't get involved in sentencing matters as a practice. I never have in Congress and that's been my policy,"" Schiff told CNN on Monday when asked about Cohen's request. Cohen's attorneys wrote last week to Democratic leaders of the committees where he testified in February and March, saying the President's former personal attorney needs to be ""readily accessible and immediately available"" to Congress in part because he was able to recently access a hard drive with 14 million files, consisting of emails, voice recordings and other information. Cohen's lawyers asked lawmakers to write letters outlining his cooperation during his public and private testimony as well as with the ""substantial trove of new information,"" something the attorneys could use to lobby authorities in the Southern District of New York for a delayed sentence. Lanny Davis, Cohen's attorney, told CNN on Monday that his client is asking lawmakers only to send letters to Cohen's attorneys stating his cooperation, adding that he is not asking the members of Congress to communicate with the courts. Read More Davis notes the letter ""did not ask members of Congress to communicate with the court or prosecutors nor imply any quid pro quo regarding Mr. Cohen's willingness to cooperate."" ""There is no doubt that Mr. Cohen's testimony, both public and private, has contributed substantially, with documents and other evidence, to triggering additional areas for investigation by law enforcement authorities and Congress,"" says the letter from Cohen's attorneys to lawmakers. Trump says he's not concerned with contents of Michael Cohen's hard drive Lawmakers who received the Cohen request include House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, who has yet to say whether he would agree to help. Cohen is scheduled to start his sentence on May 6 after he pleaded guilty to financial crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. His lawyers wrote in last week's letter that he had gained access only recently to the hard drive with millions of files that could be helpful to investigators. They also argued that Cohen's congressional testimony had demonstrated his cooperation both with congressional probes and the criminal investigations into Trump and his businesses. In his testimony earlier this year, Cohen accused his former client, Trump, of financial fraud and directing hush-money payments to women alleging affairs. ""We hope that this memorandum demonstrates that Mr. Cohen needs to be readily accessible and immediately available to provide ongoing assistance to Congress in order for it to fulfill its executive branch oversight responsibilities,"" the letter states. ""However, with 30 days left before he surrenders to prison, time is no longer a luxury he is capable of."" Schiff told CNN on Monday that he was nevertheless interested in receiving any new information from Cohen, regardless of his prison sentence. ""We continue to encourage Mr. Cohen to provide us any materials that he has that are relevant to our investigation,"" Schiff said. ""We will continue to do so and hope that he has additional information to offer."""
Cuban baseball group criticizes Trump move to cancel player deal - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Allie Malloy,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/white-house-cuba-baseball/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Monday canceled a deal that made it easier for Cuban baseball players to compete professionally in the United States -- a decision that swiftly drew criticism from the Cuban Baseball Federation.
The move rolls back another Obama-era effort aimed at warming relations between the two countries. The deal, reached in December, would have allowed Cuban citizens to play Major League Baseball without being forced to defect from the communist-run island and risk being banned from returning to the island. It also allowed the Cuban government to claim a fee from MLB teams that drafted Cuban players. ""The agreement with MLB seeks to stop the trafficking of human beings, encourage cooperation and raise the level of baseball. Attacks with political motivation against the agreement achieved harm (to) the athletes, their families and the fans,"" the state-run Cuban Baseball Federation said in a statement to CNN. The original agreement was helped by an Obama-era regulatory change that allowed US employers to hire Cuban nationals despite the 60-year-old US trade embargo against Cuba. During Barack Obama's second term, he attended an MLB exhibition game in Havana and efforts were made to open the door for Cuban baseball players to legally earn salaries. Read More The White House, however, argued Monday that the Cuban Baseball Federation is part of the Cuban government, which caused the deal to be nullified as trade with Cuba is banned. The Trump administration has reversed parts of the Obama administration opening to Cuba and blames Havana for the turmoil taking place in socialist ally Venezuela. National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement that ""The US does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society."" Marquis added that the administration ""looks forward"" to working with the MLB to ""identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents, and not as property of the Cuban State."" The MLB on Monday said they ""stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba."" The initial deal, which was expected to run through October 2021, allowed Cuban players to sign with clubs under rules similar to those for players from Japan and South Korea. Previously, players regularly paid criminal gangs to smuggle them from Cuba to third countries where they could sign as free agents. Players who were over 25 years old would be free to sign with organizations that paid a ""release fee"" to the Cuban club. Other players could sign minor league deals. The Washington Post first reported that the deal had been canceled."
Donald Trump's revolving door presidency - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/donald-trump-administration-departures-kirstjen-nielsen/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Remember back in 2016 when then-candidate Donald Trump pledged that ""I'm going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people?""
Who knew there would be so many! The removal of Kirstjen Nielsen as head of the Department of Homeland Security on Sunday night accounts for the 14th(!) member of Trump's Cabinet to resign, be fired or move on to another job. How does that compare to Trump's immediate predecessors? Barack Obama lost nine Cabinet secretaries in his first term; George W. Bush saw four Cabinet officials move on in his first four years. Trump has been president for 808 days. So And it's not just at the Cabinet level! According to Kathryn Dunn Tenpas at Brookings , a DC-based think tank, 66% of all senior-level staffers who came into jobs when Trump became President are now gone. That's nearly equal to the 71% attrition for Obama's entire first term -- and eclipses Bush's 63% rate. Trump, for his part, insists that his administration remains the hottest club in DC . Read More ""Everybody wants to work in this White House,"" he said soon after the 2018 midterm election . ""We are a hot country. This is a hot White House. We are a White House that people want to work with."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
The facts belie that claim. Not only has Trump suffered from record-setting numbers of departures in his Cabinet and senior staff, he has also struggled to fill those jobs with permanent replacements. Nielsen's planned replacement -- Kevin McAleenan -- takes over the job only in an interim role. Ditto the Defense secretary. And the Interior secretary. And the White House chief of staff. Is it possible that Trump is choosing not to fill some of the more junior roles within these departments under the belief that the government is bloated with unnecessary people? Sure! But it's hard to make that same argument when we are talking about the HEADS of massive government entities. Why the turnover? And the struggles to replace the people who go? Trump. He is someone who struggles to delegate decisions and, even when he does, often overrules his people -- publicly. That's, uh, not a great work environment. The Point : Trump views himself as the one indispensable cog of his administration. And he treats the people who work for him as interchangeable parts, usually of little value."
Eric Swalwell announces 2020 presidential bid - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/eric-swalwell-announces-2020-run/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell announced Monday that he is running for president, telling ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert that he believes the United States is in ""quicksand"" where Americans feel they are ""running in place and it is not adding up to anything.""
Swalwell has been contemplating a run for months. The California Democrat has made several trips to early nominating states like Iowa and New Hampshire, telling reporters that he sees a space for a candidate like himself in the race and hinted earlier this month that he was ""close to making a decision."" ""None of that is going to change until we get a leader who is willing to go big on the issues we take on, be bold in the solutions we offer and do good in the ways that we govern. I am ready to solve these problems. I am running for president of the United States,"" he told Colbert. Swalwell, who also filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Monday, added, ""Boy, did it feel good to say that."" Swalwell, 38, enters the race as a long-shot candidate in a crowded field of 17 other Democrats, many of whom have more national name recognition, electoral experience and campaign war chests. The field is also slated to get larger in the coming weeks: former Vice President Joe Biden's announcement is looming this month, along with possible entrances by Rep. Seth Moulton, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams. Read More Swalwell and his small team of political advisers began to make plans for an April announcement last month, telling a small group of early state operatives that the four-term congressman from the Bay Area plans to enter the race. Swalwell's planning got so specific that an aide close to the congressman told early state Democrats in March that he would announce his campaign on a late night show , according to those Democrats. Here are the Democrats who have said they're running for president ""I have already done a lot,"" said of his time in Congress and his presidential bid, ""but I can do more."" Swalwell will follow up his announcement with a frenetic week of campaigning. The first event will be a Tuesday town hall focused on gun control in Sunrise, Florida -- a few miles from Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the 2018 school shooting that left 17 people dead. Swalwell has made combating gun violence a focus for months and traveled to Iowa in December with Cameron Kasky, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and co-founder of March for Our Lives, the student activist group that grew out of the shooting. ""We should go big and be bold and expect in our lifetime that we can have background checks,"" Swalwell said at the Progress Iowa event in December. ""We can ban and buy back every single weapon of war. We can fund and study gun violence. We can take care of people with mental illness needs."" The congressman will then travel to Iowa on Thursday, South Carolina on Friday, his home district in California on Sunday -- where he will, according to an advisory, discuss his ""vision for the East Bay and America"" -- and Nevada next Monday. Swalwell has raised his profile in recent years by becoming a staple on cable television, especially to talk about investigations into the Trump administration. But he admitted in a December interview with CNN that a possible presidential bid against big-name politicians like Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders is ""daunting."" ""I don't want to do it half-assed,"" he said. ""I would want it to be a serious campaign that could be a winning campaign."""
Libya's UN-backed government condemns airport airstrike as 'war crime' - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliza Mackintosh,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/africa/libya-airstrike-tripoli-airport-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Tripoli's only working airport was targeted in an airstrike on Monday, as forces loyal to renegade Libyan general Khalifa Haftar continued their advance on the capital, ignoring international calls for a truce.
Mitiga airport, in the eastern quarter of Tripoli, was shuttered after it was attacked by Haftar's so-called Libyan National Army (LNA). Libya's United Nations-backed government, the Government of National Accord (GNA), quickly condemned the aerial bombardment, calling it a war crime. There is also fighting around Tripoli's international airport, 15 miles south of the city center, which has not been operational for years. The GNA admitted Monday that it temporarily lost control of the site to Haftar's fighters. ""Haftar forces attacked Tripoli four days ago, mainly from the south and got as far as controlling Tripoli international airport,"" a GNA official told CNN Monday. ""As of yesterday and today, Monday, Haftar forces have been pushed back and Tripoli secured."" The same official said militias from the coastal towns of Misrata and Zawia -- which are not under the GNA's direct control -- deployed troops to the capital as part of the counter-offensive against the LNA. Luggage trolleys lie in front of the gate of the Mitiga airport after it was attacked Monday. Read More Years of fighting among various militias in the war-torn country have reached a crescendo in recent days, as Haftar pushes to take control of the capital. The UN said that 3,400 people have been displaced in the upsurge of violence since Haftar ordered LNA forces to march on Tripoli Thursday. Twenty-one people have been killed and 27 injured in the conflict, according to Libya al Ahrar TV, quoting Libya's Ministry of Health. The UN and France made shows of support Monday for the GNA's leader, Fayez al-Sarraj, whom Haftar is seeking to unseat. The UN Secretary General's Special Representative, Ghassan Salame, met Sarraj in his office in Tripoli to discuss ways the UN Support Mission in Libya ""can assist at this critical and difficult juncture,"" UNSMIL said on Twitter. France, meanwhile, said that it wanted Sarraj to remain a ""key player"" in ongoing efforts to negotiate peace between the GNA and Haftar's forces. ""France would like Sarraj's government to remain a key player and to try and conclude the peace process negotiated in Abu Dhabi,"" a spokesperson for French President Emmanuel Macron told CNN. The European Union pleaded for a humanitarian truce on Monday, a day after warring parties ignored a UN call for a two-hour halt to fighting. US pulls troops from Libya amid a surge in violence Departing from the EU's prepared agenda to express concerns about Libya, the EU's top foreign policy official Federica Mogherini called for ""full implementation of the humanitarian truce to allow the civilians and the wounded to be evacuated from the city and to avoid any further military action and any further military escalation."" Emergency services have so far been unable to reach casualties and civilians amid the violence. Refugees and migrants in detention centers are particularly at risk, according to the UN. Clashes are affecting residential areas, trapping civilians, and fighting has damaged electricity lines, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement Monday. The flare in fighting in Libya forced the United States military to pull a contingent of its troops from the country over the weekend. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling on Haftar to stop the offensive. ""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,"" he said in a statement Sunday. In the eight years since Moammar Gadhafi was deposed and killed in the 2011 conflict, Haftar has been one of a handful of strongmen to take advantage of the nation's descent into disarray. Based in the city of Benghazi, Haftar wields control over much of eastern Libya, and has his sights set on Tripoli. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Benghazi last week for talks with Haftar to push for an international peace deal, but left empty handed. Following their meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya ""with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli."" The UN repeated Guterres' calls for a political solution on Monday."
How US border hardliners nudged out Nielsen - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-last-days-dhs/index.html?utm_source=The+Point+with+Chris+Cillizza&utm_campaign=24cccf64d2-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_04_08_02_31&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a4165679e3-24cccf64d2-74171921,"(CNN) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left Washington last Sunday for what was supposed to be a week-long trip to Europe. While there, Nielsen planned to discuss cybersecurity and terror threats with senior UK and Swedish government officials, and attend a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris -- providing her a temporary respite from the tense situation at the US Southern border, where a recent rise in migrant apprehensions had drawn the intense ire of President Donald Trump.
Instead, the trip proved to be a miscalculation on her part, one that began a week-long descent into limbo for Nielsen that ended with her abrupt resignation on Sunday evening after meeting with Trump in the White House. Nielsen did not resign willingly, a person close to her told CNN, but was under pressure to do so. Nor did she fight or plead to keep her job, the source said. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster exposes Trump's immigration crisis The resignation ends months of speculation over her possible departure. It also demonstrates the power of immigration hardliners inside the White House, including national security adviser John Bolton and senior adviser Stephen Miller, who, despite her defense of the administration's controversial policies, still deemed Nielsen insufficiently tough when it came to stemming the flow of migrants to the border. According to multiple administration officials, over the past few months it had become clear to many inside the White House that Nielsen had few allies left in the West Wing, particularly following last year's departure of chief of staff John Kelly, widely seen as her biggest advocate in the White House. Read More Nielsen butted heads with Kelly's replacement Mick Mulvaney. Miller openly complained about her to the President. She was also a target of Bolton's, according to four people familiar with their relationship. Bolton often criticized Nielsen for how she was handling immigration issues and had no hesitation about expressing his reservations openly in front of President Trump. Nielsen had no ally in the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner either, who has become more involved in immigration talks recently, according to one administration official. In a sense, Nielsen had become an island unto herself inside the West Wing, and the people who talk to Trump the most were openly against her. By early Sunday, Nielsen knew how the day would likely go and that she would likely be forced to resign, according to a source familiar with her thinking. Shortened Trip In the weeks leading up to her Europe trip, Nielsen had been increasingly on thin ice in the eyes of the President. She apparently did not realize how tenuous her standing was when she left for Europe, but once there quickly realized her mistake and abruptly returned after her first day of meetings in London. Nielsen hastily left to travel to the US southern border, where she visited three border regions, ending at a stop in Calexico, California, to join the President. Scramble inside the West Wing over Trump's threat to close the border During the week, Nielsen did interviews -- including on CNN -- to try and improve the President's souring view of her, a source close to Nielsen said, but to little avail. Last week, she also convened an emergency call with members of Trump's Cabinet to discuss migration at the border. ""We are going to treat it as if we have been hit by a Cat 5 hurricane,"" Nielsen said on the call, a participant told CNN. The call took White House officials by surprise, according to a person familiar with the matter. Neither Miller nor Trump cared for Nielsen's decision to treat the situation at the border as a hurricane, the person said. ""People were caught off guard"" by the Thursday call, they added. It appears Miller did not know what Nielsen was up to, a major problem according to this person. At the end of the day, the source said, Nielsen could not make Trump happy with her performance on the border. This source said Trump might as well name Miller as the next DHS secretary. ""He's the one driving the policy,"" the source added. Miller was also behind the sudden withdrawal of the nomination of Ron Vitiello for director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which caught both Congress and the Department of Homeland Security by surprise. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination was pulled, a person familiar with the news said. Nielsen's resignation also follows plans to cut aid to some Central American countries, marking a sudden reversal after Nielsen had, days earlier, visited Honduras to sign a regional compact agreement with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Tenuous relationship Trump hired Nielsen as DHS secretary, based on a strong recommendation from his former chief of staff John Kelly, but the President was rarely happy with her, a source told CNN. Despite Trump's displeasure, she remained in place thanks to Kelly's ability to divert some of Trump's anger over immigration away from her and onto others, like former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to one source. There was also no clear replacement lined up in the event of Nielsen's departure. A key moment came in May 2018, when Trump and Nielsen got into a lengthy, heated argument during a Cabinet meeting focused on immigration. Trump was furious with Nielsen, telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground, citing the law in certain instances, the source said. Nielsen increasingly pushed back when the President lashed out at her department for not doing more to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants. A senior administration official said that in recent days Trump and Nielsen had again clashed over the issue. He accused her of not doing her job, and she responded forcefully. Around the midterm elections in November, it was expected that Trump would ask Nielsen to resign. After the departure of Kelly as White House chief of staff, speculation increased that she would soon be following him out the door. But by last December, sources told CNN that Trump had warmed to Nielsen, at least temporarily easing the tension in an explosive relationship that was once seen as untenable. Trump soon began praising her repeatedly behind closed doors, which surprised officials who were used to hearing his frequent criticism of her. ""People overplayed this idea that Gen. Kelly was her protector and that after she left the White House, she would leave,"" said a former DHS official. ""The very active and leading role that she took on immigration, re-established her with the President in ways that maybe when General Kelly was still there wasn't possible,"" added the former DHS official. But it wasn't enough to mend their relationship. And over the past three months, the surge of migrants continued to rise despite a slew of aggressive immigration policies. Child Separations Under Nielsen's leadership, thousands of families along the southern border were separated, sparking an uproar across the country last year. Though it was the result of a policy implemented last year by Sessions, Nielsen was often cast as the face of family separations, and endured withering criticism as a result. While frustrated, one of the reasons Nielsen decided to stick it out was to repair her image, a source familiar with her thinking told CNN. Incoming acting secretary of Homeland Security 'not an ideologue or fire breather' Still, that policy and others that make it harder for migrants to claim asylum appear to have done little to deter migrants from journeying to the US-Mexico border. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who is taking over DHS in an acting capacity, warned late last month that the US was on pace to encounter more than 100,000 migrants in March alone, making it ""the highest month since 2008."" Relief and exasperation A source familiar with Nielsen's thinking told CNN Nielsen is taking this as a relief. Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable"" with Trump ""becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. In California on Friday, a senior administration official tells CNN, Trump told border agents he wanted them to stop letting people cross the border, despite the fact that Central American asylum seekers according to US law can do so. It's unclear what Trump will look for in a permanent successor. For now, he has named McAleenan, the current CBP Commissioner, as acting secretary. Nielsen leaves behind a bare bones department that not only oversees immigration issues but also cybersecurity, infrastructure protection, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""We had a Secretary who knew cyber, knew FEMA, knew immigration,"" said an administration official. ""Now you'll get someone who knows border and immigration, but may not know the rest of DHS."" ""Secretary [Nielsen] worked harder than any cabinet person I know of, but probably had the most difficult job,"" the official added. Asked about the mood at DHS following Nielsen's resignation, one DHS official told CNN there was, ""some exasperation,"" adding that the department doesn't ""have enough depth"" to fill longtime vacancies. ""We are losing leadership faster than we can get it confirmed or even hired permanently,"" the official said, noting the number of acting officials in place heading units inside the department. DHS has had at least three positions filled by people in an acting capacity in senior roles. ""Now this is going to cause a massive move up the chain everywhere and it's rare an acting executive permanently selects anyone for those jobs so we'll be without permanent leaders that much longer.""

China launches app to teach schoolkids 'belief in the party' - CNN,edition.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/asia/china-students-socialist-theory-app-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Kids in the United States may be busy playing Fortnite and Apex Legends, but their Chinese counterparts are getting into socialist theory.
At least that's the intention of a new app launched under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and the Communist Party's Young Pioneers association. According to the state-run Global Times , the new app and website is designed to help elementary and middle school-aged children ""learn about new socialist thought and Chinese classics as part of a campaign to consolidate their belief in the party and inspire them to be reliable socialist successors."" Lessons on the platform -- run by the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party -- include "" I am Chinese ,"" which introduces children to the country's ""56 ethnic groups living in harmony,"" and "" Building a well-off society ."" Another lesson explains how "" Grandpa Xi led us into the new era ,"" replete with illustrations of President Xi Jinping alongside smiling children. ""It is Grandpa Xi who led us into the new era!"" One of many lessons on the new People's Daily Junior platform for elementary and middle school-aged kids to learn about Xi Jinping Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics: https://t.co/ZQAZoTJtkn pic.twitter.com/OTCDI3Jm5Q
— 𝕛𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕤 𝕘𝕣𝕚𝕗𝕗𝕚𝕥𝕙𝕤 🇭🇰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 (@jgriffiths) April 8, 2019 Read More Global Times said the app was launched as part of a campaign begun in January by the Ministry of Education to ""allow students to better understand socialism in the new era through reading Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and classics President Xi has quoted in his speeches."" Its launch follows the success of Study Powerful Country -- Xuexi Qiangguo, also translated as Study the Great Nation -- an app designed for adults to better understand Xi Jinping Thought, launched earlier this year . That app -- nicknamed Xi's digital ""little red book"" after Chairman Mao's famous tract -- has shot up the app store charts , as all 90 million Communist Party members, as well as many employees of state-owned enterprises have been ordered to download it. In a notice issued to party members in Hunan province, promotion of the app was described as a mandatory ""ideological task"" for cadres around the country. Users can earn scores by reading articles about Xi and watching videos, something which has led many to attempt to hack the process , assuming that a high score could be beneficial down the line. One tool , hosted on the code-sharing site Github, promises to help users ""learn automatically"" on the app. Others meanwhile, have turned to more old-fashioned approaches. ""We were told we had to score at least 30 points a day,"" one official told the South China Morning Post . ""I can make that score just by leaving the phone open with the articles and videos turned on, though I have to adjust the settings to avoid a timeout."" This photo illustratration from February shows a phone app called ""Xuexi Qiangguo"" or ""Study to make China strong"" with an image of China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing. According to David Bandurski, an expert on Chinese propaganda at the University of Hong Kong, the app is part of a new approach designed to ensure that the party's message was getting through in the smartphone age. ""Once engagement with the app is enforced by administrative demands that it be installed and used, something that is already happening, the messages of the party become inescapable,"" he wrote in February . ""Gone are the days when you can simply ignore that stack of party newspapers in the corner of the office, or switch off the party's nightly newcast, 'Xinwen Lianbo'."" Both Study Powerful Country and the new app for kids build on a burgeoning cult of personality around Xi , which has seen him raised to a prominence and level of power no Chinese leader has held since Mao. While at times state media has appeared to wish to roll back this propaganda push -- dropping the use of Xi Dada, a nickname for the President -- it has ramped back up in recent months, as China prepares to mark a number of key anniversaries this year, including the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic."
How Kamala Harris' death penalty decisions broke hearts on both sides,edition.cnn.com,Kyung Lah,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/kamala-harris-death-penalty-decisions/index.html,"San Francisco (CNN) Senator Kamala Harris greets supporters along the rope line after a campaign rally. She hugs admirers, poses for selfies and warmly thanks person after person for attending.
Watching on her TV, Renata Espinoza stares and shakes her head. ""Is it the real you?"" Espinoza asks of the candidate on screen. ""Or is it not? We never saw that,"" she said. ""It upsets me because I see her doing that now, and I wish she would have done that back then."" Sen. Kamala Harris pauses for a selfie with supporters in Atlanta last month, one of many campaign stops. The ""back then"" is 2004, when Espinoza, her husband Isaac and Harris were all part of San Francisco's extended law and order family - Isaac Espinoza as a police officer and Harris as the city's newly elected district attorney. It was when Renata Espinoza became a widow and when the prosecutors' mantra of standing ""for the people"" suddenly became for her, and her murdered husband. Read More For Harris, she was on a crucial early rung of the professional and political ladder that would take her to today, becoming a top-tier candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Her time as a prosecutor helped to shape some of the policies on which she's now running as well as to give fodder to both her supporters and critics. One case is her attitude to the death penalty. While she's been consistent in her personal opposition to capital punishment, professionally she has both refused to seek it AND, as California attorney general, acted to keep it available. Her actions have upset both people for and against the death penalty, though Harris has always stood by her decisions. Renata Espinoza has always declined to speak on camera. But, after 15 years, she agreed to a CNN interview because of Harris' presidential run. Renata Espinoza decided to break her silence after 15 years. ""I want people to know who she is,"" Espinoza said, ""how she was back then and how her actions affected us. I want people to know everything about her, even in the past, before they vote for her. And I want them to hear Isaac's story."" Death of an officer It was the day before Easter in 2004. Officer Isaac Espinoza, 29, was called in on overtime, to work the Saturday shift. He was looking forward to getting off that night so he could rest before Easter services with his wife and 3-year-old daughter. Espinoza worked as a plainclothes officer in the Bayview District of San Francisco. Bayview struggled with poverty and gang wars -- but it was a neighborhood Espinoza was drawn to, requesting it as an assignment because he felt he made the most impact as a cop there. Officer Isaac Espinoza asked to work in the troubled Bayview District, hoping to make a difference. On that night, April 10, Espinoza and his partner saw a man who appeared to be hiding a weapon as he walked down the street. Espinoza got out of their unmarked car and approached him, identifying himself as a police officer, according to court testimony. The man, 21-year-old David Hill, turned to face him, about a dozen feet away. Then he took out an AK-47 assault rifle and fired about a dozen rounds. ""I had just talked to Isaac maybe about 30 to 40 minutes before,"" recalled Renata Espinoza, her voice soft and shy, sometimes barely above a whisper. ""He had told me to stay up because he was coming home."" Espinoza was fatally shot after getting out of his unmarked car. Instead, she was taken to him -- sped in a police vehicle to San Francisco General Hospital by one of her husband's fellow officers. ""Is he alive?"" she asked. ""He's fine, he's alive,"" he reassured her. But her Isaac had been shot. When they pulled into the hospital, a sea of police officers met Espinoza. None of them would look at her. ""Can I see him? Can I see him?"" Espinoza pleaded. The officers searched for their captain. Espinoza doesn't remember everything she said that night -- she just knew that then, like every night since she was 16 years old, Isaac was the center of her life. He had to be OK. Renata and Isaac met when they were teenagers. The pair were high school sweethearts. They met when she was a sophomore and he was a senior -- he was the loud jokester at school and she, the shy daughter of a pastor. Renata's father, conservative and faithful, forbade her from going out on solo dates. So instead, the young couple would take all of Renata's siblings along, to spend time with each other without breaking the rule. Isaac Espinoza knew two things at an early age, his wife said -- he would one day marry her and he would become a police officer. He would accomplish both. A few years out of high school, Renata married Isaac. And as soon as he was age-eligible, he joined the police academy. Then after trying for several years, the couple had a daughter, Isabella. Being a father, a husband, a cop and a Christian -- that's what mattered to Isaac Espinoza. Renata and Isaac Espinoza, with their daughter Isabella. Espinoza's captain approached Renata. He handed her Isaac's star. ""I remember I walked into this room and he still had blood here,"" said Renata Espinoza, pointing to her hip, her voice breaking as she remembered. She paused, the tears she'd held back now falling. ""He was laying there with his eyes closed and I saw the blood here. And I walk over to him I just said, 'wake up.'"" Renata's pastor father was in the room too. She turned to him and pleaded. ""Can you just pray over him?"" she cried in desperation. ""So he can wake up."" The news conference Gary Delagnes was also at the hospital that night, as president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Isaac Espinoza was the union representative for the Bayview station and Delagnes knew him and his young family. Afterwards, he couldn't get the image of the young officer's body -- struck by bullets from the rifle -- out of his mind. It had been 10 years since a San Francisco officer had been gunned down in the line of duty. ""A day or two after the death, I got a call from her,"" he remembered. The caller was new District Attorney Harris. Delagnes was also relatively new as union president and the two had a somewhat cool professional relationship because the police union had endorsed another candidate. But Delagnes said both recognized the need to work together. Gary Delagnes said he couldn't get the image of his slain colleague out of his mind. He knew there would be areas where they would have to agree to disagree -- as on the death penalty. Harris had pledged in her campaign for DA not to seek the death penalty -- a stance generally backed by Bay Area voters and juries, and also taken by the other two candidates. Delagnes, a practicing Catholic, himself had mixed feelings. He would publicly both support and reject the death penalty in his career. On April 13, 2004, three days after Isaac Espinoza was shot to death, a suspect was in custody and Delagnes agreed to join Harris at a news conference. ""In San Francisco, it is the will, I believe, of a majority of people that the most severe crimes be met with the most severe consequences,"" Harris told reporters and camera crews. ""And that life without the possibility of parole is a severe consequence."" ""I'm standing there and I'm going, 'Oh my God,'"" recalled Delagnes, who stood stoically next to the DA, then 39, as she spoke. ""The kid's not even in the ground yet. You're thinking to yourself, OK, is she sorry that this kid died or is this just a political opportunity? Is this just an opportunity for her to double down on the fact she's not going to pursue the death penalty?"" Delagnes said he didn't know Harris would take the death penalty off the table when he stood with her at a news conference. Debbie Mesloh, a longtime Harris adviser who was then communications director for the DA's office, recalled the hours and days after Espinoza's murder as emotionally wrought for the new team. Within 48 hours of Espinoza's murder, Mesloh remembers reporters asking for comment, saying the police officers' union was calling for the death penalty. But San Francisco juries rarely, if ever, handed down the death penalty and the suspect was just 21, she told CNN. ""We were working in a full attempt to be honest and provide clarity on what was a difficult and emotionally charged situation,"" said Mesloh. ""As communications director, I recommended we provide details about the case as soon as possible."" In the shock of becoming a 27-year-old widow with a toddler to raise, Renata Espinoza's memory is inexact about the immediate days following the murder. But she's crystal clear that the news conference was when she first heard about Harris' decision to not seek the death penalty. ""She did not call me,"" recounted Espinoza. ""I don't understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It's like, you can't even wait till he's buried?"" Newfound anger was layered upon her grief. ""I felt like she had just taken something from us,"" said Espinoza. ""She had just taken justice from us. From Isaac. She was only thinking of herself. I couldn't understand why. I was in disbelief that she had gone on and already made her decision to not seek the death penalty for my husband."" Political ramifications The political blowback for Harris came swiftly, publicly and out of the blue at Espinoza's funeral, exacted by the most powerful elected official in attendance. Hundreds of police officers, state and city officials filled the church pews for the fallen officer, with his young widow and toddler seated near the casket. Fellow officers salute at the funeral of Isaac Espinoza, in April 2004. US Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in the middle of a fight in the Senate to reauthorize her assault weapons ban, had been invited to give a eulogy. In 2004, Feinstein was a supporter of the death penalty, a position she would later change. But as she stepped before the grieving crowd, Feinstein made clear her sentiments on that day. She parted from her prepared remarks and, while not using her name, blasted the new district attorney. ""This is not only the definition of tragedy, it's the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law,"" she said. Renata Espinoza remembers the din of chaos after Feinstein's words -- then the standing ovation by hundreds of rank-and-file officers as they turned to Harris. Delagnes, who was also at the funeral, keeps a grudging respect for Harris. ""It would have been very easy for her to say, 'Hey, I'm against the death penalty but this guy killed a cop and I'm going to change my mind on this.' There's something to be said for the fact that she remained consistent."" Nevertheless, the San Francisco Police Officers Association never endorsed Harris in any of her future political runs. Harris' adviser Mesloh said the funeral frayed the relationship between the DA's office and the police department. ""Pronouncements at the church on the death penalty in this case sowed deep division and pain within San Francisco law enforcement and between our office and the family,"" she said. The DA's victim services team was in contact with the police department, a department that closed ranks around the family. The focus inside the DA's office turned to getting the sentence of life in prison without parole, a challenge given the defendant's age, Mesloh said. The assistant DA, Harry Dorfman, would try the case with the full resources of the office and directly engage with the family. But the Espinoza family still wanted to talk to Harris. Renata Espinoza holds her daughter at her husband's funeral. Renata Espinoza wrote a letter to Harris. Regina Espinoza, older sister to Isaac by just one year, kept expecting a response or phone call from the DA. ""She never called,"" Regina Espinoza said. ""There was no consideration for Renata, my niece, my parents, me, or the officers. It was as if she didn't care."" Mesloh did not recall a letter arriving for Harris from the Espinoza family. She said, while she could not dispute the account, it would be uncharacteristic of Harris to not answer a letter. Harris has been known to painstakingly reply to many letters over her years in office, she added. The Espinozas still did not understand why Harris wouldn't seek the maximum punishment possible for Isaac's death. In 1973, California passed a ""special circumstances"" law, making the murderer of a police officer eligible for the death penalty. The Espinozas knew the immediate past showed the death penalty as a punishment might be near impossible, but an accused cop killer had not gone on trial in San Francisco for decades. Harris had laid out her opposition to the death penalty during her run for DA, saying there were a multitude of systemic flaws -- including the inequity of its application based on a defendant's race and income, and the cost to taxpayers of keeping prisoners on death row. On April 23 -- 13 days after Espinoza's death and just a week since his funeral -- the San Francisco Chronicle ran an opinion article from Harris where she again laid out what she saw as problems with using the death penalty, and why she would not pursue it. She wrote, ""For those who want this defendant put to death, let me say simply that there can be no exception to principle."" Harris wrote that she wanted to honor her commitment to the people of San Francisco to oppose the death penalty. ""The district attorney is charged with seeking justice, not vengeance."" The Espinoza family clipped the piece and added it to the memorial album for Isaac. They hadn't known about Harris' opposition to the death penalty before the news conference, they said. Their confusion and anger grew, as a feeling that the DA was not seeking full justice for Isaac solidified. The family says they asked the assistant DA to arrange a meeting with Harris, so they could make their pleas in person. ""I can't remember exactly what she said,"" Regina Espinoza told CNN. ""But I remember there was no connection. We let her know how we felt. We didn't walk away feeling better."" Renata Espinoza recalled: ""She never came over and said, 'I'm sorry for your loss.' Never. Nothing."" She wanted that human connection, even for a moment, she said. ""I would have been able to hear her explanation directly and then we could have talked about it."" In the months and then years that it took for the trial to lead to a conviction, Renata Espinoza said Harris never gave her that compassion she hoped for. On the presidential campaign trail this month, Harris called Officer Espinoza's case ""an absolute tragedy,"" and said her office ""prosecuted that case with all the resources that we had."" She did not answer directly when asked if she personally ever spoke with the Espinoza family, but said someone from her office did. ""We reached out to the family. We always did. We did in that case as well and offered all of the support that our office was able to give the family."" Asked whether she regrets not speaking to the family before announcing the death penalty would not be sought, Harris said, ""I did not ask for permission to make my decision."" She would not discuss the matter further with CNN, but last month Harris told the San Francisco Chronicle the question she's reflected on is whether she should have waited until after Espinoza's funeral to discuss punishment. ""Maybe it was a political novice mistake. I don't know. Maybe it was the right thing to do but you got to take the heat for it,"" the newspaper quoted her as saying. Life in prison ""It took a lot of courage and integrity to make a campaign promise like that -- and then keep it,"" said David Hill, Espinoza's killer and the key beneficiary of Harris' decision not to seek the death penalty. ""I'm forever grateful."" Hill is now 36. He's an inmate at the maximum-security California State Prison. ""I will spend the rest of my life in jail,"" said Hill, matter of fact and without emotion. After he was found guilty of the murder of Espinoza and the attempted murder of his partner, a judge handed down two consecutive life sentences, one without the possibility of parole. David Hill as he looked as the 21-year-old arrested for Isaac Espinoza's murder. In a series of phone calls with CNN, Hill reflected on the 21-year-old gang member he once was, and how different he says he is today. Hill sounded upbeat and earnest, until he talked about the pain he unleashed on the Espinoza family. ""I am remorseful about the whole situation,"" said Hill, pausing as he recalled his crime. ""I'm deeply saddened. And I came to this feeling through the rehabilitation programs at the prison. They've helped me understand."" When asked about Renata Espinoza, Hill said, ""Sorry wouldn't suffice."" He said he has not tried to send Espinoza any letter expressing his remorse in the last 15 years, but said he thinks often about how his actions led to so much loss for her. ""I know what she's missing out on,"" he said, talking about Espinoza raising a daughter without the man he killed. ""All those first moments,"" said Hill, himself a father. ""All that he's missing out on, too."" Hill has a set schedule in prison, a day that begins at 6 a.m. and ends before sundown. He takes a variety of classes -- restorative justice, art, culture, creative writing and yoga. He has been the prison's literacy clerk and is involved in the prison's book club, where guests speak to inmates. Hill knows he will die in prison, but still he says a life sentence showed he was ""not unredeemable."" Hill said he's been paying attention to Kamala Harris' campaign for President and has heard her underscore her personal opposition to the death penalty. In his case, said Hill, not being sentenced to death changed his entire outlook, even though he knows he will die in jail. ""There's no specific day that I know I will die,"" he said. ""I'm not unredeemable."" The other case The clock was running for Professor Hadar Aviram. ""45 days,"" she said to herself. ""45."" She clicked ""start a petition"" on the change.org website. She titled it, ""Do Not Appeal Judge Carney's Death Penalty Abolition Decision."" Aviram began typing a public plea , directing the petition to California Governor Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris. It was summer, 2014. US District Court Judge Cormac Carney had ruled California's death penalty was unconstitutional, halting executions in the state. He found that the long wait on death row before execution was itself cruel and unusual punishment. Anti-death penalty activists like Aviram may not have agreed with the judge's reasoning, but still cheered the decision. Professor Hadar Aviram was shocked when Harris, as California attorney general, didn't take the chance to see the death penalty lapse. Two ballot propositions attempting to abolish the death penalty in California had failed but here was a new opportunity. If Harris didn't file the appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals before the 45-day window closed, Aviram believed the decision by Judge Carney would become a launching pad to end the death penalty. Aviram was hopeful that Harris, who became attorney general in 2011, would listen. ""I knew that personally she was opposed to the death penalty and had never sought it as San Francisco DA,"" said Aviram. ""Basically, all I asked the attorney general to do was nothing."" Aviram underscored her message to Harris by closing her petition with this: ""I call upon Ms. Harris to do the right thing, as her office did in (Prop 8) and refrain from appealing a decision that she knows is right, prudent and just."" Harris had refused to defend Proposition 8, the California voter-approved law that declared same-sex marriage unconstitutional. She and the governor believed the voter initiative infringed on the civil rights of same-sex couples. Their actions paved the way for the case to reach the Supreme Court, which later ruled in favor of allowing same sex couples to marry. As the 45 days ticked down, Aviram thought she was right about Harris. ""So imagine our surprise when, a couple of days before the clock runs out, the attorney general decides to appeal the decision,"" Aviram said. ""It was an upsetting piece of news to receive."" Soon after, Aviram said she got a call from an assistant to Harris who explained the appeal was being filed because the judge's reasoning was flawed. But Aviram saw Harris' actions as ""hardly consistent with her personal opposition to the death penalty."" ""You are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,"" she told CNN. ""If you truly believe that they're morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it's an imperative to do so."" As California Attorney General, Kamala Harris won an appeal to keep the death penalty available in the state. Harris' campaign did not provide answers to CNN questions about the death penalty appeal. While Harris' filing of the appeal disappointed anti-death penalty advocates across California, the decision was praised by the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board as an appropriate one for the attorney general, ""putting professional responsibility over personal politics."" But the newspaper also cited Harris' inconsistency in not supporting Proposition 8. ""... Harris' response to the two cases suggests a willingness to pick and choose the limits of professional obligation."" The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the attorney general's argument and overturned the lower court ruling. The death penalty was once again part of California's penal system. Until this year. In March, California's new Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order putting a moratorium on the state's death penalty, calling it ""ineffective, irreversible and immoral."" Under Newsom's order, all 737 inmates on death row were granted reprieves. It's a decision Presidential candidate Harris immediately hailed. In a statement she said, ""I applaud Governor Newsom for his decision to put a moratorium on this deeply flawed system of capital punishment in California."" Aviram has examined Harris' law enforcement career and calls her a progressive prosecutor, but still criticizes her action on the death penalty appeal. ""The brave thing is not so much to support the person who does the revolutionary thing. The brave thing is to actually step up and do the revolutionary thing,"" she said. A full picture For Renata Espinoza, the appeal over the death penalty added to her confusion about Harris. ""It feels like, why are you changing your mind now? Why couldn't you change your mind back then and put your feelings aside?"" Espinoza told CNN she agreed to an interview now for two reasons. Renata Espinoza says Kamala Harris showed her no compassion when her police officer husband was killed 15 years ago. The first is for voters to have a full picture of the candidate and her humanity. ""You're trying to be President of the United States. That's a lot. Are you going to show compassion? Are you going to be 'for the people'? Or are you going to be for yourself?"" she asks of the candidate, referencing her 'for the people' slogan. The second, and more important, was for Isaac. He was the brave and loud one in their marriage, Espinoza said, and she preferred to let him do the talking. But he can't talk now. Isaac Espinoza with his baby daughter. She was three when he was killed. ""He just believed in fairness,"" said Espinoza. ""The way things went down with her, that wasn't fair. He always fought for the little guy and he loved doing it. With us, she was careless. And now you're running for President. I don't think her actions back then are those Isaac would approve of."""
Scientists have just captured a record-breaking python 17 feet long in Florida,www.cnn.com,Good King News,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/florida-huge-python-captured-trnd/index.html/,"Scientists have just captured a record-breaking python 17 feet long in Florida By 3 Share
Scientists caught in the Florida Everglades a feminine python over 17 feet long, weighing 140 kilos and containing 73 creating eggs.
The image with the Facebook submit says all of it.
He exhibits a crew of 4 researchers, separated from one another, holding the large reptile. Although pythons of all sizes have been discovered in the Everglades, most of them are between 6 and 10 feet long. the the largest one was over 18 feet long and weighed over 100 kilos , based on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Yet this final discovery is spectacular. Big Cypress Rangers acknowledge that analysis and new monitoring expertise make this potential.
""The use of male pythons with radio transmitters allows the team to track the male to locate the breeding females,"" their assertion mentioned. ""The team not only removes invasive snakes, but collects data for research, develops new removal tools, and learns how pythons use the pool.""
The Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia, however in latest a long time, massive snakes have develop into a rampant menace in Florida. The Everglades are a huge area with a tropical local weather conducive to the event of pythons.
State wildlife officers estimate that there are 100,000 pythons dwelling in the huge swamps outdoors of Miami. Snakes pose a important menace to native wildlife.
To management their inhabitants, Florida even organizes competitions encouraging hunters to withdraw as many as potential. Some 1,600 folks registered for first Python problem in 2013, organized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The researchers discovered solely 68 snakes. In 2017, 25 hunters had been paid for the euthanasia of pythons as a part of a pilot program of $ 175,000 from the South Florida Water Management District.
Pythons started to appear in the Everglades in the 1980s, in all probability deserted by animal homeowners when snakes turned too large to deal with. Some pet pythons might also have escaped from a breeding facility destroyed throughout Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Share this:"
First border wall construction contracts expected to be awarded this week - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/border-wall-construction-contracts/index.html,"(CNN) The first contracts to support the construction of President Donald Trump's much-sought-after border wall are expected to be awarded this week using Pentagon funds, two US defense officials tell CNN.
The officials tell CNN that the first US Army Corps of Engineers contracts to support the wall's construction should be signed this week, with one official saying it could happen as early as Tuesday. The contracts are to support work at the two sections of the proposed wall that Defense Department officials surveyed late last month, in Yuma, Arizona, and the New Mexico part of the El Paso sector, which also includes Texas. A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers told CNN last month that the plan was to install 11 miles of fencing at Yuma and 46 miles at El Paso. The funds for the contracts are to come from the $1 billion that was recently reprogrammed from Army personnel accounts into the 284 counter-drug account that authorizes border barrier construction. Read More That reprogramming has been opposed by some lawmakers in Congress, but the Pentagon has said it does not need congressional approval to shift the funds. As a consequence of the move, Congress has threatened to strip the Pentagon of its ability to transfer funds in the future. Officials had previously told CNN that if the contracts were awarded in mid-April, construction could begin by late May, depending on whether the Department of Homeland Security issues environmental waivers, which is sometimes done to expedite construction. Trump traveled to the border Friday accompanied by Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commander of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Pentagon funds are to be spent on 57 miles of 18-foot-high fencing along the Yuma and El Paso sections of the border, according to a letter acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan sent to outgoing Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who approved the DHS request for support. Trump announced on Sunday that Nielsen would soon be leaving her position . The administration has previously said it plans to shift an additional $1.5 billion in Pentagon funds toward wall construction at some point. That money is separate from the $3.6 billion in military construction funds that the Trump administration has sought to tap into to fund the wall via a national emergency declaration."
Judge blocks policy forcing some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/asylum-seekers-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration's policy of returning some asylum seekers to Mexico to await their immigration court hearing, delivering a major blow to the administration just a day after the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign.
The preliminary injunction from Richard Seeborg of the Northern District of California is slated to go into effect nationwide on April 12. The Migrant Protection Protocols program, informally known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" was initially rolled out at the San Ysidro port of entry in January. Nielsen recently ordered that the policy be expanded along the southern border in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants to the border. Up to 400 people have been returned to Mexico under the policy, according to a DHS official. 'I don't want to return to Mexico, your honor': Asylum seekers make their plea to immigration judges READ: Judge's order blocking 'remain in Mexico' policy Seeborg found that the provision on which the government was relying was never intended to permit the return of asylum seekers to Mexico, and even if it did, the current screening procedures were not adequate, Melissa Crow, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement. Read More ""Today's victory is especially important amidst reports that the Trump administration is planning to move toward even more extreme immigration policies,"" Crow said. ""The decision will prevent incredibly vulnerable individuals from being trapped in dangerous conditions in Mexico, but it's only a step in a much larger fight."" The judge's order will likely draw the ire of President Donald Trump, who has fumed over the legal challenges that have kept his administration from implementing a series of controversial policies. It's almost become so common that Trump publicly griped about the challenges his national emergency declaration would face. ""We will have a national emergency and we will then be sued,"" Trump said in the Rose Garden in February. ""We'll possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling, and then we'll end up at the Supreme Court and hopefully we'll get a fair shake."" A judge also blocked the administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy that resulted in the separation of parents and children. Senior administration officials told CNN that in the last four months or so, the President has been pushing Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy. In February, a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups asked a federal judge for a restraining order that would block the so-called Remain in Mexico policy. Eleven migrants who are seeking asylum in the United States and were returned to Mexico under the policy are also plaintiffs in the case. If the ruling takes effect, the government will have two days to allow those 11 migrants into the US. Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security Some have already attended their first hearing in removal proceedings at the San Diego immigration court. The immigration hearings underway so far have underscored outstanding issues with the new program, including the challenge of obtaining legal representation while in another country and providing notification of court dates to an individual without a fixed address. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Cuban baseball group criticizes Trump move to cancel player deal - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Allie Malloy,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/white-house-cuba-baseball/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Monday canceled a deal that made it easier for Cuban baseball players to compete professionally in the United States -- a decision that swiftly drew criticism from the Cuban Baseball Federation.
The move rolls back another Obama-era effort aimed at warming relations between the two countries. The deal, reached in December, would have allowed Cuban citizens to play Major League Baseball without being forced to defect from the communist-run island and risk being banned from returning to the island. It also allowed the Cuban government to claim a fee from MLB teams that drafted Cuban players. ""The agreement with MLB seeks to stop the trafficking of human beings, encourage cooperation and raise the level of baseball. Attacks with political motivation against the agreement achieved harm (to) the athletes, their families and the fans,"" the state-run Cuban Baseball Federation said in a statement to CNN. The original agreement was helped by an Obama-era regulatory change that allowed US employers to hire Cuban nationals despite the 60-year-old US trade embargo against Cuba. During Barack Obama's second term, he attended an MLB exhibition game in Havana and efforts were made to open the door for Cuban baseball players to legally earn salaries. Read More The White House, however, argued Monday that the Cuban Baseball Federation is part of the Cuban government, which caused the deal to be nullified as trade with Cuba is banned. The Trump administration has reversed parts of the Obama administration opening to Cuba and blames Havana for the turmoil taking place in socialist ally Venezuela. National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement that ""The US does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society."" Marquis added that the administration ""looks forward"" to working with the MLB to ""identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents, and not as property of the Cuban State."" The MLB on Monday said they ""stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba."" The initial deal, which was expected to run through October 2021, allowed Cuban players to sign with clubs under rules similar to those for players from Japan and South Korea. Previously, players regularly paid criminal gangs to smuggle them from Cuba to third countries where they could sign as free agents. Players who were over 25 years old would be free to sign with organizations that paid a ""release fee"" to the Cuban club. Other players could sign minor league deals. The Washington Post first reported that the deal had been canceled."
Half the women are gone from Trump's Cabinet - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/trump-women-cabinet-gone/index.html,"(CNN) He's had three national security advisers, three chiefs of staff and three attorneys general and he hasn't even been in office for three years. One other result of the chaotic churn in President Donald Trump's Cabinet is that he has fewer women -- down to just three.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out over the weekend because her boss wanted a more hardline immigration policy. The repercussions of her departure have already led to what one source described to CNN's Kaitlan Collins as a "" near-systematic purge "" at the agency that oversees immigration and the nation's borders, among many other things. It comes after the announcement less than two weeks ago that Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon is leaving her position to join Trump's outside political group . McMahon, who made a fortune as the executive in charge of the WWE, which at one point featured Trump, will stay in his orbit as she tries to raise money for the super PAC that will try to help him win reelection. The current commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Kevin McAleenan, will temporarily take on the duties of homeland security secretary. It's not clear who will take over for McMahon. They were preceded by UN Ambassador Nikki Haley , whose position has gone unfilled since her departure months ago. Read More Depending on who permanently replaces Nielsen and McMahon, Trump will have just three women sitting at the table for Cabinet meetings. Haley's UN position -- one that has been filled by a succession of women -- was downgraded, leaving 23 Cabinet-level positions. Counting the vacated roles, that leaves women as just 13% of Trump's Cabinet-level officials, a lower percentage than either Barack Obama or George W. Bush and the lowest in decades , according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. It's not clear that the remaining women in Trump's Cabinet are in any danger, though Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been under scrutiny recently for her department's short-lived proposal to cut funding for the Special Olympics, which briefly put her on the wrong side of Trump. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- and CIA Director Gina Haspel, Trump's replacement for his now-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, are the other two. Turnover in top positions But the shrinking number of women in Trump's Cabinet is just one symptom of the remarkable changeover among his top staffers, something that's been chronicled throughout his presidency . He's had five communications directors, for instance, which is not a Cabinet-level position but has been a central role for previous White Houses. That position is currently vacant, essentially filled by Trump and his Twitter feed. There is also not currently a permanent chief of staff, supposedly the president's right hand, and a position that does not require Senate approval, although it does have Cabinet rank. Reince Priebus came first, the Republican insider who lasted a little more than six months in the role. John Kelly lasted longer, a year and half, from July of 2017 through the end of 2018. Rather than give his successor the title outright, Trump made Mick Mulvaney, who is still technically the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a sort-of promotion to acting chief of staff. A deputy of Mulvaney's is now acting OMB director. Acting leaders And that's another key theme of Trump's presidency. He'll fire or push out a Cabinet secretary who frustrates him and then wait months to nominate a permanent successor, even in crucial roles. That's what happened with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the nation's top lawyer. Trump pushed Sessions out of the role after more than a year of venting his frustration that Sessions had recused himself from the Russia election interference investigation. The President waited a month to nominate William Barr in Sessions' place. At the Pentagon, Patrick Shanahan has been acting secretary of defense for nearly four months and it's still not clear if Trump will nominate him as a permanent replacement . Turnover in national security, diplomacy positions Shanahan isn't the only key national security official to be left hanging. Trump forced out his first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , who he routinely disagreed with on policy, and elevated his then-CIA director, Mike Pompeo. His first defense secretary, James Mattis, wrote a letter outlining his opposition to Trump's plans to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan . The mainstay of Trump's national security team is Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, although he has publicly disagreed with Trump. Who's left the Trump administration? Working closer to the President on a daily basis is his national security adviser, which is also not a Cabinet role but is key to national security policy. Trump's had three. Michael Flynn was fired after he lied to Vice President Mike Pence. H.R. McMaster left after policy disagreements with the President. Now in the role is John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk who has disagreed with Trump on Syria. Nielsen herself had been on thin ice with Trump for months even though she had defended his controversial positions, like separating the children of undocumented immigrants from their parents at the border. She had been brought to the role by her predecessor, Kelly, a former Marine who left his position as homeland security secretary to become Trump's second chief of staff, before being supplanted by Mulvaney. Trump has already had more turnover among his Cabinet in a little more than two years than recent presidents have had in four years, according to research by Brookings. That turmoil extends to top staffers in government who are outside the Cabinet. On the website outlining top leadership for the Department of Homeland Security , for instance, which is the umbrella agency in charge of everything from border policy and immigration enforcement to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Secret Service, there are 14 ""acting"" or ""vacant"" positions. And that's not including Nielsen or Secret Service Director Randolph Alles, who are on their way out. Trump has said he might prefer to keep some of these positions open because, as he said in January, it gives him more "" flexibility ."" But he hasn't chosen a single woman for an acting Cabinet secretary role yet."

Eric Swalwell announced Monday that he is running for president, telling ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert that he believes the United States is in ""quicksand"" where Americans feel they are ""running in place and it is not adding up to anything.""
Swalwell has been contemplating a run for months. The California Democrat has made several trips to early nominating states like Iowa and New Hampshire, telling reporters that he sees a space for a candidate like himself in the race and hinted earlier this month that he was ""close to making a decision."" ""None of that is going to change until we get a leader who is willing to go big on the issues we take on, be bold in the solutions we offer and do good in the ways that we govern. I am ready to solve these problems. I am running for president of the United States,"" he told Colbert. Swalwell, who also filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Monday, added, ""Boy, did it feel good to say that."" Swalwell, 38, enters the race as a long-shot candidate in a crowded field of 17 other Democrats, many of whom have more national name recognition, electoral experience and campaign war chests. The field is also slated to get larger in the coming weeks: former Vice President Joe Biden's announcement is looming this month, along with possible entrances by Rep. Seth Moulton, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams. Read More Swalwell and his small team of political advisers began to make plans for an April announcement last month, telling a small group of early state operatives that the four-term congressman from the Bay Area plans to enter the race. Swalwell's planning got so specific that an aide close to the congressman told early state Democrats in March that he would announce his campaign on a late night show , according to those Democrats. Here are the Democrats who have said they're running for president ""I have already done a lot,"" said of his time in Congress and his presidential bid, ""but I can do more."" Swalwell will follow up his announcement with a frenetic week of campaigning. The first event will be a Tuesday town hall focused on gun control in Sunrise, Florida -- a few miles from Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the 2018 school shooting that left 17 people dead. Swalwell has made combating gun violence a focus for months and traveled to Iowa in December with Cameron Kasky, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and co-founder of March for Our Lives, the student activist group that grew out of the shooting. ""We should go big and be bold and expect in our lifetime that we can have background checks,"" Swalwell said at the Progress Iowa event in December. ""We can ban and buy back every single weapon of war. We can fund and study gun violence. We can take care of people with mental illness needs."" The congressman will then travel to Iowa on Thursday, South Carolina on Friday, his home district in California on Sunday -- where he will, according to an advisory, discuss his ""vision for the East Bay and America"" -- and Nevada next Monday. Swalwell has raised his profile in recent years by becoming a staple on cable television, especially to talk about investigations into the Trump administration. But he admitted in a December interview with CNN that a possible presidential bid against big-name politicians like Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders is ""daunting."" ""I don't want to do it half-assed,"" he said. ""I would want it to be a serious campaign that could be a winning campaign."""
"Maine woman allegedly sent threatening letter to Susan Collins, feds say - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/maine-susan-collins-letter-threat/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Authorities arrested a woman on Friday who is accused of sending a threatening letter to Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine last year, the Justice Department announced Monday.
A criminal complaint against Suzanne Muscara dated Friday accused the Maine woman of violating a federal law against mailing threats by sending a letter last October to Collins shortly after her vote in favor of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Court documents said Muscara's initial appearance was held in Bangor, Maine, on Monday afternoon and that Muscara was ""ordered temporarily detained"" with a preliminary hearing set for next week. Halsey Frank, the US attorney for Maine, announced Muscara's arrest and charging in a statement Monday morning, and an attorney listed in the federal court system for Muscara did not immediately return a request for comment. The statement from Frank's office said if convicted, Muscara ""faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine."" Read More Collins' office confirmed the arrest on Monday. ""Senator Collins and Mr. (Tom) Daffron greatly appreciate the extraordinary efforts made by state and federal law enforcement agencies which culminated in an arrest in this case,"" said Collins' spokeswoman, Annie Clark. Last October, Collins' spokesperson said Daffron, Collins' husband, ""received a threatening letter that the writer claimed was contaminated with ricin,"" a highly toxic substance. The complaint against Muscara cited FBI agent Michel Verhar, who said in an affidavit that an initial letter sent to Daffron said, ""Good luck to you and Susan in the next life"" and that the letter claimed to be coated in ricin, but that tests showed ""no hazardous materials were present."" Verhar said after the initial letter, a postal inspector was assigned to screen all mail sent to Collins' residence and that inspector observed ""a fine white powder"" leaking from an envelope addressed to Collins. Tests showed the envelope tested negative for toxins, according to Verhar, and contained a flyer inside that read, ""AnthRAX!!! HA HA HA!!!"" along with a stick figure ""with the letter 'X' for eyes, the tongue sticking out, and with 'You' and an arrow pointing at the stick figure face."" The FBI determined the white powder was starch and found a fingerprint that matched Muscara, whose prints were in the FBI's database after a 2013 arrest in Pennsylvania, according to Verhar. Verhar said he and another FBI agent approached Muscara last Friday, who waived her Miranda rights and told them ""she had sent an envelope by mail to Senator Susan Collins that contained a white powder"" and recalled ""using the word 'anthrax.'"""
First border wall construction contracts expected to be awarded this week - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/border-wall-construction-contracts/index.html,"(CNN) The first contracts to support the construction of President Donald Trump's much-sought-after border wall are expected to be awarded this week using Pentagon funds, two US defense officials tell CNN.
The officials tell CNN that the first US Army Corps of Engineers contracts to support the wall's construction should be signed this week, with one official saying it could happen as early as Tuesday. The contracts are to support work at the two sections of the proposed wall that Defense Department officials surveyed late last month, in Yuma, Arizona, and the New Mexico part of the El Paso sector, which also includes Texas. A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers told CNN last month that the plan was to install 11 miles of fencing at Yuma and 46 miles at El Paso. The funds for the contracts are to come from the $1 billion that was recently reprogrammed from Army personnel accounts into the 284 counter-drug account that authorizes border barrier construction. Read More That reprogramming has been opposed by some lawmakers in Congress, but the Pentagon has said it does not need congressional approval to shift the funds. As a consequence of the move, Congress has threatened to strip the Pentagon of its ability to transfer funds in the future. Officials had previously told CNN that if the contracts were awarded in mid-April, construction could begin by late May, depending on whether the Department of Homeland Security issues environmental waivers, which is sometimes done to expedite construction. Trump traveled to the border Friday accompanied by Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commander of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Pentagon funds are to be spent on 57 miles of 18-foot-high fencing along the Yuma and El Paso sections of the border, according to a letter acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan sent to outgoing Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who approved the DHS request for support. Trump announced on Sunday that Nielsen would soon be leaving her position . The administration has previously said it plans to shift an additional $1.5 billion in Pentagon funds toward wall construction at some point. That money is separate from the $3.6 billion in military construction funds that the Trump administration has sought to tap into to fund the wall via a national emergency declaration."
Montana bear attack: Teen was pinned to a tree but eventually deployed bear spray - CNN,us.cnn.com,Eliott C.

He turned to find a bear charging at him.
The 17-year-old was unable to grab his bear spray, according to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks, and the bear pinned him against a tree and held him there. ""When the bear let go, the teen fell over and attempted to crawl between two trees and protect his head and vitals. The bear then pinned him face-down on the ground,"" the department said in a statement recounting the Sunday attack.

Donald Trump's revolving door presidency - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/donald-trump-administration-departures-kirstjen-nielsen/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Remember back in 2016 when then-candidate Donald Trump pledged that ""I'm going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people?""
Who knew there would be so many! The removal of Kirstjen Nielsen as head of the Department of Homeland Security on Sunday night accounts for the 14th(!) member of Trump's Cabinet to resign, be fired or move on to another job. How does that compare to Trump's immediate predecessors? Barack Obama lost nine Cabinet secretaries in his first term; George W. Bush saw four Cabinet officials move on in his first four years. Trump has been president for 808 days. So And it's not just at the Cabinet level! According to Kathryn Dunn Tenpas at Brookings , a DC-based think tank, 66% of all senior-level staffers who came into jobs when Trump became President are now gone. That's nearly equal to the 71% attrition for Obama's entire first term -- and eclipses Bush's 63% rate. Trump, for his part, insists that his administration remains the hottest club in DC . Read More ""Everybody wants to work in this White House,"" he said soon after the 2018 midterm election . ""We are a hot country. This is a hot White House. We are a White House that people want to work with."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!

The facts belie that claim. Not only has Trump suffered from record-setting numbers of departures in his Cabinet and senior staff, he has also struggled to fill those jobs with permanent replacements. Nielsen's planned replacement -- Kevin McAleenan -- takes over the job only in an interim role. Ditto the Defense secretary. And the Interior secretary. And the White House chief of staff. Is it possible that Trump is choosing not to fill some of the more junior roles within these departments under the belief that the government is bloated with unnecessary people? Sure! But it's hard to make that same argument when we are talking about the HEADS of massive government entities. Why the turnover? And the struggles to replace the people who go? Trump. He is someone who struggles to delegate decisions and, even when he does, often overrules his people -- publicly. That's, uh, not a great work environment. The Point : Trump views himself as the one indispensable cog of his administration. And he treats the people who work for him as interchangeable parts, usually of little value."
How Kamala Harris' death penalty decisions broke hearts on both sides - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Kyung Lah,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/kamala-harris-death-penalty-decisions/index.html,"San Francisco (CNN) Senator Kamala Harris greets supporters along the rope line after a campaign rally. She hugs admirers, poses for selfies and warmly thanks person after person for attending.
Watching on her TV, Renata Espinoza stares and shakes her head. ""Is it the real you?"" Espinoza asks of the candidate on screen. ""Or is it not? We never saw that,"" she said. ""It upsets me because I see her doing that now, and I wish she would have done that back then."" Sen. Kamala Harris pauses for a selfie with supporters in Atlanta last month, one of many campaign stops. The ""back then"" is 2004, when Espinoza, her husband Isaac and Harris were all part of San Francisco's extended law and order family - Isaac Espinoza as a police officer and Harris as the city's newly elected district attorney. It was when Renata Espinoza became a widow and when the prosecutors' mantra of standing ""for the people"" suddenly became for her, and her murdered husband. Read More For Harris, she was on a crucial early rung of the professional and political ladder that would take her to today, becoming a top-tier candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Her time as a prosecutor helped to shape some of the policies on which she's now running as well as to give fodder to both her supporters and critics. One case is her attitude to the death penalty. While she's been consistent in her personal opposition to capital punishment, professionally she has both refused to seek it AND, as California attorney general, acted to keep it available. Her actions have upset both people for and against the death penalty, though Harris has always stood by her decisions. Renata Espinoza has always declined to speak on camera. But, after 15 years, she agreed to a CNN interview because of Harris' presidential run. Renata Espinoza decided to break her silence after 15 years. ""I want people to know who she is,"" Espinoza said, ""how she was back then and how her actions affected us. I want people to know everything about her, even in the past, before they vote for her. And I want them to hear Isaac's story."" Death of an officer It was the day before Easter in 2004. Officer Isaac Espinoza, 29, was called in on overtime, to work the Saturday shift. He was looking forward to getting off that night so he could rest before Easter services with his wife and 3-year-old daughter. Espinoza worked as a plainclothes officer in the Bayview District of San Francisco. Bayview struggled with poverty and gang wars -- but it was a neighborhood Espinoza was drawn to, requesting it as an assignment because he felt he made the most impact as a cop there. Officer Isaac Espinoza asked to work in the troubled Bayview District, hoping to make a difference. On that night, April 10, Espinoza and his partner saw a man who appeared to be hiding a weapon as he walked down the street. Espinoza got out of their unmarked car and approached him, identifying himself as a police officer, according to court testimony. The man, 21-year-old David Hill, turned to face him, about a dozen feet away. Then he took out an AK-47 assault rifle and fired about a dozen rounds. ""I had just talked to Isaac maybe about 30 to 40 minutes before,"" recalled Renata Espinoza, her voice soft and shy, sometimes barely above a whisper. ""He had told me to stay up because he was coming home."" Espinoza was fatally shot after getting out of his unmarked car. Instead, she was taken to him -- sped in a police vehicle to San Francisco General Hospital by one of her husband's fellow officers. ""Is he alive?"" she asked. ""He's fine, he's alive,"" he reassured her. But her Isaac had been shot. When they pulled into the hospital, a sea of police officers met Espinoza. None of them would look at her. ""Can I see him? Can I see him?"" Espinoza pleaded. The officers searched for their captain. Espinoza doesn't remember everything she said that night -- she just knew that then, like every night since she was 16 years old, Isaac was the center of her life. He had to be OK. Renata and Isaac met when they were teenagers. The pair were high school sweethearts. They met when she was a sophomore and he was a senior -- he was the loud jokester at school and she, the shy daughter of a pastor. Renata's father, conservative and faithful, forbade her from going out on solo dates. So instead, the young couple would take all of Renata's siblings along, to spend time with each other without breaking the rule. Isaac Espinoza knew two things at an early age, his wife said -- he would one day marry her and he would become a police officer. He would accomplish both. A few years out of high school, Renata married Isaac. And as soon as he was age-eligible, he joined the police academy. Then after trying for several years, the couple had a daughter, Isabella. Being a father, a husband, a cop and a Christian -- that's what mattered to Isaac Espinoza. Renata and Isaac Espinoza, with their daughter Isabella. Espinoza's captain approached Renata. He handed her Isaac's star. ""I remember I walked into this room and he still had blood here,"" said Renata Espinoza, pointing to her hip, her voice breaking as she remembered. She paused, the tears she'd held back now falling. ""He was laying there with his eyes closed and I saw the blood here. And I walk over to him I just said, 'wake up.'"" Renata's pastor father was in the room too. She turned to him and pleaded. ""Can you just pray over him?"" she cried in desperation. ""So he can wake up."" The news conference Gary Delagnes was also at the hospital that night, as president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Isaac Espinoza was the union representative for the Bayview station and Delagnes knew him and his young family. Afterwards, he couldn't get the image of the young officer's body -- struck by bullets from the rifle -- out of his mind. It had been 10 years since a San Francisco officer had been gunned down in the line of duty. ""A day or two after the death, I got a call from her,"" he remembered. The caller was new District Attorney Harris. Delagnes was also relatively new as union president and the two had a somewhat cool professional relationship because the police union had endorsed another candidate. But Delagnes said both recognized the need to work together. Gary Delagnes said he couldn't get the image of his slain colleague out of his mind. He knew there would be areas where they would have to agree to disagree -- as on the death penalty. Harris had pledged in her campaign for DA not to seek the death penalty -- a stance generally backed by Bay Area voters and juries, and also taken by the other two candidates. Delagnes, a practicing Catholic, himself had mixed feelings. He would publicly both support and reject the death penalty in his career. On April 13, 2004, three days after Isaac Espinoza was shot to death, a suspect was in custody and Delagnes agreed to join Harris at a news conference. ""In San Francisco, it is the will, I believe, of a majority of people that the most severe crimes be met with the most severe consequences,"" Harris told reporters and camera crews. ""And that life without the possibility of parole is a severe consequence."" ""I'm standing there and I'm going, 'Oh my God,'"" recalled Delagnes, who stood stoically next to the DA, then 39, as she spoke. ""The kid's not even in the ground yet. You're thinking to yourself, OK, is she sorry that this kid died or is this just a political opportunity? Is this just an opportunity for her to double down on the fact she's not going to pursue the death penalty?"" Delagnes said he didn't know Harris would take the death penalty off the table when he stood with her at a news conference. Debbie Mesloh, a longtime Harris adviser who was then communications director for the DA's office, recalled the hours and days after Espinoza's murder as emotionally wrought for the new team. Within 48 hours of Espinoza's murder, Mesloh remembers reporters asking for comment, saying the police officers' union was calling for the death penalty. But San Francisco juries rarely, if ever, handed down the death penalty and the suspect was just 21, she told CNN. ""We were working in a full attempt to be honest and provide clarity on what was a difficult and emotionally charged situation,"" said Mesloh. ""As communications director, I recommended we provide details about the case as soon as possible."" In the shock of becoming a 27-year-old widow with a toddler to raise, Renata Espinoza's memory is inexact about the immediate days following the murder. But she's crystal clear that the news conference was when she first heard about Harris' decision to not seek the death penalty. ""She did not call me,"" recounted Espinoza. ""I don't understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It's like, you can't even wait till he's buried?"" Newfound anger was layered upon her grief. ""I felt like she had just taken something from us,"" said Espinoza. ""She had just taken justice from us. From Isaac. She was only thinking of herself. I couldn't understand why. I was in disbelief that she had gone on and already made her decision to not seek the death penalty for my husband."" Political ramifications The political blowback for Harris came swiftly, publicly and out of the blue at Espinoza's funeral, exacted by the most powerful elected official in attendance. Hundreds of police officers, state and city officials filled the church pews for the fallen officer, with his young widow and toddler seated near the casket. Fellow officers salute at the funeral of Isaac Espinoza, in April 2004. US Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in the middle of a fight in the Senate to reauthorize her assault weapons ban, had been invited to give a eulogy. In 2004, Feinstein was a supporter of the death penalty, a position she would later change. But as she stepped before the grieving crowd, Feinstein made clear her sentiments on that day. She parted from her prepared remarks and, while not using her name, blasted the new district attorney. ""This is not only the definition of tragedy, it's the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law,"" she said. Renata Espinoza remembers the din of chaos after Feinstein's words -- then the standing ovation by hundreds of rank-and-file officers as they turned to Harris. Delagnes, who was also at the funeral, keeps a grudging respect for Harris. ""It would have been very easy for her to say, 'Hey, I'm against the death penalty but this guy killed a cop and I'm going to change my mind on this.' There's something to be said for the fact that she remained consistent."" Nevertheless, the San Francisco Police Officers Association never endorsed Harris in any of her future political runs. Harris' adviser Mesloh said the funeral frayed the relationship between the DA's office and the police department. ""Pronouncements at the church on the death penalty in this case sowed deep division and pain within San Francisco law enforcement and between our office and the family,"" she said. The DA's victim services team was in contact with the police department, a department that closed ranks around the family. The focus inside the DA's office turned to getting the sentence of life in prison without parole, a challenge given the defendant's age, Mesloh said. The assistant DA, Harry Dorfman, would try the case with the full resources of the office and directly engage with the family. But the Espinoza family still wanted to talk to Harris. Renata Espinoza holds her daughter at her husband's funeral. Renata Espinoza wrote a letter to Harris. Regina Espinoza, older sister to Isaac by just one year, kept expecting a response or phone call from the DA. ""She never called,"" Regina Espinoza said. ""There was no consideration for Renata, my niece, my parents, me, or the officers. It was as if she didn't care."" Mesloh did not recall a letter arriving for Harris from the Espinoza family. She said, while she could not dispute the account, it would be uncharacteristic of Harris to not answer a letter. Harris has been known to painstakingly reply to many letters over her years in office, she added. The Espinozas still did not understand why Harris wouldn't seek the maximum punishment possible for Isaac's death. In 1973, California passed a ""special circumstances"" law, making the murderer of a police officer eligible for the death penalty. The Espinozas knew the immediate past showed the death penalty as a punishment might be near impossible, but an accused cop killer had not gone on trial in San Francisco for decades. Harris had laid out her opposition to the death penalty during her run for DA, saying there were a multitude of systemic flaws -- including the inequity of its application based on a defendant's race and income, and the cost to taxpayers of keeping prisoners on death row. On April 23 -- 13 days after Espinoza's death and just a week since his funeral -- the San Francisco Chronicle ran an opinion article from Harris where she again laid out what she saw as problems with using the death penalty, and why she would not pursue it. She wrote, ""For those who want this defendant put to death, let me say simply that there can be no exception to principle."" Harris wrote that she wanted to honor her commitment to the people of San Francisco to oppose the death penalty. ""The district attorney is charged with seeking justice, not vengeance."" The Espinoza family clipped the piece and added it to the memorial album for Isaac. They hadn't known about Harris' opposition to the death penalty before the news conference, they said. Their confusion and anger grew, as a feeling that the DA was not seeking full justice for Isaac solidified. The family says they asked the assistant DA to arrange a meeting with Harris, so they could make their pleas in person. ""I can't remember exactly what she said,"" Regina Espinoza told CNN. ""But I remember there was no connection. We let her know how we felt. We didn't walk away feeling better."" Renata Espinoza recalled: ""She never came over and said, 'I'm sorry for your loss.' Never. Nothing."" She wanted that human connection, even for a moment, she said. ""I would have been able to hear her explanation directly and then we could have talked about it."" In the months and then years that it took for the trial to lead to a conviction, Renata Espinoza said Harris never gave her that compassion she hoped for. On the presidential campaign trail this month, Harris called Officer Espinoza's case ""an absolute tragedy,"" and said her office ""prosecuted that case with all the resources that we had."" She did not answer directly when asked if she personally ever spoke with the Espinoza family, but said someone from her office did. ""We reached out to the family. We always did. We did in that case as well and offered all of the support that our office was able to give the family."" Asked whether she regrets not speaking to the family before announcing the death penalty would not be sought, Harris said, ""I did not ask for permission to make my decision."" She would not discuss the matter further with CNN, but last month Harris told the San Francisco Chronicle the question she's reflected on is whether she should have waited until after Espinoza's funeral to discuss punishment. ""Maybe it was a political novice mistake. I don't know. Maybe it was the right thing to do but you got to take the heat for it,"" the newspaper Quote: d her as saying. Life in prison ""It took a lot of courage and integrity to make a campaign promise like that -- and then keep it,"" said David Hill, Espinoza's killer and the key beneficiary of Harris' decision not to seek the death penalty. ""I'm forever grateful."" Hill is now 36. He's an inmate at the maximum-security California State Prison. ""I will spend the rest of my life in jail,"" said Hill, matter of fact and without emotion. After he was found guilty of the murder of Espinoza and the attempted murder of his partner, a judge handed down two consecutive life sentences, one without the possibility of parole. David Hill as he looked as the 21-year-old arrested for Isaac Espinoza's murder. In a series of phone calls with CNN, Hill reflected on the 21-year-old gang member he once was, and how different he says he is today. Hill sounded upbeat and earnest, until he talked about the pain he unleashed on the Espinoza family. ""I am remorseful about the whole situation,"" said Hill, pausing as he recalled his crime. ""I'm deeply saddened. And I came to this feeling through the rehabilitation programs at the prison. They've helped me understand."" When asked about Renata Espinoza, Hill said, ""Sorry wouldn't suffice."" He said he has not tried to send Espinoza any letter expressing his remorse in the last 15 years, but said he thinks often about how his actions led to so much loss for her. ""I know what she's missing out on,"" he said, talking about Espinoza raising a daughter without the man he killed. ""All those first moments,"" said Hill, himself a father. ""All that he's missing out on, too."" Hill has a set schedule in prison, a day that begins at 6 a.m. and ends before sundown. He takes a variety of classes -- restorative justice, art, culture, creative writing and yoga. He has been the prison's literacy clerk and is involved in the prison's book club, where guests speak to inmates. Hill knows he will die in prison, but still he says a life sentence showed he was ""not unredeemable."" Hill said he's been paying attention to Kamala Harris' campaign for President and has heard her underscore her personal opposition to the death penalty. In his case, said Hill, not being sentenced to death changed his entire outlook, even though he knows he will die in jail. ""There's no specific day that I know I will die,"" he said. ""I'm not unredeemable."" The other case The clock was running for Professor Hadar Aviram. ""45 days,"" she said to herself. ""45."" She clicked ""start a petition"" on the change.org website. She titled it, ""Do Not Appeal Judge Carney's Death Penalty Abolition Decision."" Aviram began typing a public plea , directing the petition to California Governor Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris. It was summer, 2014. US District Court Judge Cormac Carney had ruled California's death penalty was unconstitutional, halting executions in the state. He found that the long wait on death row before execution was itself cruel and unusual punishment. Anti-death penalty activists like Aviram may not have agreed with the judge's reasoning, but still cheered the decision. Professor Hadar Aviram was shocked when Harris, as California attorney general, didn't take the chance to see the death penalty lapse. Two ballot propositions attempting to abolish the death penalty in California had failed but here was a new opportunity. If Harris didn't file the appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals before the 45-day window closed, Aviram believed the decision by Judge Carney would become a launching pad to end the death penalty. Aviram was hopeful that Harris, who became attorney general in 2011, would listen. ""I knew that personally she was opposed to the death penalty and had never sought it as San Francisco DA,"" said Aviram. ""Basically, all I asked the attorney general to do was nothing."" Aviram underscored her message to Harris by closing her petition with this: ""I call upon Ms. Harris to do the right thing, as her office did in (Prop 8) and refrain from appealing a decision that she knows is right, prudent and just."" Harris had refused to defend Proposition 8, the California voter-approved law that declared same-sex marriage unconstitutional. She and the governor believed the voter initiative infringed on the civil rights of same-sex couples. Their actions paved the way for the case to reach the Supreme Court, which later ruled in favor of allowing same sex couples to marry. As the 45 days ticked down, Aviram thought she was right about Harris. ""So imagine our surprise when, a couple of days before the clock runs out, the attorney general decides to appeal the decision,"" Aviram said. ""It was an upsetting piece of news to receive."" Soon after, Aviram said she got a call from an assistant to Harris who explained the appeal was being filed because the judge's reasoning was flawed. But Aviram saw Harris' actions as ""hardly consistent with her personal opposition to the death penalty."" ""You are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,"" she told CNN. ""If you truly believe that they're morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it's an imperative to do so."" As California Attorney General, Kamala Harris won an appeal to keep the death penalty available in the state. Harris' campaign did not provide answers to CNN questions about the death penalty appeal. While Harris' filing of the appeal disappointed anti-death penalty advocates across California, the decision was praised by the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board as an appropriate one for the attorney general, ""putting professional responsibility over personal politics."" But the newspaper also cited Harris' inconsistency in not supporting Proposition 8. ""... Harris' response to the two cases suggests a willingness to pick and choose the limits of professional obligation."" The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the attorney general's argument and overturned the lower court ruling. The death penalty was once again part of California's penal system. Until this year. In March, California's new Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order putting a moratorium on the state's death penalty, calling it ""ineffective, irreversible and immoral."" Under Newsom's order, all 737 inmates on death row were granted reprieves. It's a decision Presidential candidate Harris immediately hailed. In a statement she said, ""I applaud Governor Newsom for his decision to put a moratorium on this deeply flawed system of capital punishment in California."" Aviram has examined Harris' law enforcement career and calls her a progressive prosecutor, but still criticizes her action on the death penalty appeal.

A full picture For Renata Espinoza, the appeal over the death penalty added to her confusion about Harris. ""It feels like, why are you changing your mind now? Why couldn't you change your mind back then and put your feelings aside?"" Espinoza told CNN she agreed to an interview now for two reasons. Renata Espinoza says Kamala Harris showed her no compassion when her police officer husband was killed 15 years ago. The first is for voters to have a full picture of the candidate and her humanity. ""You're trying to be President of the United States. That's a lot. Are you going to show compassion? Are you going to be 'for the people'? Or are you going to be for yourself?"" she asks of the candidate, referencing her 'for the people' slogan. The second, and more important, was for Isaac. He was the brave and loud one in their marriage, Espinoza said, and she preferred to let him do the talking. But he can't talk now. Isaac Espinoza with his baby daughter. She was three when he was killed. ""He just believed in fairness,"" said Espinoza. ""The way things went down with her, that wasn't fair. He always fought for the little guy and he loved doing it. With us, she was careless. And now you're running for President. I don't think her actions back then are those Isaac would approve of."""

"Sen. Amy Klobuchar raises $5.2 million for White House bid, campaign says - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Fredreka Schouten,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/amy-klobuchar-first-quarter-fundraising-numbers/index.html,"WASHINGTON (CNN) Sen. Amy Klobuchar raised more than $5.2 million in the first seven weeks of her presidential bid, the Minnesota Democrat's campaign announced Monday.
Her fundraising haul appeared to edge her just past another senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Cory Booker, who raised about $5 million. But Klobuchar, now in her third Senate term, ranks behind the early leaders in fundraising -- led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who collected $18.2 million during the first 41 days of his campaign, and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who raised $12 million in the first quarter. Klobuchar's fundraising also lagged behind that of former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, who entered the race more than a month after the Minnesotan and collected $9.4 million in just 18 days. He benefited from an enormous donor base built during his 2018 Senate bid. His strength as a small-dollar fundraiser helped him collect a record-smashing $80 million on his way to losing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Klobuchar coasted to re-election in Minnesota last fall and ended her Senate campaign with more than $3 million in leftover funds. Those reserves helped her start April with $7 million remaining in the bank. Two other Democratic contenders have announced how much money they have remaining in their bank accounts: Sanders with $28 million and Booker with $6.1 million. Read More The fundraising totals offer an early snapshot of the financial strength of candidates in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump in the general election. Some of Klobuchar's fundraising has included higher-dollar events where she raised money for both the primary and general elections. Money raised for the general election would not be available to her until she received her party's nod. Her campaign's news release did not break out how much money specifically was raised for the primary. ""Since that snowy day we launched in February, the outpouring of support has been incredible,"" Klobuchar said Monday on Twitter, referring to her outdoor campaign announcement in the middle of a Minnesota snowstorm. She said her campaign had received donations from every state. With at least 17 contenders already declared and others waiting in the wings, no Democratic candidate is posting record-breaking totals. Democrat Hillary Clinton, for instance, raised an eye-popping $47.5 million during her first quarter of the 2016 presidential race. Given the intense competition for the nomination in 2020, candidates' ability to draw in new, small-dollar donors who can contribute repeatedly will be a key test of their staying power ahead of the Iowa caucuses, which are nearly 10 months away. Klobuchar's aides said she attracted nearly 100,000 online donors with an average online donation of $40. In addition, 85% of all donors contributed less than $100, her campaign said. Klobuchar did not disclose how many people in total contributed to her campaign. In the news release, her campaign aides said Klobuchar's bid would be ""homegrown"" and emphasized that she already has visited 10 states and met with ""thousands of voters"" in her fight for the nomination."
"Glaciers could disappear from several mountain ranges this century, study says - CNN",us.cnn.com,"Nina Avramova, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/world/global-glaciers-sea-levels-study-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Most glaciers in Central Europe, Western Canada and the United States would vanish in the second half of this century under the current rates of ice loss, according to a new report.
Glaciers have lost over 9,000 billion tons of ice between 1961 and 2016, according to a research letter published in the journal Nature on Monday. This amounts to a block of ice the size of Germany and almost 100 feet thick, or the size of the United States and 4 feet thick, said lead author Michael Zemp. How climate change is revealing, and threatening, thawing relics ""Under current loss rates we are going to lose glaciers -- basically all glaciers -- in several mountain ranges,"" said Zemp, who is a lecturer in glaciology at the University of Zurich. This ice loss has also meant global sea levels increased by up to 27 millimeters over the time period, said the letter, which was authored by 15 international scientists. This accounts for between 25% to 30% of the observed increase in global sea levels. In this latest research, the team used data from over 19,000 glaciers, including satellite observation and 450 field visits. That's far more than previous studies, which Zemp said relied on data from around 500 glaciers. Read More Glaciers are ""icons of climate change,"" the authors said, and the research suggests glacier loss may be larger than previously reported. In addition to raising sea levels, Zemp said that melting glaciers can destabilize mountain ridges. Glaciers can also be an important water source for agriculture. For example, in the Peruvian Andes, he said, households depend on local glacier water in dry seasons. Greenland's most critical glacier is suddenly gaining ice, but that might not be a good thing By comparing current ice loss rates with remaining ice volume the researchers found that glaciers in several regions, including in the European Alps, New Zealand and Western Canada, will disappear within this century. ""But behind that there is a second bad message,"" said Zemp. That mesage? In more heavily glaciated regions, such as the Canadian Arctic, the melting of glaciers has only just ""kicked in,"" meaning that these glaciers will continue to raise sea levels beyond 2100. Glaciers in other regions, such as the European Alps and New Zealand, also saw significant ice losses, the study said, but they played a small role when it comes to rising global sea levels because of the regions' small glacierized areas. Currently, up to 335 billion tons of ice are lost each year, the study found. This translates into an increase in sea levels of nearly 1 millimeter per year, according to the calculations. Calculations of changes in global glacier mass can be further improved, the researchers noted. One way to do this would be to have more observational data, especially from regions that are more likely to contribute to future sea level increases, such as Alaska, Arctic Canada and the Russian Arctic.

Martin Siegert, co-director at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and Environment at Imperial College London said that the research confirmed what glaciologists had expected for some time -- ""that glaciers around the world are contributing as much to sea level rise as the Greenland Ice Sheet."" Siegert was not involved in the new research. ""At the moment, their state of health is critical to how sea levels will rise over the coming decades,"" he said in an email. ""The outlook is bleak for these glaciers, however, with melting entirely over the coming century."""
Adam Schiff rejects Michael Cohen bid for help delaying prison term - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Manu Raju,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/adam-schiff-michael-cohen/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff is signaling he has no intention of helping Michael Cohen's quest to delay his upcoming three-year prison sentence after attorneys for President Donald Trump's former fixer informed lawmakers he had just gained access to troves of new records and could provide even more information to investigators.
""I don't get involved in sentencing matters as a practice. I never have in Congress and that's been my policy,"" Schiff told CNN on Monday when asked about Cohen's request. Cohen's attorneys wrote last week to Democratic leaders of the committees where he testified in February and March, saying the President's former personal attorney needs to be ""readily accessible and immediately available"" to Congress in part because he was able to recently access a hard drive with 14 million files, consisting of emails, voice recordings and other information. Cohen's lawyers asked lawmakers to write letters outlining his cooperation during his public and private testimony as well as with the ""substantial trove of new information,"" something the attorneys could use to lobby authorities in the Southern District of New York for a delayed sentence. Lanny Davis, Cohen's attorney, told CNN on Monday that his client is asking lawmakers only to send letters to Cohen's attorneys stating his cooperation, adding that he is not asking the members of Congress to communicate with the courts. Read More Davis notes the letter ""did not ask members of Congress to communicate with the court or prosecutors nor imply any quid pro quo regarding Mr. Cohen's willingness to cooperate."" ""There is no doubt that Mr. Cohen's testimony, both public and private, has contributed substantially, with documents and other evidence, to triggering additional areas for investigation by law enforcement authorities and Congress,"" says the letter from Cohen's attorneys to lawmakers. Trump says he's not concerned with contents of Michael Cohen's hard drive Lawmakers who received the Cohen request include House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, who has yet to say whether he would agree to help. Cohen is scheduled to start his sentence on May 6 after he pleaded guilty to financial crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. His lawyers wrote in last week's letter that he had gained access only recently to the hard drive with millions of files that could be helpful to investigators. They also argued that Cohen's congressional testimony had demonstrated his cooperation both with congressional probes and the criminal investigations into Trump and his businesses. In his testimony earlier this year, Cohen accused his former client, Trump, of financial fraud and directing hush-money payments to women alleging affairs. ""We hope that this memorandum demonstrates that Mr. Cohen needs to be readily accessible and immediately available to provide ongoing assistance to Congress in order for it to fulfill its executive branch oversight responsibilities,"" the letter states. ""However, with 30 days left before he surrenders to prison, time is no longer a luxury he is capable of."" Schiff told CNN on Monday that he was nevertheless interested in receiving any new information from Cohen, regardless of his prison sentence. ""We continue to encourage Mr. Cohen to provide us any materials that he has that are relevant to our investigation,"" Schiff said. ""We will continue to do so and hope that he has additional information to offer."""
Trump naming career Secret Service member to take over agency - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/secret-service-james-murray/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has chosen a ""career member"" of the Secret Service to be its new director starting in May, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced Monday afternoon.
Sanders' announcement of the selection of James Murray followed the news that Trump was removing the current director of the Secret Service, Randolph ""Tex"" Alles, amid a shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security. In her statement announcing the move, Sanders described Murray as ""a career member"" of the US Secret Service. A brief biography of Murray provided by the Secret Service said he is a New Jersey native who attended the University of Scranton and Seton Hall University before starting a career as an Army Reserve officer and a special agent in the Department of Transportation. Murray has been in the Secret Service since 1995, according to the biography, beginning in New York before joining the presidential protective division in 2001. He held various positions in the agency from there, including as a liaison to Congress, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Washington field office and the agent in charge of the agency's training center in Maryland. Read More Alles said in an email to Secret Service employees obtained by CNN that his incoming successor ""is a consummate professional"" and that he was confident in Murray, whom he referred to as the agency's assistant director of the office of protective operations. Murray wrote a letter to the National Park Service under that title last year requesting a closure for sidewalks under the Park Service's jurisdiction around the White House complex during a white nationalist protest that was scheduled to take place in Washington. Justice Department news releases in 2016 named Murray as a special agent in charge at the Secret Service's Washington field office, and repeated releases from the Justice Department showed Murray joining with federal officials in that role to announce sentences for people convicted of financial crimes in the Washington area. The announced choice of Murray contrasted with Trump's choice earlier in his presidency to name Alles, a retired Marine general and Customs and Border Protection official, to head of the agency responsible for the security of himself and his family."
Zhang hearing exposes Secret Service weaknesses at Mar-a-Lago - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/secret-service-mar-a-lago-zhang/index.html,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) The Chinese national Yujing Zhang's hearing in a Florida federal courthouse Monday afternoon highlighted missteps by the Secret Service at virtually the same time news broke that the Secret Service director was being fired.
In all, it amounted to a bumpy afternoon for the agency that protects the President. As word spread Monday that Secret Service director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was leaving, a Secret Service agent took the stand to testify about the woman who had allegedly gained unauthorized access to President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club on March 30 and could be engaged in a spying operation. Zhang faces two criminal charges, for lying and for entering the restricted grounds while Trump was there. She has not entered a plea and is being held in a Florida jail. The hour of court testimony Monday from agent Samuel Ivanovich, guided by Zhang's defense attorney Robert Adler, revealed just how serious the security breach around the President that day had been. Read More Adler, through his questioning, prompted Ivanovich to admit the following details about the Secret Service's process with Zhang and at the private club. Malware began downloading automatically The Secret Service had confiscated a thumb drive (and several other electronics) from Zhang that she had carried into Mar-a-Lago. When an agent went to run an analysis on the drive, inserting it into a computer, it immediately began downloading a file. The Secret Service had called it ""malicious malware."" Woman accused of illegal entry to Mar-a-Lago had numerous electronic devices, thousands in cash It was ""very out of the ordinary"" -- an authorized download they had never seen before, Ivanovich testified. The agent looking at the drive immediately stopped analyzing it and shut down his computer when he realized what was happening. In a statement, a law enforcement official speaking on background said that anytime the agency does a forensic analysis on an electronic device, it is done in a controlled environment and on a stand-alone computer, not a Secret Service network computer. Those protocols were followed in this case, the official said. No video surveillance at Secret Service entry checkpoint Audio and video surveillance at Mar-a-Lago didn't catch Zhang's entrance to the club -- because those surveillance devices weren't used by the Secret Service at the entry checkpoint. They did check two passports she carried, though. Even 7-Eleven convenience stores have video cameras, the defense attorney pointed out. Did not record audio during interview When the Secret Service questioned Zhang at the agency's office after removing her from Mar-a-Lago, the agency videotaped her interview. But unbeknown to the agent who led the questioning, the office didn't record audio of the interview. The room where she was interviewed didn't have that capability. Audio recording capability, the agent had thought, was a standard practice in Secret Service offices. Mar-a-Lago staff determines who gets in The Secret Service appeared to rely on Mar-a-Lago staff to determine whether people should be admitted through the security perimeter into the club when the President was there, allowing for the issue of whether Zhang was related to a club member to arise, according to Ivanovich's testimony. It's up to a ""host committee"" to decide who accesses a site that's under Secret Service restrictions, the agent said. The President was not on the club grounds during the time Zhang allegedly attempted to enter. No protocol for flagging multiple phones The agency also didn't have a protocol to flag the amount or types of electronics Zhang carried with her -- even though one had malware that even an agent performing an analysis on the device found to be unusual. ""We don't deny someone for having so many cell phones. That's not a direct violation of our restricted access,"" Ivanovich told the judge. Zhang had four phones and other devices -- plus she left several more, including a radio signal detector, in her hotel room nearby. Trump is removing US Secret Service director Language barrier Zhang was clearly a Chinese national, with two Chinese passports, her first language Mandarin. But Ivanovich and others in the Secret Service took hours to bring in an available agent who spoke Mandarin and could help translate during her interview. The Secret Service spoke with her -- and she answered them -- in English during more than four hours of questions, Ivanovich said. Her facility with reading English and responses led them to believe she had no trouble with the language. But language, the Secret Service had said, had led to the confusion over her relation to a Mar-a-Lago member. Once the Mandarin-speaking agent was involved, he would speak with her to give her ""further understanding"" in the interview, Ivanovich said. Zhang used a translator in court on Monday to listen to the proceedings, but answered questions from the judge in English. The breach has led Democrats in Congress to ask for more information about security at Mar-a-Lago. The criminal complaint filed by prosecutors and the Secret Service against Zhang last week highlighted how a Mar-a-Lago beach club manager erroneously thought Zhang was related to a member. The President, whose family business owns the club, has called Zhang's entrance onto the property a fluke and said he wasn't concerned."
Felicity Huffman and 12 wealthy parents plead guilty in college admissions scam - CNN,us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/felicity-huffman-guilty-admissions/index.html,"(CNN) Thirteen wealthy parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, and one coach will plead guilty to using bribery and other forms of fraud as part of the college admissions scandal , federal prosecutors in Boston said on Monday.
Huffman, the ""Desperate Housewives"" star, pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to a fake charity associated with Rick Singer to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs, the complaint says. She faces up to 20 years in prison. In exchange for Huffman's plea, federal prosecutors will recommend incarceration at the ""low end"" of the sentencing range, a $20,000 fine and 12 months of supervised release. They will not bring further charges. A federal judge will have the final say on the outcome for Huffman and the other defendants. ""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" she said in a statement. Read More ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly. Cheat. Bribe. Lie. Here's how the college admissions scam allegedly worked ""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty,"" she said in the statement. Huffman, Gregory and Marcia Abbott, Jane Buckingham, Gordon Caplan, Robert Flaxman, Agustin Huneeus Jr., Marjorie Klapper, Peter Jan Sartorio, Stephen Semprevivo and Devin Sloane were all charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and have agreed to plead guilty, prosecutors said. Bruce Isackson and Davina Isackson will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Bruce Isackson will also plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the IRS for taking a tax deduction for the bribe. Finally, Michael Center, the former men's tennis coach at the University of Texas, agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Prosecutors recommended a range of sentences for those pleading guilty, from 12 to 18 months and unspecified ""low end"" amounts such as Huffman's recommended sentence. More than a dozen guilty pleas Actress Lori Loughlin arrives at federal court in Boston on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, to face charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal. Rick Singer, who ran a college prep business, masterminded what prosecutors called the largest college admissions cheating scheme ever prosecuted in the United States. Singer helped wealthy parents cheat on standardized tests for their children, and he bribed college coaches to falsely designate the children as recruited athletes, smoothing their path to admission. The scheme helped the students get into highly selective universities like Yale, Stanford, University of Southern California and UCLA. Several of the central figures in the case have already pleaded guilty, including Singer. Yale women's soccer coach Rudy Meredith, who accepted a bribe to help a student get admitted, and Mark Riddell, who cheated for the students on the SATs and ACTs, have agreed to plead guilty and are cooperating witnesses for the prosecution. The outrageous steps parents allegedly took to get their kids into elite schools John Vandemoer, Stanford University's former sailing head coach, has also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering. But a number of the defendants in the case have given no signs of a coming guilty plea, including ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli. Loughlin and Giannulli allegedly agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team, easing their acceptance to the school. What Huffman did The criminal complaint says Huffman and Singer exchanged multiple emails about how to get extra time on her daughters' SAT. They then arranged for Huffman's daughter to take the SAT at a location controlled by an administrator who had been bribed by Singer, the complaint states. Riddell, the brains of the operation, then flew from Tampa to California to cheat on the test for Huffman's daughter. How 34 recorded phone calls helped prosecutors bring down the college admissions scam Huffman's daughter received a score of 1420 out of a maximum of 1600 on the SAT, a score about 400 points over her Preliminary SAT exam a year earlier. Huffman later discussed the scheme in a recorded phone call with Singer, the complaint says. In court last week, Huffman acknowledged her rights, charges and the maximum possible penalties. She waived a pretrial hearing, signed conditions of her release and then was free to leave. Her husband, the actor William H. Macy, is not charged in the case. Prosecutors will be asking for jail time for all defendants, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. The defendants are facing anywhere between six to 21 months in prison if convicted or if they plead guilty, the official added, though the exact sentence would depend on a number of factors. USC, Georgetown University and other schools implicated in the scheme have said they are reviewing the admissions of students accused of participating. Yale and Stanford have each expelled students associated with the scam."

14 tons of pangolin scales seized in Singapore in a single smuggling bust,us.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/asia/singapore-pangolin-smuggling-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Authorities in Singapore have seized one of the largest ever shipments of pangolin scales en route to Vietnam, worth an estimated $38.7 million.
In a statement , customs officials said they inspected a 40-foot container passing through Singapore from Nigeria and labeled as ""frozen beef."" Inside was over 14 tons of pangolin scales, packed in 230 bags, along with almost 180 kilograms (around 400 pounds) of cut up and carved elephant ivory. Fourteen tons is around the same weight as two to three African elephants, or around eight Toyota Camrys. A scale-covered, cat-sized nocturnal mammal that survives on ants and termites, pangolin are among the most trafficked animals in the world. In China and Vietnam, they are eaten as a delicacy and used in traditional medicine, with their keratin rich scales believed to have a host of positive benefits -- including aiding breastfeeding and curing asthma or cancer -- none of which is supported by science. Pangolin scales seized by customs officials in Singapore this month. This demand has put multiple pangolin species on the endangered list , with the Chinese Pangolin listed by the International Union for Conservation as ""critically endangered,"" one step above being extinct in the wild. Read More All eight pangolin species are protected under national and international laws, but smuggling pangolin scales and meat remains highly lucrative and efforts to crack down on the trade have had limited success. For some Indian farmers, pangolin poaching is too lucrative to resist In India, which has a domestic pangolin species, the scales from a single pangolin can provide a ""life-changing sum of money"" for people living in some of the country's poorest communities. The pangolin's defense mechanism against predators -- rolling itself into a scaly ball -- unfortunately makes it easy prey for human hunters. Pangolin poaching is illegal in India, but is nevertheless widespread in Assam, a state in the country's northeast, near the border with Myanmar and China. A single pangolin can be worth a year's salary for hunters, making prevention difficult. Poaching also occurs in Africa, which has four native species of pangolin. The animals are also hunted for bush meat. Scales are often seized as they pass through major Asian shipping hubs such as Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which have stepped up efforts to crack down on illegal animal smuggling. In February, authorities in Hong Kong seized $8 million worth of smuggled endangered species in one of the biggest busts the city has ever recorded. The haul included 8.3 tons of pangolin scales and 2.1 tons of ivory, also from a shipment of supposed ""frozen beef"" from Nigeria."
Meet the latest weapons in the war against wildfire ... goats,us.cnn.com,"Sarah Lazarus, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/americas/goats-and-wildfires-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""We are living in a tinderbox,"" says Reinette Senum.
Senum is the vice mayor of Nevada City. Nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 147 miles northeast of San Francisco, the town's streets are lined with characterful wooden houses that date back to the late 19th century. Nevada City's historic downtown. Senum is terrified that Nevada City -- home to 3,100 people -- will go up in flames. Wildfires are a growing problem in California -- 15 of the 20 largest fires since 1932 have taken place in the last 20 years. As climate change makes California's weather ever hotter and drier, this trend is set to continue . According to the US National Climate Assessment , climate change is responsible for half of the forestland burned by wildfire in western states since the mid 1980s, and burned areas in southwest California could double by 2050 . Read More Nevada City is especially vulnerable because it is a patchwork of urban streets and forests -- with no separation between the two. Senum says that the 450 acres of wild land within the city limits are ""choked"" with overgrown -- and highly combustible -- vegetation. Nevada City sits in a beautiful -- but flammable -- landscape. Senum had been investigating ways to reduce the town's fire risk for years but Camp Fire , which killed 85 people in northern California, and incinerated the town of Paradise last November, spurred her efforts. Paradise is less than 80 miles from Nevada City and the tragedy there was a ""call to action,"" says Senum. Obtaining government grants is a slow process, so last December Senum launched a crowdfunding campaign -- Goat Fund Me . Funds will be used to rent herds of goats to chomp down vegetation and create firebreaks that prevent wildfires jumping from trees and plants to homes and businesses. A search and rescue crew member searches for human remains at a mobile home park in Paradise which was destroyed on November 21, 2018. A goat's work is never done Using goats to help prevent wildfire is a growing trend across California and other western states in the US. Johnny Gonzales runs Environmental Land Management which operates a herd of 1,200 goats that work in cities throughout southern California. He says interest in goats is at an all-time high. Other goat rental companies include Goats R Us, Rent a Goat and Goats on the Go. Environmental Land Management's goats hard at work around southern California. Fortunately, goats are tireless in their appetites. They can eat 8 to 10 lbs of food a day -- up to about 9% of their body weight, says Gonzales. His goats are taken to work in stock trucks and trailers, having been 'acclimated' to the urban environment so that the din of honking car horns and wailing police sirens does not frighten them. Contained by low voltage electric fences, the goats are accompanied by a human herder and guardian dogs which protect them from predators including coyotes, bobcats and mountain lions. Great Pyrenees guardian dogs protect grazing goats from predators. One of Gonzales' clients is Anaheim Fire and Rescue. Their Public Information Officer, Daron Wyatt, says goats have been deployed for about three years in areas where wild land encroaches on the urban environment, with great success. ""They're very effective and it's a great method of clearing the vegetation in an environmentally friendly way,"" he says. The goats gobble tall grasses, shrubs, bushes and small trees. Nimble and hardy, they can work on steep, rocky terrain that's difficult for humans to navigate, says Wyatt. Johnny Gonzales' goats at work in Lemon Grove, near San Diego. The goats do have some human assistance though -- crews follow them, where possible, and use chainsaws and pruning shears to cut down the thicker trunks and branches that the goats can't chew through. Fueling the fire Lynn Huntsinger, professor of range ecology and management at the University of California, Berkeley, says that California has seen an increase in ""fuel"" -- the term fire experts use to describe ""dead plants."" Huntsinger, who used to keep goats in the backyard of her Bay Area home, says the fire problem has its roots in history. In the past, Native Americans lit fires to control the vegetation, she says. These deliberate burns created a landscape of open grasslands, so wildfires were smaller and less frequent. As grasses have been replaced by shrubs and trees in California, the risk of large fires -- such as this one that took place in the Stanislaus National Forest on July 22, 2018 -- has grown. That changed with the arrival of colonial settlers. They did not understand how ""using fire prevented fire,"" and banned deliberate burns from around the turn of the 20th century, says Huntsinger. Over time, the grasses were replaced with different types of woody shrubs -- collectively called brush -- which have since grown out of control. The Camp Fire moves through the town of Paradise on November 8, 2018. Suburban sprawl has also increased the threat and scale of damage. ""Our land use planning has been oblivious to the danger of mixing houses and brush,"" says Huntsinger, pointing to Camp Fire as a classic example of people living in a ""highly flammable environment."" The problem was exacerbated by California's record-beating drought which started in 2011 and was only declared over last month , having killed more than 100 million trees . Along with the brush, they provide a huge source of highly incendiary fuel for future fires. Source: Nik Childers
""Goats are very good at eating brush, says Huntsinger. ""These shrubs tend to be distasteful to most animals, but goats like them."" Huntsinger also advocates the use of cattle and sheep in fire prevention. They pair well with goats because they eat different plants.

Libya's UN-backed government condemns airport airstrike as 'war crime',us.cnn.com,Eliza Mackintosh,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/africa/libya-airstrike-tripoli-airport-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Tripoli's only working airport was targeted in an airstrike on Monday, as forces loyal to renegade Libyan general Khalifa Haftar continued their advance on the capital, ignoring international calls for a truce.
Mitiga airport, in the eastern quarter of Tripoli, was shuttered after it was attacked by Haftar's so-called Libyan National Army (LNA). Libya's United Nations-backed government, the Government of National Accord (GNA), quickly condemned the aerial bombardment, calling it a war crime. There is also fighting around Tripoli's international airport, 15 miles south of the city center, which has not been operational for years. The GNA admitted Monday that it temporarily lost control of the site to Haftar's fighters. ""Haftar forces attacked Tripoli four days ago, mainly from the south and got as far as controlling Tripoli international airport,"" a GNA official told CNN Monday. ""As of yesterday and today, Monday, Haftar forces have been pushed back and Tripoli secured."" The same official said militias from the coastal towns of Misrata and Zawia -- which are not under the GNA's direct control -- deployed troops to the capital as part of the counter-offensive against the LNA. Luggage trolleys lie in front of the gate of the Mitiga airport after it was attacked Monday. Read More Years of fighting among various militias in the war-torn country have reached a crescendo in recent days, as Haftar pushes to take control of the capital. The UN said that 3,400 people have been displaced in the upsurge of violence since Haftar ordered LNA forces to march on Tripoli Thursday. Twenty-one people have been killed and 27 injured in the conflict, according to Libya al Ahrar TV, quoting Libya's Ministry of Health. The UN and France made shows of support Monday for the GNA's leader, Fayez al-Sarraj, whom Haftar is seeking to unseat. The UN Secretary General's Special Representative, Ghassan Salame, met Sarraj in his office in Tripoli to discuss ways the UN Support Mission in Libya ""can assist at this critical and difficult juncture,"" UNSMIL said on Twitter. France, meanwhile, said that it wanted Sarraj to remain a ""key player"" in ongoing efforts to negotiate peace between the GNA and Haftar's forces. ""France would like Sarraj's government to remain a key player and to try and conclude the peace process negotiated in Abu Dhabi,"" a spokesperson for French President Emmanuel Macron told CNN. The European Union pleaded for a humanitarian truce on Monday, a day after warring parties ignored a UN call for a two-hour halt to fighting. US pulls troops from Libya amid a surge in violence Departing from the EU's prepared agenda to express concerns about Libya, the EU's top foreign policy official Federica Mogherini called for ""full implementation of the humanitarian truce to allow the civilians and the wounded to be evacuated from the city and to avoid any further military action and any further military escalation."" Emergency services have so far been unable to reach casualties and civilians amid the violence. Refugees and migrants in detention centers are particularly at risk, according to the UN. Clashes are affecting residential areas, trapping civilians, and fighting has damaged electricity lines, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement Monday. The flare in fighting in Libya forced the United States military to pull a contingent of its troops from the country over the weekend. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling on Haftar to stop the offensive. ""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,"" he said in a statement Sunday. In the eight years since Moammar Gadhafi was deposed and killed in the 2011 conflict, Haftar has been one of a handful of strongmen to take advantage of the nation's descent into disarray. Based in the city of Benghazi, Haftar wields control over much of eastern Libya, and has his sights set on Tripoli. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Benghazi last week for talks with Haftar to push for an international peace deal, but left empty handed. Following their meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya ""with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli."" The UN repeated Guterres' calls for a political solution on Monday."
China launches app to teach schoolkids 'belief in the party',us.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/asia/china-students-socialist-theory-app-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Kids in the United States may be busy playing Fortnite and Apex Legends, but their Chinese counterparts are getting into socialist theory.

According to the state-run Global Times , the new app and website is designed to help elementary and middle school-aged children ""learn about new socialist thought and Chinese classics as part of a campaign to consolidate their belief in the party and inspire them to be reliable socialist successors."" Lessons on the platform -- run by the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party -- include "" I am Chinese ,"" which introduces children to the country's ""56 ethnic groups living in harmony,"" and "" Building a well-off society .""

Its launch follows the success of Study Powerful Country -- Xuexi Qiangguo, also translated as Study the Great Nation -- an app designed for adults to better understand Xi Jinping Thought, launched earlier this year . That app -- nicknamed Xi's digital ""little red book"" after Chairman Mao's famous tract -- has shot up the app store charts , as all 90 million Communist Party members, as well as many employees of state-owned enterprises have been ordered to download it. In a notice issued to party members in Hunan province, promotion of the app was described as a mandatory ""ideological task"" for cadres around the country. Users can earn scores by reading articles about Xi and watching videos, something which has led many to attempt to hack the process , assuming that a high score could be beneficial down the line. One tool , hosted on the code-sharing site Github, promises to help users ""learn automatically"" on the app. Others meanwhile, have turned to more old-fashioned approaches.

This photo illustratration from February shows a phone app called ""Xuexi Qiangguo"" or ""Study to make China strong"" with an image of China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing. According to David Bandurski, an expert on Chinese propaganda at the University of Hong Kong, the app is part of a new approach designed to ensure that the party's message was getting through in the smartphone age. ""Once engagement with the app is enforced by administrative demands that it be installed and used, something that is already happening, the messages of the party become inescapable,"" he wrote in February . ""Gone are the days when you can simply ignore that stack of party newspapers in the corner of the office, or switch off the party's nightly newcast, 'Xinwen Lianbo'."" Both Study Powerful Country and the new app for kids build on a burgeoning cult of personality around Xi , which has seen him raised to a prominence and level of power no Chinese leader has held since Mao. While at times state media has appeared to wish to roll back this propaganda push -- dropping the use of Xi Dada, a nickname for the President -- it has ramped back up in recent months, as China prepares to mark a number of key anniversaries this year, including the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic."
"Iran's Revolutionary Guards, explained",us.cnn.com,Tamara Qiblawi,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/middleeast/iran-revolutionary-guards-explainer-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The United States put Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist groups on Monday. The unprecedented move against another country's armed forces is bound to rachet up tensions with Tehran. Here's what you need to know.
What is the Revolutionary Guard and what does it do? The IRGC is an elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country's revolution in 1979. The unit is at the forefront of Iran's military operations in the region -- it has a significant presence in Iraq and Syria, where its troops and advisors have played a major role in the fight against ISIS , and have sometimes been within miles of US military positions. There are more than 150,000 troops in the IRGC, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. These include ground forces, naval and air forces, as well as intelligence and special forces. Their primary role is internal security but experts say that the group -- considered Iran's dominant military force -- assist Iran's regular army, which has roughly 350,000 soldiers, with external defense. Trump backs Netanyahu, but will voters? Your guide to Israel's elections Read More In 2009, the Guards' Basij branch -- one of five IRGC subgroups-- cracked down hard on anti-government demonstrations in the wake of a contested election, helping to secure the position of hardline then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The Revolutionary Guard chief, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, reports to directly to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is not only Iran's most powerful military institution, it holds deep influence over domestic politics and the economy, with interests extending to and beyond the construction, telecommunications, auto and energy industries The IRGC and the United States The Revolutionary Guards have long been in the crosshairs of successive US administrations. In 2007, the US Treasury Department designated the Quds Force -- a Revolutionary Guards unit in charge of foreign operations -- as a supporter of ""terrorism,"" describing it as Iran's ""primary arm for executing its policy of supporting terrorist and insurgent groups."" After US President Donald Trump took office, he withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and set about clamping down on Tehran's influence in the Middle East, re-imposing a strict sanctions regime that was designed in part to curb the influence of the Guards. US allies in the region also consider the Revolutionary Guards a major security threat, and Bahrain and Saudi Arabia added the IRGC to their terror lists last year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently railed about the Guard's military activity in the region. Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the IRGC's Quds Force. The US claims that the Revolutionary Guards' presence in Syria -- where it helps support the armed forces of the Syrian government -- is a direct threat to Israel. ""Under the cover of the Syrian war, the IRGC is now trying to plant military roots in Syria and establish a new strategic base to threaten Syria's neighbors such as Israel,"" Brian Hook, the State Department's special representative for Iran, told reporters last Tuesday. Hook also said that Iran was responsible for the deaths of at least 608 US service members in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq. ""This accounts for 17 percent of all deaths of US personnel in Iraq from 2003 and 2011. This death toll is in addition to the many thousands of Iraqis killed by the IRGC's proxies,"" he added. What impact will the terror designation have on Iran and the rest of the region? Experts believe the designation could bring the US and Iran ever closer to a direct military confrontation and dash any hopes of reviving talks over the 2015 nuclear deal. The move had also been met with internal resistance in the Trump administration because of concerns about US troops in the Middle East. ""The impact (of the terror designation) could be a heightening of barriers to dialogue with Iran,"" said Al Monitor Associate Editor Mohammad Ali Shabani. ""It displays an ambition by proponents of confrontation with Iran to restrict Trump's deal-making instinct, and also to make it as difficult as possible for the next US president to engage with the Islamic Republic."" The designation also risks impacting US relations with countries in the region that have direct relations with the Iranian government, including Lebanon and Iraq, where Shia-led armed groups are supported by the IRGC and are represented in the governments of those countries. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend the group photo at the Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East on February 14, 2019 in Warsaw, Poland. ""In the shorter term, (the terror designation) also represents an attempt to impose an 'either with us or against us' approach to several governments in the region, namely Lebanon and Iraq,"" said Shabani. Revolutionary Guards chief Jafari has already promised retaliation. ""If reports prove to be true that the stupid US administration intends to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization, then the IRGC will also specify the US army as a group (and target) like [ISIS] in all parts of the world, especially the Middle East,"" the commander was Quote: d as saying in the semi-official Fars News agency. The Trump administration's move has already drawn praise from Israel, one of Iran's biggest regional rivals. On Monday, Netanyahu tweeted, ""Thank you for responding to another one of my important requests, that serves our interests and the interests of regional countries."""
A couple from New York has been missing for almost two weeks since visiting the Dominican Republic,us.cnn.com,Lauren del Valle,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/americas/missing-americans-dominican-republic/index.html,"(CNN) Cheryl Freeman shared just a day of vacation bliss in the Dominican Republic with Orlando Moore and Portia Ravenelle.
But her memories could help determine the whereabouts of the missing couple. Moore and Ravenelle were supposed to return to New York from the Dominican Republic on March 27, Moore's half-sister said. But Moore's family has not heard from him since he left for the Dominican Republican on March 23 from Newark Liberty International Airport, Lashay Turner said. The couple left a car at the airport. Portia Ravenelle, left, went sightseeing with Canadians Carter Warrington, center, and Cheryl Freeman, right. Police on the island have not publicly confirmed the identities of the missing couple. Manuel Mateo, the captain of the Dominican Republic's National Police, said the agency is investigating the disappearance of a couple from New York. Read More Investigators are meeting Monday night to gather details to release to the public, National Police spokesman Col. Frank Felix Durán Mejia told CNN. It is not clear when the information will be released. In the meantime, Freeman and her boyfriend are believed to be among the last people who spent time with the couple on their final day in Samana, a resort town about 2.5 hours from the capital of Santo Domingo. Freeman fondly remembers the couple, whom she had hoped to keep in touch with after she returned to Canada. ""They were very sweet people,"" said Freeman, an accountant in Halifax, Nova Scotia. ""Orlando is so friendly he could make friends with anyone."" This is Freeman's account of the time she spent with the missing couple. Carter Warrington, left, met Orlando Moore at the resort where they were both staying. A chance encounter on a cart ride Freeman and her boyfriend Carter Warrington stayed at the same all-inclusive resort as Moore and Ravenelle, the Grand Bahia Principe Cayacoa. On the morning of March 25, the two couples met on a cart ride from their villas to the breakfast buffet, Freeman said. Immediately, the couple was friendly and invited Freeman and Warrington to eat breakfast with them. After breakfast, the couple parted ways and exchanged emails so they could meet up the next day, Tuesday, March 26. Horseback riding and waterfalls After breakfast Tuesday, the foursome sat by the pool, drinking piña coladas until it started to rain, Freeman said. They agreed to meet in the lobby at 12:30 p.m. to find a waterfall, Freeman said. Moore told them he had made friends with the hotel bartender the night before, Freeman said, and the bartender sent them to a friend in El Limón for sightseeing. Moore drove the four in a white Kia rental car to El Limón, where they met the bartender's friend. Orlando Moore told fellow resort guests that the hotel bartender recommended a guide for horseback riding. For $20 per person, the friend took them horseback riding up a mountain and down to a valley where they spent the afternoon by a waterfall. Freeman shared gleeful photos of the couples sharing toasts and sipping drinks from pineapples. In one photo, they smiled and hugged as they posed in front of a waterfall. Another photo captured Moore on horseback. Concerns arise about driving At some point in the day, Freeman said she learned that the couple had a flight around 2 a.m. out of Santo Domingo, located roughly 100 miles from their resort. Ravenelle told Freeman that they got a good deal on the airfare, but she had not realized how far it was from their hotel. To make it to the airport on time, the couple had rented the car they used for sightseeing, Freeman said. But Ravenelle expressed anxiety about the prospect of driving at night, Freeman said. Throughout the day, Freeman said Ravenelle was on her phone talking to the rental company about what time they would return the car. Ravenelle also said she was talking to her daughter, according to Freeman. Portia Ravenelle and Cheryl Freeman spent a day together sighseeing with their partners. On the drive to El Limón, Freeman said Ravenelle told them that the rental company warned them to not stop and open their windows for anyone because the locals know which cars are rentals, and try to mug tourists. During the drive, Ravenelle told Moore not to roll down his window for the men on speed bikes driving up next to their car, Freeman said. On the way back to the hotel, Ravenelle repeatedly asked Moore if he was sure they had enough gas to make it to the airport. She kept checking to make sure their phones were charged enough to use the GPS, Freeman said. A disco excursion After returning to the hotel, the couples separated for dinner, Freeman said. They agreed to meet around 8:30 p.m. to go to a disco in Samana. At the bar, the couples split a bottle of rum. They also saw the hotel bartender and his wife there, Freeman said. Again, Freeman said Ravenelle appeared nervous, wanting to leave because she was worried about traveling to the airport and returning the car. Freeman said she was nervous, too, as a tourist in Samana. Locals ""harassed you constantly and there were always people trying to get you to follow them and do stuff,"" she said. ""I would not recommend it."" They returned to the resort between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tuesday. They hugged goodbye in the lobby and promised to exchange photos over email and keep in touch. ""They invited us to come see them in New York and we invited them to Nova Scotia for later in summer."" Freeman said the last thing the couple said to them was that they were going upstairs to pack up and check out. That was the last they heard from them After the couple left, Warrington, Freeman's boyfriend, sent Moore an email wishing them a safe flight. He never heard back from him. Freeman said she did not realize the couple had gone missing until she returned to Halifax on March 31 and discovered several emails from Ravenelle's family. Freeman said no law enforcement agencies have contacted her about their disappearance. Now, details about the resort stick out in Freeman's mind. She noted that there was a security guard armed with a rifle guarding her villa every night at the hotel. She also said the public could access the resort via the beach. In the brief time she knew her, Freeman said Ravenelle came off as ""very cautious, adding that she would be surprised if Ravenelle would have let Moore stop even for directions. Meanwhile, Moore's family is also searching for answers. His sister said she filed a police report with Mount Vernon Police on March 29. But the office of the chief said no report was filed about Moore, and the department is not conducting an investigation. Turner said she has been trying to call law enforcement in the Dominican Republic, but has struggled to get information. ""I'm scared, I don't know what's going on,"" Turner told CNN. ""My brother's not the type to just run off, and not tell anybody."""
Facebook and Google will face Congress over white nationalism,us.cnn.com,Donie O'Sullivan,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/tech/facebook-youtube-white-nationalism/index.html," Representatives from Facebook and Google will be on Capitol Hill Tuesday to face questions from lawmakers about how their platforms are used by white supremacists.
The hearing, which is being held by the House Judiciary Committee, comes just a few weeks after a terror attack in New Zealand that was streamed live on Facebook. Fifty people at two mosques were killed in the attack. The representatives from the two big tech companies' policy teams will appear on an eight person panel that will also include representatives from civil rights groups such as the Anti-Defamation League, and Candace Owens of the conservative group Turning Point USA. Google has received criticism for the role online search plays in spreading hateful ideologies, but its video sharing site YouTube has increasingly been slammed for hosting such content and its algorithms surfacing it. The New Zealand attack ""underscores the urgency"" of addressing the white supremacy problem on social media, Kristen Clarke, the head of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told CNN Business. Facebook says it's policing its platform, but it didn't catch a livestream of a massacre. Why? The attack, Clarke said, is ""exhibit A in how violent white supremacists abuse the Facebook platform to promote their dangerous, fatal activities."" She will be part of the panel testifying on Tuesday. Read More The mass shootings in New Zealand highlighted two key challenges for the social media platforms: The way in which they are used to spread extremist ideologies and rally people to those ideologies, and how people who commit violence on behalf of those extremist ideas use the platforms to promote their actions. Two weeks after the massacre, Facebook announced that it would ban all ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on Facebook and Instagram. Previously, the company had banned white supremacy, but had viewed white nationalism differently. The company said it had decided to ban white nationalism after months of consultation with civil rights groups. Neither YouTube nor Twitter have enacted similar blanket bans of white nationalism but both companies say they have policies to fight hate and the incitement of violence on their platforms. Despite investments in human moderators and artificial intelligence, Facebook failed to interrupt the video stream of the mass murder as it was streamed live. Facebook and YouTube said they spent the days after the attack removing millions of reuploads of the video. Facebook said it had stopped the upload of 1.2 million versions of the video, but that 300,000 copies had made it onto the platform and were later removed. A statement from the House Judiciary Committee said Tuesday's hearing ""will examine hate crimes, the impact white nationalist groups have on American communities and the spread of white identity ideology. The hearing will also foster ideas about what social media companies can do to stem white nationalist propaganda and hate speech online. """
These firms have an outsize influence on Corporate America. The SEC needs to regulate them,us.cnn.com,"Radhakrishnan Gopalan, Todd Gormley and Todd Milbourn for CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/perspectives/proxy-advisory-firms-sec-regulate/index.html,"Radhakrishnan Gopalan is a professor of finance at Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.

Increasingly, investors are relying on proxy advisory firms to help them decide how to vote their shares during shareholder meetings. The research these firms provide can help a pension fund decide whether to vote its shares in favor of appointing a certain board member, or an asset manager to vote her stake for or against a corporate takeover.
But the proxy advisory industry's rapidly growing popularity poses a problem. The industry is currently dominated by two key players — Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis — giving these firms immense power over some crucial votes in Corporate America. The growing reliance on this industry and the concentration of power within it has increased calls for greater regulation. Indeed, the SEC needs to regulate proxy advisers and require more transparency and accountability from the industry. Proxy advisers' booming growth is thanks to a 2003 SEC rule that requires institutional investors to disclose and offer a rationale for their votes in shareholder meetings. Often, institutions, particularly smaller ones with fewer assets under management, find it more cost-effective to use proxy advisers' recommendations to justify their votes than to have an in-house research department that analyzes and offers recommendation on proposals. Proxy advisers belong to a class of institutions that produce financial research for investors, which include auditors, credit rating agencies and security analysts. These industries tend to be dominated by a few key players (Moody's, S&P and Fitch in the credit rating industry, for instance) because of how expensive it is to set up shop — which deters new entrants. More Markets & Economy Perspectives It's a tough time for trade. But emerging economies are moving ahead
What to expect from 2019's 'post-peak' economy
Why the US would never win a trade war with China
An important disciplining device that keeps these institutions on the straight and narrow is their focus on reputation. When institutions do a poor job (inflated ratings or voting recommendations based on sloppy analysis, for instance), their ultimate concern becomes about tarnishing their reputation. And that concern gets greater the more one has to lose — i.e., the large market shares with fat profit margins associated with a concentrated industry. This focus on reputation deters competition, as the market is less likely to trust new, potential ""fly-by-night"" operators that lack these incentives. Read More Research on the credit rating industry shows that increased competition isn't always beneficial for investors. The same could be true for the proxy advisory industry if increased regulation pushes the industry toward greater competition. But there are areas where the entire industry could benefit from stricter oversight. The first is in terms of proxy advisory firms' recent foray into corporate governance consulting, which is a troubling trend. This new line of business provides potentially significant conflicts of interest, i.e., hire us to consult on your governance, and you will get favorable recommendation on your shareholder proposals. Such conflicts of interest are not new. They arose when auditing firms branched into consulting, which contributed to the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals and subsequently leading to regulation prohibiting such practices. The SEC needs to use its power to eliminate such conflicts of interest. That might entail forcing the proxy advisors to divest their consulting businesses altogether. The second area the SEC needs to regulate is in ensuring greater transparency about the rationale for these advisers' recommendations. This will serve two purposes. First, companies often complain that proxy adviser recommendations are based on faulty data. Whether these complaints are legitimate or simply reflect companies' unhappiness with the adviser's recommendation is unclear. But what is clear is that greater transparency will allow companies to more easily challenge faulty data, if it exists. Second, greater transparency will shed light on whether proxy advisory firms are using a ""one-size-fits-all"" policy to arrive at their recommendations. For example, advisers may think that classified boards — wherein not all directors are due for election in a year — is bad for shareholders, and because of this, always recommend against proposals that classify a board. But, research shows that optimal governance arrangements are often much more nuanced and that one size does not fit all. Greater transparency will allow firms to challenge recommendations based on such policies and put forth their arguments as to why their case is unique. Given the ever-increasing reliance on the few players in the proxy advisory industry, we believe we are past due for some increased oversight, accountability and transparency in this space."
The analyst that called GE's downfall is predicting more trouble,us.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/investing/ge-stock-downgrade-jpmorgan/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The JPMorgan analyst who foretold General Electric's downfall is warning of more trouble for the storied American conglomerate.
C. Stephen Tusa Jr. downgraded GE ( GE ) to ""underweight"" on Monday and predicted the stock will nearly get cut in half to $5 by the end of the year. In a withering, 123-page research report, the influential JPMorgan ( JPM ) analyst argued the ""risk/reward"" for owning GE has ""tilted back negative"" because the stock's 2019 spike hasn't been based on underlying change. ""We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE,"" Tusa wrote to clients, ""while overestimating the value of small positives."" GE's stock plunged 8% to $9.15 on the downgrade, making it the biggest loser in the S&P 500. The maker of light bulbs and jet engines is in jeopardy of suffering its worst day since last fall. GE was up 38% on the year as of Friday's close. Read More Tusa's GE calls are powerful because he presciently went negative on the iconic company in May 2016, when the stock was trading at $30. GE would eventually lose three-quarters of its value because of a cash crisis sparked by mounting debt and poorly timed acquisitions. The company even got kicked out of the exclusive 30-stock Dow. The JPMorgan analyst upgraded GE to ""neutral"" in December and spelled out a path for reviving the company. Even though Tusa voiced skepticism in that research report, his upgrade helped send the stock skyrocketing. Nightmare recession scenario While Wall Street is betting the GE crisis is over, Tusa is urging extreme caution. He pointed to GE's ""stubbornly heavy debt,"" GE Power's ""weak"" results, the need to pump GE Capital with more cash and overexuberance about the health of the aviation division. The nightmare scenario is that the next recession arrives before GE has repaired its debt-riddled balance sheet. GE would be ""vulnerable to liquidity issues in the event of a recession,"" Tusa said. GE bets on offshore wind as fossil fuels business stumbles An economic downturn wouldn't just prolong GE's turnaround plan. The ensuing market turmoil would add stress to GE's pension program, which is already facing a massive shortfall. A decline in asset values, along with rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, would increase GE's pension liabilities by more than $30 billion, JPMorgan estimates. GE's stock could plummet ""substantially lower"" than $5 if the company doesn't raise more cash and there is a recession, he said. Other analysts have expressed confidence in GE's turnaround under Larry Culp, who has moved with a sense of urgency since becoming CEO last fall. Last month, RBC analyst Deane Dray raised his price target on GE to $13 and kept an ""outperform"" rating on the stock. ""There is still much to fix at GE, but the market can now have confidence in the senior leader at the helm,"" Dray wrote in a report to clients. 'Where is all the money going?' Even though investors turned uber-bullish on GE this year, the company's management team has preached caution. Culp recently warned that 2019 will be another brutal year , marked by up to $2 billion of negative free cash flow from its industrial businesses. That would be a sharp reversal from the $4.3 billion generated in 2018. ""GE's challenges in 2019 are complex but clear,"" Culp said in a statement last month. ""We are facing them head on as we execute our strategic priorities to improve our financial position."" GE warns of bleak 2019 but promises a brighter future John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, predicted Monday that GE could likely lose about $2.5 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter. Anything worse than that would raise concern about GE's financial health. ""Both the bond markets and ratings agencies would not be pleased,"" Inch wrote in a report. Inch expressed dismay over GE's worsening debt ratios in the face of efforts to raise cash by selling long-held businesses. ""Where is all the money going?"" Inch asked. ""The company appears to be approaching the end of the runway of obvious assets it could sell."" GE gave EU officials 'incorrect information' Meanwhile, GE landed in hot water with regulators for a recent renewable energy acquisition. The European Commission on Monday fined GE 52 million euros ($59 million) for providing authorities ""incorrect information"" about its 2017 takeover of LM Wind. Regulators said GE initially said it was not developing any high-power offshore wind turbines beyond its existing 6 megawatt turbine. The commission later discovered from an unnamed ""third party"" that GE was ""simultaneously"" offering a 12 megawatt offshore wind turbine to potential customers. GE corrected the error a few weeks later and regulators later approved the $1.7 billion LM Wind acquisition . GE said in a statement that it is reviewing the European Commission decision before determining its next steps."

The women, along with fellow hosts Abby Huntsman and Sunny Hostin, were discussing the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen during their ""hot topics"" segment at the beginning of the talk show. During this segment, the co-hosts started talking about border security, President Trump's immigration policy and Kevin McAleenan, who is expected to take over DHS in an acting capacity. Tensions started to rise between Behar and McCain when they were debating what plan of action McAleenan can bring to the border security issues. ""[For] many friends of mine, this is the number one and only issue,"" McCain said. ""If we sit here and act like there isn't a crisis, that it's just crazy people living in border states that think that there's a crisis, that is a winning ticket for Trump going forward.""

""Give them a house, give them food, help them, help their children."" ""Give a Nicaraguan a house?"" McCain said, cutting her off.

Boeing is about to reveal just how much the 737 Max crisis hurt its business,us.cnn.com,Chris Isidore,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/boeing-737-max-deliveries/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a tragedy that has cost 346 lives. On Tuesday, investors will start to find out what it means for Boeing's bottom line.
Boeing is set to report the number of planes it delivered during the quarter. The company didn't deliver any of its bestselling 737 Max planes in the last two weeks of the quarter, because it halted those deliveries following the global grounding of the 737 Max planes on March 13 . Investors will be waiting to see if Boeing forecasts the costs of the grounding and halt of deliveries. Boeing ( BA ) doesn't normally give any dollar figures as part of its deliveries report, but this is not a normal time. It is one of the greatest crises in the company's history. Boeing is scheduled to report first quarter results on April 24, and then meet with shareholders April 29. But Tuesday's report is an early look at the financial costs of its 737 problem. The company could also provide some details on whether the grounding hurt orders for the plane, although the first quarter report generally focuses only on deliveries, not orders. So far only one airline, Indonesia's Garuda, has disclosed that it has canceled an order for 50 of the jets. Although that order was worth $4.9 billion, it's a fraction of the backlog of 5,000 737 Max orders that Boeing has on its books. Read More Boeing boasted about streamlined approval for the 737 Max. Now it's cleaning up the mess The 737 problem will extend far beyond first-quarter results. Boeing is scrambling to come up with a software fix for the automatic safety system, which is the focus of investigations into two fatal crashes. Boeing also announced last week that it was scaling back production of the 737 Max. ""The 737 delay could last longer than previously expected,"" wrote Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein in a note to investors Monday, in which he downgraded his recommendation on the stock. Epstein estimates the disruption to Boeing's business could last between six and nine months. He had previously forecast three to six months of disruption. He said he now predicts it will take Boeing until 2021 to catch up on promised aircraft deliveries. That's a big deal: The 737, which is Boeing's most profitable program, accounts for about 40% of the company's operating profit. While there are plenty of traditional 737 models in service, nearly all of the new planes that Boeing is selling as part of the program are Max models. Aviation world faces moment of reckoning after 737 MAX crashes Over the weekend American Airlines ( AAL ) , which has 24 of the Max planes, announced it was canceling flights through June because of the grounding. Cowen aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr said he now believes Boeing won't be able to make deliveries to US airlines — American, Southwest Airlines ( LUV ) and United Airlines ( UAL ) — until June. And he said that foreign aviation regulators, who were quicker to ground the planes than the US Federal Aviation Administration, may take longer to allow those deliveries to resume. He projects the foreign carriers won't start getting the planes until the third or possibly even the fourth quarter. Overall, he expects Boeing to deliver just 500 737 planes in 2019. Before the crisis, he believed Boeing would deliver 630. But he admits his best guess could be way off if Boeing's problems deepen. ""It comes at a sizable, albeit still hard to quantify, financial penalty to 2019 results,"" wrote von Rumohr."
Chuck E. Cheese will be a public company again,us.cnn.com,Danielle Wiener-Bronner,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/chuck-e-cheese-public-trnd/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Chuck E. Cheese has been quietly making a comeback. Now the company thinks it's ready to show off to Wall Street.
After going private five years ago, Chuck E. Cheese will be public once again. The chain's parent company is merging with a publicly traded acquisitions firm. That combined company will start trading under the CEC symbol on the New York Stock Exchange this year. Over the course of the past five years as a private company — out of the view of investors who expect consistent profit growth — CEC Entertainment has made significant investments to its menu, stores and entertainment to help modernize the brand. It replaced tokens with RFID cards and introducing an ""all you can play"" model that lets parents pay for entertainment by time. Like other food chains, Chuck E. Cheese has also launched a loyalty program and partnerships with delivery platforms so that kids can eat Chuck E. Cheese food at home. Those improvements have paid off. Sales at CEC stores — which include Chuck E. Cheese and the smaller Peter Piper Pizza — open at least a year grew 3.3% in the fourth quarter of last year, the company reported, and are projected to grow 7.7% in the first quarter of 2019. Read More Now, the plan is to ""continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in the next stage of our company's evolution,"" CEC CEO Tom Leverton said in a statement announcing the merger. The brand will remodel stores, introduce new products and continue to expand internationally. The chain, which is owned by Queso Holdings, will merge with Leo Holdings. ( LHC ) Once the deal goes through, Leo will change its name to Chuck E. Cheese Brands Inc. ""This is a perfect time for Chuck E. to get back into the public market,"" Leverton told CNN Business. As a private company , the chain was able to make changes without worrying about quarterly improvements, he noted. ""We could take a little bit more of a long-term view on some of these big-ticket dollar spends,"" he said. CEC's leadership team will continue to run the business once the deal closes. Leo CEO Lyndon Lea called Chuck E. Cheese a ""part of Americana,"" and said that CEC is ""extremely attractive acquisition."" Lea noted that the company has continued to perform well even in economic downturns. There are more than 600 Chuck E. Cheese stores globally. CEC also owns over 140 Peter Piper Pizza locations in the United States and Mexico. Apollo Global Management will remain CEC's largest shareholder — it owns about 51% of the company."
Meet the latest weapons in the war against wildfire ... goats - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Sarah Lazarus, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/americas/goats-and-wildfires-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""We are living in a tinderbox,"" says Reinette Senum.
Senum is the vice mayor of Nevada City. Nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 147 miles northeast of San Francisco, the town's streets are lined with characterful wooden houses that date back to the late 19th century. Nevada City's historic downtown. Senum is terrified that Nevada City -- home to 3,100 people -- will go up in flames. Wildfires are a growing problem in California -- 15 of the 20 largest fires since 1932 have taken place in the last 20 years. As climate change makes California's weather ever hotter and drier, this trend is set to continue . According to the US National Climate Assessment , climate change is responsible for half of the forestland burned by wildfire in western states since the mid 1980s, and burned areas in southwest California could double by 2050 . Read More Nevada City is especially vulnerable because it is a patchwork of urban streets and forests -- with no separation between the two. Senum says that the 450 acres of wild land within the city limits are ""choked"" with overgrown -- and highly combustible -- vegetation. Nevada City sits in a beautiful -- but flammable -- landscape. Senum had been investigating ways to reduce the town's fire risk for years but Camp Fire , which killed 85 people in northern California, and incinerated the town of Paradise last November, spurred her efforts. Paradise is less than 80 miles from Nevada City and the tragedy there was a ""call to action,"" says Senum. Obtaining government grants is a slow process, so last December Senum launched a crowdfunding campaign -- Goat Fund Me . Funds will be used to rent herds of goats to chomp down vegetation and create firebreaks that prevent wildfires jumping from trees and plants to homes and businesses. A search and rescue crew member searches for human remains at a mobile home park in Paradise which was destroyed on November 21, 2018. A goat's work is never done Using goats to help prevent wildfire is a growing trend across California and other western states in the US. Johnny Gonzales runs Environmental Land Management which operates a herd of 1,200 goats that work in cities throughout southern California. He says interest in goats is at an all-time high. Other goat rental companies include Goats R Us, Rent a Goat and Goats on the Go. Environmental Land Management's goats hard at work around southern California. Fortunately, goats are tireless in their appetites. They can eat 8 to 10 lbs of food a day -- up to about 9% of their body weight, says Gonzales. His goats are taken to work in stock trucks and trailers, having been 'acclimated' to the urban environment so that the din of honking car horns and wailing police sirens does not frighten them. Contained by low voltage electric fences, the goats are accompanied by a human herder and guardian dogs which protect them from predators including coyotes, bobcats and mountain lions. Great Pyrenees guardian dogs protect grazing goats from predators. One of Gonzales' clients is Anaheim Fire and Rescue. Their Public Information Officer, Daron Wyatt, says goats have been deployed for about three years in areas where wild land encroaches on the urban environment, with great success. ""They're very effective and it's a great method of clearing the vegetation in an environmentally friendly way,"" he says. The goats gobble tall grasses, shrubs, bushes and small trees. Nimble and hardy, they can work on steep, rocky terrain that's difficult for humans to navigate, says Wyatt. Johnny Gonzales' goats at work in Lemon Grove, near San Diego. The goats do have some human assistance though -- crews follow them, where possible, and use chainsaws and pruning shears to cut down the thicker trunks and branches that the goats can't chew through. Fueling the fire Lynn Huntsinger, professor of range ecology and management at the University of California, Berkeley, says that California has seen an increase in ""fuel"" -- the term fire experts use to describe ""dead plants."" Huntsinger, who used to keep goats in the backyard of her Bay Area home, says the fire problem has its roots in history. In the past, Native Americans lit fires to control the vegetation, she says. These deliberate burns created a landscape of open grasslands, so wildfires were smaller and less frequent. As grasses have been replaced by shrubs and trees in California, the risk of large fires -- such as this one that took place in the Stanislaus National Forest on July 22, 2018 -- has grown. That changed with the arrival of colonial settlers. They did not understand how ""using fire prevented fire,"" and banned deliberate burns from around the turn of the 20th century, says Huntsinger. Over time, the grasses were replaced with different types of woody shrubs -- collectively called brush -- which have since grown out of control. The Camp Fire moves through the town of Paradise on November 8, 2018. Suburban sprawl has also increased the threat and scale of damage. ""Our land use planning has been oblivious to the danger of mixing houses and brush,"" says Huntsinger, pointing to Camp Fire as a classic example of people living in a ""highly flammable environment."" The problem was exacerbated by California's record-beating drought which started in 2011 and was only declared over last month , having killed more than 100 million trees . Along with the brush, they provide a huge source of highly incendiary fuel for future fires. Source: Nik Childers
""Goats are very good at eating brush, says Huntsinger. ""These shrubs tend to be distasteful to most animals, but goats like them."" Huntsinger also advocates the use of cattle and sheep in fire prevention. They pair well with goats because they eat different plants. The #goats are back to dine on fine grass and reduce fire danger near our home. ❤️🐐 #California 'sNaturalFirefighters pic.twitter.com/lEabY5TzRs
— Linda Childers (@lindachilders1) May 3, 2016 Senum says the response to Goat Fund Me has been ""amazing."" Contributions have poured in from local residents, from across the state and around the world. At the time of writing, the fund had reached $26,000 of its $30,000 target. Senum is pursuing additional revenue streams including government grants and corporate donations. ""My saying is -- the more we raise, the more we graze."" The vegetation will need cutting back every year, she says, but ""it will get easier every time."" With enough goats, Senum hopes to secure Nevada City's future and prevent the fate that befell Paradise. The town is not only beautiful, it has a very tight knit community, she says. ""It's worth saving."""
"NBA player discusses struggle with his white privilege, calls for 'denouncing' racism 'at every level' - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/sport/kyle-korver-white-privilege/index.html,"(CNN) NBA player Kyle Korver revealed Monday in an intensely personal essay that he has struggled with the privilege he's been granted as a white man, and he tasked himself with becoming a ""part of the solution"" against racism.
""I know that, as a white man, I have to hold my fellow white men accountable,"" Korver, a guard for the Utah Jazz, wrote in his article titled ""Privileged"" in The Players' Tribune . Korver described two incidents involving black players in the NBA that made him reflect on racism and his own privilege. The first involved teammate and friend Thabo Sefolosha when the two were on the Atlanta Hawks. In 2015, Sefolosha was arrested after leaving a nightclub in New York. The arrest resulted in a fractured fibula for Sefolosha and ligament damage, and led to the end of Sefolosha's season that year.

Read More ""My first thought was: What was Thabo doing out at a club on a back-to-back??"" Korver wrote, referring to games on consecutive days. ""Before I knew the full story, and before I'd even had the chance to talk to Thabo I sort of blamed Thabo."" Korver also said he cringed at the thought of putting himself in Sefolosha's shoes at the club that night. ""The police wouldn't have arrested me. Not unless I was doing something wrong,"" he said, summing up his feeling at that realization in one word: ""Cringe."" The second incident was a March altercation between Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook and a Utah Jazz fan. The fan ""had said some really ugly things at close range to Russ. Russ had then responded ... he'd said he felt the (fan's) comments were racially charged,"" Korver wrote. Russell Westbrook In a closed-door team meeting with the president of the Jazz the next day, ""my teammates shared stories of similar experiences they'd had -- of feeling degraded in ways that went beyond acceptable heckling."" ""It was almost like disappointment, mixed with exhaustion. Guys were just sick and tired of it all,"" Korver wrote. ""This wasn't the first time they'd taken part in conversations about race in their NBA careers, and it wasn't the first time they'd had to address the hateful actions of others. ...This wasn't only about Russ and some heckler. It was about more than that. ... It was about racism in America,"" Korver wrote. Later in the article, Korver wrote: ""Let's face it: I probably would've been safe on the street that one night in New York. And Thabo wasn't. And I was safe on the court that one night in Utah. And Russell wasn't."" Korver added that white people are not ""guilty of the sins of our forefathers,"" but are, he believes, ""responsible for them."" ""It's not about guilt. It's not about pointing fingers, or passing blame. It's about responsibility,"" Korver wrote. ""It's about understanding on a fundamental level that black people and white people, they still have it different in America. And that those differences come from an ugly history not some random divide."" Korver put forth some of his own efforts ""that are starting to ring most true"" toward thwarting racism, including: ""I have to continue to educate myself on the history of racism in America."" ""I have to listen. I'll say it again, because it's that important. I have to listen."" ""I have to support leaders who see racial justice as fundamental -- as something that's at the heart of nearly every major issue in our country today."" ""I have to do my best to recognize when to get out of the way -- in order to amplify the voices of marginalized groups that so often get lost."" ""This feels like a moment to draw a line in the sand,"" he wrote. ""I believe that what's happening to people of color in this country -- right now, in 2019 -- is wrong."""
The Stephen Miller purge of DHS (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Elliot Williams,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/stephen-miller-immigration-white-house-purge-elliot-williams/index.html,"Elliot Williams ( @elliotcwilliams ) was an assistant director at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement from 2009-2013.

(CNN) In a move better befitting an episode of ""Game of Thrones"" than the management of our government, White House senior adviser Stephen Miller is reportedly ushering a "" wholesale decapitation "" of the Department of Homeland Security's leadership.
Elliot Williams This week started with the ouster of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Her having presided over the Trump administration's too-sinister-to-be-true practice of deterring people from coming to the country by separating them from their toddlers clearly was not enough for President Trump and Miller. Her sacking also comes days after the withdrawal of the nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, citing a need to go in a ""tougher direction."" More firings are on the way. Their fate is an object lesson in why we need to get immigration out of DHS and reset how we think and talk about immigration policy in America. Ironically, despite the DHS' role in immigration policy, the agency's mandate goes far beyond immigration. Before using even the word ""immigration,"" Nielsen's resignation letter references ""enemies and adversaries,"" ""cyberspace"" and ""emerging threats from new technologies."" (This is striking, given that even a quick glance at the DHS website could lead most people to wonder whether DHS actually does anything other than immigration.)

Secret Service head ousted as DHS shakeup continues 02:24 All this highlights the enormous problems with how the United States government approaches immigration. By housing most of the agencies that deal with immigration in DHS, the US government wrongly suggests that immigration is exclusively a function of securing the homeland, of keeping the public safe. The President has capitalized on this, spending a tremendous amount of political energy on making immigration about crime and threat. Regardless of the merits of Trump's approach, we have a huge problem with how we approach immigration. Read More For starters, there is no reason that immigration as a government function could not be reconceived and housed in a new standalone Cabinet department. Quick civics lesson: The Constitution lays out very few exclusive powers to the federal government. A number of the jobs it identifies -- ""to raise and support Armies"" and ""to regulate Commerce"" to name two -- are, at least today, overseen by Cabinet secretaries who report directly to the President. None of this is required; in setting up the Departments of Defense and Commerce, Congress made policy choices reflecting how important each of these issues is to our success or failure as a country. Kirstjen Nielsen had the toughest job in the government Congress could do the same when it comes to immigration. Right now, DHS is a behemoth that is impossible for any one person to manage effectively. It was formed in a rush to reform government after 9/11 and resulted in the merger of 22 agencies (among them ICE, which I helped lead for more than four years in the Obama administration) -- overseen by over 100 congressional committees -- that had little to do with each other beyond sharing a loose nexus to public safety. As a result, the secretary of Homeland Security is now responsible for overseeing everything from airport screening to helping Americans recover from tornadoes. This structure benefits nobody. For starters, today, what would happen in the event of another major natural disaster or -- heaven forbid -- major terror attack? The leadership of DHS would certainly have to shift its energy and resources away from addressing immigration crises that aren't going anywhere any time soon. Even under the best of circumstances, nobody should be in the position of having to manage one entity with such a diffuse mandate. Moreover, putting so much on the DHS head's plate only leaves more room for immigration hardliners like Miller to swoop in, dictate our immigration policy , and force us deeper into believing that immigrants represent as grave a threat to the United States as cyberattackers do.

Ex-ICE head: Trump had 'single dumbest idea I've ever heard' 01:45 Ironically, even the President seems to recognize that we need to reconceive how we approach immigration. His latest solution -- creating a position of ""border czar"" to coordinate government efforts -- necessarily implies that our immigration system could use more tailored leadership. Of course, his proposal is more likely to score him political points than actually fix anything; he has proposed two immigration hard-liners who would further entrench the notion that immigrants make us less safe. But something needs to change. Based on how the system is set up, Nielsen could never have succeeded. She served a President who benefits from instability. Any number of his major actions on immigration -- declaring a national emergency based on border security; threatening to close the border to all traffic from the south; manufacturing support for a border wall we largely don't need -- all fuel a political narrative that we ought to be scared, and that the President can live true to his campaign promise that ""[he] alone can fix it."" No DHS secretary, short of one committed to ending all immigrant border crossings, would ever have satisfied the President. I'm certain that incoming acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, a former colleague of whom I am fond, will not either. When the structure of our government treats immigrants as a threat, government personnel are going to keep being fired for failing to stop all immigration.

It can't happen overnight, but it is time for a major reset. Congress has the power to hold hearings and restructure the system.

Trump's latest Iran decision sets a dangerous precedent (opinion),us.cnn.com,Jonathan Cristol,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/trump-irgc-terrorist-organization-dangerous-precedent-cristol/index.html,"Jonathan Cristol is a research fellow in the Levermore Global Scholars Program at Adelphi University and senior fellow at the Center for Civic Engagement at Bard College.

(CNN) On Monday, President Donald Trump formally designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). This designation will do nothing to limit the IRGC's malign activities, but it may criminalize the activities of millions of Iranians and foreign tourists -- and set a precedent that Washington may come to regret.
According to the White House statement, this is the first time that the US has designated a unit of a foreign government as a ""terrorist organization."" In response, Tehran has already designated US Central Command as a terrorist organization. And it's not hard to imagine other adversarial governments designating American individuals or military units as ""terrorists"" for political reasons. Jonathan Cristol For background, shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Ayatollah Khomeini established the IRGC as a parallel military to Iran's ""regular"" military. The existing military could not be dismantled, both because putting over 400,000 armed Iranians out of work was clearly a bad idea, and because the old guard knew how to operate advanced American and European military equipment. So, Khomeini created a new military, with its own army, navy and air force -- and a distinct set of responsibilities. This parallel military would be loyal to the Islamic Government, rather than to the Iranian people. Over time, according to a Congressional Research Service report, the IRGC permeated Iran's economy. It now owns businesses ranging from construction firms to shipping companies to shopping malls and bazaars, some of which are already subject to US sanctions. In 2017, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo estimated that the IRGC might control 20% of Iran's GDP, but the actual number is unknown . Read More Iran's Revolutionary Guards, explained Inside Iran, it is difficult to avoid doing business with the IRGC, IRGC-controlled or IRGC-linked entities. The White House's Monday statement says that, ""If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism."" Does this apply to a produce vendor who rents his stall from an IRGC-linked bonyad (a cross between a charitable foundation and a private equity fund)? What about the vendors' customers, who might be Iranian locals or foreign tourists? Are all visitors to Iran now responsible for determining the precise ownership of every hotel, restaurant and store that they patronize? The designation of the IRGC as an FTO will also do little to reverse Iran's influence in Iraq. But it will make life more difficult for American forces and diplomats in Iraq, which is why many inside the State Department and Defense Department have opposed this decision. And while the United States may not work directly with Iran in Iraq, the two states have a shared interest in ensuring that ISIS does not reemerge and that other radical groups do not gain a foothold. Even if the United States has accounted for this necessity in how it intends to use this designation, if Iraqis need to choose between doing business with the United States, or doing business with Iran -- and risk the US accusing them of ""material support for terrorism"" -- they may well decide to maintain a good relationship with the regional power that isn't going anywhere, rather than with a Washington that seems eager to withdraw from the region. Foreign Minister Zarif's risky gamble wins the Iran deal more time Moreover, Shia militias trained by and connected to the IRGC are now being integrated into, and paid by, the Iraqi government. IRGC-Quds Force commander Qassam Soleimani is a frequent visitor to Baghdad. In short, the Iraqi government officials have little choice but to work with the IRGC. Of course, it's critical to acknowledge that the Iranian government uses the IRGC to spearhead its most malign actions across the Middle East. Thus far, the IRGC has helped to establish and support Hezbollah in Lebanon. It aids Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It fights on behalf of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and supports the Houthis in Yemen. And it is responsible for the deaths of dozens of American soldiers in Iraq. At home, its Basij militia attempts to violently suppress protests, and its businesses and entities distort the local economy. The United States does need to counter the IRGC -- and it has already acted appropriately by sanctioning dozens of individuals and entities connected to, or part of, the IRGC. Sanctions allow the US to target those individuals and entities directly responsible for actions to which we object -- and while they impact the broader population, they do not make them susceptible to criminal charges.

And if the Trump administration thinks that it is easy to avoid dealing with the IRGC, I'd suggest it ask the Trump Organization , which, according to the New Yorker, worked with an IRGC-linked family on a building in Azerbaijan. The building suffered major damage in an April 2018 fire, and the story was quickly overtaken by the myriad other Trump administration controversies. Maybe now the House of Representatives can, in the spirit of Monday's designation, investigate American firms that may knowingly have done business with the IRGC -- starting with the Trump Organization."
