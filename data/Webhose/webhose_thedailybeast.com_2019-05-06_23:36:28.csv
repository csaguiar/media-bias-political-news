Jacob Wohl’s Business Plan: ‘Make Shit Up’ to Game Political Betting Sites,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jacob-wohls-business-plan-make-shit-up-to-game-political-betting-sites,"exclusive Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
Bumbling conservative provocateur Jacob Wohl pitched investors this spring on a scheme to use fraudulent news stories to manipulate political betting markets, according to a fundraising document obtained by The Daily Beast.
The document indicates that Wohl attempted to raise $1 million to fund the Arlington Center for Political Intelligence, which he claimed would “make shit up” to profit from bets on political races and would suppress Democratic turnout in 2020.
“Backers will use ACPI’s insights in order to place profitable bets on political outcomes,” the pitch reads, adding that the group would also place bets themselves to guarantee a source of revenue.
The “confidential brief” makes other ambitious claims—promising to infiltrate 2020 Democratic campaigns and improve on social-media manipulation by Russian troll farms to wreak havoc on Democrats.
It’s not clear how Wohl, who has become notorious for failing at nearly every dirty tricks plot he hatches, would have pulled any of it off.
Last November, Wohl and GOP lobbyist Jack Burkman were involved in a botched attempt to smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller with trumped-up sexual-assault allegations. Their press conference turned comical when the purported victim failed to show up and Burkman pronounced Wohl a “child prodigy who has eclipsed Mozart.” The woman at the center of their plan later accused them of making it all up.
That disaster didn’t stop them from trying to carry out a nearly identical plan in recent weeks.
As The Daily Beast reported Monday, Wohl and Burkman are accused of attempting to persuade a number of gay Republicans to lodge false sexual-assault claims against Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg—including one who recorded part of the recruitment conversation.
A Michigan college student, Hunter Kelly, took the bait. But after accusations under his name were posted on Medium on Monday, Kelly denied all of it and claimed that Wohl and Burkman had tricked and coerced him—which Burkman disputed.
Wohl’s shenanigans have earned him the enmity of nearly everyone in politics and gotten him banned from Twitter. But his effort to influence and profit from political betting markets shows how he little he has been deterred by those admonitions.
On Tuesday, Wohl denied any connection to the ACPI fundraising document. But The Daily Beast obtained an email sent from Wohl’s account making the investment pitch, and also spoke with an investor who said Wohl had asked him to contribute tens of thousands of dollars to the effort.
A conservative activist familiar with Wohl’s operations told The Daily Beast that Wohl had claimed in the past that he could profit by manipulating political betting markets. A phone number listed on ACPI’s now-deleted Facebook page has also been the source of bizarre claims about Wohl and Burkman in text messages to reporters at The Daily Beast and other outlets, apparently in an attempt to fool reporters and generate fake news stories about them.
The Daily Beast is not aware of any involvement by Burkman in ACPI.
The fundraising pitch, which was marked as “priviledged [sic] and strictly confidential” at the bottom of every page, laid out how ACPI would plant fake news stories in the media using a strategy called “Feeding It Up the Chain.”
First, it would find “hungry bloggers” and feed them a “scoop and exclusive,” often a fake one.
“Make shit up,” the document reads. “Leak something sensational, extreme, sexual, scandalous, trending, or hate triggering.”
Then, the document claims, the group would “misdirect with details aimed to confuse.” “Make shit up...Leak something sensational, extreme, sexual, scandalous, trending, or hate triggering.” — Arlington Center for Political Intelligence investor pitch
That scenario jibes with how the Buttigieg smear circulated on Monday. After the sexual-assault allegation appeared in a vague Medium post under Kelly’s name, the unverified claim was quickly trumpeted by a number of right-wing blogs, including Big League Politics, The Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars. From there, it circulated widely on conservative Twitter accounts and other blogs for hours until the accuser denied the allegations and The Daily Beast revealed that Wohl and Burkman were accused of soliciting men to make up stories about the candidate.
A source told The Daily Beast that Wohl and Burkman said the goal of that scheme was to take down the Democrat who poses a threat to President Donald Trump’s re-election. The apparent aim of ACPI’s plan was profit.
The investor pitch says that ACPI and its backers would make money by using fake stories and other tactics to affect political betting sites, where gamblers wager on the outcome of elections or other events just like they would on horses at a racetrack. It asked for $25,000 in initial investment from each backer.
“ACPI plans to produce positive cash-flow by selling intelligence to friendly campaigns and by placing bets alongside our backers on the political outcomes that we influence,” the document reads.
The outline also claims that ACPI would replicate the Russian social-media efforts from the 2016 election, using bot networks and a “troll farm” to target specific demographic groups, including black and Hispanic voters.
It imagines creating “Suburban Moms” Facebook groups devoted to a particular Democratic candidate, then attacking the candidate right before Election Day in an attempt to depress Democratic turnout.
“With a superior handle on American cultural nuances ACPI will be able to have a devastating impact on Democrat candidates,” the document reads.
The group also planned to create “high-impact political publicity stunts” to affect political races. The pitch praises two recent headline-grabbing conservative efforts—the GoFundMe campaign to fund the border wall and anti-Muslim activist Laura Loomer handcuffing herself to Twitter’s New York office —as activities to emulate.
“ACPI plans to execute similar sophisticated and impactful stunts as frequently as possible in order to influence political outcomes in the favor of our backers during the 2020 election cycle,” the pitch reads.
The group also promised to plant multiple operatives in each major 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, then sell the intelligence gathered by those informants to Republican groups. It claims that most of the spies would not realize they were working for ACPI, instead believing that they were leaking to a rival Democratic campaign. “ACPI plans to execute similar sophisticated and impactful stunts as frequently as possible in order to influence political outcomes in the favor of our backers during the 2020 election cycle.” — American Center for Political Intelligence
“They won’t know that they are doing the bidding of ACPI—rather they will be led to believe that they are working to help the interest of their favorite Democrat candidate,” the outline reads. “The prospective agents will be recruited through leftwing college campus organizations, where Democrat campaigns most often recruit campaign volunteers and staffers.”
This would not be Wohl’s first attempt at creating an “intelligence agency.” To find women to accuse Mueller of sexual assault in 2018, Wohl used a front organization called Surefire Intelligence, which purported on its website to be a group of highly trained former intelligence officers. Instead, a shadowy picture of the group’s leader, when brightened, revealed the person to be Wohl himself. Other pictures of Surefire employees were just pictures of models and Hollywood actor Christoph Waltz.
While allegedly hunting for people to smear Buttigieg, Wohl used a phone number that traced back to an outfit called Potomac Intelligence. It had a website similar to Surefire that was taken down after The Daily Beast called Wohl and Burkman for comment on the Buttigieg effort.
In addition, another group called Bolt Intelligence has the same phone number as one for Potomac in an classified recruitment ad in a San Francisco newspaper. An archive of Bolt’s website also contains the phone number of Wohl’s podcast partner. The website, which has since been removed, listed the group’s specialties as “intelligence gathering, government relations and media manipulation.”
The fundraising prospectus for ACPI anticipates a need for more than $700,000 to set up the group and establish a Washington headquarters, including $288,000 in salary expenses.It’s not clear how the rest of the $1 million sought would have been spent.
It’s not clear whether anyone actually invested in the plan. The investor who said he was approached by Wohl—and who asked not to be named because he feared being associated with Wohl would hurt his business interests—said he was initially intrigued by the idea of backing Wohl to support Republican candidates.
He changed his mind, though, after reading the investment pitch and feeling that ACPI would lead to a “Jussie Smollett kind of deal.”
The investor became more cautious after he researched Wohl’s previous failed efforts. Before entering politics, for example, Wohl became famous in the financial world for becoming the youngest person to ever be banned from trading futures contracts.
“I was like, ‘Man, I don’t know,’” the potential investor said. "

Trump’s Labor Secretary Defends Controversial Jeffrey Epstein Prosecution: ‘We Were Too Aggressive’,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/alexander-acosta-defends-jeffrey-epstein-prosecution-we-were-too-aggressive,"SAY WHAT? Trump’s Labor Secretary Defends Controversial Jeffrey Epstein Plea Deal: ‘We Were Too Aggressive’ After a federal judge concluded that Alexander Acosta and his team of prosecutors violated the law when they reached a plea agreement with Epstein without telling his victims. 05.01.19 4:29 PM ET Al Drago/Reuters
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta on Wednesday defended his role in the 2008 prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, insisting that his office was actually “too aggressive,” despite giving the billionaire sex offender a secret plea deal.
“This matter was appealed all the way up to the deputy attorney general’s office. And not because we weren’t doing enough, but because the contention was that we were too aggressive,” Acosta responded to Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL), who called his actions “odious” at a House Education and Labor Committee hearing.
The non-prosecution deal between Acosta—then the top federal prosecutor in Miami—and the 66-year-old Epstein, a prominent financier accused of paying dozens of girls for sex and intimate massages, allowed the politically connected hedge-fund manager to plead guilty to two minor state charges and avoid any serious prison time.
Epstein has also been accused of molesting more than 100 underage girls in Palm Beach, Florida.
In exchange for the secret deal—which essentially buried dozens of allegations of child sex abuse and required Epstein to serve just a year in jail with generous work release—Epstein provided federal investigators with “unspecified information,” according to records first cited by The Miami Herald in a bombshell investigative report. The report details how Acosta and his team allegedly buckled under the pressure of Epstein’s defense lawyers, including Sexgate prosecutor Ken Starr and celebrity attorney Alan Dershowitz.
Virginia Roberts, who was 16 years old and working at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort when she was allegedly approached by Epstein , told The Daily Beast that Acosta’s defense of the deal “is insulting, but not surprising.” Roberts alleges Epstein instructed her on how to perform oral sex before sending her to a private island to have sex with his associates, including Dershowitz .
In February, the Department of Justice announced an investigation into Epstein’s plea deal, and whether department lawyers may have “committed professional misconduct” during his prosecution.
“It is the department’s position in litigation that the Crime Victim’s Rights Act was not violated. I understand that the judge disagreed with the department’s position but we acted consistent with DOJ rules and protocols,"" Acosta said Wednesday.
Wilson, who used the Miami Herald report to grill the Trump cabinet member, did not seem convinced by his defense, arguing that Acosta acted “in blatant violation” of the Crime Victim’s Rights Act.
“When faced with criticism about this case, you have hidden behind prosecutorial discretion, that you were just part of a prosecution team. Your actions suggests that you had some confusion about which team you were on,” she said .
A Florida federal judge also concluded in February that Acosta—and his team of federal prosecutors who brokered the deal—violated the law when they allowed Epstein to avoid federal prosecution without telling his victims.
U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra’s February findings concluded an 11-year investigation into Epstein’s plea agreement, ruling that Epstein broke federal law in 2008 by running an international sex trafficking operation that recruited underage girls, often bringing them to the U.S. from overseas.
“Epstein used paid employees to find and bring minor girls to him,’’ Marra wrote. “Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.’’"

Barr Defends Himself—and Trump—Over Mueller in Blistering Senate Session,www.thedailybeast.com,betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff) Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey) justin.miller@thedailybeast.com (Justin Miller),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/barr-defends-spinning-mueller-report-at-senate-judiciary-committee-grilling,"05.01.19 12:49 PM ET The Asahi Shimbun/Getty
Democrats accused Attorney General Bill Barr of misleading Congress and dissembling for President Trump the day after it was revealed Special Counsel Robert Mueller accused Barr of sowing confusion about his investigation.
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) accused Barr of engaging in “masterful hairsplitting” to defend previous testimony about handling of the Mueller Report. Sen. Maize Hirono (D-HI) went further, likening Barr to Trump’s lackey and saying he outright lied to Congress. Other Democrats asked how Barr could conclude Trump’s brazen behavior in office was not criminal.
The catalyst for the Democratic reaction to Barr was a letter written by Mueller criticizing Barr’s summary of the Mueller Report he gave to Congress.
“The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public... did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller told Barr in March.
“There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation,” he added.
Mueller’s letter stood in stark contrast to testimony Barr gave in a House hearing last month. Asked if he was aware of any concerns on Mueller’s team about how the report was characterized, Barr said, “I suspect they probably wanted more put out.”
On Wednesday, Whitehouse asked Barr why he didn’t bring up the Mueller letter in his original answer. “To me, it seemed to be a very different question,” Barr said.
Whitehouse sounded incredulous.
“I can’t even follow that down the road,” he said. “Boy, that’s some masterful hairsplitting.”
During a recess after his exchange with Barr, Whitehouse shuffled down the hallway sending emails on his iPad. “I think he was cagey and misleading,” he told The Daily Beast.
Barr’s credibility was in “free fall,” said Whitehouse, adding that he seemed to be playing to an “audience of one,” referring to Trump. Several Democratic senators waiting for the elevator with him piped in their agreement.
Hirono went further during the hearing, calling Barr “no different than Rudy Giuliani or Kellyanne Conway or any of the other people who sacrificed their once-decent reputation for the grifter and liar who sits in the Oval Office.”
After Hirono said Barr lied, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), chairman of the committee, said she went too far.
“You slandered this man from top to bottom,” he said as Hirono’s time expired. “If you want more of this, you’re not gonna get it.”
Hirono and other Democrats have called for Barr’s resignation following the publication of Mueller’s bombshell letter Tuesday night that accused Barr of twisting the special counsel’s words. Defending Trump
Throughout the hearing, Barr defended Trump’s conduct in office investigated by Mueller for crimes.
In particular, he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) discussed a directive Trump gave to White House Counsel Don McGahn to tell the Justice Department that Mueller was too conflicted to serve. McGahn told Trump those conflicts were bogus and he would resign before telling DOJ to sack Mueller.
Barr said Trump wasn’t trying to stop the Mueller investigation—even though he wanted Mueller gone.
“There’s something very different between firing a special counsel outright, which suggests ending the investigation, and having a special counsel removed for conflicts, which suggests that you’re going to have another special counsel,” Barr said.
Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said Trump’s proposal that McGahn write a memo “for our records” denying he ordered Mueller to be fired may have been intended for insidious purposes. Barr defended the president’s decision, saying Trump may have thought he was directing McGahn to write the truth.
Presidential candidates took their own shots at Barr.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) pressed him extensively on the evidence regarding obstruction of justice. Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, asked Barr about Trump’s criticism of people who “flip,” or cooperate with the government. Klobuchar pressed Barr on why this wasn’t evidence of a criminal witness tampering.
“The report found that after Manafort was convicted, the president himself called him a brave man for refusing to break,” Klobuchar said.
“Yes,” Barr began, “and that is not obstruction because the president's—the evidence, I think—what the president's lawyers would say is that the president's statements about flipping are quite clear, and express, and uniformly the same, which is by flipping, he meant succumbing to pressure on unrelated cases to lie and compose in order to get lenient treatment. That is not––it's a discouraging flipping in that sense, it's not obstruction.”
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is also running for president, asked Barr whether he and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein had reviewed the underlying evidence before declaring there was not enough proof to conclude Trump committed a criminal offense.
“No,” Barr said, answering next neither Rosenstein nor anyone in his executive office, to his knowledge, hadn’t reviewed that evidence either. “We accepted the statements in the report and the characterization of the evidence as true.”
“No, Harris said. “Yet, you represented to the American public that the evidence was not, quote, sufficient to support an obstruction of justice offense…”
Barr then cut her off.
“In the Department of Justice we have cross memos and declination memos every day coming up and we don’t go and look at the underlying evidence.”
Harris criticized Barr from her perspective as a former prosecutor.
“No prosecutor worth her salt would make a decision about whether the president of the United States was involved in obstruction of justice without viewing the evidence. This attorney general lacks all credibility,” she told reporters, adding Barr should resign. On Offense
Republicans stayed united behind a counteroffensive that impugned the roots of the Mueller investigation as a political “spying” on the Trump campaign by politically motivated FBI officials. They found a receptive audience in Barr, who enthusiastically defended his use of the word “spying” to describe the FBI’s court-authorized surveillance of campaign advisor Carter Page.
“I’m not going to abjure the use of the word spying,” Barr said. “My first job was in the CIA and I don’t think the word spying has any pejorative connotation at all.”
“It is not commonly used by the department,” said Whitehouse.
“It is commonly used by me,” Barr responded with a smile.
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) pressed Barr on why the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation in 2016 related to the Trump campaign and Russia.
“I am looking into it,” Barr replied.
Then Hawley asked if Barr would share his findings with Congress.
“At the end of the day, when I form conclusions, I intend to share them,” he replied.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Hawley said.

Swarthmore’s Fraternities Disbanded After Student Uproar. Protesters Say They’re Staying Put.,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/swarthmores-fraternities-disbanded-after-student-uproar-protesters-say-theyre-staying-put,"NOT OVER Swarthmore’s Fraternities Disbanded After Student Uproar. Protesters Say They’re Staying Put. Students staged a sit-in after documents revealed frat brothers bragging about a ‘rape attic.’ Protesters say their battle isn’t over until the frats are ‘permanently dissolved.’ Emily Shugerman 05.01.19 2:28 PM ET
After dozens of fellow students stormed their houses in protest of what the student newspaper described as a “ cult of misogyny ,” Swarthmore College’s fraternities voted to voluntarily disband and vacate their houses Tuesday. But the protesters say they’re not going anywhere.
“We want [the school] to formally confirm that there will be a process in place for next year to reallocate the houses,” said Daria Mateescu, one of the protesters who slept in front of the Phi Psi fraternity for four days. “We want an agreement that [the fraternities] will be permanently dissolved.”
She added, “We want permanent measures to prevent us from ever having to do something like this again.”
The protests started Saturday, after two student newspapers published internal Phi Psi documents dating from 2010 to 2016. The documents contained a litany of misogynistic, racist and homophobic language, including one reference to a “rape attic” in the Delta Upsilon fraternity house. Photos and videos show fraternity members groping and kissing women who may not have known they were being recorded, according to the publications.
Fraternity meeting minutes obtained from the 2013-2014 school year start with the declaration that there is “nothing better than basement takedowns and tiny Asian chicks getting pummeled with full sheet cakes.” The minutes also document brothers demanding to see “black nips” and discussing starting a “milf sex trafficking ring.”
Students flooded the Phi Psi houses in protest after the documents were published, demanding the school permanently dissolve the Greek system. Phi Psi responded by saying that most of the leaked documents predated their current members’ arrival on campus. Protesters claimed the leak simply confirmed a dangerous culture that students had been protesting for years. A Tumblr blog started by one of the protesters in April contains dozens of allegations of sexual assault and harassment at both fraternities from 2015 until this year.
On Tuesday night, it appeared the protesters had gotten their wish. Delta Upsilon posted on Facebook saying they had “unanimously decided that disbanding our fraternity is in the best interest of the Swarthmore community.” Phi Psi followed up with a similar post two hours later.
“We were appalled and disgusted by the content of these minutes, which led us to question our affiliation with an organization whose former members could write such heinous statements,” the fraternity said. “We cannot in good conscience be members of an organization with such a painful history.”
The administration, however, announced no decision of their own. President Valerie Smith sent out a message early Wednesday morning acknowledging the fraternities’ choice, but added that the school had “no evidence that any current student participated in the behaviors documented in those materials.”
The president also condemned what she called “unsubstantiated attacks” on individual students and “gross generalizations” about student groups—a criticism Mateescu felt was directed toward the protesters. (A school spokesperson said the comment was in reference to individual students “from across the spectrum of the student body.”)
“We were deeply disturbed and quite frankly felt betrayed by President Smith’s email last night, which was even less sympathetic to our point of view than fraternity members have been,” she said, adding: “Even [the fraternities] finally made the right decision when our president did not.”
Mateescu also pointed to group photos that Phi Psi leadership posted on Instagram Tuesday night—screenshots of which she provided to The Daily Beast. The posts feature captions like “Live Ever Die Never” and “You can take the boys out of phi but...YOU CAN’T TAKE THE PHI OUT OF THE BOYS.”
Mateescu said her group wants the administration to formally dissolve the fraternities so they cannot go underground or decide to re-emerge in the coming years.
A school spokesperson said the administration will not issue a decision until a Greek life task force that the president convened last fall meets on Friday. In a message to students, Smith said she will communicate her final decision with the community “as quickly as I can.” She also said the administration is committed to fully investigating any allegations of sexual misconduct and has hired an external investigator to examine the fraternity documents.
The activists believe the school is trying to delay making any decisions until students leave for summer break, to avoid further demonstrations. But by staying put, the activists say they hope to force the administration’s hand.
“Survivors have poured their hearts out for years,” Maya Henry, one of the protesters, told The Daily Beast. “Activists have raised these issues for years. It’s been said already. Please make decision so no one gets hurt.”"
Klobuchar Gets Barr to Defend Trump Over and Over Again,www.thedailybeast.com,olivia.messer@thedailybeast.com (Olivia Messer),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/amy-klobuchar-gets-william-barr-to-defend-trump-over-and-over-again,"AG OR COUNSEL? Klobuchar Gets Barr to Defend Trump Over and Over Again The 2020 candidate rattled off multiple allegations against the president, and the attorney general defended Trump on each one. 05.01.19 2:09 PM ET CNN
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) forced Attorney General William Barr to repeatedly defend President Trump from evidence presented in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report that he attempted to obstruct justice on multiple occasions.
Klobuchar, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, brought up during Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Trump’s thinly veiled threats against his former fixer and personal attorney Michael Cohen, his interactions with former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and his orders to former White House counsel Don McGahn.
“This is a man in the highest office in the most powerful job in our country, and he is basically—I’m trying to think how someone would react if the President of the United States is implying, getting out there that your family members have committed a crime. You don’t consider that any attempt to change testimony?”
Trump, on more than one occasion, publicly floated vague accusations about Cohen’s father-in-law and wife. “Do you consider that evidence to be an attempt to convince a witness to change testimony?” Kobuchar asked Barr.
“No, I don't think that that could pass muster,” he responded.
Klobuchar continued: “The report found that the president’s personal counsel told Paul Manafort that he would be taken care of. That you don’t consider obstruction of justice?”
“No, not standing alone,” said Barr. “On both the same reasons.”
“You look at the totality of the evidence,” Klobuchar continued. “The report found that the president's personal counsel told Michael Cohen if he stayed on message about the Trump Tower Moscow Project, the president had his back.”
Barr responded: “The counsel acknowledged that it is unclear whether he was reflecting the president's statements on that.”
So Klobuchar tried again: “The report found that after Manafort was convicted, the president himself called him a brave man for refusing to break.”
“Yes,” said Barr. “And that is not obstruction because the president’s—the evidence, I think what the president’s lawyers would say is that the president's statements about flipping are quite clear and express and uniformly the same, which is by flipping he meant succumbing to pressure on unrelated cases to lie and compose in order to get lenient treatment. That is not—it’s a discouraging flipping in that sense, it’s not obstruction.”
Klobuchar fired back: “He tells McGahn to deny reports that the president ordered him to have the counsel fired. If you don’t see that as obstruction and directing him to change testimony, do you think that would create a false record to impair the integrity of evidence?”
“It fails,” Barr responded. “The evidence would not be sufficient to establish any of the three elements there.”
He continued: “The government has to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt, and as the report shows, there is ample evidence on the other side of the ledger that would prevent the government from establishing that.”"

‘Selfless’ Student Killed in UNCC Shooting ‘Saved Lives’ by Fighting Gunman,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/uncc-shooting-riley-howell-reportedly-jumped-on-alleged-gunman-trystan-andrew-terrell,"HERO ‘Selfless’ Student Killed in UNCC Shooting ‘Saved Lives’ by Fighting Gunman ‘He just cared about people more than himself,’ one of Riley Howell’s friends told The Daily Beast. Howell has been identified as one of two people who died in the school shooting. 05.01.19 1:18 PM ET Logan Cyrus/Getty
The two University of North Carolina at Charlotte students who were killed during a campus shooting Tuesday evening have been identified as 19-year-old Ellis Parlier and Riley Howell, a 21-year-old who “saved lives” when he fought against the gunman.
Authorities say former history student Trystan Andrew Terrell, 22, opened fire in a classroom as students were finishing the last day of the spring semester, killing two and injuring four others. The injured—Drew Pescaro, 19; Sean Dehart, 20; Emily Houpt, 23; and Rami Alramadhan, 20—are all expected to make full recoveries.
On Wednesday morning, Terrell, who withdrew from UNCC earlier in the semester, was charged with two counts of murder, four counts of attempted murder, four counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, possession of a firearm on educational property, and discharging a firearm on educational property.
“I just went into a classroom and shot the guys,” he told reporters as officers led him away in handcuffs.
According to police, Riley Howell, a junior majoring in environmental studies, was killed after he rushed toward Terrell in the midst of his rampage and took him “off his feet.” Before officers were able to apprehend the gunman, Terrell allegedly shot the college student “point blank.”
“His sacrifice saved lives,” Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a press conference Wednesday, adding that without Howell, “the assailant may not have been disarmed.”
Howell was active in sports, playing soccer and running cross-country, Dubois said in an interview on WFAE’s Charlotte Talks .
“Riley had the most amazing personality and always knew how to make someone feel important,” one of Howell’s childhood friends, 20-year-old Lucas Tate, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “He always brought an amazing light into the room and he just cared about people more than himself. He was just that kind of person. He was the most selfless person I know.”
A spokesperson for the Howell family released a statement Wednesday afternoon, describing the 21-year-old as a “big, muscular guy with a huge heart.”
“He loved Star Wars , birds, cars, snowboarding, going to the lake, Kentucky Hot Browns, cooking from scratch with cast iron while listening to the Feel Good Classic Soul playlist, and his Lauren,” the statement read , describing his long-term girlfriend. “He was everyone’s protector, always standing up for what he believed in and lending a strong back to those in need.”
Parlier, a sophomore and North Carolina native, graduated with honors from the Central Academy of Technology and Arts, a high school about 40 minutes away from UNCC. Parlier was interested in information technology and described as “a joy to have in the classroom,” a spokesperson for the high school said.
“It’s very shocking and overwhelming and our community is just trying to deal with this loss,” Tahira Stalberte, the district spokesperson, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.
Her family declined to comment, asking for privacy during this “excruciating time.”
Drew Pescaro, a 19-year-old sportswriter for the Niner Times , UNC Charlotte’s student-run newspaper, was one of the four injured Tuesday evening and is currently in stable condition after surgery, his older brother told The Daily Beast.
“We are just asking people to keep my little brother in their prayers,” Ross Pescaro, 26, said while at the Carolina Medical Center, where Pescaro is being treated along with two others who were injured. Ross Pescaro said his brother’s injuries “are really bad,” but he is recovering well.
“This feels like a dream, you know? Yesterday was Drew’s last day of sophomore year, and he was just telling me how he was excited to finally have some free time,” he added.
Described as a “dedicated and funny man,” the sophomore communications student is a video assistant for UNCC’s football team and a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity on campus. His brother said he dreams of working with the NBA after college.
“We support the students and personnel at UNC-Charlotte affected by today’s tragic shooting,” his fraternity wrote on Facebook Tuesday. “We are keeping Drew, the chapter and the campus in our prayers.”
Houpt, a 23-year-old senior, is majoring in international studies, the school confirmed. A former intern for the World Affairs Council of Charlotte, a non-profit associated with the school, Houp studied abroad in Costa Rica, Germany, and Italy, studies Arabic, and works at a local grocery store, according to the organization’s website .
“Emily has been interning for us for about five months now, mostly focused on helping us with our weekly foreign affairs-focused newsletter,” a council spokesperson told the The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “We hope she makes a speedy recovery and our deepest condolences are with the families and loved ones of those impacted in this tragedy.”
Alramadhan, a freshman, hails from Saudi Arabia, and his family was expected to arrive at the hospital by Wednesday afternoon, authorities said . Dehart, also a sophomore, is expected to make a full recovery, but his condition is unknown at this time.
Police received a call around 5:40 p.m. Tuesday about an armed student with a pistol who had shot several students in the Kennedy building, an administrative building in the middle of campus. Several officers that were nearby for a campus concert rushed to the classroom building and arrested Terrell in the room.
“One officer immediately went to the suspect to take him down,” Campus Police Chief Jeff Baker said Tuesday. “Our officers’ actions definitely saved lives.”
According to WBTV , Terrell had withdrawn from all of his UNCC classes except for one, an anthropology class in the Kennedy Hall building. On Wednesday, he arrived to class armed with a pistol and waiting about 10 minutes before opening fire, authorities said.
Adam Johnson, the anthropology teacher in the classroom where Tuesday’s mass shooting occurred, confirmed on Twitter Wednesday that the shooting happened “during team presentations.”
“My students are so special to me and I am devastated,” he wrote , adding that he will not be speaking publicly at this time.
Police declined to speculate on a motive for the shooting, but said the 22-year-old “did not say anything” at the scene when he was apprehended. On Tuesday evening, as Terrell walked into Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department's headquarters flanked by officers, he turned to several television camera and flashed a smile.
“This is the worst day in the history of UNC-Charlotte,” Philip L. Dubois, the school’s chancellor, said Tuesday.
The state university, which has an undergraduate enrollment of over 24,000 students, was established in 1946 and is located about 20 minutes outside of North Carolina’s largest city.
Terrell is expected to make his first court appearance Thursday morning. He is being held without bond at the Mecklenburg County Jail."

"Laura Ingraham Calls Into Fox ‘Hard News’ Show, Bashes Her Colleague Chris Wallace",www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/laura-ingraham-calls-into-fox-hard-news-show-bashes-her-colleague-chris-wallace,"FRIENDLY FIRE Laura Ingraham Calls Into Fox ‘Hard News’ Show, Bashes Her Colleague Chris Wallace Ingraham called into a ‘hard news’ show to blast the network’s consummate newsman and ‘Fox News Sunday’ host. 05.01.19 10:59 AM ET Fox News
Calling into Fox News’ pre-hearing coverage of Wednesday’s Senate testimony of Attorney General William Barr , Fox News primetime host Laura Ingraham slammed Fox News anchor Chris Wallace for the horrific crime of not echoing Fox News primetime’s pro-Trump talking points.
Earlier Wednesday morning, Wallace was on-air asserting that Republicans “will have to do some rehabilitation to try to restore” Barr’s reputation following news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote Barr to complain about his initial summary of the Mueller report. The Fox News Sunday host added that Democrats will grill the attorney general because they “feel he has misled the country on the essential contents of the report.”
Later in the broadcast, Ingraham called in and described the Mueller letter as a “non-story” while openly bashing her colleague.
“The idea that Bill Barr set about to fundamentally distort and misrepresent a 448-page report that he knew would be almost in its entirety released except for redactions that were agreed upon; the idea he would set about to do that to what, ruin his entire career and be roundly ridiculed, is preposterous,” she declared.
Ingraham continued: “Now, I know Chris Wallace at the top of your hour was indicating that I guess that he kind of agrees with these other cable networks that this was an attempt by the DOJ to spin what the conversation was between Barr and Mueller. So I don’t know if Chris Wallace has information that I don’t have, but that he is saying that Barr is perpetuating a lie about this conversation between him and Mueller?”
She went on to say that Mueller is a “big boy” and would have come forward if he thought the investigation was being distorted or harmed in any way before saying that she finds the “reporting on this and much of the commentary on this to be harmful and frankly very disturbing.”
“And I’m watching this in real-time and this is not spin by the way,” the pro-Trump host added.
Hours later and shortly after the hearing ended, Wallace appeared on Fox News anchor Shepard Smith’s broadcast and returned fire.
“I know there are some people who don’t think this March 27th letter is a big deal and some opinion people, some opinion people who appear on this network who may be pushing a political agenda but, you know, we have to deal in facts,” the Fox News Sunday host declared Wednesday afternoon.
Wallace went on to note that the Mueller letter reveals that the special counsel was “very upset” with Barr's summary of the investigation's findings and found it “inaccurate.”
“A lot of people, having read now the full report or as much as it has been not redacted, you know, agree that he didn’t reveal what was fully in the report,” the Fox News anchor concluded. “Again, those aren’t opinions. That’s not a political agenda. Those are the facts.”"
Julian Assange Sentenced to 50 Weeks in British Prison,www.thedailybeast.com,jamie.ross@thedailybeast.com (Jamie Ross),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/julian-assange-sentenced-to-50-weeks-in-british-prison,"LEAKER LOCKED UP Julian Assange Sentenced to 50 Weeks in British Prison WikiLeaks founder was arrested on bail-skipping charges when he was hauled out of the Ecuadorian embassy last month. 05.01.19 6:44 AM ET Daniel Leal-Olivas / Getty
LONDON— Julian Assange has been sentenced to 50 weeks in prison after being found guilty of bail-skipping charges in Britain.
The WikiLeaks founder was arrested and dragged out of London’s Ecuadorian embassy by British police in April. For the seven years he was holed up in the building, he had an outstanding warrant for jumping bail in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced rape charges.
Assange apologized in court for breaching his bail—but it wasn’t enough for the judge show him any leniency. Fifty weeks was just below the maximum possible sentence of 12 months in prison, and the judge told Assange that his case was “exceptional in seriousness” and said “by entering the embassy, you deliberately put yourself out of reach.”
“You remained there for nearly seven years, exploiting your privileged position to flout the law and advertise internationally your disdain for the law of this country,” said Judge Deborah Taylor, adding that Assange’s time in the embassy had cost British taxpayers £16 million ($21 million.)
In a letter read to the court, Assange said he had found himself “struggling with difficult circumstances” and complained that he had been suffering from depression and a toothache. He apologized to anyone who “consider[s] I’ve disrespected them,” and added: “I did what I thought at the time was the best or perhaps the only thing that I could have done.”
Immediately after his sentencing, Assange raised his fist to supporters in the courtroom and was taken down to the cells. They reportedly shouted “Shame on you!” at the judge as Assange disappeared from view.
British police also arrested Assange last month on behalf of U.S. authorities who have charged him with illegally helping Chelsea Manning to crack a computer password to steal thousands of classified documents.
The U.S. Department of Justice revealed at the time that the arrest was over a federal charge of “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion” and relates to the WikiLeaks founder’s alleged role in what it calls “one of the largest compromises of classified information” in U.S. history.
Assange will face a hearing on those extradition charges Thursday. He could be hit with as much as five years in a U.S. prison if extradited and convicted. READ THIS LIST"
"‘Gatsby’ Is Great, but Fitzgerald’s Stories Are Even Greater",www.thedailybeast.com,Colin Fleming,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/gatsby-is-great-but-fitzgeralds-stories-are-even-greater,"SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL ‘Gatsby’ Is Great, but Fitzgerald’s Stories Are Even Greater The novelette ‘May Day’ is Exhibit A proving that if you pass on F. Scott Fitzgerald the short-story writer, you miss out on the best of his inventions. 05.01.19 5:13 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast
With The Great Gatsby —the first and only work by Fitzgerald most people read—we’re instructed, starting in high school and then ever after, that only one manuscript by the Minnesota-born author is deemed worth our time. And in Gatsby , there are indeed chunks of perfect writing—velvety stuccoed passages of pure prose poetry that make it seem like this author always had a goldmine at his disposal when other writers were lucky to have pyrite crumbs.
Sometimes these plush veins go on for pages, capturing details of human existence—the ways we all think, at some time or other, which we all recognize with an “aha, yes, I’ve been that way” internal exclamation—and where entire worlds register in the precise manner of how a finger touches a glass, or a pine cone dandles in a breeze. But if you want to experience Fitzgerald the stylistic daredevil, you need to turn to his stories , right from his earliest ones. Get thee to a good compilation, go.
“I have asked a lot of my emotions—120 stories,” Fitzgerald wrote near the end of his life. Clearly that number meant a lot to him, as it should have. A little chest-thumping pride, if you will, like he’d just sunk a three to finish off triple overtime.
You’ll note that he didn’t cite the total of his novels—he went to the short story form. You create an idea for a novel, you work that idea and its tributaries through the duration of the project. But to birth new characters afresh in their own native worlds—again and again and again and again—with new journeys, new arcs, and render those fictional composites in styles best befitting each creative undertaking, each formal work of art, is, as Fitzgerald implies, a daunting task. And one’s imagination. One’s energy. One’s ability to both regularly chop wood—doing the sweating and grunting of writing—and having meritorious fresh wood to chop, which the artist grows in thickets beyond the intellectual property lines of other people—forests of genius which, in Fitzgerald’s case, experienced nary a lick of flame, or what it meant to be thinned out by so much as a single sapling.
These characters are created, their stories told, and then new ones must take their place in what becomes an accession of narrative forms, each self-contained, but belonging to a single corpus. Nothing taxes your originality and imagination more. To do it well, that is. Our young man Mr. Fitzgerald, well before Gatsby’s publication in 1925, tended to write short stories like he was Indiana Jones. “Explore that? Hell yeah, boy!” There is something so cool about a writer who doesn’t do “can’t”—that is, if there’s a rule, they will not care about it, and if there’s a way you’re “supposed” to write, they will tell you to go to the devil.
One of Fitzgerald’s longest short stories (he called it a novelette) is “May Day.” It’s the perfect snapshot—or short film, really—of him in daring, inventive youth. It came out in the same year as his college bildungsroman This Side of Paradise , and was another college-based work, set on the first of May 1919.
We don’t get a lot of May Day works of art, but I’m glad we have this one, set in these early days of spring, after the rains and the lingering cold of winter. Easter may make us feel alive anew, and now we are ready for warmth, which can feel like it doubles for spiritual and emotional warmth.
Fitzgerald was in his early twenties when he wrote “May Day,” just past college age himself, not that he graduated from Princeton, the school he attended, which people usually aren’t aware of, thinking of Fitzgerald as Mr. College. His grades were terrible, classes could be restrictive for his writing, and he felt freer in student musical and literary productions.
For this story, we are in New York City, with a rich boy, and a not so rich boy. Philip Dean—who is referred to by his surname for much of the work—is at a hotel. He’s a trust funder. Cash galore. He’s hanging out in town to take a break from his life, and waiting to go to a shindig at a fancy hotel for his fellow Yale alums. You can totally imagine this guy’s parents having bribed his way to New Haven.
Gordon Sterrett—who, tellingly, is referred to by his first name in the story (he is meant to be the person we, as people, are on more familiar terms with)—turns up in the lobby, while Dean has a nice lie-in for himself. Gordon is in some trouble. He also went to Yale, and this disaffected young man got involved with a woman, at a time in life when he wants to die. He’s not planning anything—but when the spirit breaks, there is no cast with which it can be fit, no crutches that can prop it up and help it ambulate. He’s a photographer, but the artist kind.
Gordon has no money, and he has come to borrow some to pay off the woman he thinks—underline that word—is bribing him over some tawdry details of their affair. At first, Dean is happy to see this guy, because he can shoot the shit about the good old days and hook-ups in dorms, but when he realizes Gordon wants money, he becomes a supercilious dick who is going to make this guy work for it. As Dean looks Gordon over, the well-heeled man utters one of those quintessential Fitzgerald lines that captures perhaps the definitive theme of his work: “You seem to be sort of bankrupt—morally as well as financially.” “Fitzgerald picks the word that no one other writer would ever use, and it as if that word is bang on the #1 word that it had to be.”
Fascinating delivery. For it is delivered as both how a character might say those words—a peremptory kind of character—and an authorial extension, one of those rare moments of “look, this is both the person in the story talking and this external voice-box that’s going to inform a ton of my fiction, so write this one down.” People think Fitzgerald focused a lot on money and the loss of it—being flush with green and then dissolute. He didn’t. He wrote about what might happen to you—and what, if anything, you can do about it—when your character cracks and the best bits of you leak out.
Dean and Gordon head for a party. At this party will be Edith Bradin, whom Gordon presumed was the love of his life. We have a lot going on here, don’t we? But we are just starting! At the same time, Fitzgerald introduces a plot involving two ex-Army men, Kay and Rose, with no prospects of work, no friends, and not much to do. Manhattan is lousy with soldiers after the war, and this duo starts banging around town looking for booze. Kay has a brother at a hotel who he thinks can get them some. He asks a waiter if he knows this brother, and gets a quizzical look. “’His name is Kay,’ annotated Rose.”
That’s what Fitzgerald does—he picks the word that no one other writer would ever use, and it as if that word is bang on the #1 word that it had to be. You can’t teach this. To paraphrase Fitzgerald, it’s like being tall or having blue eyes or a baritone voice; you’re born with it, or you’re not. The soldiers end up, a couple of times during the day, joining a mob that is marching through the streets—or drunkenly stumbling—in search of Socialists to beat up. Someone heard someone proselytizing on a street corner, and this attempted interflow of ideas was not what soldiers who had been bayoneted in trenches for American democracy wished to hear.
The plots come together when Kay and Rose end up at the hotel where the big Yale shindig is taking place. Gordon is drunk. He sees Edith, and Fitzgerald winds us up for what seems like it’s going to be a sort of meet cute story, albeit the redux variety—take 2, for these young lovers. She wants it to work, but she’s not dealing with him, she’s dealing with an idea. Crucial way to go wrong with people. One needs to deal with the person, not the idea of what the two can be together. But there is not some giant clash, not some well-phrased epiphany that marks their final parting. He’s a wreck, barely hanging on, and she can’t rouse him, so she doubts herself, then she’s annoyed, then she’s bored. “Love is fragile—she was thinking—but perhaps the pieces are saved, the things that hovered on lips, that might have been said. The new love words, the tendernesses learned, are treasured up for the next lover.”
You know that’s how it is. I know that’s how it is. Someone else is going to be right where you were. If you took an iron, heated it as hot as you could, shaved it into a spike, and stuck it into your heart, it would feel like that revelation. She leaves, and heads around the corner to visit her Socialist newspaper-running brother at his office. The mob, as you may have guessed, turns up, breaks down the door. This is not going to end well for one of the two ex-Army men who had begun their day just looking to get their drink on. Meanwhile, we’ve met the girl, Jewel, whom Gordon had described in unfavorable terms to Dean, and it turns out she’s sweet and wonderful and not trying to blackmail him at all. She simply loves him. Or, if it’s not love, she cares for him and seeks to shield him—from parts of himself.
You might find it reassuring to know that even 100 years ago, after these kinds of big booze-ups, everyone ends up at some breakfast joint. Dean is there, drunk out of his mind, and having refused Gordon his loan—which you knew was coming the entire time—and so are Jewel and Gordon. It’s a mess, with people doing and saying things with that special brand of assholism owned and operated by the rich and entitled.
Up until a little after this point, I buy everything in this story. When you have an ambitious plot, you risk more. For instance, if you look at the garbage in most literary magazines now, you’ll see no stories. You’ll encounter a scene, a vignette. When you do less, less can go wrong. Consequently, when someone does more, for people who always look for less, there’s a tendency to overstrain to find gaffes. The extended plot is like the extended sentence: Only a virtuosic writer—with a virtuosic soul—can pull them off. But it’s clear that Fitzgerald had no idea how to end this story. Divergent threads had intertwined at other places throughout, but once the boot was fully laced, he he no way to tie the crowning knot. So he settles for melodrama: Gordon goes to a dive hotel room with a revolver he’d bought at a sporting goods store and blows his brains out.
In the bit about the 120 stories that he wrote, Fitzgerald went on to say that he was able to do this not because of his blood, or his seed, as in his essence, but, rather, on account of the “extra” that he had. He feared that this something extra had left him in the end. He was wrong there. Maybe a trip back to May Day 1919, as his imagination had conceived it, might have been the tonic he needed, the tonic left on the nightstand bureau by Gordon Sterrett. READ THIS LIST"
A Real-Life Neo-Nazi Redemption Story,www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/skin-starring-jamie-bell-a-real-life-neo-nazi-redemption-story,"A Real-Life Neo-Nazi Redemption Story Tribeca Film Festival The new film ‘Skin,’ playing at the Tribeca Film Festival, stars Jamie Bell as Bryon ‘Babs’ Widner, a real-life Ohio neo-Nazi who removed his tattoos and changed his ways. Nick Schager 05.01.19 5:12 AM ET
H ate is easily grafted onto the bodies and souls of people in need, argues Skin . But expunging it—internally and externally—is a process filled with pain .
Premiering May 1 at the Tribeca Film Festival (ahead of its July 26 theatrical release), director Guy Nattiv’s film shares the title of his Academy Award-winning 2018 short, as well as that predecessor’s focus on American neo-Nazis . However, the true inspiration for Nattiv’s drama is the real-life story of Ohio white supremacist Bryon “Babs” Widner, a man who wears his intolerance on his face—literally. His countenance covered in permanent-ink drawings of scalpels, arrows, and other white-power-coded symbols and designs, he’s a walking billboard for fascist bigotry.
Skin doesn’t sugarcoat Bryon’s ugliness, introducing him marching through Columbus with his torch-bearing brethren, where they’re confronted by One People’s Project founder Daryle Lamont Jenkins ( Luke Cage ’s Mike Colter ) and his African-American anti-fascist comrades. A riot quickly erupts, during which Bryon suffers a stab wound from a young kid and, in retaliation, beats the boy mercilessly in an alleyway, punctuating his assault by carving an “SS” insignia into his cheek. All in a day’s work for Bryon, who’s soon back enjoying business as usual: giving his flame April (Louisa Krause) a tattoo and then screwing her in a side room; downing beers like they’re water; and responding to a cop’s (Mary Stuart Masterson) interrogation by cockily pulling his pants down to reveal thigh tats that read “Snitches Get Stitches.”
In short, Bryon is the scum of the Earth. Yet Skin isn’t content with just exploitatively wallowing in his backwoods racism; on the contrary, it’s a redemption story, one that begins—obliquely—with an opening image of Bryon sitting on a surgical table. Over the course of the ensuing two hours, Nattiv repeatedly returns to that medical locale to depict Bryon having his facial tattoos removed. It’s a procedure that requires years of work—which is too bad for Bryon, since he screams with every zap of the instruments used to slowly erase his hateful marks. And there are many, many zaps.
If Bryon and Daryle’s names sound familiar, that’s because they were two of the prominent figures featured on last year’s thoroughly ill-advised (and fortunately cancelled-before-it-aired) A&E reality series Generation KKK . Whereas that show cast them as partners in KKK-conversion-therapy duty, Skin illustrates the arduous path Bryon had to originally navigate to save himself. Such salvation begins with his chance encounter with Julie ( Patti Cake$ ’s Danielle Macdonald), a mother of three whose young daughters perform at a “NordicFest” put on by Bryon’s Vinlanders sect leaders Fred “Hammer” Krager ( Bill Camp ), aka “Pa,” and his wife Shareen (Vera Farmiga), known as “Ma.” Julie’s youngest Iggy (Colbi Gannett) takes a liking to Bryon’s dog Boss, and Bryon, in turn, takes a fancy to Julie, who cautiously allows a relationship to develop even though, after a traumatic experience with her first husband, she’s trying to keep her children away from the neo-Nazi life.
Nattiv allows details about Krager’s gang—its fascination with Norse god mumbo-jumbo; its deification of macho masculinity; the laughable phoniness of its “we don’t hate, we just want America for ourselves” ethos—to emerge from the action at hand. Better yet, his film underlines the way such outfits prey upon the weak and vulnerable. In an early scene, Krager entices young runaway Gavin (Russell Posner) to join the group by offering him a beer and the promise of food, shelter, and manly camaraderie—an incident followed by Bryon subsequently forcing the kid to admit that he joined simply because he was hungry. Not that Krager is the only predator here; Farmiga’s Shareen coddles her “sons” with sweetness and pseudo-sexual caresses, the better to rope them in and then subject them to her venom.
Skin contends that, for individuals like Gavin and Bryon, being a neo-Nazi isn’t just about race hate; it’s also about having a loyal and dependable family, as well as clothes on your back and a place to sleep. Bryon’s ensuing romance with Julie, which engenders an uneasy reaction from her abuse-scarred daughter Desi (Zoe Colletti), shows him that there are other clans from which you can get those things, and they don’t come with requirements that you spew animosity and commit murder. It’s a realization of life-altering proportions, albeit one that has problematic ramifications for Bryon, be it blowback from white-power brothers and sisters who view his departure as a sign of treason (and possible collusion with the Feds), or entrance into a mainstream society that’s reluctant to believe he’s changed given the tattoos covering his face.
Despite the fact that there’s little suspense about how things will turn out (the tattoo-removal cutaways are de facto giveaways), Nattiv’s film confidently situates itself in this downtrodden, seething-with-rage milieu. Danger is omnipresent, especially once Bryon tries to make a clean break and start anew. Arnaud Potier’s stark, immediate visuals and Dan Romer’s score—especially its use of occasional anxious string-plucking—enhance the dark, corrosive atmosphere. The film feels infected down to its core; a miasma of rage, prejudice, desperation and sinister manipulation.
More than its aesthetics, Skin casts its spell courtesy of its cast, with Farmiga proving the cagey yin to Camp’s bullying yang, her every sugary smile and comment laced with arsenic. They’re a repugnant pair contrasted by Macdonald, whose maternal protectiveness is as fierce as her love is upfront and genuine. Caught in the middle of these warring forces is Bryon, whom Bell brings to life as a mad dog trying to come to grips with, and adjust to, Julie’s kindness and the potential future it suggests is within reach. Letting his character’s sledgehammer belligerence slowly soften—a transition that has its share of confusion, panic and agony—Bell evokes a potent sense of Bryon’s shifting moral compass even as his situation threatens to spiral out of control.
Reminiscent of Edward Norton’s work in the similar American History X , Bell first defines himself via his scary appearance, and then digs deeply into his protagonist’s knotty resentment, frustration and longing. Akin to the medical technique that obliterates the physical remnants of Bryon’s past, it’s a raw performance that scrapes away at the monstrous surface to expose the scarred, and salvageable, human lurking within."
Will Care-Bots Cure the Loneliness of Nursing Homes?,www.thedailybeast.com,Joelle Renstrom,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/will-care-bots-cure-the-loneliness-of-nursing-homes,"Will Care-Bots Cure the Loneliness of Nursing Homes? ‘Stevie gives them motivation to do things that are good for them.’ 05.01.19 5:12 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty
When Conor McGinn, head of the Innovation and Robotics Lab at Trinity College Dublin, and his team began piloting their robot Stevie in the U.S., they were surprised to find that many of the applications we might anticipate robots doing, such as fetching objects, aren’t what people actually want.
“People want quality of life improvements. They want to have more fun, more social interaction,” McGinn said.
Because of that observation, Stevie’s priority shifted would be to combat isolation and loneliness by bringing people together through activities such as game-playing.
And they found a surprising audience starving for attention and friendship: the elderly.
And there’s quite a market for Stevie. Elderly populations around the world are soaring, doubling to an estimated 2.1 billion people worldwide over the age of 60 by 2050. But the workforce caring for the elderly is dwindling . Robot nurses such as Pearl and RIBA already help mitigate staffing shortages in countries such as Japan, which has the highest proportion of elderly people of any country, and whose government directs considerable funds into the development of care robots.
Now, nursing homes and assisted living facilities everywhere are beginning to recognize the benefits of robotic caretakers.
Sayabot , a humanoid service robot created by Asimov Robotics, is one of these robots. A mobile robot with dexterous arms, a humanoid face with eyes equipped with cameras, and speech capabilities, Sayabot can be customized for patient use and is already seen in banks and restaurants.
According to Jayakrishnan T., CEO of Asimov Robotics, the robot assisted patients between 60 and 85 years old in clinical trials last year, performing tasks such as helping patients use the restroom, providing mental stimulation through conversation and games, 24/7 monitoring, and dispensing food, drinks, and medicine. Sayabot and other “care-bots” can also call for human assistance if there’s an emergency.
But creating a robot that interacts productively with patients is more challenging than designing a robot for other customer service interactions—the stakes are higher, as is the need for sensitivity.
For one thing, the appearance of a care-bot is important—it should be human-like but not so much that it triggers an “uncanny valley” response.
“Sayabot’s design is based on studies that have found a ‘sweet spot’ between human and machine,” Jayakrishnan told The Daily Beast.
Details matter, such as Sayabot’s eyelashes, which humanize its face enough to make it appear engaged, but not creepy. Jayakrishnan’s team has also developed Sayabot’s voice, volume, and modulations to be “pleasant”; a robot can’t be helpful if its voice is grating or frightening.
Sayabot also monitors patients’ gestures and facial expressions to determine the best strategy and demeanor for care. “Even if the robot has to nag a patient by repeatedly reminding them to take their medicine, it will be thoughtfully done at the best suitable time,” Jayakrishnan said. That’s based on data gleaned from clinical trials, as well as from individual patients; over time, these robots learn what approaches work best for the people with whom they interact. “The biggest concern about robotic caregivers is that they shift care away from humans and become an excuse to pass off the care of the sick or elderly elders onto machines.”
So how do humans respond to Sayabot? In experiments with Sayabot, some patients expressed apprehension and skepticism about having a machine around instead of a human for care. But according to Jayakrishnan, it only took about two days for patients to grow comfortable with the robot.
While situations for which robots have not been expressly trained pose challenges and require constant feedback and updating, every new situation helps robots like Sayabot and their designers learn more about the functionality necessary to provide effective care. And unlike humans, robots don’t get tired or short-tempered, which helps ease patients’ stress and worries about being burdensome.
Being freed from the worry that they’re inconveniencing or irritating human caregivers helps facilitates a real relationship between patients and the robots looking after them, and it’s not surprising that humans soften towards their care-bots. When a French hospital brought in Zora , a friendly-looking robot just under two feet tall with sensors and speech capabilities, residents developed attachments to it. The same goes for PARO , a robotic seal that elicits emotions and boosts interactivity among users. Zora and PARO don’t fulfill medical tasks and aren’t caretakers in the traditional sense, but they help mitigate the loneliness that plagues residents of assisted living and nursing homes.
Being friendly and fun might not seem like health care, but given how loneliness and isolation adversely affect people’s health and motivation to live, it makes sense to couple companionship and care.
Which brings us back to Stevie. One of the most interesting results of the trial programs with Stevie is how much residents enjoyed being part of the focus group. They got to provide feedback about what they liked and didn’t like, and what they want and didn’t want, which facilitates feelings of ownership and purpose.
“The residents wanted to help create the robot. They wanted the responsibility and took pride in helping to shape Stevie,” McGinn said.
Soliciting and implementing feedback from residents has been so integral to Stevie’s benefits that McGinn realized that process shouldn’t end when the pilot programs do, but should be part of the product offering. “The residents wanted to help create the robot. They wanted the responsibility and took pride in helping to shape Stevie.” — Conor McGinn, Trinity College Dublin
“Residents organize committees to show each other how to use the robot. They’re facilitators, not just customers. Stevie gives them motivation to do things that are good for them,” he said. The unanticipated benefits of using Stevie outweigh the expected ones, which suggests that more paradigm shifts might arise from the use of such robots in facilities.
The biggest concern about robotic caregivers is that they shift care away from humans and become an excuse to pass off the care of the sick or elderly onto machines. “It’s potentially very dangerous taking people out of the loop,” McGinn acknowledged, “but I don’t think that’ll happen anytime soon. The tech isn’t even close to being able to circumvent all people.”
Pilot programs with Stevie were illuminating, especially regarding assumptions most of us make about what drives caretaking needs.
“People who are worried about tech replacing people haven’t spent time in nursing homes. The people who work with these patients don’t spend quality time with patients—they’re stressed and getting beeped constantly. The truth is that older people are alone all the time, starved of care and interaction,” McGinn said, emphasizing that robotic caregivers don’t replace interactions—they add to them, especially in situations where those interactions aren’t currently taking place.
While robots such as Stevie might not be affordable for individuals, they’re cost-effective solutions for facilities in which a single robot could assist 20 people.
According to Kimberly Stanley, Healthcare Sector Leader with EYP , an architectural design firm that works with healthcare organizations, it’s easier to “picture robots assistant with more time-consuming jobs that are not patient-facing. However, it doesn’t take much imagination to envision a day when empathetic, patient-facing robots are commonplace.” READ THIS LIST"
Preet Bharara: There’s a ‘Reasonable Likelihood’ Trump Will Get Indicted After He Leaves Office,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott Porch,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/preet-bharara-reasonable-likelihood-trump-will-get-indicted-after-he-leaves-office,"exclusive Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty
Preet Bharara talks on his podcast “ Stay Tuned ” and writes in his new book Doing Justice about principles—truth, fairness, ethics, integrity, equality —that seem quaint and abstract at a time when the president of the United States is a compulsive fabulist , wannabe autocrat, and unindicted co-conspirator in scandal about his hush money payment to a porn star.
Bharara was formerly the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he had broad discretion for bringing criminal cases involving financial crimes, terrorism, mafia rings and murders. President Donald Trump held Bharara over from the Obama administration and then abruptly fired him when he stopped answering calls to his personal mobile phone that Bharara considered inappropriate .
Doing Justice , though, is not about Trump and isn’t a self-congratulatory memoir of Bharara’s years as one of the most powerful prosecutors in the country. It’s about those principles—truth, fairness, ethics, integrity, equality—as they presented themselves to him when he was a prosecutor and how he sees them mattering right now in through-the-looking-glass 2019.
Bharara sat down with The Daily Beast to talk about the new book.
I know you mostly from listening to your podcast, so I’ve been listening to the book on audio instead of reading it. Are you hearing a lot of that?
We were bullish on audio because of the podcast, and the audiobook sales have been off the chart. The hardcover debuted at No. 4 on the New York Times list, and the audiobook has done even better. A lot of fans of the podcast have told me that they listen to “Stay Tuned” or their Thursday commute and have been listening to the book on their other mornings.
The book is a combination of several things—memoir, practice guide for young prosecutors, meditation on principles and ethics, leadership book. Was your plan from the outset to include all of those things?
One outlet [ The Guardian ] called it “a metaphorical survival guide for the Trump era,” and maybe it’s a little bit of that also. I didn’t have any interest in writing a straight memoir. I wanted to explain and discuss issues of truth, evidence, justice, decision-making and moral reasoning. Instead of talking about those things in the abstract, I wanted to do it through various stories that I hoped would be illuminating and page-turning.
The federal courts in general and the Southern District of New York in particular have huge structural advantages over criminal defendants, and I was curious how you’d represent that in the book. How much in your work as a United States Attorney did you have to guard against those advantages?
Any individual or institution who has a lot of power has to be constantly vigilant to guard against overreach. Prosecutors have enormous discretion and authority. People make the point about the president having the authority to fire James Comey as head of the FBI, but that’s the beginning of the inquiry. You have to be deliberative and make judgments about doing the right things for the right reasons in the right way. “Any institution, whether it’s a prosecutor’s office or a university or a baseball team, should not do things the same way for the sake of continuity.”
The priorities of a District Court reflect the priorities of the United States Attorney for that district, and I came away from the book thinking about that position more in policy terms than I did going into it. You came from Chuck Schumer’s office and from the policy world. Did you think of United States Attorneys as policy-makers?
Actually, I don’t. I think of them as by-the-book law people. To the extent that they’re engaging in policy, it’s only with respect to how they prioritize cases. They’re not engaging in an analysis of what the border policy should be or what tax policy should be or what the insider-trading laws should be. There are indirect policy consequences, but the job is to take particular cases with particular facts and particular defendants on their own merits.
What guided you, then, in looking for particular kinds of cases? Was it cases where you saw the greatest injustices? Cases where you saw under-prosecuted injustices?
There were hundreds of people prosecuting hundreds of cases when I got there, so I didn’t show up and say, “Hey, we should do some stuff.” New things came up like Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, but there’s a natural continuation of the work that the office does. A good institution has to appreciate two competing values: one is continuity of excellence, integrity, culture and doing the right thing, and the other is change.
One thing we changed when I got to the Southern District was allocating resources and training people to deal with cybercrime. Another was civil rights where we saw that the Americans with Disabilities Act was not readily enforced or complied with. And another was the conditions and how people were being treated in prison. Those were all areas where we saw injustice and areas where we could do something to make it better.
Those ideas about continuity and change apply to a lot of other institutions. There are a lot of questions about whether the way we choose Supreme Court justices should be changed, how voting districts should be apportioned, whether the Senate should eliminate the filibuster. Should we approach those things a certain way?
Any institution, whether it’s a prosecutor’s office or a university or a baseball team, should not do things the same way for the sake of continuity. Michael Lewis’s Moneyball opened people’s eyes to a lot of things about how to use science and data in baseball, but disrupting things for the sake of disruption can lead to losing valuable things. The trick is figuring out what to keep and value over time vs. what you change. “The only other people in the room were Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon. I complied with the request and gave him my number.”
Can you watch Showtime’s Billions , or do the dramatization and little inaccuracies drive you nuts?
I can, but it’s highly fictionalized both professionally and personally.
You tell a story in the book about a fingerprint lifted from a terrorist bombing in Spain and the fingerprint of a Muslim man from Oregon that “mirrored each other to a stunning degree.” It wasn’t him [the same man], and you call it a case of confirmation bias. That strikes me less as confirmation bias than the diligent investigation of a lead that didn’t pan out.
I think it’s both. There was obvious confirmation bias where multiple people didn’t go back and revise their initial conclusions when facts cast doubt on that conclusion and instead relied on the facts that Brandon Mayfield had married a Muslim woman, converted to Islam, and as an attorney had represented someone with links to terrorism.
You can weed out a lot of the people doing their jobs in bad faith. The more difficult situation is people who are doing their jobs in good faith but maybe aren’t quite careful enough or rigorous enough and don’t recognize their own biases. That can lead to the same bad outcome as the corrupt officer who plants the gun or lies about a witness.
Do you think the incentives are in the right place for United States Attorneys to put doing the right thing ahead of getting the conviction?
I think it’s important for the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorneys to make sure that the incentives are right. If you have a culture that only rewards how many people you indict or how many people you convict or how long you send them to prison, that’s a problem.
If you give people the wrong incentive, they will take it. We would announce verdicts at quarterly meetings with every single prosecutor and investigator in the room, and we would talk through what happened in each case whether it was a conviction or an acquittal. We didn’t treat acquittals as a professional failure or dishonor; sometimes juries just didn’t see a case the same way we did. “It will be harder to shut down other investigations where the Attorney General doesn’t have a tight leash on them.”
You didn’t have a culture of corporate earnings reports where you’re supposed to have more convictions every quarter.
Right, and I think corporations could learn something about that too. When Wells Fargo incentivized opening accounts, some employees couldn’t resist the urge and opened thousands of fake accounts. If you reward employees based on how many loans they approve, they’ll approve a lot of loans. That’s where disaster will strike.
When you were a United States Attorney, Donald Trump asked you for your mobile number. Did the context of that imply why he may have wanted your personal number?
No, but I thought it was odd. The only other people in the room were Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon. I complied with the request and gave him my number.
Considering everything you know now, why do you think he wanted your personal number?
He called me three times, and the third time I didn’t call him back. He never said anything untoward or asked me to bring a case or not bring a case, but he seemed to want to cultivate some relationship, to have someone in a spot to be helpful to him.
Donald Trump was pretty clearly the unindicted co-conspirator in the guilty plea that sent Michael Cohen to prison. I won’t ask you what people in the know may have told you, but how likely likely is it that the Southern District or the State of New York will indict Trump after he leaves office?
I don’t know. My former office clearly endorses and believes the fact—as Michael Cohen admitted in open court—that he engaged in the conduct he pleaded guilty to at the direction of Individual 1. Individual 1 is the president. Depending on what the other circumstances are, I believe there’s a reasonable likelihood that they would follow through on that. There’s a difference, though, between accepting a guilty plea from Michael Cohen and going to trial on the strength of that same witness after he’s gone to prison for lying. “There’s a difference between accepting a guilty plea from Michael Cohen and going to trial on the strength of that same witness after he’s gone to prison for lying.”
Do you expect that the Justice Department’s characterization of the Mueller Report won’t actually have much of an effect on how the various investigations of Donald Trump and the Trump campaign will proceed?
It will be harder to shut down other investigations where the attorney general doesn’t have a tight leash on them. In the Southern District of New York, the Eastern District of Virginia, the D.C. District and other courts, I would expect things will unfold in the natural course.
Have you thought about running for governor of New York?
[ Laughs. ] As I have said many times, elective office is not my cup of tea. I love public service and there are ways I could serve in the future, but I’m not interested in running for office and raising money in the terrible system we have now.
Would you want to return to the Southern District of New York or to the Justice Department for a future president?
Right now I’m selling a book. [ Laughs .] If there are future opportunities, I’ll take those on a case-by-case basis. READ THIS LIST"
Game of Thrones’ Night King Believes Arya Stark Is No Mary Sue,www.thedailybeast.com,melissa.leon@thedailybeast.com (Melissa Leon),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/game-of-thrones-night-king-believes-arya-stark-is-no-mary-sue,"Game of Thrones’ Night King Believes Arya Stark Is No Mary Sue Courtesy of HBO Vladimír Furdík, the Slovak stuntman who played the Night King, opens up about why Arya Stark was the ‘best’ person to kill him—and much more. Melissa Leon 05.01.19 5:11 AM ET
V ladimír Furdík may be the only Game of Thrones player with more faces than the god of death.
The 49-year-old Slovak stuntman is known for playing the Night King in Seasons 7 and 8, but he’s appeared all over Westeros in a number of roles over the years. He’s doubled for actors or played anonymous swordsmen in 14 episodes, spanning series-defining moments in the Battle of the Bastards , the Loot Train attack and Cersei’s destruction of the Sept of Baelor . He also played the first White Walker Jon Snow killed at Hardhome , and that’s him in “The Door” as the shirtless First Man the Children of the Forest tie up and transform into the Night King, the supernatural Big Bad who threatens to wipe out humanity and plunge the world into endless darkness.
That was the Night King’s plan, anyway, until the Battle of Winterfell brought the show’s longest-running storyline to an abrupt halt . In a thrilling last-minute reversal, Arya Stark single-handedly eliminates an army of 100,000 wights and White Walkers by stabbing the Night King with Valyrian steel, shattering him into icicle dust for good.
But who was the Night King? A long-lost Targaryen? An ancient Stark? How did he come to be who he was, and is the threat of the Long Night—an existential event the show has teased from its very first scene—really all over? Just like that?
We turned to the man under the ice spikes for clarification. Be warned: he’s about as concerned with the difference between Starks, Lannisters, and Targaryens as the Night King himself. And he’s definitely not here for the guys labeling Arya Stark a “Mary Sue” for killing his character—in his eyes, she was the “best” choice.
Were you surprised by how early in the season The Night King dies?
No, I’m not surprised.
Did you ever learn anything about who the Night King was when he was human? Some people thought he might be a Targaryen or a Stark.
No, no. But I sometimes see people asking who he is and where he’s from. For example, I put on Instagram a picture of some fight that I did for the Tower of Joy when I stunt-doubled for one of the actors [Luke Roberts, who played Ser Arthur Dayne], and I’m in the same costume as him. And I put this picture on Instagram and people said, “Ah! So the Night King is…” I think they started saying he was part of Jon Snow’s family—or somebody’s family, I don’t know which. I’m a little bit lost with who’s who. ( Laughs. ) They said I’m a Targaryen, or with the Lannister family, but I am also lost between these families.
Did you want to learn more about who he was before he went?
Uh, no.
Really? Why not?
You know, I can wait for another time when somebody makes a book or something about who the Night King was. It will be interesting to see. But at the moment, maybe one day somebody will say who he was exactly and where he comes from.
He smiles up at Daenerys in this episode after Drogon tries and fails to burn him up. Do you think the Night King’s fatal mistake was getting too cocky?
Yeah, I think Miguel [Sapochnik, who directed “The Long Night”] wanted to show people that inside the Night King there is a little bit of humanness, like he was part of… He’s not just a monster—he is actually monstrous, but he also thinks. He’s not stupid. Through this smile, I think Miguel would like to show that he knows what he wants, you know? He’s not just walking into the country and killing people. He has some target.
The smile did make him feel human. Were you given direction on giving him a personality?
Yes. I think on the day we did three versions [of that scene]. We did like a cold face, we did a big smile—which is not easy to do under the mask because then the smile is not really nice—and then we did a couple where I moved my mouth only a little bit on the right or left side. So we shot three versions and they took this version.
The big grin must have looked hilarious.
Yes, it was. Miguel wanted me to have some kind of smirk. But not too big.
Is there more to the Night King’s story coming even though he’s gone? I feel like we still only know part of his deal.
You know, I don’t know. This is not a question for me, maybe for somebody else. ( Laughs. ) Me, personally, I would like to know one day. Why not? To finish his story. Let’s see.
What was it like filming this battle? I’ve read it was an extraordinarily tough shoot.
Everything was so difficult, I think for every actor—for me, for Jon Snow, for Arya, because of the rain, cold, snow, and fog. It was a three-month night shoot, and then we did a couple weeks shooting inside. I’ve said before, this was one of the harder shoots of my stunt [career] and actor life, over the last 30 years. One of the hardest jobs of my life.
Some guys online don’t like that Arya was the one to kill the Night King. They think it should have been Jon Snow. How did you feel about Arya dealing the death blow?
I think this was a good decision. Because nobody’s waiting so much for [Arya to surprise him], not many people knew it would happen. Maybe ten minutes before Arya jumps on the Night King, we don’t know where she is. We see Jon Snow and other actors, but we don’t know where she is. Maybe somebody can predict it, but I think it was a good decision. Who else can kill him and how? It was the best, I think.
Now that your run as the Night King is over, looking back, do you have a favorite scene you shot?
My favorite scene as the Night King for me was in this last episode, when I walk into the fire and Jon Snow runs behind me. I loved it. Miguel said, “OK, now you should stop. You should turn your head, and you know he’s behind you. And then I would like to see you turn and look at him like, ‘Hey. What do you want?’” I loved this, you know? And on the day on set, I loved it too because for me, it was easy. We did this scene maybe 20 times and Kit Harington had to run on every take, about 100 meters. And I just did my 15-meter walk. ( Laughs. ) And he would just run, run, run. You can imagine how difficult it was for him in the mud in the winter. But for me it was an easy, good moment."
The Public Overwhelmingly Supports Meghan and Harry’s Decision to Keep Royal Baby Birth Private,www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-public-overwhelmingly-support-meghan-and-harrys-decision-to-keep-royal-baby-birth-private,"Fair Enough The Public Overwhelmingly Supports Meghan and Harry’s Decision to Keep Royal Baby Birth Private British media attempts to whip up anger over the royal couple’s decision not to turn the birth of their baby into a media circus is falling on unreceptive ears. 05.01.19 5:00 AM ET WPA Pool
The desperate attempts of the British media to whip up a storm of outrage against Meghan and Harry for having the temerity to not turn the birth of their baby into a media circus has failed.
A whopping 75% of the public told pollsters that they believed Meghan and Harry “have the right to keep the details about the baby’s birth private” while just 12% told polling firm YouGov that they agreed with the contrary proposition that “they are wrong and the public has the right to know more details about the baby.”
After an announcement was made saying that the new parents wants to keep the birth private, the British media were quick to try to argue that their decision was somehow selfish and perverse.
Typical among the dozens of criticisms was The Sun’s Jane Moore, who told the British TV show Loose Women their decision to not organize a gigantic public photo shoot outside a hospital was ‘weird’ and, perhaps more revealingly, added, “We paid for that story.”
The Mail’s Jan Moir was similarly disgusted and suggested, with absolutely no justification, “Perhaps Oprah has snapped up the exclusive first-look baby rights? I wouldn’t put it past her. Or them.”
In fact, as Moir well knows, Meghan and Harry have said that a series of photographs will be taken in the grounds of Windsor Castle a few days after the birth and it seems likely these will simultaneously be released on Instagram and to the media.
It now appears, not for the first time, that the young royals are more in touch with the British public than the news media, who, other voices have suggested, are not actually disgusted because of the breaching of some imaginary constitutional principle but because they are concerned about the loss of a ratings and clicks bonanza.
Meghan is now believed to be several days overdue.
The palace have said that they will announce when Meghan is in labor and make another announcement after the baby is born confirming its weight and sex. READ THIS LIST"
Trevor Noah Reveals How Trump Has a ‘Huge Advantage’ Over Joe Biden,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/daily-shows-trevor-noah-reveals-how-trump-has-a-huge-advantage-over-joe-biden,"HUH?! Trevor Noah Reveals How Trump Has a ‘Huge Advantage’ Over Joe Biden The ‘Daily Show’ host criticized the 2020 Democratic frontrunner for stumbling over several words during his campaign kickoff rally in Pennsylvania. 05.01.19 3:22 AM ET Comedy Central
“So many Democrats are struggling to get noticed, but one candidate has no problem at all—and that’s former vice president and professional tickle-monster Joe Biden,” said Trevor Noah.
The Daily Show host dedicated a large chunk of his program Tuesday night to the Dems’ current 2020 frontrunner, who kicked off his presidential campaign with a rally on April 29 in front of labor-union supporters in his native Pennsylvania.
“Donald Trump is the only president who’s decided not to represent the whole country. The president has his base. We need a president who works for all Americans,” Biden announced.
Noah had some thoughts. “Yes, that’s where America has gotten to: candidates now have to promise that if they get the job, they’ll be the president of the whole country,” he said. “It’s crazy because thanks to Trump, that’s not a foregone conclusion anymore, you realize that? Because he got into the White House and he was like, ‘California, suck a fat dick! New York, same to you! All the people who voted for Hillary, suck my balls!’”
“Biden’s first speech seemed like it was hitting all the right notes—it was connecting with all the people—but there was one thing that keen observers noticed: the former vice president was a little out of practice when it came to saying words,” added Noah.
The comedian then aired a reel of Biden repeatedly stumbling over words during his kickoff speech—including “successful,” “in and of,” “hospitals,” “conquer,” “incredible,” “hedge fund,” etc.
“The hudge -fund managers?” cracked Noah. “Aw man, Joe Biden. It’s one thing to mess up in the middle of a sentence, it’s another thing to stumble when you’re TRYING TO RALLY THE TRAMPS—I mean, THE TROOPS! It loses all energy! Can you imagine if King Leonidas slipped up like that? It would have changed 300 forever. THIS IS SPLENDA—I MEAN, SPARTA!”
“That’s why Trump has a huge advantage over every other candidate,” Noah continued. “If you notice, when he makes a mistake, he doesn’t let it trip him up—he just creates another reality and plows right through.”
Noah argued that because Trump has nicknamed Biden “Sleepy Joe,” these gaffes are now amplified. “Because Trump has started a narrative that Biden is old and losing his wits, Biden can’t afford any slip-ups,” he explained. “Literally, every day on Twitter, Trump is calling Biden ‘Sleepy Joe.’ That’s his nickname for him.”"

You think that’s overstated? Then tell me another time when an attorney general went before a committee of the United States Senate and lied like that to protect a lying president. The day after being caught in another whopping lie as we learned about the existence of Robert Mueller’s letter taking issue with the way Bill Barr had characterized the Mueller Report, which Barr had lied about to Congress previously.
And—tell me another time when the members of one political party participated in the protection racket quite like that. Why did Lindsey Graham think it was cute or cheeky to utter the word “fucking” at the beginning of this hearing? Fine, he had the excuse that he was quoting something. But that isn’t why he did it. He did it to de-dignify these proceedings. To signal to viewers that they didn’t need to take this hearing seriously. And, he did it for an audience of one. You think Orange Julius didn’t chuckle when he heard Graham go down in the gutter?
I could go on in this vein. Barr was wall-to-wall dishonest and appalling, the way he tried to deflect questions by niggling over a small matter, picking a tiny nit, running out the clock, wearing that “but I’m the Attorney General” cloak of slightly bored superiority.
But instead, let’s step back and look at it like this:
The Republican Party started life as a grand and admirable thing. Our anti-slavery party; our conscience. Its leader was assassinated, and in short order it became the party of Wall Street, and it remained that for a century, though it always contained within it conservatives, moderates, and even some liberals.
Then, starting in the 1980s, it lost the liberals. Then, in the 1990s, it started to lose most of the moderates, as right-wing issue and interest groups and Koch money began to define what constituted “conservatism,” pushing it ever-further rightward so that today it really isn’t even conservatism, but just a collection of grievances that they can use to piss off enough white people to stay in power.
Bill Barr came of political age in this period. He was a young, right-wing legal hotshot at the time of originalism, the Federalist Society, the rise of the right-wing arguments about a strong executive.
Lindsey Graham came of political age in this period. He was first elected to the South Carolina state legislature in the 1990s defeating a Democrat, and then just two years later made it to Congress, beating one of those post-civil rights-era Dixie Democrats who, throughout the 80s and 90s, were turned out of office by Republicans who were pushing their party, and their region, much farther to the right than it had been.
Their apologetics today are the natural consequences of their having marinated in these juices of resentment and rage for all the years they have. It’s what the party has become. And of course it’s the party that produced and elevated a gangster like Trump. It’s all of a piece.
It’s one of the greatest political quotes of all time, from philosopher Eric Hoffer; I’ve used it before and I’ll use it again: “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.” Barr and Graham were around I suppose to just catch the tail end of the movement phase. But mostly, they matured in Washington during the business era.
But then, in late 2015, when it became apparent the party was actually probably going to nominate Trump, came the racket phase. And Barr and Graham have adapted to it with, we must confess, a kind of evolutionary impressiveness, like bedbugs that have developed an ability to repel pesticides. And not just them, of course—every single one of them.
And all of it along the way—every racist dog whistle, every Rush Limbaugh rant, every false, out-of-thin-air accusation against Bill and Hillary Clinton, every lie about easily liberating the people of Iraq, every accusation that the rest of us hated freedom, every “joke” about Obama serving fried chicken, every disgusting attack on immigrants and gay people and you name it—has brought us to this point. Brought us to today, when a sitting attorney general said in effect to the American people whose interests he is supposed to be defending, “No, I truly do not give a fuck. I’m up here for the president, and that’s that.” And naturally, we learned three hours after he left the Senate chamber that he will not deign to appear at the House , where the questioning would likely be tougher.
Trump is a uniquely diseased man, it’s true. But what kind of political party nominates, celebrates, venerates, and takes political bullets for a uniquely diseased man?
So after today, if we didn’t before, we see now with a new and oddly liberating clarity where this is headed. It’s 18 months until Election Day. They may well be the most consequential and frightening stretch in the history of the country, or at least since Reconstruction.
This racket known as a political party will try to pervert the law in ways we’ve never seen. Reverse the meaning of every word we know. Trump is screaming that he’s the victim of a “coup.” What he is doing, of course, is perpetrating a coup, against the Constitution, with the eager help of Barr and Graham and all the rest of them. Trump is an idiot, but on some intuitive level, he’s a smart man, smart enough to know that to get away with staging a coup, the very first thing you have to do is to accuse your opponents of trying to stage one.
Barr and Graham and Mitch McConnell and everyone else around knows that they’ve thrown in, and having thrown in, they can’t throw out. Survival will require every kind of lie you can imagine, especially and exactly the lie of accusing their foes of that which they are doing themselves. And before this is over, they’re all going to be in on it. READ THIS LIST"
"Escalation: Barr Refuses to Testify, Dems Call It ‘Blackmail’",www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/william-barr-will-skip-scheduled-house-judiciary-testimony,"NO-SHOW Escalation: Barr Refuses to Testify, Dems Call It ‘Blackmail’ The AG was slated to appear Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee, but after a testy day across the Capitol and arguments over the terms of his testimony, he’s pulling out. 05.01.19 5:56 PM ET Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters
Attorney General William Barr will be a no-show for his long-scheduled testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, a move that significantly increases the tension between Barr and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and may force Democrats to subpoena the attorney general to get him to talk before lawmakers.
On Wednesday, Nadler told reporters that the Department of Justice informed him that Barr would not be testifying on Thursday. He said the committee will convene anyway at 9 a.m.: “I hope and expect that the attorney general will think overnight and be there as well.” A Democratic Judiciary aide told The Daily Beast the committee is anticipating a letter from the Department of Justice that may explain their reasoning further.
The attorney general’s decision on the eve of his appearance comes after days of battling between Barr and Judiciary Democrats over the terms of his testimony, particularly Nadler’s insistence that Barr be questioned by the two parties’ respective staff attorneys for 30 minutes each.
Barr rejected that rule, along with Nadler’s proposal that they discuss redacted parts of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report behind closed doors. Nadler said on Thursday that “the committee has the right to determine its own procedures. The administration has a nerve to try to dictate our own procedures.” “He is trying to blackmail the committee into not following the most effective means of soliciting the information we need.” — House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler
“He is trying to blackmail the committee into not following the most effective means of soliciting the information we need,” Nadler said.
In a statement, a DOJ spokesperson said Nadler’s ground rules were “unprecedented and unnecessary” and called it “inappropriate” for committee staff to question Barr. The attorney general, they said, is “happy to engage directly with Members on their questions regarding the report.”
On Wednesday, as House Judiciary voted on a party line to approve the rules Barr rejected, the attorney general was across the Capitol in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee , where he faced tough questioning from Democratic members. It grew so testy that at least two GOP senators declared Barr was getting the “Kavanaugh treatment.”
The hearing came a day after the release of a March 27 letter in which Special Counsel Robert Mueller complained that Barr’s summary of his report on the Russia probe was “sowing confusion” about the findings of the investigation—a complaint that only exacerbated concerns among Democrats who had already accused Barr of misleading Congress and manipulating the report's dissemination.
“The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public... did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller told Barr in the letter .
Barr fought back by calling Mueller's letter “snitty” during testimony Wednesday.
“The letter is a bit snitty and I think it was probably written by one of his staff people,” Barr told Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).
Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said Barr was President Trump’s lackey and accused the attorney general of outright lying to Congress.
Other Democrats questioned Barr on how he determined Trump's behavior in office was not criminal. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) pressed him extensively on the evidence regarding obstruction of justice, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) asked him about perceived discrepancies in his House testimony last month. Rep. Kamala Harris (D-CA) repeatedly questioned how Barr could make the determination without examining the evidence firsthand.
Barr argued that his office “accepted the statements in the report as factual record… We accepted it as accurate.”
“I think you’ve made it clear, sir, that you’ve not looked at the evidence and we can move on,” Harris retorted.
Nadler and other Judiciary Democrats have long made clear they would subpoena Barr to compel his testimony. The chairman said that they may yet subpoena Barr, but that the priority is to obtain Mueller’s unredacted report, which he had requested by Wednesday morning—a deadline Barr blew through. Nadler said they would seek a contempt citation for failing to produce the unredacted report.

2020 Democratic Candidates Call for Attorney General William Barr to Resign,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/2020-democratic-candidates-call-for-attorney-general-william-barr-to-resign,"2020 Democratic Candidates Call for Attorney General William Barr to Resign Before and after Barr's testimony on the Hill on Wednesday. 05.01.19 5:06 PM ET REUTERS
A host of 2020 Democratic candidates called for Attorney General William Barr’s resignation on Wednesday in response to his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
“AG Barr is a disgrace, and his alarming efforts to suppress the Mueller report show that he’s not a credible head of federal law enforcement,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) tweeted . “He should resign—and based on the actual facts in the Mueller report, Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President.”
Two of the candidates calling for Barr’s resignation also had the opportunity to question him as he testified Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Moments after she grilled the attorney general, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) told reporters: “No prosecutor worth her salt would make a decision about whether the president of the United States was involved in obstruction of justice without viewing the evidence. This attorney general lacks all credibility.” She called for Barr’s resignation.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), a fellow judiciary panelist and Democratic candidate, shared a similar sentiment, urged supporters on Twitter and via email to sign a petition calling for Barr’s ouster.
“We can’t trust him to tell the truth, and these embarrassing displays of propaganda have to stop,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said . And former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) tweeted : “Barr has failed in his responsibility to our country. He is not fit to serve as Attorney General and should resign.”
Prior to the hearing, Julián Castro had already called for Barr’s resignation and later added in a CNN interview : “The Attorney General takes an oath to defend the Constitution and at every juncture what’s clear is that this Attorney General instead, has tried to be Donald Trump’s personal lawyer. That’s not the role of the Attorney General.” Castro additionally called for him to be impeached should he not resign.
Similarly, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) also called for Barr’s resignation prior to Wednesday’s hearing.
Former Vice President Joe Biden , the latest to enter the 2020 contest, was campaigning in Iowa during the hearing and a spokesperson said they did not have anything to add at the moment when asked if he agreed with his competitors’ call for Barr’s resignation.
Later in the day however, Biden himself said that he should as he had ""lost the confidence of the American people."""
The Newest Trend in Bars: No Booze,www.thedailybeast.com,alaina.demopoulos@thedailybeast.com (Alaina Demopoulos),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-newest-trend-in-bars-no-booze,"SOBERING UP The Newest Trend in Bars: No Booze Wellness entrepreneurs are betting on sobriety becoming a drink trend. But how tasty are the cocktails, and how much of a good time can you have drinking in the bars selling them? 05.01.19 8:00 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
It was around 9 p.m. at a corner bar off a main drag in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Two good friends and I raised froth-filled cocktail glasses, the loudest among us punctuating our cheers with a bellowing, “Yaas!” It was an entirely unexceptional scene that could have taken place in any one of New York’s thousands of bars . But there was one crucial difference.
We were imbibing at Getaway, a two-week-old bar where no alcohol is served. Our highball and coup cups were filled not with the usual whiskey or mezcal, but a hodgepodge of gussied-up mocktail ingredients like coconut milk and elderflower syrup.
Call us squares, suckers, or both, but we left the bar laughing, arms around each other. In that grand, drunk tradition, I told one friend how much I love her. We did not need alcohol to get to that happy place, but I’m sure our sugar high helped.
Getaway is just one of the latest sober bars to open in New York. One pop up, Listen Bar, with faux beer and kombucha on tap, is currently crowdfunding for a permanent space. Ambrosia Elixirs, which promises “the taste of sacred intention” in every zero-proof sip, has been in Bushwick for three years, but will expand to spaces in Williamsburg and Manhattan this spring.
Across the pond in London, even famously beer-happy Brits can turn to he dramatically named Redemption Bar for beetroot martinis and “Pious Pina Coladas.” The bar’s founders, entrepreneurs Catherine Salway and Andrew Waters, were reportedly inspired to open Redemption after wondering, “Why should socializing always be at the expense of your health?”
A few weeks before the opening of Getaway, Amanda Mull wrote in The Atlantic that there is quite a bit of anecdotal evidence to suggest that “millennials are sick of drinking.” While statistics still show that more than 60 percent of 22 to 37 year olds drink alcohol every month, they might be drinking less.
“What some have been quick to characterize as an interest in being sober might actually be more like a search for moderation in a culture that has long treated alcohol like a dichotomy: Either you drink when the opportunity presents itself, or you don’t drink at all,” Mull wrote.
In this way, a kind of sober tourism has emerged. Think of friends who have gone alc-free for the 31 days of “Dry January” as a testament to willpower or made a point to buy less beer as a way to feel healthy. Regardless of how truly popular these subtle movements truly are, booze-less buzz has garnered enough interest for the wellness industry to take note.
“NYC’s sober bar scene is a ‘hip’ oasis for booze-free fun,” read a recent New York Post headline. The piece quoted a former club promoter and Getaway patron who said, “Sobriety is only going to get more cool.”
Sobriety can be cool, sure, but also very necessary—and lifesaving—for alcoholics. Is the idea of temperance becoming the next Goop -y trend à la reiki , yoga, or weed, just a little bit insensitive?
“It smells of privilege, but I’m into it,” a sober friend told me when I sent her the Post story. “I think it’s dope. I want to go get fun mocktails and have a night of pure connection, you know?”
“I know people were saying ‘fuck this’ because of the price of these drinks,” said one sober Getaway patron who lived down the block. “But I said, yes! Finally.”
AA did not make a representative available for a Daily Beast interview. According to the organization’s “Tenth Tradition,” “Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.”
A spokesperson for the fellowship added, “In keeping with this Tradition, the A.A. Fellowship does not develop or offer opinions on any other organization, cause, treatment, medications, legislation, housing, sober bars, non-alcoholic beverages, or the alcohol industry. This tradition is one of several that helps us avoid the distraction that focusing on other issues might cause.”
Dr. Carrie Wilkens, co-founder of the Center for Motivation and Change, a private mental health practice in New York that specializes in substance use treatment, said she might start telling patients to visit an alcohol-free bar as a “homework assignment.” “Go and notice what it feels like to be sober. Have a good time. Go to this place with the expectation that you’ll have fun and there is no alcohol involved”
“Maybe for some people a mocktail might be triggering and they may feel, ‘I want to have the real thing,’” Dr. Wilkens said. “But we would be setting it up as: Go and notice what it feels like to be sober. Have a good time. Go to this place with the expectation that you’ll have fun and there is no alcohol involved.”
If I may add, go to Getaway when you’ve got money to spend. The mocktails—with names like “Daters Gonna Date” and “That’s Just My Face”— cost $13. Ciders will set you back $6 each.
A Getaway bartender told me that most people start with pricey virgin drinks out of curiosity, but stick to cheaper options for round two. (My friends and I eschewed thriftiness and left with a $78 bill for six drinks and a hummus plate).
For Dr. Wilkens, if sobriety has to earn the troublesome—and expensive— “trendy” title to reduce the stigma around abstaining from drink, so be it. “For people to say, I’m a fun, sober person, I can’t imagine what would be wrong with that,” she shrugged.
Getaway is conveniently sandwiched between two Alcoholics Anonymous meeting centers within walking distance. But just as co-founders Sam Thonis and Regina Dellea will not check IDs at the door, the pair feel no need to ask customers if they are sober or not.
“It is just not a fun question,” Thonis said. Sometimes, AA members will leave “nice notes” on the receipt thanking their bartenders for opening a space.
While one might think of a sober bar as a glorified coffee shop, Getaway's proprietors still want the space to exude a communal, pub-like feel. Unlike Starbucks, the menu respectfully requests that patrons do not use laptops while inside.
Michael Scippa, public affairs director for the industry watchdog group Alcohol Justice, also believes that temperance does not have to kill the party.
“When they banned smoking, everyone said it was going to be the end of bars,” Scippa said. “Of course, none of that happened. It wasn't horrible. Bars are still flourishing. I think we’re probably about 20 years behind tobacco in terms of educating folks to the true dangers of a toxic substance.”
Thonis hopes to soon host trivia nights and other community programs, though Getaway declined a DJ’s recent offer to host a dance party. (The space is just a little too small for that, and the sceney vibe is less Top 40 and more Todd Rundgren on vinyl.)
According to the owners, Thursdays are the quietest nights at Getaway, which is open from 5pm to midnight. That was true when I stopped in last week, when only two sets of couples were out on dates. I was promised things get rowdy on the weekend, but Saturday around 10:30 pm the place was empty. Not wanting to sit alone, my group ended up at a nearby pub.
Getaway’s proprietors swear they have opened an agenda-less space that just so happens to serve no alcohol. As made evident by the saccharine cocktails, it is not a health-focused juice bar. In Thonis’ words, “If you want to eat a cheeseburger before you come here, eat a cheeseburger.”
Jen Batchelor grew up around alcohol—180-proof moonshine, that is. Growing up in Saudi Arabia, where drinking is illegal, Batchelor was the daughter of an expat who made his own black market hooch. “I had this unconventional introduction to alcohol, but I saw it as a unifier of community—it can bring people together,” she said.
Years later, Batchelor worked at a hospitality and wellness startup. “It’s easy to drink every night if you’re moving and shaking in New York,” Batchelor said. “When people say, ‘Let’s grab a drink,’ they really just want to connect, catch up, find a business opportunity. We’re requiring our brains to be happy and with it and be good listeners, but two or three glasses of wine in, I’m not that.”
Batchelor, a student of ayurvedic medicine, launched Kin Euphorics last December. The alcohol-free spirit is made with nootropics, also known as smart drugs.
Such substances are also found in caffeine, nicotine, and amphetamines. Though detailed research is sketchy, nootropics stimulate the brain’s release of dopamine , the feel-good hormone.
Kin launched last December via a glossy Vogue article ; since then, Batchelor says the company has attracted 20,000 customers. “If you did a scrub of our list, you’re going to get folks from the entertainment world or freelancers who cannot afford the downtime, be bloated, be hungover. That is time wasted, not spent doing our best,” she said.
Batchelor’s mission is not anti-alcohol. In her words, “I want people who have been reevaluating their relationship with alcohol—or the toxic, mindless habits of their life in general—to have an option that is relevant and respectful of them.” That option will not come cheap, though: Kin costs $47, on par with a bottle of the real stuff.
Much like Getaway’s owners, Batchelor has refrained from actively marketing Kin to alcoholics. “The sweet taste went down easy, but as my friend became giddy—that ‘oh god, mom has a wine-buzz’ kind of giddy—I felt next to nothing”
“If you are in recovery, Kin is not a substitution for that work,” she said. “There is a real psychoactive effect when it comes to Kin—we are absolutely stimulating your bliss molecules for pleasure and joy.” A respectable disclaimer, sure, but also a sneaky sales pitch. Who among us does not need some serious bliss stimulation?
I drank Kin on a recent Tuesday night at home with a friend. The sweet taste went down easy, but as my friend became giddy—that ‘oh God, mom has a wine-buzz’ kind of giddy—I felt next to nothing.
When I told Batchelor this, she said, “Kin affects everyone differently. Feeling really yourself, rejuvenated, energized is the typical feeling we hear about. People just want to dance, or just want to chill.”
For my part, I did sleep very well that night—and of course, woke up without a hangover (or, important to note, a sugar headache).
Kin is not the only non-alcoholic spirit in town, but with its juicy red coloring and minimalist packaging, it just may be the prettiest.
Earlier this year, Heineken launched a zero-proof beer in splashy fashion, enlisting The Office ’s Angela Martin and Brian Baumgartner to hype it. Diageo, the world’s largest producer of spirits, funds Seedlip, a faux spirit made from peas.
Kin will open its first speakeasy-themed sober bar in Brooklyn on May 21. Batchelor is currently planning the bar’s programming—she envisions “community-driven” events like Ted Talk-style conferences, female open mic nights, and drink and draws.
“The original intent of alcohol, thousands of years ago, was to transcend your existence for richer, deeper, more meaningful purposes,” Batchelor said. “I don’t know about you, but I can’t remember the last time I was at a bar and had a transcendent experience.” READ THIS LIST"
Police: Parents Killed 5-Year-Old A.J. Freund for Soiling His Pants,www.thedailybeast.com,Audrey.McNamara@thedailybeast.com (Audrey McNamara),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/aj-freund-case-parents-killed-5-year-old-illinois-boy-for-soiling-his-pants-cops-say-in-unsealed-affidavit,"05.01.19 10:17 PM ET Scott Olson/Getty
Andrew “A.J.” Freund, a 5-year-old Illinois boy found buried in a shallow grave last month, was killed by his mother and father after they became enraged that he’d soiled his pants and failed to ’fess up about it, police allege in newly unsealed search warrants.
The McHenry County Coroner’s office announced last week that the boy had died as a result of “craniocerebral trauma” caused by “multiple blunt force injuries,” with police alleging that his parents, JoAnn Cunningham and Andrew Freund Sr., forced him to sit in a freezing cold shower while they beat him. Both were charged with first-degree murder in connection with his death, among other charges, but details on his final moments and what prompted the alleged fatal beating were scarce.
A search warrant affidavit written by McHenry County Sheriff’s Det. Edwin Maldonado now reveals that investigators began digging deeper into the parents almost immediately after they reported him missing on April 18, claiming the last time they’d seen him was when he went to bed the previous night.
Investigators found a two-minute video on JoAnn Cunningham’s phone showing A.J. “laying on a bare mattress in a crib” in his room, with a woman who sounded like his mother “berating [him] for urinating on his bed” while he was covered in bandages and heavy bruising all over his chest and head, according to the affidavit.
Andrew Freund Sr., his father, is said to have finally confessed to police investigators and a FBI agent that A.J. was not missing but dead after being shown that video. He allegedly told police the injuries seen in the footage were caused by Joann, who he said used “hard physical beatings” to punish her son when she believed he was being defiant.
He allegedly said A.J. died after being forced into a cold shower—a punishment he’d deemed to be less brutal than the beatings—for 20 minutes. The boy was punished because he “lied about soiled underwear,” he said, according to the court documents.
A.J. was put to bed “cold, wet, and naked,” according to the documents, and was later found unresponsive in bed. His father allegedly told investigators he stored A.J.’s body in a plastic tote in the basement of the family home for nearly two days before transporting the body to a wooded area in Woodstock and burying it.
A.J.’s 4-year-old brother, identified in local news reports as Parker but as P.F. in the police affidavit, told investigators his parents told him his brother “fell down the stairs and had a lot of owies.” He said his parents told him not to talk about A.J.
Both JoAnn Cunningham, who is seven months pregnant with another child, and Andrew Freund Sr. are being held at McHenry County jail with bond set at $5 million each. Their next court hearing is set for May 10. Authorities have also moved to strip them of their parental rights for their younger son, Parker, with the next court hearing on that matter set for May 30."
The Trump White House Is Loving Itself Some Bill Barr: He ‘Dismembered’ Democrats,www.thedailybeast.com,asawin.suebsaeng@thedailybeast.com (Asawin Suebsaeng) Erin.Banco@thedailybeast.com (Erin Banco),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-trump-white-house-is-loving-itself-some-bill-barr-he-dismembered-democrats,"05.01.19 10:00 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
Shortly after Attorney General William Barr ’s Senate testimony ended on Wednesday, the Trump White House convened a conference call with surrogates and media allies. On it, Steven Groves, who serves as a deputy press secretary, assured listeners that the attorney general had not just done “a great job” but, according to a person on the call, “dismembered” Democratic lawmakers who sparred with him over whether the president had tried to obstruct justice.
What had seemed, to most outside observers, as a shaky moment for the administration—with the attorney general peppered as to why Special Counsel Robert Mueller had written him expressing frustration with Barr’s portrayal of Mueller’s findings —was internalized at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as a triumph.
“We have Barr’s back,” a senior White House official told The Daily Beast shortly after the Capitol Hill hearing wrapped following hours of testimony. And if there was any doubt that Trumpland was feeling emboldened by the proceedings it was dispelled just hours later, when Barr formally declined to attend a follow-up session with House Democrats on Thursday, citing, in part, his belief that he’d made himself readily available already to lawmakers.
White House officials maintained that the decision to ghost on the House Judiciary Committee was Barr’s alone. But among allies of the president, it was a glorious little F-U to the nattering critics in Congress.
“No, I don’t think [Barr] should appear before House Judiciary—they’re playing games with him,” John Dowd, Trump’s former lawyer in the Russia investigation who still keeps in touch with the president , told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “This is the attorney general of the United States. This is a high official of a coequal branch. You don’t treat him that way.”
Congressional Democrats, Dowd added, had been “juvenile” and asked “stupid questions.” Shortly thereafter, the Trump campaign blasted out a fundraising email with the subject line: “Stand With Barr.” Shortly after that, Trump tweeted out a Wall Street Journal oped titled ""A Real Attorney General.""
Barr’s hearing on Wednesday and his refusal to testify on Thursday mark yet another escalation in the fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over access to, and the interpretation of, the Mueller report. What had started out as a battle over the institutional powers of coequal branches has morphed into name-calling and overt political posturing, with the administration increasingly adopting the position that it simply won’t abide by Congress’ prerogatives.
Barr’s appearance came just hours after The Washington Post reported that Mueller wrote a letter to Barr in March, in which he said that the attorney general’s summary of his report “did not fully capture the context, nature and context” of it. In his opening remarks, Barr addressed his interactions with Mueller leading up to the release of the special counsel’s report. But while he faced some tough questions by Democrats on the committee, Republicans largely gave him cover from the vitriol of his critics.
“I think he was treated disrespectfully,” Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said of the questioning of Senate Democrats. “I thought he did an extraordinary job, was very professional throughout the hearing. What I saw most, out of all of that, was when you lost on the outcome of the investigation and a decision on no underlying crime, no obstruction, then they’re just trying to use it as fodder for as long as they can, I don’t think it lasts very long.”
For all the praise that Barr received from congressional Republicans and within the White House, there was still a looming sense that he would face a different, frostier reception when he testified before the Democratic-run House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
The committee’s chairman, Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), had pushed for committee lawyers to question the attorney general rather than members of the committee—a request that did not sit well with the Department of Justice. The two sides had negotiated for more than a week in an attempt to come to an agreement about the format of the hearing, its subject matter, and the line of questioning. But those efforts came apart. On Wednesday afternoon, Kerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, released a statement saying that Nadler’s “conditions” were both “unprecedented and unnecessary.” Nadler, in response, said that the committee would decide whether to issue a subpoena to compel Barr to come into testify.
“We are heading for a collision,” one Democratic lawmaker told The Daily Beast.
As Barr was stonewalling House Democrats, the Department of Justice was also blowing past its 10 a.m. deadline to submit the full, unredacted Mueller report to the judiciary committee, which had issued a subpoena for the report several weeks ago. Nadler said on Wednesday evening that the committee is seeking a contempt citation for the report.
The stonewalling from the administration has led to an uptick in meetings between various House committees about how to both compel Barr’s testimony and force President Trump to comply with congressional investigations. One senior Democratic aide said party leadership felt that one way to get Trump to capitulate was to continue using public testimonies by senior officials to “name and shame” the administration with the hope of bringing the focus back to Mueller’s findings.
But some Democrats are already thinking past Barr. On Wednesday, various lawmakers called on Mueller himself to testify, demanding that the Department of Justice officially set a day for such a hearing, which it has so far been reluctant to do.
Mueller’s testimony would be a fireworks display-type ending to a two-year-long investigation. But Democrats also believe that it could open new doors for investigating the president and his family.
For the White House and the Department of Justice, that would prove to be a nightmare, especially as Trump and his team gear up for the 2020 campaign. But it might not be one they can avoid. Several lawyers and former DOJ officials who spoke to The Daily Beast said there is no legal foundation or reason why the department would not allow Mueller to testify even if he is still technically a DOJ employee.
“I don’t see a legal basis on which they could prevent him from testifying,” said Elliot Williams, a the former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legislative Affairs at DOJ, adding that any slow-walking by DOJ is “political if nothing else.”
“I think it is an improbable and politically suicidal for the administration to not have Mueller testify at this point given the enormous public interest in his testimony,” he added.

Colbert: Barr’s Testimony to Senate Judiciary Made Me Want to ‘Wring His Neck’,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/stephen-colbert-attorney-general-william-barrs-testimony-to-senate-judiciary-made-me-want-to-wring-his-neck,"DISTURBING Colbert: Barr’s Testimony to Senate Judiciary Made Me Want to ‘Wring His Neck’ The ‘Late Show’ host has had it with the attorney general’s ‘bucket of lies’ about the Mueller Report. 05.01.19 9:32 PM ET Scott Kowalchyk/CBS
“Happy Bill Barr Day, everybody! I got you the traditional gift: a bucket of lies,” joked Stephen Colbert at the top of his program.
The Late Show host then offered his take on Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary “grilling” of “man-trying-to-hold-in-his-burp-until-the-elevator-door-opens, William Barr.”
“It was incredibly frustrating to watch—filled with legalistic hair-splitting and political ass-covering. I’d say it made me want to wring his neck but I’d need five more hands,” said Colbert.
Attorney General Barr was repeatedly questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee over his curious four-page memo “summarizing” the Mueller Report, wherein he appeared to let Trump off the hook, leading the president to boast of “complete and total exoneration”—a claim that appears in doubt, if Mueller himself is to be believed.
“Last night, The Washington Post reported that three days after Barr’s four-page summary, Mueller wrote Barr a letter complaining that Barr ‘did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance’ of Mueller’s work,” Colbert explained. “Context, nature, and substance. That is… everything . That’s like saying, I really like what you did with this car, except the wheels, the engine, and… the car.”
“Again,” Colbert continued, “Mueller sent his letter of complaint to Barr on March 27, but on April 10, in Senate testimony under oath , Barr said this.”
Colbert then through to a clip of Barr testifying—under oath: “I don’t know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion.”
“Yes, you do!” the comedian exclaimed, before mimicking Barr: “I don’t know if he really supported my conclusion. I mean, what is knowledge? Can we really know anything?”"
Trump Mocks ‘Very Nasty’ Kamala Harris and Other ‘Lunatics’ Who Questioned Attorney General Bill Barr,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-mocks-very-nasty-kamala-harris-and-other-lunatics-who-questioned-attorney-general-bill-barr,"Trump Mocks ‘Very Nasty’ Kamala Harris and Other ‘Lunatics’ Who Questioned Attorney General Bill Barr The president insists Barr ‘performed incredibly well’ during his Senate testimony. Justin Baragona 05.01.19 10:27 PM ET
Hours after Senate Democrats grilled Attorney General William Barr on his handling of the Mueller Report following the revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller accused Barr of creating “public confusion” with his initial summary , President Trump described the 2020 presidential candidates on the panel as “lunatics.”
Calling into Fox Business Network’s Trish Regan Primetime for a friendly Wednesday night chat, the president applauded Barr for doing a “fantastic job” while parroting his oft-repeated mantra that the Mueller Report showed “no collusion, no obstruction.”
Eventually, following Trump predictably calling on the “other side” to be investigated, an incredulous Trish Regan asked him about the growing call from Democrats for Barr to resign.
“I have not even heard that. It is so ridiculous, he is an outstanding man with an outstanding mind,” the president replied. “I heard he performed incredibly well today.”
The Fox Business host then mentioned Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who pressed Barr hard on whether the White House had asked him to investigate anyone, causing the attorney general to become flustered.
“She was probably very nasty,” Trump responded, drawing flashbacks to the 2016 presidential campaign and his “nasty woman” diss aimed at Hillary Clinton.
Trump then took aim at all three Senate Judiciary Democrats who are currently running for president—Harris, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).
“How about these three people?” Trump huffed. “Three of them are running, three not doing very well, but three are running for a particular office. I think, maybe you’re talking to the person right now. You have three of them running against me and they are up there ranting and raving. Like lunatics, frankly!”
The president went on to claim the three senators were heaping “abuse” on Barr for “political points” because they’re running for office, saying the public “sees through it easily.”
“I think they do!” Regan excitedly responded before boasting about Trump’s economic numbers. READ THIS LIST"
Seth Meyers Goes Off on Senate Republicans for ‘Obsessing’ Over Hillary Clinton’s Emails During Barr Testimony,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/seth-meyers-goes-off-on-lindsey-graham-and-senate-republicans-for-obsessing-over-hillary-clintons-emails-during-barr-testimony,"LET IT GO! Seth Meyers Slams Senate Republicans for ‘Obsessing’ Over Hillary Clinton’s Emails During Barr Testimony The ‘Late Night’ host had strong words for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and his GOP colleagues, who repeatedly brought up Hillary Clinton during AG Barr’s testimony. 05.01.19 10:24 PM ET NBC
Late Night host Seth Meyers dedicated his “A Closer Look” segment Wednesday night to Wednesday’s testimony of Attorney General William Barr in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Barr, who was handpicked for the AG role by President Trump, had to answer for why his four-page summary of the Mueller Report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the report—this according to the office of Robert Mueller .
“So now we know that the guy who spent almost two years putting together a 448-page report about a criminal conspiracy to interfere in the 2016 election complained that Trump’s handpicked attorney general misled the country about that report. That’s huge news,” explained Meyers. “And yet, when they had the chance to ask Barr about that news in a hearing today, Republican senators mostly acted like it didn’t happen.”
One of those people was Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Here’s the Mueller Report,” Graham said during Wednesday’s hearing, raising it high. “You can read it for yourself. It’s, uh, about 400-something pages. Can’t say I’ve read it all, but I’ve read most of it.”
“What do you mean you haven’t read it all? That was the assignment!” exclaimed Meyers. “Are you the guy who shows up to book club and says, ‘I’m really excited to talk about Moby Dick , but if we could just avoid any details about what happens to the whale, that’d be great. I didn’t get to the whale parts.’” (Plenty of senators, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have read the report in full.)
“So Graham admitted he hadn’t even read the whole report, and then he decided to spent the rest of his time harping not on Mueller but on the GOP’s favorite obsession: Hillary Clinton,” added Meyers.
Yes, Graham took it upon himself to read texts sent between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page concerning the bureau’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a personal email server. In the texts, Agent Strzok called Trump “abysmal” and a “fucking idiot” in the spring of 2016, well before the former reality-TV host was elected president.
“I love that Graham thinks it’s an incredible gotcha to read a bunch of text messages from FBI officials calling [Trump] a disaster. I mean, look at him. If you saw him on the street and had no idea who he was, you’d say, ‘Man, that guy’s a disaster,’” joked Meyers.
Later on, the comedian expanded on how the Senate Republicans were “obsessing over somebody that wasn’t even in the room” instead of questioning the attorney general about the possibility that Trump may have committed obstruction of justice—airing a montage of Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley, John Cornyn, John Kennedy, and Lindsey Graham repeatedly invoking Clinton’s name, and the investigation into her emails, during the AG’s testimony.
“Oh my God, guys, let it go!” said Meyers. “A thousand years from now, when global warming has destroyed the planet and hordes of zombie bandits roam the countryside, a gang of survivors is going to find an abandoned room in the Capitol with these words scrawled in blood: What About Hillary’s Emails? ”"
Chelsea Manning’s Lawyer Says She’s ‘Very Concerned’ for Her at Tribeca Premiere of ‘XY Chelsea’,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/chelsea-mannings-lawyer-says-shes-very-concerned-for-her-at-tribeca-film-festival-premiere-of-xy-chelsea,"EXPOSING SECRETS Chelsea Manning’s Lawyer Says She’s ‘Very Concerned’ for Her at Tribeca Premiere of ‘XY Chelsea’ Showtime The doc, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and will debut on Showtime later this year, chronicles the heavy toll the whistleblower’s cruel treatment has had on her. Amy Zimmerman 05.02.19 12:45 AM ET
A t the Wednesday night premiere of XY Chelsea at the Tribeca Film Festival, director Tim Hawkins mourned the fact that the subject of the documentary, Chelsea Manning , couldn’t be in attendance.
In 2013, Manning, a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst in Baghdad, received a 35-year sentence for leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents. It was reportedly “the longest ever sentence for a leak of U.S. government information.” Four years later, after Manning had already survived two suicide attempts and extended periods of solitary confinement in prison, President Obama commuted her sentence. Now, two years after that life-changing commutation, Manning is currently incarcerated once again—for refusing to testify in a grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks.
“When I first started making this film, Chelsea was still in prison in Kansas,” Hawkins explained. “And in one of the letters that she sent me, she made a kind of dark joke about how she thought she’s going to miss the premiere. That was three years ago. A lot has happened since then, and just weeks ago we were making preparations for her to be here with us today.”
In a conversation after the film—one that Manning would have participated in if she was not currently incarcerated—legal counsel Nancy Hollander told the crowd that she’s “very concerned” for Chelsea. “She’s not in solitary anymore, but I’m very concerned about her being there and I’m concerned about what this means for the rest of her life, that this is just another example. The government is going to continue to go after her. There’s really no reason for them to need Chelsea’s testimony at this point, as far as I’m concerned.”
Asked to clarify the stand that Manning is currently taking, Hollander continued, “It’s an objection to the process. The grand jury is a secret organization that we shouldn’t have in our system to begin with. If she testifies, she runs into tremendous risk to herself, and she also doesn’t believe that we should have grand juries. For her, it’s another step in the principled actions that she has taken. They’re very courageous actions. This is something I would expect from her.”
Hollander’s statements line up with the portrait that XY Chelsea paints. It’s an intimate study of a woman with no apparent sense of self-preservation—someone who throws herself again and again into principled fights, at the cost of her emotional and mental well-being, and ultimately her freedom.
The documentary also helps to shed light on the personal toll of Manning’s courageous choices. While Manning has proven herself willing to risk almost anything to take a stand, she has been severely traumatized by the repercussions of her actions. During one of the bleakest interviews that she gives throughout the film, Manning describes her experience in solitary confinement prior to her military hearing. At one point, in Kuwait, she was kept in a cage for 60 days, for up to 23-and-a-half hours per day. Manning struggles to articulate what she experienced there, before concluding, “I was alive but also dead, and I’ve been dead since.” For Manning, even after her release, freedom feels like “purgatory.” She explains her inability to escape “this sense of impending doom”—paranoia that has since proved prophetic.
Now that Chelsea Manning is back in hell, it feels more imperative than ever to understand how she ended up there in the first place. “ I was alive but also dead, and I’ve been dead since. ” — Chelsea Manning
The documentary begins with news of the commutation of Manning’s sentence. It follows her from her release to a safe house, and then out into the world. At various points we return to the past, reconstructing Manning’s whistleblowing, her trial, and her time in prison through messages, phone calls, and news footage, all framed through Manning’s own recollections. In the present-day narrative, we see Manning physically adjusting to freedom. In her words, “learning how to be again.” Of course, Manning has to do more than “just be”; she’s a public figure now, and we watch her navigate fame—interviews, photoshoots, her first viral tweet. Some people want to hear from Manning, learn more about why she did what she did. Others, like threatening trolls who call her a traitor, have already made up their minds.
XY Chelsea is in part an effort to refute the narratives that formed around Manning when she first entered the public’s consciousness, like takes that attributed her decision to give classified documents to WikiLeaks to gender dysphoria-related distress. To hear Chelsea Manning tell it, she was disturbed by what was being done in the name of the American people in Iraq and Afghanistan, from civilian deaths to torture tactics. In her words, “life was cheap in Iraq.” While on leave, Manning recalled feeling as if everyday Americans had forgotten about the war, and were unaware of its atrocities. She had access to classified documents that would provide a window into these wartime realities; moreover, she felt guilt over her complicity. Manning attempted to contact multiple mainstream news outlets, but wasn’t getting anywhere. Knowing that she needed to leak the documents before returning to Iraq, she turned to WikiLeaks.
During the film’s talkback, Hawkins emphasized, “Really, if you honestly look at the interaction between [Assange and Manning] it wasn’t the kind of thing that’s been built up by the media. And I think, you know, we often make these sort of associations, that they’re kind of part of a cabal, that Snowden and Assange and Chelsea are all friends and talking on the phone and that’s just not the case…I think what this film was really about is firstly the personal story, and re-centering the perspective.”
An important part of that reclamation is hearing Manning talk about her transition, on her own terms. Manning says that she always intended to go public as a whistleblower, but was afraid that “being trans would take over everything else.” She served her sentence in an all-male prison, where she was able to successfully sue to begin hormone therapy. As a trans woman in prison, Manning remembers being ogled and judged by fellow prisoners and guards. She says that the guards would often walk in on her while changing; and then, she adds, there were the strip searches. In a recorded excerpt of a prison phone call, an emotional Manning can be heard pleading, “I want to be treated like a human being, I want to be treated like a woman.” Painful descriptions of an attempted suicide attempt underline the direness of the situation that Manning had found herself in—believing, at that point, that she would spend the rest of her life behind bars.
Once she was released Manning wasted little time putting her platform to use, throwing herself into activist work before she had begun to adjust to life outside. She even launched a Senate campaign, in part galvanized by the rise of the alt-right. At one point in the documentary, explaining why she felt the need to speak out against fascism, Manning asks, “What are they going to do, throw me in prison? Or kill me? They’re going to do that anyway.”
This anti-fascist fight quickly led to a huge controversy: Manning, in what she describes as an effort to learn more about her enemy, attended an alt-right event . While Manning was transparent about her efforts and her motives, many accused her of hanging out with neo-Nazis and bombarded her with criticism on social media. Documentary footage taken in the midst of the backlash shows Manning extremely upset, mainly with herself. A subsequent tweet sent from the roof of a building sparked fears that Manning might attempt suicide. While she was ultimately fine, she took a step back from her campaign in an effort to focus on her health.
At one point in the film, Manning insists, “I’m not a hero”; she is, however, someone who firmly believes that no one should sit around waiting for a savior—that “it’s not going to stop until we stop them.” This core belief illuminates Manning’s actions. She is someone who stands up for what she believes in, often past her human limits.
Speaking on Manning’s current incarceration, Janus Rose, a friend and member of Chelsea’s jail support committee, said, “She really is concerned about using this as an opportunity to engage in another protest against a system that she finds unjust.” Later on, Rose added, “She didn’t want to just kind of fall into obscurity when she was released. She wanted to seize this moment and use it to produce some kind of good, because she’s always kind of been the kind of person that can’t really just like sit by when she knows she can do something. I always tell people that’s the most consistent thing about her personality, is that in every phase of her life that I know about, she seems to, when given an opportunity to do something, she has this bias toward action. And you know, sometimes it’s good, sometimes it backfires. But I think it’s great and it’s good that we have people like that.”
Another Manning lawyer, Vince Ward, agreed, saying that “Chelsea’s not a typical person.” He continued, “There’s something about being around people who are sacrificial to an extent, and I didn’t really think that existed until I was around Chelsea—that there were people who were literally willing to do something that was so contrary to their self-interest because they felt that strongly about something.""
“I know that she says she’s not special, but I think there’s something special about that rebellious spirit,” Hawkins chimed in. “But at the same time, if you act alone against a huge institution like the U.S. government, it’s going to crush you. It’s going to swallow you up, and so whilst we kind of venerate and can sometimes martyrize figures like Chelsea, whistleblowers who stand up, actually what we really need to do is be getting behind them collectively, because it’s only going to be through collective action that we actually do make any sort of real changes... You need the rebels and people like Chelsea, but you also need all of us to really rally around. And I think now is a great moment for us to help her.”
At the beginning of the film, Manning confesses that she loves a good coming-of-age story. It’s a sentiment made all the more poignant as we see how Manning used the army to escape a largely unhappy adolescence, before moving from the military to prison, and essentially losing a decade in the process. As Rose put it, “She didn’t really get to have a young adulthood… and all of a sudden she comes out and she’s, you know, 29 approaching 30 years old and the world has changed.”
Now, Manning’s life has once again been put on hold, as her friends and supporters eagerly wait for the day that she can start learning “how to be” all over again."
How Woodstock 50 Is Shaping Up to Be Fyre Fest 2.0,www.thedailybeast.com,,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-woodstock-50-is-shaping-up-to-be-fyre-fest-20,"How Woodstock 50 Is Shaping Up to Be Fyre Fest 2.0 Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast Financiers claim the 50th anniversary festival honoring Woodstock is cancelled. The festival’s lead organizer, meanwhile, claims the show will go on. Joseph Longo 05.02.19 3:34 AM ET
I f Woodstock 50 fails to launch, it’ll be a twist of irony as the event honoring an infamously issue-plagued festival has itself become synonymous with behind-the-scenes woes—chaos that evokes a more Fyre -like festival.
Michael Lang, lead organizer of Woodstock 50, is adamant the anniversary festival will take place in August with the same lineup, same partners and at the same venue.
A source with Amplifi Live, the investment arm of lead financier Dentsu Aegis Network which canceled the festival on Monday , unequivocally disagrees. “He’d have to come up with a different name. Different talent. Different everything,” the source told The Daily Beast. “The festival is now ours, and then we decided to cancel it.”
This is just the latest in a back-and-forth battle regarding the future of Woodstock 50, the highly anticipated festival that was (and maybe still is) set to run August 16 to 18 in Watkins Glen, New York and features headliners Miley Cyrus, The Killers and Jay-Z. At the crux of the debate: Who owns Woodstock 50?
Lang, alongside hotelier Greg Peck and another partner, operate the Woodstock 50 LLC, which runs the festival’s website . “Dentsu has no legal right or ability to cancel it,” Woodstock 50’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz said in a statement Tuesday. Kasowitz is President Trump’s former longtime personal attorney .
The truth is a little bit more complicated, and it starts with permits. Event site Watkins Glen International Speedway is the official applicant and submitted final permits to several New York state departments and Schuyler County on April 15.
But they waited too long. The mass gathering permit by the Department of Health needed approval before Woodstock 50 could sell tickets. With a previously announced Earth Day ticket sale kickoff on April 22 looming, Lang claims the state was willing to issue a conditional permit assuming Watkins Glen secured a needed bond. While it’s unclear if the bond was issued—the speedway declined to comment for this article—the Department of Health did not rule on the permit, forcing Woodstock 50 to indefinitely postpone their kickoff with no explanation.
On Tuesday, a source for Dentsu denounced claims that permits are still being considered, stating they contacted all state and county offices to cancel permits. However, the Department of Health said the speedway’s permit is still pending and was never asked to be revoked. To which the Dentsu source replied, “I can only assume it’s government. It takes time to wind things down.”
The State Department of Health reconfirmed to The Daily Beast Wednesday a day after Dentsu’s claim that the speedway’s permit is still pending and they are in contact to “determine” next steps.
Slated performer John Fogerty took a jab at the permits debacle on Tuesday. “For Woodstock 75, we can all still get together and sing ‘Kumbaya.’ They should start working on getting the permits right now,” he told Rolling Stone .
Lang admits the entire festival got off to a late start. Contract settlements with the Japan-based Dentsu, as well as with event company Superfly and booker Danny Wimmer Presents all took an “extraordinary” amount of time. Danny Wimmer didn’t start booking until November, while festivals like Lollapalooza and Coachella begin up to a year in advance. The official announcement came January 9, 2019, seven months ahead of the festival weekend. “ He’d have to come up with a different name. Different talent. Different everything. ”
Following their Monday cancellation statement, a source for Dentsu claimed they told all major talent agencies the festival is a no-go. Billboard spoke with an unnamed talent agent who sided with Dentsu, saying the artist contracts are with the financiers and not Woodstock 50.
“It’s kind of a legal question as to what the control factor is,” Lang told The Daily Beast in response to Billboard ’s story, claiming the contracts are with both Dentsu and Woodstock 50. “We feel that will be all worked out,” he said, noting his attorneys are reviewing contracts.
Lang claims he issued a notice to all agencies stating Woodstock 50 expects talent to perform in August. In actuality, he sent them the same letter emailed to the 207,000 people signed up for Woodstock.com notifications. The letter did not mention the artists or their expectation to perform.
The back-and-forth has left performers and their teams in limbo, though Lang believes “As far as we’re concerned, they refer to us.” Variety reported performers were paid in advance with money currently held in escrow.
A representative for Santana and David Crosby said, “We have no idea what’s going on. Until then, we’re not making any statements.” A source close to rapper Taylor Bennett believed the festival was cancelled. However, another band who asked not be mentioned by name due to the unclear legal obligations said, “Until we’re told the festival is absolutely canceled, we’ll play it.” Several publicists and managers did not return requests for comment.
Part of the confusion over festival control comes down to apparent party loyalty. While Woodstock 50 alongside Danny Wimmer Presents booked the talent, Billboard reported the contracts are with Dentsu.
Festival sponsors, on the other hand, are Lang’s people. “We’re moving forward until we hear differently from the organizers. It’s a really important thing what Michael Lang and his team are doing,” a spokesperson for Hiring America said. The veteran affairs organization is in preliminary stages of planning their on-site activities. “ Until we’re told the festival is absolutely canceled, we’ll play it. ”
Event company Superfly, which has largely stayed quiet this week, was hired through Dentsu and continued to take their direction post-cancellation statement, even initially referring Daily Beast’s inquiries to the financial investors.
In a rare agreement, both Dentsu and Woodstock 50 state Billboard erroneously reported that unnamed festival organizers tried to fire event company Superfly. A source for Dentsu told The Daily Beast, “That is not accurate” and praised Superfly’s performance.
“There are points along the way where we discussed changing production partners, but we decided in the interest of keeping things on track to continue on,” Lang said, also denying Woodstock 50 tried to fire Superfly. Billboard has not issued a correction and did not immediately return The Daily Beast’s request for comment.
Yet a day later, Superfly officially cut all ties with Woodstock 50, following Dentsu’s lead. A spokesperson for the event company said Superfly will not be involved in any further festival planning. Woodstock 50 is talking to new vendors and investors this week, including CID Entertainment , which produces Bonnaroo and Mountain Jam , the latter which set to take place on the site of the original 1969 Woodstock.
The iconic farm has since become the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, where this year’s troubles first started. Bethel Woods rejected Woodstock 50’s request to hold the festival on their site. Their max capacity is 15,000, while Lang expects 75,000 attendees at Woodstock 50.
While still unclear why Dentsu pulled out, most reports are settling around Dentsu’s lack of confidence in securing a large enough audience. TMZ reported the investors requested 100,000 attendees. However, Lang is requesting capacity for 75,000. Smaller, he claims, than the 250,000 permitted for 1994 Woodstock and 220,000 for 1999 Woodstock.
The economic impact of Woodstock 50s’ possible cancellation has already hit Watkins Glen, NY. Scott Bell, general manager of Watkins Glen Harbor Hotel, has gone from entirely sold-out Woodstock 50 weekend to a few cancellations in just the past two days. “What the public and everybody misses is the amount of work that has gone into it to date,” Bell said."

Marlow Stern 05.02.19 5:39 AM ET
T OPANGA, California—Upon arriving at the rustic, wood-accented restaurant nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains, a bohemian establishment boasting a menu of “locally sourced organic ingredients” and a hearty diet of Elliott Smith, the first thought that crossed my mind was: Blair Cornelia Waldorf wouldn’t be caught dead here .
You see I’m here to meet Leighton Meester , who for five years embodied one of the all-time great television characters on Gossip Girl . A mélange of Sarah Michelle Gellar’s Kathryn Merteuil and Reese Witherspoon’s Annette Hargrove, her Queen B reigned over Manhattan’s Upper East Side—a paragon of glamour and bitchiness. Serena van der Woodsen and the rest of the gals at Constance never stood a chance. That Meester’s mantel isn’t lined with Emmys is a crying shame, though perhaps voters will be more partial to her new scene-stealing sitcom role.
Meester’s Angie D’Amato is the heart and soul of Single Parents , a surprisingly funny ABC sitcom from New Girl ’s Liz Meriwether and J.J. Philbin. A single mother with a needy young boy, Angie is overwhelmed and, due to her past with men, emotionally guarded. She’s also a bit of an oddball, her two biggest vices being corn chips and death metal (she worships at the altar of Slayer). Fortunately, Angie finds camaraderie in a group of other single parents with young children—Will Cooper (Taran Killam), Douglas Fogerty (Brad Garrett), Poppy Banks (Kimrie Lewis), and Miggy Park (Jake Choi)—who help her navigate the chaos.
It’s been seven years, one marriage (to Adam Brody, of The O.C. fame), one child, and one stint on Broadway since Gossip Girl , and Meester seems, well, content. “It just seems right ,” the 33-year-old actress says of Single Parents .
As our brunch interview comes to a close, she motions to a man in a red baseball cap perched at the bar, his head buried in his phone. “Are you watching Bernie Sanders videos over there?” she says, playfully. It’s Brody, her husband of five years. They live nearby, in Cali bohemia, with their daughter Arlo. He smiles, and the two embrace.
Before that, we discussed everything from her unique childhood to parenthood and Single Parents .
How did you and Liz Meriweather connect? Because I remember when your husband guested on New Girl as Zooey Deschanel’s jealous ex.
Right! He’s still in love with her. [ Laughs ] I had met her before as well—I forget the scenario, whether it was social or work-related, but probably both—throughout the years. And I’m a huge fan of hers. Jason [Winer], who’s directed a lot of Single Parents and is the executive producer, I really like his whole vibe and whole tone—this New Girl -meets- Modern Family vibe. I was like, oh, this is something I can sink my teeth into, and everyone was very supportive of this collaborative experience. We are a squad, and hopefully it translates, but it’s actually like we’re having fun and we’re friends but they’re filming it.
You and Taran Killam, especially, have great chemistry on the show. How early on was that apparent to you?
Early on. At first, the people behind the show were the pitch—J.J. [Philbin] and Liz [Meriweather] and Jason [Winer]—and Taran was already onboard, and I’m a huge fan of his professionally. And the first day I met him, we just ended up talking for over an hour and realizing that we had a lot in common life-wise. He is a very inspiring, supportive, encouraging person who I can go to with almost anything, and who’s pushed me to stand by jokes that I believe in. But somewhere along the line, we were hanging out outside of work, going to karaoke, going to dinners, and our families were hanging out together.
What are your go-to karaoke songs?
He does Green Day with that voice very well. And he’s done that Shaggy song “It Wasn’t Me” very well—both parts. For me, anything Kate Bush. I do this full-blown, wannabe impersonation. And En Vogue, which is way more than a duet.
Love En Vogue. Are we talking an anthem like “Free Your Mind” or more on the ballad side, like “Don’t Let Go?”
Definitely “Don’t Let Go”—like, fall to the floor and sing on your knees type of thing.
I remember listening to that on the Set It Off soundtrack. You ever see that flick? With Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, Jada Pinkett, and Kimberly Elise as the four friends who rob a bank?
I don’t think so! OK, I gotta look for that!
Oh, it kicks ass. They buy their guns from Dr. Dre. Highly recommend. I think the last time I sang karaoke me and a friend did “The Call” by the Backstreet Boys.
How does that one go?
[Sings terribly] Listen baby I’m sorry, just wanna tell ya don’t worry, I will be late don’t stay up and wait for me…
Oh! For some reason, I missed the whole TRL era. Like, I saw it all, but I think I was just always like, I can’t. I don’t know why! “ Early on I was like, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if my character was really into Slayer?’ And then I had to do a full performance of it—I’m singing it, my daughter’s singing it, I have to explain to her what ‘reign in blood’ means. ”
Looking back, TRL had such an odd mix of talent—you had the boy bands but then groups like Korn and Kid Rock.
Yeah, Korn was mainstream! My character is really into Korn on the show—and Slayer, which was a big mistake. Early on I was like, “Wouldn’t it be funny if my character was really into Slayer?” And then I had to do a full performance of it—I’m singing it, my daughter’s singing it, I have to explain to her what “reign in blood” means.
[ Laughs ] Right. Angie has this big 30th birthday bash on the show where they recreate Ozzfest and she belts out a Slayer song. Did you do anything big for your 30th?
No! I had recently become a mom, so I think I didn’t do much. I think I had dinner. There’s no fun, ceremonial birthdays anymore! The last big birthday I had, as far as a big party, was when I was turning 25 all my best friends threw me a surprise party, and that was very touching.
That must have run right up against the end of Gossip Girl , right?
Yeah. It was probably during, but for some reason I was out here. Very slowly, I became an Angeleno. I was out here for all of my breaks and hiatuses, and since I’d lived here prior I had a lot of friends out here, so it was really where my center was for the last two years of the show.
How have you found being an Angeleno? Some people enjoy the chaos of New York since it can add fuel to the fire, but out here feels like a healthy downshift.
It is. I am so glad that I had my early- to- mid-twenties in New York. It was like going off to college—but instead I was making a show. I lived in the city and it was the perfect place to live alone, get to know myself. The other part of that is, here I’ll go out and not really come face to face with people, but there you go out your door and have to always interact with people. You’re a bit more mobile there; like, I can walk to the store or take the train to this and that place. It’s a different life. And in many ways, as a single person—and a single person—it’s easier and more convenient to do that. But when you have a family, it’s the exact opposite. You go grocery shopping and everyone is in their coats, and you have to take off your coats, your shoes, your hats, your soaking-wet snow boots; then, you have to pick out all your groceries and load up a car—or don’t. You’re pushing a stroller where there’s sloshy, black snow splashing you, and then have to try to get it up and down from the subway. It’s a whole other thing.
And the bars out here close at 2 a.m.
The bars close at 2—which is why it’s so great to be in your early twenties in New York, where they never close. In the very early days I went out, and I’m pretty sure I had a fake ID when I first was there, because I was 20. It was from Nevada and of someone who looked nothing like me whatsoever. The funny thing was, I didn’t really even drink that much or anything around that time, I just thought, let’s go out at bars, this is cool, play some pool. But then I’d go to work at 5 o’clock in the morning when people are being let out of the bars and clubs and still peeing on the street while I’m on my way to work, so that quickly changed and I didn’t really have that going on. But it was just a great place to live in my little apartment. I think of these little, special pockets of time during that period—and certainly moving out here, I met my husband right away, and life changed.
It’s funny—for a lot of people my age who watched both The O.C. and Gossip Girl , you two occupied about a decade of TV viewing during our late-teens and twenties. Did you watch The O.C. ?
I didn’t! But I know it was very special and important to a lot of people. And yeah, it is funny. I’d met Adam throughout the years, but then I moved out here and it was like life was different.
Was it through Josh Schwartz?
Through Josh, through acquaintances. And then we ended up doing a movie together, The Oranges . People sort of have a fantasy about that overlap of characters in real life. They have a whole … special place in their heart for it.
You two do have that shared experience as well—both knowing what it’s like to be in that pop-culture maelstrom of being on a hit teen show.
Absolutely. And I think there’s something about working at a young age that feels like you can understand each other. But also being on something that gets attention at a young age, it’s great, but also is something that requires some examining … There is this requirement in me to go back and look at that and examine it a bit more. I still had to go through all the learning, and relationships, and moving, and just all the experiences that people go through growing and making mistakes—while I was working and had a consistent job, which was great, but also, to some degree, having that be examined. Like, relationships with people that you date in college, I suppose, when you’re not in this line of work, nobody knows or hears about that, you know? But the same goes with the music that I was making at that time. It’s much different than what I am doing now. I was learning about myself and trying to figure it all out.
Do you feel like you were pushed into a pop direction at that age?
I feel I was. I think that was also a 20-year-old’s taste, and it was also, this is what we’re going to capitalize on . While I did have a very amicable break with Universal-Republic, it was mutually like, this isn’t what either party is looking for. It just wasn’t me; it wasn’t what I wanted. And I even felt it at the time. But now, I’m grateful that I can step away from that and do something like Single Parents , do a play, or do the music I’m making now.
It seems like such a good fit, you on Single Parents . Having played an iconic character like Blair Waldorf, do you feel audiences needed some time to adapt to you as a grown-up?
I think the nice thing about specifically this audience is that they’re growing up as well. A lot of people are like, “I watched you when I was a kid.” And there are some people who are willing to step away and say, I’m going to follow you to the play you’re in, or the music you’re doing, or the new show you’re on, and can look away and see whatever it is that you’re into now, how your taste has grown, and where your inspiration has taken you. And I think the opposite is true, too. That show meant so much to so many people in that specific time and space, and they can’t and don’t want to look beyond it. But yeah, it hasn’t really gotten in the way of me being able to have other opportunities and other jobs that don’t entail me being a rich, fancy lady! I have been told, interestingly—and I take it as a compliment in many ways—by a producer or casting director before they’ve met me that I’m too “glamorous”—specifically that word. And don’t get me wrong, I take that as a compliment, but it’s one character that I’ve played. It isn’t me. I mean, I’m from South Florida.
But you were born in Texas, right?
I was born there but immediately moved, within a month or two. I just happened to be born there. I guess my birthing parent happened to be there. And then I lived in Cincinnati, but I don’t remember that, living with my grandma. And then I moved to Florida, and that’s where my family still lives.
What do you mean by “birthing parent?”
My mother. “ I think it’s always something that I think, whether you become a mother or father, you do revisit unconsciously or consciously—your past, your origins, your upbringing—and try to look at what was done right and wrong. ”
And you were born under unique circumstances [ Meester’s parents were serving a federal prison sentence at the time for smuggling marijuana ]. Have you thought about that, now that you’re a mother yourself?
I think it’s always something that I think, whether you become a mother or father, you do revisit unconsciously or consciously—your past, your origins, your upbringing—and try to look at what was done right and wrong. For me, that’s what’s been interesting being a mother myself, and helpful. And also, playing a mother has been so enlightening and wonderfully rounding. I love Angie in the hilarity of the way the character is written, but I also love how she is, because of her environment, sort of walled-off to the possibility of hurt, and help, and relationships, and vulnerability, and saying “I love you.” Whenever I watch a show or a movie that I really love, all the characters are so distinctly themselves and I can find myself in each one of them, and I can certainly find facets of Angie in me—not just the comedy stuff, but the more drama-leaning stuff from my life has managed to seep in.
Has your opinion evolved when it comes to what your parents did to land themselves in prison? Because the attitude nationally toward marijuana has really changed quite a bit in recent years. And from an outsider’s perspective, smuggling marijuana from Jamaica back then sounds pretty fascinating.
That might be the movie version. In this time in my life, now, personally how I’ve always felt, is that the way we have it now in California—at least with recreational marijuana—that’s right. That’s where we should head. I personally think, much like cigarette ads, they shouldn’t be advertising it that way—in billboards and magazines—and certainly I think there will be laws that change that eventually.
And edibles, woof . The most banged-up I’ve ever gotten is on edibles. You just have no idea where those things are gonna take you.
I’ve had some full-blown am I alive? moments—which are scary. But yeah, as far as recreational marijuana, and the long-term prison sentences for a minor offense of almost any drug, to be honest, is not right. But that was a different time, and certainly a different offense. Nobody was just smoking weed and went to prison.
When the college admission scandal news broke, The Cut did this funny post about how Gossip Girl “predicted” the scandal. It struck me as a bit of a stretch, and seemed to draw the connection just because there was some SAT cheating on the show.
Oh, there was?!
Yeah! Serena gets roofied by Georgina Sparks and can’t make the SATs, so Chuck sends in a person to take it for her—who also took it for him. But then, there’s Blair who’s playing mind games with Nelly Yuki in order to have her screw up on the SATs and not make it into Yale.
Ohhh , that’s right. This is a stretch! But I do remember that—and no, I did not see that article. [ Laughs ]
I re-watched Gossip Girl recently, and a few things struck me as odd. For one, the Nate Archibald character literally transforms into Jared Kushner—running The Spectator , a spin on The Observer . And then, there’s this character, Willa Weinstein, who’s supposed to be Harvey Weinstein’s daughter on the show. She’s a weird nude performance artist who tries to seduce Dan Humphrey at Tisch.
Oh, that’s funny. And we also had Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump on the show.
Right. That infamous scene at the Boom Boom Room .
I wish I had remembered that experience. I was with a bunch of the other people on the show and remember meeting them, but they gave us a green room and me and all the other girls just hung out—so we didn’t talk to them, really. I got no other juice for ya!
In preparing for this interview, I saw a ton of headlines about how your appearance with Adam at the Shazam! premiere was your first red-carpet appearance as a couple in two years. Having spent so much of your twenties in the public eye, is it nice to step back a bit?
I don’t enjoy the parties and events so much. We support each other and do what needs to be done, so I was happy to join him there at Shazam! Actual work is always on my mind too. Being with my daughter is the priority, so I want to make sure the work I’m doing is meaningful and important to me in a way that I can justify not being with her for however many hours it takes to work every day—and the same goes for going to events and stuff. But I would argue that I wasn’t necessarily ever going out and doing that anyway! But I guess time’s have changed—though only in the way that life changes."
"Yes, Buying Alcohol Is Still Illegal in Parts of the U.S.",www.thedailybeast.com,Wayne Curtis,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-buying-alcohol-is-still-illegal-in-parts-of-the-us,"Yes, Buying Alcohol Is Still Illegal in Parts of the U.S. Imagno/Getty For an estimated 18 million Americans across the country, Prohibition never ended and they’re still prohibited from buying a drink. Wayne Curtis 05.02.19 5:25 AM ET
T he population of Beaver County, Oklahoma, is 5,315 and deeply divided. In a vote last year to determine whether alcohol sales should be made legal—it’s been a dry county for more than a century—the wets initially prevailed, voting in legal liquor by a scant five votes. But then the provisional ballots were tallied. And…the prohibitionists carried the day. So Beaver County remains alcohol-free. It is the last and only county in Oklahoma where you can’t buy a legal drink.
Oklahoma has long been a laboratory for Prohibition —it effectively ended liquor sales in 1908, a decade before the national ban, and didn’t allow much in the way of hard liquor sales until 1959. But the most interesting result of this last electoral experiment was not that Beaver County narrowly chose to remain dry. It was that 13 other counties in the same election all voted to go wet.
“Dry counties” exist as a sort feral anachronism—like phone booths and video stores. They appeared in response to perceived social or economic need, and when those needs dissipated, they were left behind, like flotsam from a flood nobody remembers. We are a nation that’s pretty good at building laws, and pretty lousy at dismantling them.
And so dry counties persist—today an estimated 18 million people are unable to buy a legal drink where they live. Mostly these persist in the south, and a map of dry counties overlaid with one of the Bible Belt, not surprisingly, shows considerable overlap. (Although the penchant for dryness fades as you get closer to the Gulf of Mexico.) The states with the most dry counties are Kentucky, Arkansas and Tennessee. Fact: you can still get arrested for possession of alcohol in some dry counties, as a 69-year-old man in Culliman, Alabama, learned recently.
A survey of dry counties is complicated by the fact that there’s considerable variation in laws about what sort of sales are allowed (for instance, near-beer and wine only), and where sales can take place (bars and restaurants, grocery stores). All this confusion dates back to Repeal—once the U.S. Congress lifted the ban on liquor sales in 1933, it was left up to each state to decide if it wanted to outlaw liquor.
Many did—Mississippi, for instance, maintained its liquor ban until 1966. At least in theory—booze was still widely sold and consumed in Mississippi. Even the governor was caught up in a liquor raid while dining at a country club. A short time later, he admitted that the poorly enforced ban made his state a laughingstock, so he signed a new law that permitted the resumption of legal alcohol sales.
But the 1966 loosening of laws in Mississippi came with a catch—the state technically remained dry by default. Counties were allowed to vote whether they wanted to go wet. If they didn’t, they automatically remained dry. Today, 32 of the state’s 82 counties still prohibit liquor sales.
Kicking the can down the road from the feds to more ever-more local jurisdictions led to this fragmented process of regulating liquor. For instance, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kansas are technically dry, but allow local communities to vote to go wet. Other states have done the inverse—gone wet stateside, but permit local jurisdictions to vote whether they’d like to remain alcohol free. (More than a dozen states explicitly prohibit counties from voting to go dry even if they so choose.)
State oversight can lead to an even more curious patchwork. In some jurisdictions, cities or towns within a dry county have voted to go wet, yielding what are often called “moist” counties. For instance, Hollywood, Prineville, Reform, and Rogersville are all wet cities within dry Alabama counties.
And politics can lead to even narrower slices of wet. Moore County, Tennessee—home to the Jack Daniel’s distillery—is dry, but the distillery is allowed to sell “commemorative” bottles… that happen to be full of whiskey, provided the purchasers leave the county before consuming them.
While social currents are squirrely, dry counties have faced an ebb tide lately. Oklahoma’s sweeping vote last year—yielding 13 new wet counties—is not an outlier. About four dozen cities in Texas have petitioned to vote wet/dry in the past two years; all those that have come up for vote have gone wet. Indeed, in 1965, Texas had 142 dry counties; only five now remain.
Others are striving to go wet, if not quite succeeding. Five years ago a ballot measure in Arkansas to legalize liquor sales in all 75 counties went down to defeat. And this year a push to allow individual cities within dry counties in Arkansas to sell liquor was withdrawn, with the bill’s sponsor admitting, “I didn’t have the will of the people on this one.”
Notably, Virginia recently aimed to switch up oversight. A bill was sent to the governor’s desk earlier this year that would instantly make liquor sales legal in all counties—although the 31 dry counties could vote to remain dry (only nine are entirely dry; others are “moist”). Rather than putting the burden on the wets to lobby for sales, this approach flips the stakes such that proponents of prohibition have to take the first steps to maintain the status quo.
Why is dry America getting damp? Part of it may be the fading of collective memory—we forget why these patchwork laws were implemented in the first place. Part of it is a loosening of social mores. But a major driver is certainly practicality. Counties that forego liquor sales often lose out on economic development and retail opportunities to neighboring counties where liquor is sold. Wal-Mart in particular has been a quiet player, reportedly letting counties know that liquor sales may be a factor in whether they erect a new store within their bounds, or twenty miles down the road in a wet county. And restaurateurs, who often depend on sweetening their pot through liquor sales, may seek to put down roots in wetter terrain. As a result, potential new residents may prefer to live somewhere that there’s more choice in their dining options
Studies also suggest, paradoxically, that dry counties may actually be more troubled by drunk driving. The reason isn’t all that hard to figure out: those who choose to patronize a bar will have to drive longer distances to cross a county line. (Other studies have found that many liquor stores set up just over the county line for convenience to the drys.) A 1997 study in Texas, found the rate of fatalities in drunk-driving accidents was three times higher in dry counties than in wet.
Evidence is mounting that the era of dry counties is in eclipse—although how fast it fades into oblivion is yet to be known. But it’s clear that a century after it implementation, Prohibition is—at last—loosening its long grip.
Wet, it appears, is our natural condition. Dry is not."

"Venezuela: When a Coup Is Not a Coup, What the Hell Do You Do?",www.thedailybeast.com,christopher.dickey@thedailybeast.com (Christopher Dickey),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/venezuela-when-a-coup-is-not-a-coup-what-the-hell-do-you-do,"DISAPPOINTMENT Venezuela: When a Coup Is Not a Coup, What the Hell Do You Do? In the struggle to oust the Maduro dictatorship, self-declared Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó promised a great deal more than he could deliver this week. It’s not the first time. opinion Federico Parra/AFP/Getty
John Bolton is right. Whatever it was that self-declared Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó announced on Tuesday morning in Caracas, it was “not a coup.” But it may yet be a bloodbath . And people in Latin America, who have long experience with both, know the difference.
Trump National Security Adviser Bolton was arguing that because the U.S. and other foreign governments have recognized the legitimacy of Guaidó’s claim to the office, “it’s not a coup for Juan Guaidó to try and take command of the Venezuelan military.”
Note the word “try.”
In fact, Guaidó failed to have his commands followed, leaving him with no alternative but to call for “the biggest march” in Venezuelan history on Wednesday to try to oust Nicolás Maduro, the wildly incompetent and corrupt leader who nevertheless still sits in the presidential palace of Miraflores.
And Wednesday came and the biggest march, well, it was not.
To be sure, thousands of people poured into the streets demanding Maduro’s ouster, but thousands turned out to defend him as well in worker demonstrations around the country that also commemorated May Day. Senior members of the Maduro government called for the armed militias it supports, the colectivos , to show their backing by assembling at Miraflores, gun in hand.
So, Guaidó once again tried to up the ante, telling the crowds he had to admit that when he called for the country’s soldiers to rally around him the day before “ there weren’t enough .” To keep up the pressure on Maduro and his military and security forces, “From now on every day we are going to have protests,” he declared, “until we reach our objective.” He called for nationwide strikes. Meanwhile a woman was killed and some 40 people were injured in clashes.
Such competing marches, sooner or later, lead to carnage, as Venezuelans know after years protesting massively and clashing violently with Maduro’s brutal security forces. Video Tuesday of some of Maduro’s men running over protesters with an armored vehicle was regarded by many as a sign of what’s to come, and might have deterred some from joining the protests on Wednesday.
By contrast, a classic military coup, a quick and decisive golpe de Estado , would have been welcomed by many, and probably most, after years of suffering under Maduro and months of Guaidó’s half-baked proclamations and ploys.
That Guaidó has been backed by the Trump administration imposing ever more dramatic sanctions on the country’s crippled economy is not exactly a great endorsement of the young pretender to the presidency, either.
No doubt some Venezuelans would welcome U.S. military intervention, as The Daily Beast has reported in the past . And President Trump keeps saying that’s still a possibility. But declarations out of Washington and events in Caracas during the not-a-coup this week suggest Bolton and Trump have a very unreliable idea of what’s possible or likely on the ground in Venezuela, with or without the U.S. sending in the Marines, Special Operators, or, for that matter, the mercenary heirs of Blackwater .
No country wants to be liberated by self-deluding fools the way Iraq was divested of its dictator by the George W. Bush administration. And it is worth remembering that years of draconian U.S. sanctions and failed conspiracies preceded the final push to oust Saddam Hussein in 2003, with the long and very costly aftermath we know too well. There's a rhythm to these things, with the drumbeat of little failures leading to the crescendo of big ones.
While it’s too early to write an anatomy of this week’s attempted coup in Caracas, Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have given us a pretty clear picture in public of what they had in mind.
The obvious idea was for Guaidó to make his big announcement that he’d won over the military, for senior officers to fall into line behind him, and for Maduro to panic.
Pompeo announced that Maduro indeed did try to flee to Cuba, but the Russians dissuaded him. Maybe that’s true, maybe it’s disinformation spread to undermine Maduro’s abysmal credibility, but it really doesn’t matter. What matters is that he stayed.
(Vladimir Putin’s agents have gotten quite good at helping tyrant clients survive. Look at Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. And the Cubans have been the guardians of the “Bolivarian Revolution” declared by the late Hugo Chávez ever since a coup attempt failed to oust him in 2002.)
Then Bolton came out of the White House to announce the coup was not a coup, and try to stir up some more trouble by naming top Maduro officials, including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, as figures who had held secret talks with Guaidó. Bolton said they should keep their “commitment” to the opposition leader.
But, no. Padrino appeared on TV to denounce Guaidó’s protests, with a huge picture of Maduro looming behind him.
There was one top official dismissed by Maduro on Tuesday, but he is also one of the most hated military men in the country: Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, head of the secret police force known as SEBIN. He had circulated a letter calling for new leadership, perhaps thinking he was the man for the job. (This is a classic frame of mind for intelligence chiefs.) As of Wednesday, Figuera was reportedly in hiding.
It had been a long day. Back when the not-a-coup began, Guaidó had been accompanied by Leopoldo López, the fiery opposition leader who has spent years in prison and under house arrest. It appeared his guards had let him go, and that was held up as a sign the Maduro military had cracked. But by afternoon López reportedly was looking for refuge with foreign diplomats, finally settling in with his family at the Spanish ambassador’s residence.
As cited in The Washington Post , Maduro was in an almost jovial mood addressing the nation on Tuesday night: “Mike Pompeo said—how crazy can things get?—that I, Maduro, had a plane ready to escape to Cuba and that the Russians prohibited me from leaving,” Maduro said. “Mr. Pompeo, please. Such a lack of seriousness. Mr. Bolton gave orders to high-ranking officers to join the coup that was overcome in Venezuela... Dear God, how far will the U.S. go?”

Now the 70-year-old conspiracy theorist is on the run. 05.02.19 5:23 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty/YouTube
It’s easy to be a fugitive from the law when you think all laws are fake.
Winston Shrout is a leader in the so-called “ sovereign citizen ” movement, a loosely organized conspiracy scene whose adherents claim to be independent of the government. Their claims are completely bunk. But leaders like Shrout have used the movement to sell false hope to the destitute and the desperate. Last fall, Shrout was sentenced to 10 years in prison for giving followers fake bills he claimed were worth more than $100 trillion, total.
Shrout was supposed to report to federal prison on March 4, to begin his prison sentence, OregonLive first reported . But he didn’t show. Instead, the 70-year-old conspiracy king is on the lam.
He may have been a fugitive for weeks, but Shrout has openly flouted the law for years. It was his business plan. Shrout’s company, Solutions in Commerce, sold expensive courses, supposedly on how to avoid paying taxes based on a completely made-up set of financial rules. The sovereign citizen movement treats these rules as gospel. Members often believe that they can opt out of citizenship, that they don’t have to pay taxes if they misspell their names on documents, and that they each have $630,000 waiting for them in a secret federal bank account.
The conspiracy theory often appeals to people in deep debt. And grifters like Shrout are ready to cash in on new converts.
One of Shrout’s would-be victims was Mark Morini, an undercover agent with the Treasury's Inspector General's Office. Posing as a landscaper with $25,000 in tax debt, Morini paid nearly $1,000 to attend one of Shrout’s seminars and buy one of his pricey DVDs in 2009. At the seminar, Shrout showed Morini how to use a fraudulent bank account to wipe out his debt, Morini testified during Shrout’s trial in 2017.
Shrout wasn’t just fraudulently erasing debt—he was making fake money. The conspiracy theorist distributed fake international bills that he claimed were worth more than $100 trillion. But some of his income was real. He asked customers like Morini to pay him in U.S. dollars, which added up to more than $500,000 over five years, prosecutors argued.
By his own admission in court, Shrout hadn’t filed income tax returns in more than 20 years.
Despite his admitted evasion, Shrout has maintained a fanbase in the conspiracy community, a movement that has only grown under the Trump presidency.
Sovereign citizens used to attract mostly anti-government types , many of them vehemently opposed to the Obama administration. But for a group that claims to want nothing to do with the government, a significant number of sovereigns are vocal Trump supporters, or parrot Infowars-style talking points from the fringe right.
Other, newer right-wing conspiracy theories have also breathed life into the movement. Multiple sovereign citizen figures and social media accounts, including at least one that made videos with Shrout while his trial was ongoing, have adopted the QAnon conspiracy theory . A favorite of diehard Trumpists, QAnon falsely accuses Trump’s enemies of being involved in child sex-trafficking and murder.
After Shrout’s conviction in October, his conspiracy theorist allies flocked to his defense, with one conspiracy outlet alleging a plot to “silence” Shrout, and a prominent QAnon peddler urging his followers to look up Shrout’s theories. “For a group that claims to want nothing to do with the government, a significant number of sovereigns are vocal Trump supporters.”
But offline, Shrout faces less friendly circumstances. Instead of showing up to prison as scheduled in March, he went missing and filed a brief for an appeal in his case. An exasperated federal attorney moved to dismiss his appeal, on the grounds that he was on the run.
“As the district court found, defendant has repeatedly attempted to delay serving his sentence. Having exhausted those efforts, defendant has now chosen to defy the court,” the attorney wrote. “This is precisely the kind of ‘heads I win, tails you lose’ gaming of the system that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine is intended to prevent.”
Since Shrout went missing, his movement’s least favorite day—Tax Day—has come and gone. Without Shrout to provide advice, at least one sovereign citizen wondered whether or not to keep practicing Shrout’s “Accepted for Value” (A4V) tax-evasion method.
“is there any information on A4V?” the person wrote on a sovereign Facebook page weeks before taxes were due. “Is it recommended for paying taxes in light of Winston Shrouts imprisonment? Thanks”"
Joe Biden’s Union Pitch Is a Throwback Aimed at White Males,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby) gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-bidens-union-pitch-is-a-throwback-aimed-at-white-males,"HARD LABOR Joe Biden’s Union Pitch Is a Throwback Aimed at White Men In recent days, the former vice president has surrounded himself with white male union workers, an old-timey representation that does not reflect the modern union workforce. 05.02.19 5:23 AM ET Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty
In the first days of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden has pursued support from unions with the confidence of a man who has defined his political life by his singular closeness with organized labor.
“I make no apologies: I am a union man, period,” Biden said at his kickoff rally at at the Teamsters Local 249 in Pittsburgh on Monday afternoon, to an audience largely composed of union workers. “The country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs and hedge fund managers—it was built by you. It was built by the great American middle class, and the American middle class was built by you, by unions!”
But Biden’s bid to build a strong coalition of union supporters in the primary and beyond has, so far, frequently been focused on largely white, largely male career fields and labor organizations—electricians, firefighters, Teamsters—rather than the nation’s increasingly diverse unionized workforces.
“Those of us who work in and around the labor movement understand how diverse the membership is. The old stereotypical view of white male-dominated unions is a thing of the past,” Steve Rosenthal, former political director for the AFL-CIO, told The Daily Beast. “It’s one element of the labor movement, but not even the dominant element anymore. With the growth of the public and service sectors, with organizing, the bigger unions like [National Education Association] NEA, [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] AFSCME and [Service Employees International Union] SEIU have incredibly diverse memberships.”
Some of Biden’s off-the-cuff remarks in front of such audiences—joking about consensual touching in front of one mostly male audience of electrical workers to make light of accusations that he has made women feel uncomfortable—also give the impression that he sees unions as a boys’ club. But the makeup and political ideology of unions is no longer so synonymous with that of white working-class men.
“Forty years ago, women were trying to work on job sites in New York City, and weren’t able to do it, and unions were an obstacle to that. Forty years later, they’re our strongest partner,” said Amanda Kogut, vice president of programs at Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW), a nonprofit that prepares, trains, and places women in careers in the skilled construction, utility, and maintenance trades.
“Folks have an idea in their mind who labor is, who a tradesperson is—probably a middle aged white man,” Kogut said. “But labor represents and fights for the rights of a broad and diverse group of people—labor is really there to be the champion for them all, and when you think about it in that context, they represent the worker today.”
Like the term “working class,” which when employed by talking heads is a term that almost always means the white working class, the image that comes to mind when politicians reach out to labor unions is almost always male, Caucasian, and, as Biden listed during a speech before an electrical workers union conference last month, are “ironworkers, steelworkers, boilermakers, plumbers, electrical workers.”
But even Biden’s own support is more diverse than the crowds to whom he’s made his earliest pitch, more closely resembling the crowd of UFCW workers he addressed at a Stop & Shop strike days before announcing his run. Early polling has shown that the former vice president is performing well among non-white Democrats—according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Tuesday, Biden actually performs better among non-white voters (42 percent) than white voters (35 percent).
Biden’s early focus on certain types of unions risk giving the impression that he’s more interested in winning back working white males from President Donald Trump than advocating for policies that can build a coalition of diverse union support.
Trump, for one, clearly feels that Biden’s entreaties to organized labor is code for a bid for his base. Following the endorsement of the former vice president’s candidacy by the International Association of Fire Fighters, Trump complained that while he’ll “never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership,” the rank-and-file members of those unions “love Trump.”
“The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me,” Trump tweeted . “Some things never change!”
The next day, Trump retweeted nearly 60 people who said that the firefighters in their lives would not support Biden over Trump.
Trump may not be wrong. White, male union members being tempted to vote for social identity over their economic interest “is an old problem and an old argument” in political labor history, said Professor Jefferson Cowie, a social and political historian at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses on inequality and labor shape American politics.
“Going back to Nixon, who had a white, male, blue-collar strategy to win the hearts of white male industrial workers out from underneath the AFL-CIO leadership, there’s always been a strong constituency that’s going to vote whiteness and maleness.”
These “Bruce Springsteen voters,” as Eric Alterman dubbed them , form a strong constituency in labor circles that “votes things other than its economic interest,” Cowie said. “Biden’s project is going to be trying to reach out beyond his white male blue-collar base… the whole thing’s built on coalitions.”
The strength of that coalition is far from the guarantee it once was. Between 1978 and 2017, union membership in the United States fell from 26 percent of the workforce to 10.7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Democratic share of that cohort has fallen as well. Among union voters, Hillary Clinton outperformed Trump by 8 percentage points nationally, the smallest margin for a Democrat since 1984, when Walter Mondale actually lost labor voters to President Ronald Reagan. By comparison, President Barack Obama carried union voters in 2012 by 18 points.
Clinton’s relatively poor performance may give credence to Trump’s argument that the endorsement of union leadership is no guarantee that union members will fall in line. According to the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the United States, 37 percent of members supported Trump in 2016, a 4-point increase from 2012.
The drop in union membership, Cowie said, may have actually contributed to increased union support for Trump, a plutocrat who frequently chose to use non-union workers on construction projects, and famously flaked on paying the laborers he did employ.
“Trump is an expression of so many people feeling left out,” Cowie said, calling Trump’s resonant attacks on diversity and immigrant labor part of a trend in labor history going back to the fraught relationship between unions and social progressives in the 1970s.
“In a lot of ways, that was the moment when white working class guys who were the center of the labor movement in the ’60s and ’70s sort of took the whole thing down with them, in a way,” Cowie said. “By the early ’80s, you begin to see the precipitous decline of the institutional strength of organized labor.”
Judging by Biden’s nascent stump speech, the former vice president sees tapping into that resentment as a useful tool to shore up union support.
“We’ve gotten so damn sophisticated. We’ve gotten so damn elitist,” Biden said in a speech before electrical workers in April. “How the hell did we get to a place where a lot of you don’t think the rest of the country sees you, or hears you, or knows you, or maybe most importantly, respects you?”
But despite such direct appeals, with a wealth of possible options at their disposal, the labor movement has indicated that it will take its time considering all the candidates and where they stand on key issues before making any kind of endorsements in the Democratic primary.
“This is why we have a primary process, which we are in the beginning stages of now,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, told The Daily Beast. “The Democratic primary voters—young and not so young; male, female and nonbinary; and people of all religions, races and geographic areas of the country—will give Joe, Bernie, Elizabeth, Kamala, Pete, Amy, Beto and the other 2020 Democratic candidates a full hearing.”
“I think we will have to see over time if in fact the former vice president was attempting to appeal to that certain segment of the labor movement with the images that were being projected,” Rosenthal said. “But certainly what he was saying has appeal across the movement.”
But Biden’s own record may complicate his outreach on that front. As a senator, Biden supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership as vice president, both trade deals that have been opposed by unions and bashed by Trump. Biden’s late entry into the Democratic primaries has also left Biden’s campaign cash poor, which means getting donations from union-busting groups and individuals—starting on the very day he announced his campaign.
According to an early donor list mistakenly attached to a invitation to Biden’s first fundraiser in Philadelphia on April 25, the event raised tens of thousands of dollars from employees and family members of attorneys at the law firm Cozen O’Connor. The firm specializes in labor disputes, including helping employers “prepare for and respond to picket lines, strikes, lockouts, and other economic campaigns,” as well as to “avoid unionization through positive employee relations.” Cozen O’Connor’s website notes that the firm’s attorneys “manage labor relations with a clear eye toward the bottom line.”
Of the $70,150 that had been pledged to Biden’s campaign at the time the list was released, $46,850 came from checks signed by Cozen O’Connor employees and their family members.
Told of that donor breakdown, Joe Dinkin, national campaigns director of the progressive Working Families Party, was not pleased.
“Biden stood next to a union and then stood next to a union-buster,” Dinkin told The Daily Beast. “You know, we have a song, ‘Which Side Are You On ,’ and Joe Biden’s going to have to choose.”
The historically diverse field of Democratic contenders may also pose some challenges for Biden’s attempts to line up labor support.
“The labor movement is diverse—it’s not just full of guys in hard hats. It’s also full of women and people of color, especially in the growing service sector unions,” Dinkin said. “If Joe Biden wants their support, he’ll need to explain his record and talk about how his policies will improve their lives inside and outside the workforce.”
Biden’s campaign told The Daily Beast that the former vice president has been a staunch ally of labor for decades.
“Vice President Biden has stood with organized labor his whole career,” said national press secretary T.J. Ducklo. “As he’s said all week, he believes this country was built by labor, by the American middle class, but too many families are being left out. He’s running for president to restore the basic bargain that used to exist in this country where when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create.”
Union leaders told The Daily Beast that they’re not inordinately concerned about Biden’s past support for trade deals.
“Anyone who knows Joe Biden—in fact, even people who don’t know Joe Biden—knows this: Joe Biden cares about people,” Weingarten said. “Joe Biden cares if your kid is sick, if you’ve lost your job, if you’ve been preyed upon on a college campus, if your aging parents are hanging in there… That is fundamentally who he is.”
But human dignity, Kogut noted, extends far beyond labor relations—and union workers, particularly women and minorities, will be searching for a candidate who can strengthen dignity in all areas of their life.
“For us, that’s somebody who has a really strong stance on equity in the workforce—somebody who has a really strong stance on women in the workforce and safety of women in society,” Kogut said. “The concerns of labor are really the concerns of everybody, so having access to healthcare, having access to a safe place to work, being able to invest in yourself and your family... Those values reflect everybody’s values.”"

The death toll in a suspected killing spree in Tennessee has risen to seven people, including a 12-year-old girl. Michael Cummins, 25, was taken into custody Saturday night following a shootout with cops. Authorities initially found five bodies at two rural homes in Sumner County, but forensic scientists found two more Sunday and are still looking for more. Cummins is believed to be related to some of the victims. “We think they all occurred [Saturday],” said Ray Whitley, the Sumner County district attorney general. “That’s what I think. The bodies haven’t even been moved yet, so everything is suggested.” Cummins was shot in the leg by cops and is scheduled to have surgery before being charged. “We’ve never had this many deceased people in a criminal case before ... It’s pretty shocking to everybody.” Asked if he expected to find more bodies, he said: “I hope not.” Cops Say Tennessee Man Killed 7, Including 12-Year-Old Girl Cheat Sheet ®"

Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn has married his deputy head of security, just three days before his official coronation in a surprise wedding that will make his secret consort the queen of Thailand.
In a traditional ceremony on Wednesday, the bride, Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, wearing a salmon gown, shimmied down a short aisle on her belly to her waiting prince. She presented him with a tray of flowers and joss sticks that she lifted from the floor without making eye contact.
The king, 66, who will be officially crowned Saturday following the death of his father in 2016, anointed her head and gave her gifts associated with royal power.
The surprise ceremony will make Suthida the second commoner queen in Thailand’s long monarchy. Rumors that the two might be romantically linked were never confirmed by the palace. According to Thai law, insulting the monarchy is punishable by 15 years in prison, which makes idle gossip potentially felonious.
The two met when Suthida was a flight attendant for Thai Airways International, according to local press reports. She is believed to be 40 years old and will be the crown prince’s fourth wife. He has seven children from his previous three marriages.
Suthida rose through the ranks of the palace guard after Vajiralongkorn appointed her to his personal security detail in 2013, according to Thailand’s Royal Gazette . She was made a general in the Royal Thai Army in December 2016 and became the deputy head of the king’s security detail in 2017. She has received a number of honors and is regularly pictured in her general’s uniform at Vajiralongkorn’s side.
The king, now with his new queen, will be take part in an elaborate Buddhist and Brahmin coronation ceremony Saturday. They will then set off in a procession through the streets of Bangkok. READ THIS LIST"

The market of cannabidiol (CBD) products is wide and widening. If you haven’t already been asking or chatting about it with your friends, it won’t be long before you are. And with ubiquitous availability and competition, it’s a great time to try CBD and see if it’s right for you.
If you’re wondering, CBD isn’t marijuana. Rather, it’s a naturally occurring compound and its oil — the basis for most of its products — is derived from hemp.

Walking down the sunscreen aisle of your neighborhood drugstore in the spring and summer can be a bit daunting. Your eyes will probably glaze over by the time you choose a bottle and you may end up not getting the coverage you need. There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to choosing sunscreen, from the SPF level to how pore-clogging it can be. We dove into a couple of suggestions of how to best shop for sunscreen this summer, starting first with what to look for on the bottle (and what’s in it).

The biggest thing to look out for is the type of protection you’re getting. Don’t skimp on reading the labels, because not all sunscreens are the same, even if they have the same SPF number. According to the American Cancer Society’s website , you should “choose a sunscreen with ‘broad spectrum’ protection. Sunscreens with this label protect against both UVA and UVB rays.” The site explains that while all sunscreens protect against sunburn and skin cancer-causing UVB rays, only broad-spectrum ones protect against UVA, which can contribute to skin cancer risk and premature aging.
When it comes to that SPF number , it isn’t just arbitrary. “The SPF number is the level of protection the sunscreen provides against UVB rays,” according to the site. But that doesn’t mean that 100+ is always the answer, even if it has the highest number. “Higher SPF numbers do mean more protection, but the higher you go, the smaller the difference becomes,” the ACS site warns. For context, the site explains that SPF 15 sunscreens filter out about 93% of UVB rays, SPF 30 about 97%, SPF 50 about 98%, and SPF 100 about 99%, warning that “no sunscreen protects you completely.” Face:
EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 , $33 on Amazon: When it comes to your face, sunscreen that has been specially made to be non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) is good for sensitive skin. The EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen has a 4.3-star rating with over 3,500 reviews and is also derived from a mineral-based formula with niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and lactic acid added to keep your skin happy. Body:
Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen , $9 on Amazon: One of the biggest complaints about body sunscreen is that it can be greasy and thick. The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen is both water-resistant (for up to 80 minutes) and non-greasy. With broad spectrum SPF 100+, you’re protected from every level of UV exposure. Over 1,000 reviews leave it with a 4.5-star rating. Lips:
Supergoop! Fusion Lip Balm SPF 30 , $10 on Amazon: Most SPF makeup doesn’t do a great job at protecting us , but one of those exceptions is SPF lip balm. Before it’s a lip balm, the Supergood! Fusion Lip Balm offers broad spectrum SPF 30 protection for some of your most vulnerable and sensitive skin. With a 4.4-star rating from 220 reviews, this balm pairs sun protection with moisturizing shea butter, sunflower oil, and honey to keep your lips moisturized.

Facebook Pulls 49 Sites Selling ‘Stolen-to-Order’ Antiquities From Syria and Iraq,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-pulls-49-sites-selling-artifacts-looted-to-order-from-syria-and-iraq,"LOOTERS’ MARKET Facebook Pulls 49 Sites Selling ‘Stolen-to-Order’ Antiquities From Syria and Iraq A BBC investigation found scores of social-media pages selling artifacts looted to customer’s specifications, including pieces from the ruins of ISIS-wracked Palmyra. 05.02.19 10:46 AM ET REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki
Facebook has shut down 49 “loot-to-order” antiquities-trafficking pages selling bespoke artifacts from war zones to clandestine collectors, in response to a two-year BBC investigation .
The BBC probe, published Thursday, found that looters were smuggling everything from ancient statues to Roman mosaics out of Iraq and Syria into Turkey, where they could be sent to the buyers who ordered them through the social-media pages.
Archeologist Amr Al-Azm, who is a professor at Shawnee State University in Ohio, worked with the BBC to expose the racket. He found pictures of mosaic floors still embedded in the ground in Syria, which were offered with an option for the buyer to choose styles and colors “if available.”
He also showed BBC reporters the Facebook pages offering any number of statues from the looted ancient city of Palmyra , implying that the Islamic State terror group fighters had not destroyed all the antiquities there. Some 70 percent of all artifacts purported to come out of Syria are fakes, but the Facebook sites guaranteed authenticity.
“What we’ve seen is an explosion of sites and users on Facebook,” he told the BBC. “It’s transnational and Facebook is essentially allowing this to happen on its watch.”
Al-Azm told the BBC that buyers are often working on behalf of anonymous collectors across the world, including some in the U.S. who are looking for rare art from war-torn areas that might easily be written off as destroyed. As such, the provenance of the artifacts will more easily escape notice.
The BBC found that several sites offered a way for buyers to ask for specific antiquities. “In one case, Facebook administrators ask for Islamic-era manuscripts to be made available in Turkey,” the BBC reports. It is not clear if the purchase and delivery was carried out.
“It’s really opened our eyes to how accelerated these trafficking networks are,” researcher Katie Paul told the BBC. “Now if you dig something up in your backyard and you don’t know a trafficker, you can hop on Facebook, share pictures of what you’ve found and connect with people who are willing to buy it.”
The Facebook pages were a way for traffickers to meet buyers who then conducted the official business of the illegal transactions privately.
After the BBC asked Facebook for a response to their investigation, they removed 49 sites. READ THIS LIST"
We Asked William Barr Straight Questions. He Gave Crooked Answers.,www.thedailybeast.com,Sheldon Whitehouse,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/we-asked-attorney-general-william-barr-straight-questions-he-gave-crooked-answers,"opinion Getty
I have served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for twelve years. I have never witnessed a performance like Attorney General William Barr’s on Wednesday. Here is what I saw.
First, his testimony was an astonishing exercise in dissembling . Barr gave a head-spinning explanation of why he did not disclose in House testimony the letter in which Robert Mueller forcefully pushed back on Barr’s initial summary of the Mueller report. He quarreled over whether his summary was a “summary.” He said Special Counsel Mueller’s concerns – expressed in the letter for everyone to see – were not concerns with Barr, but with the media. He said Justice Department policy against indicting a president wasn’t the reason Mueller didn’t conclude the President broke the law, when the report says the opposite. When Senator Harris asked if anyone at the White House asked or suggested that he open an investigation – which would be a massive abuse of power – he pondered the meaning of the word “suggest.” Those are just a few examples of his hair-splitting. It was a brilliant mind put to a low and disgraceful use.
Second is the loaded, Trumpian language Barr used – not the language I associate with prosecutors or high-ranking Justice Department officials. He said authorized Justice Department investigations are rightly called “spying” (a “good English word!”). I’ll venture that the 1990s Attorney General Barr never used that kind of language describing the work of the Justice Department. He said the media was responsible for the “faux outrage” it triggered. He repeated Trump’s tagline of “no collusion.” As has been noted in The Daily Beast , Barr is sounding more like Trump’s attorney than Americans’ top prosecutor. “Now, Congress must hear from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Robert Mueller himself.”
Third, we learned some odd things about how Barr managed the release of his summary and then the full report. He told Senator Harris that his charging decision on obstruction was based on the Mueller report – like the “pros memos” used by federal prosecutors to recommend criminal charges. But that would have given him only two days to make that decision. So he then told me that the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel was in close contact all along with the Mueller investigation. That’s odd; I have served in the Justice Department and seen how the OLC operates. The OLC does not try cases or assess the sufficiency of evidence. It is the Justice Department’s in-house legal advisor, opining on complicated matters of law.
Perhaps it was coincidence that the head of the OLC, Steven Engel, received Barr’s unsolicited June 2018 memo arguing that the President cannot obstruct justice. Perhaps it was another coincidence that Engel invited Barr to a brown bag lunch with OLC lawyers immediately upon receiving the memo. Perhaps.
Finally, we learned the curious full story of Barr’s infamous March 24 “principal conclusions” letter—a document that provided a huge PR benefit for a White House eager to get out from under the cloud of the Russia investigation. For three weeks, all the public could see were Barr’s selective “principal conclusions.” In so doing, he engineered a PR bonanza for the president and his media allies.
Mueller’s team had provided Barr with material for him to release, minimally redacted and ready for the public, to help “assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”
Barr had a better idea: to let the president’s PR machine run wild for three weeks to set a phony narrative.
During his confirmation process, some held out hope that an Attorney General Barr would serve the American people first. They hoped he would uphold the traditions of the Justice Department and the law above all else. What was left of Attorney General Barr’s credibility as day broke on Wednesday had crumbled by day’s end. He is now a confirmed spin master for the president.
As if to acknowledge that truth, Barr decided late Wednesday against testifying in the House, to avoid questioning from skilled lawyers on the Judiciary Committee. That may have been the most honest thing he did all day.
Now, Congress must hear from the others who know the truth about Justice Department leadership’s handling of the Mueller report, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller himself. I trust they will respect the rule of law and the Department’s tradition of apolitical service to the American people.

Chasten Buttigieg: From Cast-Out to Could-Be First Gentleman,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/chasten-buttigieg-how-mayor-petes-husband-went-from-cast-out-to-could-be-first-gentleman,"SPEED READ Chasten Buttigieg: From Cast-Out to Could-Be First Gentleman In today’s Washington Post, the former middle-school drama teacher made the case that his own biography may be even more compelling than his husband’s. 05.02.19 1:11 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photo Kamil Krzacynski/Getty
Much of the early focus on Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the not-so-long-shot presidential contender from South Bend, Indiana, has been on his almost cartoonishly polished life story : the son of academics who went to Harvard, won a Rhodes Scholarship, became mayor of his hometown, deployed to Afghanistan and came out of the closet , all before age 35.
But in the first in-depth profile of would-be first gentleman Chasten Buttigieg, published Thursday in The Washington Post , the mayor’s 29-year-old husband laid out his own biography—which may be even more compelling. Buttigieg (né Glezman) lived out of his car after coming out to his family as a teenager, worked a second job as a Starbucks barista for health insurance, and has a complicated relationship with his newfound notoriety.
“It’s just so important to go out there and do a good job right now,” Buttigieg told the Post ’s Ellen McCarthy. “Because for the first time in many people’s lives, they see someone on a national scale that makes them say, ‘Oh, that’s me, too.’”
Here, the most interesting bits from the profile of the former middle-school drama teacher whose supporting role to the Democrats’ dark horse has attracted an audience of his own: Chasten Buttigieg Lived Out of His Car After Coming Out
After graduating from high school, Chasten came out to his family, who he said did not take the news well.
“I remember my mom crying,” he told the Post , “and the first thing she asked me was if I was sick. I think she meant, like, did I have AIDS?”
Feeling that his family—particularly his older brothers—didn’t accept him, Chasten left home, couchsurfing with friends and sleeping in his car in the parking lot of the community college he attended. He lived this way for months before his mother invited him home.
“She said, ‘Will you come home?’ ” Buttigieg said. “And I cried and I went home immediately.”
While he now has a better relationship with his parents, who walked him down the aisle when he married Mayor Pete in 2017, his brothers “never got over it.”
“I want the best for him,” said Rhyan Glezman, a pastor in Clio, Michigan. “I just don’t support the gay lifestyle.” He Worked Two Jobs for Health Insurance
After graduating with a degree in theater and global studies from the University of Wisconsin, Chasten Buttigieg became an instructor at a theater academy in Milwaukee—a job that did not provide health benefits.
To obtain health insurance, he worked as a Starbucks barista part-time, eventually enrolling in its coffee-master training program until a customer pulled a weapon on him during a shift.
“I should have stuck it out, just to say I was a coffee master,” Buttigieg said. “Then you get the black apron.” He Laughed When His Husband First Proposed Running for President
Barely a year into their marriage, the two-term mayor of South Bend floated the possibility of making a long-shot run for the Democratic presidential nomination while his husband was folding laundry.
Chasten’s first reaction: laughter.
“I laughed,” Buttigieg said. “I was like, ‘No, no, no—are you serious?’ OK, what are we thinking here? I love you. I believe in you. You’re amazing. Do you think this would work?’ ”
When the campaign officially kicked off in South Bend last month, the pair made history with a casual kiss on the cheek—a moment that Chasten said was not choreographed in advance.
“I’m not surrounded by people telling me not to be myself,” Buttigieg said. “And if I were, I’d ask them to find a different project to work on.”"
Stephen Moore Withdraws as Trump’s Federal Reserve Board Pick After Anti-Women Remarks Unearthed,www.thedailybeast.com,julia.arciga@thedailybeast.com (Julia Arciga),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/stephen-moore-withdraws-as-trumps-federal-reserve-board-pick-after-anti-women-remarks-unearthed,"BITES THE DUST Stephen Moore Withdraws as Trump’s Federal Reserve Board Pick After Anti-Women Remarks Unearthed The former Trump campaign advisor’s views on women and other subjects sparked criticism from lawmakers, including Republicans. 05.02.19 12:31 PM ET Andrew Harrer/Getty
Stephen Moore withdrew himself from consideration to sit on the Federal Reserve Board on Thursdayafter drawing substantial criticism for his 25-year history of criticizing gender equality and advancement.
News of his withdrawal came via a Tweet from President Donald Trump.
Just hours earlier, Moore had told Bloomberg that he was “all in” for the Fed nomination after having talked with the White House the day before. What changed between then and Trump’s tweet is unclear.
But the writing had been on the wall after a number of Republican lawmakers expressed concerns about Moore, a Trump campaign advisor, for his comments about women. CNN kicked off renewed attention to Moore’s anti-women remarks last week when it revealed that he repeatedly suggested women should not be allowed to play or referee sports with men.
Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD) told Politico Tuesday the surfaced comments would “be a good test” for Moore’s support level in the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) reportedly called his nomination “ very problematic .” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) told reporterst she wasn’t “enthused” about what Moore has written previously. “I think it’s ridiculous,” she stated, adding it was “very unlikely” she would support his nomination to the Fed Board and that she expressed her point of view with the White House.
Aside from lamenting women’s involvement in men’s sports, The New York Times found a National Review column in which Moore asserted that female breadwinners “could be disruptive to family stability.” CNN additionally reported that he once mocked women as being “sooo malleable,” as an explanation for why they tend to vote Democratic. “No wonder there's a gender gap,” he wrote.
During a 2000 appearance on C-SPAN, he reportedly told a caller that it was “not a good thing that black women are making more than black men.”
“In fact, you know, the male needs to be the breadwinner of the family,” Moore said, according to the Times . “One of the reasons you’ve seen the decline of the family, not just in the black community, but also it’s happening now in the white community as well, is because women are more economically self-sufficient.”
In a 1994 Washington Times editorial, Moore reportedly called the Violence Against Women Act the “most objectionable pork” and took issue with its funding initiative to investigate violent crimes against women. “The act would be more efficient if Congress cut out the federal middleman and simply required every American household to write a $20 check to the radical feminist group of its choice,” he wrote.
On Monday evening, PBS show Firing Line with Margaret Hoover released a clip of Moore explaining away his celebratory 2016 joke about Trump moving into the White House and kicking “a black family out of public housing.” Moore stumbled through the interview, telling Hoover , “That is a joke I always made,” before acknowledging: “I shouldn’t have said it.”
The former Wall Street Journal editorial board member further elaborated on his feelings about women in sports, once declaring that female athletes demanded “equal pay for inferior work” and that there should be “no women anything” in the NCAA’s March Madness tournament.
In a 2016 debate, Moore advocated for children aged 11 and 12 to join the workforce. While he reportedly recognized he was a “radical on this,” he said he would end child-labor laws if he could.
“I'm not even a big believer in democracy,” he said in a 2009 interview , according to CNN . “[T]here are a lot of countries that have the right to vote that are still poor. Democracy doesn't always lead to a good economy or even a good political system.""
On top of all of this, Bloomberg reported that Moore owed $75,328.80 to the Internal Revenue Service—which seems to fit his personal view of getting rid of the “ damn income tax. ”
Moore is now the second of Trump’s picks for the Fed Board to withdraw his own nomination. Herman Cain, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, pulled out shortly after he insisted that he would stick the confirmation process out. Cain, like Moore, faced scrutiny from lawmakers—mainly due to the sexual-misconduct accusations against him and his potentially bizarre policy recommendations .
For years, Moore has had Trump’s ear on economic issues and policy. In fact, typical, doctrinaire fiscal conservatives (of which Moore used to count himself) would be right to blame him for being one factor as to why President Trump isn’t all that worried about tackling the tens of trillions of dollars in national debt via deep cuts to popular programs.
As Moore recounted to The Daily Beast late last year, he had, as an economic adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign, made several visual presentations to the future president in mid-2016 that showed him the severity of the U.S. debt. However, Moore personally assured candidate Trump that the massive debt could be dealt with by focusing on economic growth—a position that became a pillar of the “Trumponomics” that Moore helped craft.
“That was why, when [the president] was confronted with these nightmare scenarios on the debt, I think he rejected them, because if you grow the economy… you don’t have a debt problem,” Moore said. “I know a few times when people would bring up the enormous debt, he would say, ‘We’re gonna grow our way out of it.’”
By early 2017 meetings in the White House, when senior officials tried to show Trump with colorful charts and graphics the year the debt may reach a critical mass, the president simply responded by pointing out the chart had the debt exploding in a year in which he would no longer be in office: “Yeah, but I won’t be here,” Trump said, according to a source who was in the room.
Moore didn't immediately respond to The Daily Beast's inquiries on Thursday afternoon. Though his gig at the Fed has hit the skids, he is likely to continue to hold some sway in Trumpworld. He remains close to prominent figures in the Trump orbit, including the president’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who previously told The Daily Beast that Moore is “my brother, he’s my dear friend, I was best man at his wedding. He's one of the smartest people I know, [and] I talk to him almost every day.”
Moore will also likely have options for a Plan B in pro-Trump circles, if he desires one that doesn’t require a confirmation vote. Over the past two years, Moore has been invited to private meetings at the White House with President Trump and other senior officials, and just days before his Fed consideration was announced earlier this year, Moore had told The Daily Beast that he had also had conversations with Trump’s 2020 campaign about possibly playing a role for the reelection effort, but that nothing was set in stone. (The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.)
The president himself tweeted that he didn’t want Moore going too far. “I’ve asked Steve to work with me toward future economic growth in our Country,” @realDonaldTrump posted on Thursday after Moore was officially out."
Dems' Response to Barr’s No-Show: Threats of Contempt and Buckets of KFC,www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/democrats-response-to-barrs-no-show-threats-of-contempt-and-buckets-of-kfc,"05.02.19 12:11 PM ET Tom Williams/Getty
House Judiciary Committee Democrats had two points to make during a Thursday morning hearing with Attorney General William Barr that did not feature Attorney General William Barr.
The first was that his failure to show up and testify about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report was a threat to the Constitution and an “attack on American democracy,” in the words of the committee’s chairman, Jerry Nadler—so much so that it justified the rare punishment of being held in contempt of Congress.
Their second point was more visceral: Barr was being a big chicken.
Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) entered the committee chambers before nine o’clock clutching a ceramic chicken and a bucket of KFC. After eating several drumsticks, Cohen placed the ceramic chicken on the witness stand, where a nametag for Barr had also been placed.
“Come on, Bill,” Cohen told the chicken. “Let’s go.” It was roughly 9:30 a.m. The nearest KFC did not open until 10:30. Cohen told The Daily Beast he bought the chicken the night before and kept it in his fridge.
Barr, for his part, notably did not “go.” Instead, on Thursday, he was spotted eating lunch at Tosca, a well known restaurant frequented by lobbyists in downtown Washington D.C. A Democratic source who saw him there, wondered how he ""didn’t have time for House hearing today but [had]time to be at Tosca for lunch."" A DOJ official said Barr was there with a member of his communications team, his solicitor general, and the principal deputy solicitor general and was ""otherwise, working in the office on Department matters all day.""
The night before, Barr had informed the Judiciary Committee that he would not show for long-scheduled testimony because he rejected Nadler’s demand that staff attorneys from both sides would get 30 minutes to question him, in addition to lawmakers. Hence, the chicken.
“What is the attorney general afraid of?” asked Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), a member of the committee.
The standoff over ground rules may have produced comic visuals and painted Barr is unwilling to subject himself to a different layer of scrutiny for his handling of the Mueller report. But it also scuttled Democrats’ opportunity to conduct questioning of the AG, who had appeared before the GOP-chaired Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. It remained unclear on Thursday when Barr would appear before Nadler’s panel to discuss the report, if at all. Lawmakers did not elaborate on the status of negotiations over his testimony.
What is clear, though, is that Barr and Nadler are settling in for a protracted legal battle, setting up difficult choices for Democrats as they decide how far they are willing to go to reveal as much of Mueller’s report as possible and try to hold the president accountable for his conduct during the 2016 election and the lead up to the report’s release.
After the barely-20 minute hearing to highlight Barr’s absence, Nadler told reporters that he will likely move soon to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress for failing to produce an unredacted version of Mueller’s report to the committee. The chairman also said that the next priority was to bring Mueller in to testify, which could happen within the next two weeks.
Other members deferred to Nadler’s judgment, but suggested that they’d run out of patience with Barr some time ago.
“We all believe very strongly that the next step is to begin proceedings to hold the attorney general in contempt,” said Cicilline. “I think we are all pressing our chairman to do that. He is, as he has been, attempting to negotiate in good faith to see if the attorney general will do it voluntarily.”
Congress can move to hold an official in contempt for interfering with lawmakers’ investigations and oversight. But the Department of Justice would be unlikely to enforce a criminal contempt citation against the individual who leads it. While there is recourse through the courts to get Barr to comply with Democrats’ subpoena, lawmakers contend that they could begin imposing fines on Barr soon if he is held in contempt.
Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) raised another possibility: “In the past they had a House jail,” he told reporters. “I don’t think we’re going to go that far, but courts have upheld that as well.”
Last week, as The Daily Beast reported , Trump’s declaration that he would fight “all the subpoenas” moved some Democrats closer to the step of impeaching the president on the grounds that he was obstructing Congress’ oversight authority. Democratic lawmakers would not say that Barr’s no-show pushed them over the edge, but framed it as part of a pattern of obstruction that could form grounds for impeachment of the president, as well as the attorney general. “Nothing’s on the table or off the table,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY).
“[W]e should all be mindful of count three of the Nixon impeachment,” Cicilline said, referencing that contempt of Congress was part of that case.

"Facebook Bans Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Louis Farrakhan",www.thedailybeast.com,kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-bans-paul-joseph-watson-milo-yiannopoulos-laura-loomer-louis-farrakhan,"Facebook Bans Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Louis Farrakhan Crackdown comes after years of repeated site violations. 05.02.19 2:10 PM ET Carl Court/Getty
Facebook said it banned several far-right accounts on Thursday, citing “dangerous” behavior. Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Laura Loomer are among those purged.
Two anti-Semitic political figures, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and failed Republican congressional candidate Paul Nehlen, were also banned. Alex Jones and Infowars, which were already banned from Facebook, are now banned from Instagram.
“We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,"" a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast. ""The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.”
The accounts were live at the time of the announcement, but started going dark shortly thereafter. During the interim time, some users bemoaned the bans and asked fans to follow them on personal websites or newsletters.
Facebook has previously faced pressure to bar far-right accounts that promote hate or violence. In August, the social media site banned Jones and Infowars for violating rules against hate speech and glorifying violence. But the bans didn't affect everyone. Some Infowars associates like Watson, and other far-right figures, continued to break site rules.
Infowars was previously allowed to stay on Instagram, a Facebook-owned social media company. But the bans will reportedly affect Instagram , too.
Until recently, Instagram admitted that some of the users violated its rules against hate speech or violence, but declined to remove them. Last month , the company told The Daily Beast that Loomer had broken its rules with a long video attacking Muslim-American Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Loomer called Islam “cancer” and called to criminalize Muslims holding office. Although Instagram said the video violated its policies, it declined to ban Loomer, whose followers responded with death threats against Omar.
Instagram has also previously admitted that Yiannopoulos used his platform to glorify violence. When a Trump supporter sent mail bombs to CNN and several prominent Trump critics last year, Yiannopulous uploaded a picture with the caption “Just catching up with news of all these pipe bombs. Disgusting and sad (that they didn’t go off, and the daily beast didn’t get one).”
Instagram initially said the picture did not violate its content guidelines. It later reversed course, deleting the post and stating that it broke rules against ""celebration or praise of crimes committed."" READ THIS LIST"

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr , White House Counsel Emmet Flood blasted Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report about his probe into Russian collusion and potential obstruction of justice committed by President Donald Trump—calling it “part ‘truth commission’ report and part law school exam paper.”
Flood claimed the report “suffers from an extraordinary legal defect,” failing to “comply with the requirements of governing law.” The White House lawyer took issue with Mueller’s conclusion that the evidence his team gathered did not “exonerate” the president.
“Prosecutors simply are not in the business of establishing innocence, any more than they are in the business of ‘exonerating’ investigated persons,” he wrote. “Because they do not belong to our criminal justice vocabulary, the SCO’s inverted-proof-standard and ‘exoneration’ statement can be understood only as political statements.”
By making political statements, Flood said Mueller and his team “failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors.” He accused the special counsel’s team of not acting independently and insisted the report was “laden with factual information that has never been subjected to adversarial testing or independent analysis.”
Flood also addressed speculation that the report was intended to be a “road map” for Congress to start impeachment hearings. If that was true, he wrote to Barr that it was further evidence of Mueller’s “refusal to follow applicable law.”
Mueller did not find that Trump or anyone on his campaign colluded with Russians to interfere in the 2016 election, though the report did state that Russians were successful in interfering in a “sweeping and systematic fashion.” However, the report asserted that Mueller’s team was not able to “conclusively” determine whether or not Trump obstructed justice—adding that the evidence they gathered does “not conclude that the President committed a crime [but] does not exonerate him.”
Upon receiving the report from Mueller, Barr came to his own conclusions about the obstruction of justice issue alongside outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—with both of them concluding that the 10 instances of potential obstruction outlined in the report were not enough to bring charges against the president.
Barr’s conclusions about the report were subject to intense scrutiny when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) questioning whether or not Barr took a look at the underlying evidence of the report before making the charging decision.
Other senators also took aim at Barr’s decision to release his own “summaries” of the report rather than releasing Mueller’s own executive summaries, calling his decision an attempt at spinning the report before its full release to the public."

Facebook may be forced to create an independent privacy oversight team as part of its settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, a source familiar with the negotiations told Politico. That would mean the company would have to hire a federally approved privacy official—as well as facing a record fine of as much as $5 billion. The FTC would reportedly have veto power over the choice the official, who will have the title of “assessor.” If the draft agreement goes ahead, it will also see Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg take on the role of “designated compliance officer” for the company's privacy policies, making him personally accountable for Facebook’s handling of the issue. The FTC’s investigation was launched over a year ago when the company was in the depths of the Cambridge Analytica crisis.

A Chinese database lists the “BreedReady” status of nearly two million women in the country, a researcher has claimed. The open database allegedly contains highly private information on more than 1.8 million women and girls—the youngest being just 15-years-old—including phone numbers, addresses, and whether they’ve had children or are of child-bearing age. The Guardian reports it’s not clear whether the database has been compiled by a dating app, the Chinese government, or another company. It was discovered by Victor Gevers—a Dutch internet expert from a nonprofit called the GDI Foundation . The average age of the women in the database was 32 and almost 90 percent of the women and girls included on the list were described as single, with 82 percent listed as living in Beijing.

Tarpley Hitt 05.03.19 3:21 AM ET
O n Wednesday evening, news broke that a 300-person cruise ship had been quarantined at a port in St. Lucia. “The ministry of health is currently investigating a situation involving a cruise ship,” Merlene Fredericks-James, the island nation’s chief medical officer, said in a statement posted to YouTube. “We got information this morning from two sources that there was a confirmed case of measles on board a cruise ship that had visited our island.”
The 440-foot vessel bore the nameFreewinds, identifying it as the floating headquarters of the Flag Ship Service Organization—a “religious retreat” that promises a “a safe, aesthetic, distraction-free environment”—owned and operated by the Church of Scientology .
“So yes, the story is true, the Freewinds is in St. Lucia and we’ve been quarantined because a passenger did get diagnosed with the measles,” Scientologist Bernard Bonner wrote in a statement on Facebook, first reported by watchdog websiteThe Underground Bunker. The church did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Passengers aboard the ship had come to take high-level Scientology courses called OT VIII (“Operating Thetan Level 8”), the final step in a wildly expensive training program Scientologists call the “Bridge to Total Freedom” (The Underground Bunker estimated that completing the Bridge could cost members between $500,000 and $2 million). Instead of Total Freedom, passengers wound up with a ruling from the St. Lucia government that no one could disembark from the boat for 21 days.
The quarantine comes at a moment of intense panic surrounding measles outbreaks in the United States. According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 704 confirmed cases of measles in 22 states since the start of 2019—78 in the last week alone. “This is the greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1994 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000,” the government agency declared on its website. The global situation is only more dire: As of March, the World Health Organization had tracked more than 112,000 cases internationally, a 300 percent increase from last year. The majority of the cases involved people who had not been vaccinated, despite scientific consensus that shots can easily prevent the spread of the highly infectious disease.
Relative to other outbreaks, the Scientology quarantine of likely far less than 300 is somewhat small—recently confirmed cases in Los Angeles, for example, resulted in the isolation of more than 1,000 students and employees at UCLA and CalState—but it captures the grim absurdity of the situation. That an anti-vaxx outbreak occurred on a cruise sanctioned by Scientology—another movement known to traffic in fringe pseudoscience fronted by high-profile celebrities, sometimes the same ones—highlights the parallels between the two movements, and the uncanniness of seeing the former gain ground on the national stage.
According to Bonner, the situation began when a U.K. passenger who boarded the vessel last week started experiencing cold symptoms and later, a rash. He claims an on-board doctor administered a blood test, which came back positive for measles, and immediately isolated the woman from the rest of the passengers. “As Scientologists, we follow every law. The woman is now OK and the measles has past [sic],” Bonner said. “We have not been given her identity or whereabouts and none of us care. People ‘Can’ come on the boat but St. Lucia law is not allowing anyone off [sic].” “ He grabs a hammer and he pounds it. He smashes into this wall. I see this blue powdery substance, particles flying. I go, ‘Steve! Stop!’ ”
The Church of Scientology has not officially embraced the anti-vaxx movement, but it has hardly eschewed it either. The church has a history of opposition to the medical field , dating back to the early writings of its founder, L. Ron. Hubbard. “The doctor is a handyman desperately valuable in the specific fields of emergency surgery and repair (as needed after accidents), in obstetrics, in orthopedics and as epidemic police. Further he ceases to be valuable,” Hubbard wrote in a 1954 essay called The Road Up . “The medical profession has prepared its own retreat into the fields where it belongs.”
Among the most visible anti-vaxx advocates is actress Jenna Elfman, a well-known Scientologist who came out against SB-77, a 2015 California bill requiring vaccinations before students enroll in school.
At an anti-vaxx rally in May 2015, Elfman told the crowd that when “You open up the door of taking away parents’ rights, you open the door to a constitutional slippery slope.” In a Facebook post from that year promoting a petition against the bill, Elfman asserted, “There is no health crisis (unless they care to create one— wait for it....).” Danny Masterson, another Scientologist (and one facing multiple accusations of sexual assault ; he denies them), circulated the same petition, calling the bill in a tweet “California fascism.” And both Juliette Lewis and Kirstie Alley, also prominent Scientologists, came out against the bill. “NO on SB277...no no no...protect your rights to CHOOSE the vaccines your kids and YOU have...they are NOT all HARMLESS…” Alley wrote . “Ur kids,Ur choice [sic].”
In 2015, the church also co-sponsored an event with the Nation of Islam , inviting environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to speak in protest of SB-77. Kennedy, who has lobbied against vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal on the (widely disproven) grounds that they are linked to autism, took heat that year for likening vaccine programs to a “holocaust.” (He later apologized for the comparison.) At the talk , Kennedy reprised his rant against vaccines, this time aligning them with the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.
The quarantine isn’t the first time the Freewinds has been shut down by harmful contaminants. The ship, which was purchased by the church in 1985, was forced to stop operations in 2008, when Dutch government health inspectors detected blue asbestos in the ventilation system. At the time, the church denied the findings. But in an interview with watchdog website The Scientology Money Project, former Scientologist Lawrence Woodcraft recalled discovering the asbestos with another member during a renovation.
“He grabs a hammer and he pounds it. He smashes into this wall. I see this blue powdery substance, particles flying. I go, ‘Steve! Stop!’ You know, ‘I’m pretty damn sure that’s asbestos,’” Woodcraft said. “And I’m, like, uh-oh! ’Cause I’ve learned all about asbestos in architecture school. And I go, ‘Uh-oh, you’re releasing it! Let’s do something! Let’s suit it up. Let’s get the hell out of here!’ Like, I’m freaking! A panic mode because I’ve been in factories in England with asbestos. If they find asbestos, they freak out! The whole thing is closed down.”
The ship also came under scrutiny in 2011, when former Scientologist Valeska Paris told The Village Voice that she was held against her will aboard the boat for 12 years in an effort to prevent her from leaving the religion. In the interview, Paris described a situation much like a medical quarantine: “I was put in this small room by myself with a camera monitoring my movements,” she said. “A security guard escorted me anywhere I went, I had to eat in the engine room and was not allowed to eat in the control room because it was air conditioned. I was not allowed to work with anyone so I was alone at all times... I was in the engine room for almost 3 months full time. I hated it and just wanted to get off the Ship, I was of course not allowed to call my family at all or talk to anyone.”"

Allbirds took the sneaker world by storm when they launched their washable, breathable wool sneakers that you can wear all day. Now, after listening to customer feedback, they're launching a new style: the Tree Breezers . These ballet-flat inspired shoes are made from a breathable, lightweight fabric made from trees that will get you through your day in ease.
The flats will come in a core color called Kauri Marine Blue , and have three limited edition colors, as well: Seashell (gray), Caribbean (teal), and Starfish (pink). They have a “sugarcane-derived SweetFoam” sole to keep your feet from fatiguing, and the best part, something all Allbirds shoes boast , is that they’re machine washable. You won’t have to worry about getting caught in the rain or spilling coffee on these, as you can just toss them in the wash and they’ll be good as new.
The handful of other styles in the Allbirds lineup are mainly sneaker-inspired. The Tree Breezers are the first big departure from the core silhouettes. And look, I absolutely love my Allbirds Wool Loungers , but these may be my next upgrade.
It’s not just the style that’s new, either; these are the first Allbirds style to come in half sizes, something that the brand also considered after customer feedback. The Tree Breezers are the everyday flat that will take you from the office to happy hour and won’t skip a beat.

Top Bartender Liana Oster’s Current Obsession: Vermouth,www.thedailybeast.com,Anna Archibald,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bartender-liana-oster-from-new-york-bar-dante-is-obsessed-with-vermouth,"Top Bartender Liana Oster’s Current Obsession: Vermouth Kyle Ford Martinez/Steve Freihorn Liana Oster, head bartender of New York’s Dante, is obsessed with vermouth and shares her recipe for a reversed Martinez. Anna Archibald 05.03.19 5:10 AM ET
W hen Liana Oster took over as head bartender of New York’s Dante in March 2018, it felt like fate.
She’d been working at the beloved Greenwich Village cafe for nearly a year, and had long been fostering an obsession with one of its most popular ingredients: vermouth.
While it’s an essential cocktail element, vermouth is actually aromatized wine and features prominently in the Martini , Manhattan and Negroni .
“My mom’s side of the family is Italian so it was always around me,” says Oster. “When I was bartending in Melbourne years ago, if I wanted to go out with friends and have a night out and I didn’t want to have a big one, I’d have vermouth and soda.”
As her bartending career progressed, her love affair with vermouth blossomed, which she largely credits to its increased accessibility in the bars she tended. And Dante’s focus on low-alcohol cocktails, which often feature vermouth, helped her foster an even deeper appreciation of it.
“I really got into vermouth after I started bartending. [Before that] I knew what it was but I wasn’t fully aware of it,” she says. “Now, vermouth is one of my favorite [ingredients] to work with. There’s a lot you can do with it, which I think is enticing.”
Oster especially loves old-school vermouth brands—two of her favorites are Dolin, which is from France and has been around since the early 19th century, and Italy’s almost 130-year-old Cocchi.
Vermouth has “been around for ages, so there’s a lot of history involved in it, which is pretty exciting,” says Oster. “But I think it’s one of those categories that there’s some cool stuff coming out nowadays as well.”
On her radar are vermouths like Lo-Fi, a California-based brand that makes its sweet and dry versions with local ingredients. Regal Rogue, which is based in Australia, is another recent discovery. Its four offerings—Lively White, Daring Dry, Bold Red, and Wild Rosé—are infused with regional botanicals, including lemon myrtle and quandong.
Dante stocks more than 15 styles of vermouth—and even more brands—for her to choose from when developing drinks.
The bar’s recently launched Martini menu does a particularly nice job of showcasing the breadth and depth of its selection. Half of the recipes on it are what Oster calls “reversed,” meaning the main ingredient is vermouth and the spirits are playing a supporting role.
She particularly likes the Our Martinez, which is a reversed version of the classic. It’s typically made with two-parts Old Tom or London dry gin to one-part sweet vermouth, but in this case, the artisanal Otto’s Athens Vermouth is the main ingredient.
“It’s made from locally sourced ingredients and it’s really floral,” she says. “The vermouth brings this elegance to the drink, which I think is hard to find sometimes.” Our Martinez 2 oz Otto’s Athens Vermouth 1 oz Old Duff Genever 1 teaspoon Maraschino liqueur 1 teaspoon Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao 3 dashes Boker’s Bitters 1 dash Angostura Bitters .75 oz Acqua Panna Water Glass: Coupe Garnish: 3 skewered cherries; lemon twist (discard) DIRECTIONS: Add all ingredients to a mixing glass and fill with ice. Stir, and strain into a coupe glass. Express a lemon twist over the drink and discard. Garnish with three skewered cherries."
Can Flying Cars Help Save the Planet?,www.thedailybeast.com,Erin Biba,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/can-flying-cars-help-save-the-planet,"POINT A TO POINT B Can Flying Cars Help Save the Planet? Scientists are trying to tweak the Jetsons-era dream for a climate-change future. 05.03.19 5:10 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
The Jetsons’ jet-set lifestyle has long inspired engineers and agitated environmentalists—what about a flying car instead of gas-guzzling vehicles?
Alas, we still don’t have the joy of a Jetson lifestyle to replace our carbon emitting ground-based transportation. But we’re inching closer to a future of flying cars with Vertical Takeoff and Landing aircraft, or VTOL for short.
The aircraft works by taking off and landing like a helicopter, and flying like an airplane between destinations. By combining the two, VTOLs eliminate the inefficiency of flying with a lighter weight while maximizing speed.
Currently under development by companies around the world (including big names like Chrysler, Airbus, and Uber), the VTOL has the potential to, at the very least, make short-distance air travel easier and more common.
But researchers at the University of Michigan have been wondering whether we can improve on flying cars. It’s one thing to have a vehicle that flies, it’s another if it’s still inefficient and environmentally detrimental. If we replace our ground-based travel with these aircraft what with the impact be on the environment? And how will they compare to cars?
Researchers partnered with Ford and compared an electric VTOL to both electric and gas-powered cars. They found that as cool as a VTOL is, it’s only sometimes more energy efficient. For trips longer than 100 km (62 miles) a “flying car” fully loaded with one pilot and three passengers outperforms a gas or electric car carrying the U.S. average occupancy (which is 1.5 people). In this very specific window the emissions are 56 percent lower than gas vehicles and 6 percent lower than electric vehicles.
For trips shorter than 100 km, however, the VTOL is less efficient than any ground-based car. That’s because it requires a lot of energy to lift the airplane off the ground.
“What we’re saying is [the VTOL is better] if you’re heavily congested, have geographic constraints, indirect routing, if you don’t have roads, or if you have to go a long distance,” Gregory A. Keoleian, director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan, told The Daily Beast.
However, Keoleian notes that while the VTOLs would be more environmentally friendly in these specific circumstances, it’s important to understand the context of the study. The researchers only looked at cars; they didn’t compare the flying vehicles to the efficiency of trains or buses. And they didn’t look at the efficiency of helicopters that are currently doing all the work of short air-based travel.
“We don’t want people to shift from an efficient transit mode like rail to a VTOL that’s not going to help the environment,” he said. An aerial taxi, when rail isn’t available, he says, might ultimately be the most useful version of these flying vehicles because they are the most efficient when they are at full occupancy.
“And the other factor that’s important is vehicle miles traveled,” he added. “The more miles, the more emissions, the more energy used. So it’s also very important that new technology innovations don’t make transportation so convenient that people live further from work. We want to avoid sprawl. We need to reduce miles traveled.”
Keoleian noted that there are several companies looking at ways to turn the use of these vehicles into a business and “what we would hope is that they are going to be deployed in very strategic applications that could help accessibility but more importantly reduce environmental impact. The transportation sector is responsible for 28 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, the largest sector. Cars are 60 percent of that.”
When VTOLs finally hit the market they are going to be luxury vehicles that will be accessible only to certain, wealthy, customers. Considering that these folks are currently likely using helicopters for the types of trips that they could accomplish with a VTOL, it’s possible in the end that replacing that mode of transportation will electric aircraft will have a net environmental benefit overall.
Still, it doesn’t look like the flying car is really ever going to truly be the transportation of the future—at least not for the masses. If we really want to find energy-efficient ways to get around, says Keoleian, “maybe we should be investing more in mass transit.” READ THIS LIST"
2020 Democratic Candidates Are Already Sucking Up to N.H.’s ‘Citizen Lawmakers’ for Endorsements,www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/2020-democratic-candidates-are-already-sucking-up-to-new-hampshire-citizen-lawmakers-for-endorsements,"HELLO, IT’S ME 2020 Democratic Candidates Are Already Sucking Up to N.H.’s ‘Citizen Lawmakers’ for Endorsements In a competitive New Hampshire primary, endorsements from state lawmakers—all 424 of them—could make the difference. 05.03.19 5:10 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty/Facebook
CONCORD, New Hampshire—It was late 2018 when some of the biggest names in Democratic politics started blowing up Steve Shurtleff’s phone.
Shurtleff had just been nominated as speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and congratulations were in order: former Vice President Joe Biden called. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) called. Some others rang, too, whom Shurtleff couldn’t recall.
“I know for a guy from New Hampshire, that was flattering,” said Shurtleff. “They said, congratulations on being nominated, you’re gonna be a great speaker and all.” He sarcastically recalled his reaction to the flattery: “Aw, gee! They really know me!”
That presidential hopefuls might be solicitous of the top lawmaker in all-important New Hampshire is not a shock. What’s a little more surprising: many of Shurtleff’s lesser-known colleagues in Concord—and he has 423 of them—are also basking in attention from the horde of presidential candidates descending on the first-in-the-nation primary state.
In a crowded and wide-open primary field, candidates are looking for all the help they can get in order to gain a competitive edge, and in the early states that define the primary, endorsements and ground support from state lawmakers can make a big difference.
But the battle for endorsements in New Hampshire is unlike anywhere else. The Granite State has more state legislators than anywhere else in the country—three times more than Iowa’s comparatively puny state house.
Even in this early stage of the primary, the halls of the state capitol are filled with chatter from dozens of would-be 2020 kingmakers. Everyone from prominent state senators to rank-and-file House representatives seems to have a story: regular check-in calls from Warren, an hour-long coffee with Booker, dinner with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).
Longtime state Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, for example, has met with seven candidates so far, some of them multiple times. “When they come to town, if they’d like to meet people, I’m happy to introduce them to people,” said D’Allesandro, explaining his role. “I’m happy to be with them, and happy to help them in any way I can.”
Junior lawmakers are getting in on the action, too: 20-year old state Rep. Garrett Muscatel introduced Harris to a crowd of Dartmouth College students last week, and posted to Twitter a photo of his recent meeting with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
“I’m here to facilitate, to make sure other people get to see who presidential candidates are,” Muscatel told The Daily Beast. “I’m doing what I can to talk to as many people as I can. It’ll be a while before I can endorse anyone.”
With more than nine months to go before New Hampshire’s primary election, public endorsements are still scant. A pair of state senators have endorsed Booker; the rest of their colleagues are unspoken for.
Political insiders predict a free-for-all for endorsements among candidates, which would be a notable departure from how things were done in the past. State lawmakers have historically lent support to a single candidate as a bloc, said Ray Buckley, the chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party and a former lawmaker himself. He predicted that is unlikely to happen in 2020.
“With so many candidates,” Buckley told The Daily Beast, “it’s really hard to tell where they’re all gonna end up in February.”
The state house is a “smorgasbord of political philosophies,” said Shurtleff. “We have people who are somewhat to the far left, very much to the left, and people like myself who are more center-left.”
In a state where ordinary voters hold disproportionate sway and attention—locals joke they need to see presidential candidates three times before making a decision—it can be tempting to dismiss the hundreds of state lawmakers as unimportant. Many members themselves are self-deprecating when talking about how significant they really are.
The New Hampshire legislature is, as it’s sometimes lovingly put, a “citizen’s legislature.” Barriers to winning office are low, with only 3,300 people housed in each House district. Lawmakers are paid $100 for their services each year, before taxes—that’s a tenth of a percent of what a California state lawmaker earns—and the grandest perk of the office is arguably a special license plate.
But it’s that closeness to voters that makes representatives’ role in the primary process unique. “Most of the state reps are on a first-name basis with a significant chunk of their constituents,” said Buckley.
“When we endorse a candidate, we’re bringing along neighbors, friends, family, and other supporters… They’re people who will go out and canvas for you. If you’ve got a local legislator knocking on doors for you, and you’re a candidate for president, that’s going to be a significant boost.”
Lawmakers gave many of the 2020 candidates high marks for their engagement in New Hampshire, where the greatest sin is to not take its first-in-the-nation status seriously. “I think the earnestness of all the candidates, taking seriously the first-in-the-nation primary and really digging into retail politics, is great to see,” said state Sen. Dan Feltes, who said he’s done town halls in his Concord-area district with Warren, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Buttigieg, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX).
State Sen. Carol Rosenwald, formerly the number two House Democrat, said lawmakers have an obligation to hear out every candidate, from long-shots to front-runners. “Whether they’re going to rise to the top of the heap or not,” Rosenwald told The Daily Beast, “they’ve expressed interest in something I consider fundamental to the political landscape of New Hampshire.”
Lawmakers notice when candidates behave differently. In the 2016 primary, recalled Rosenwald, she did not hear from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) even though she was open to supporting him. She eventually endorsed Hillary Clinton, though Sanders would win the Granite State primary. She has yet to hear from Sanders this time around, though she has met with several other candidates. “His campaign doesn’t seem to operate the way other campaigns do,” Rosenwald said.
Most of the dozen lawmakers who spoke with The Daily Beast said they plan to weigh in on the race because they want to see Donald Trump defeated.
“Normally, I don’t endorse, but I think this time around I will, it’s so important,” said Shurtleff, who said he’s already met with several candidates and is getting so many requests to sit down that he can’t fit them all in his schedule.
“How many people really care?” he laughed. “It’s probably not all that great. But they ask, and it’s nice to be asked.”"

Here’s Where the 2020 Candidates Stand. Three cases before SCOTUS could enshrine LGBTQ discrimination protections. Democratic Party presidential hopefuls—with a few exceptions—tell us they are hopeful for change. 05.03.19 5:09 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
The Equality Act, which would add outlaw discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, passed the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, as the Washington Blade reported.
As the Act continues its likely-stymied passage through Congress, the Supreme Court is preparing to rule on whether Title VII bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment.
Seth Moulton, one of the nearly two dozen candidates campaigning for president in 2020, tweeted his support for LGBTQ workplace protections on Monday. The Massachusetts Democrat claimed the “ability to work for a living without discrimination is a fundamental right.”
“The Supreme Court has the rare opportunity to codify this protection for members of the LGBTQ community—they must take it,” he wrote.
Moulton’s pro-LGBTQ statement was not unprompted. Over the past week, The Daily Beast reached out to 2020 presidential hopefuls who had yet to comment about the SCOTUS case on Twitter, where candidates frequently discuss matters of policy and hot-button issues.
Last week, the nation’s highest bench announced plans to weigh in three cases in which workers claim to have been fired because they are queer or transgender. Such treatment remains legal in 29 U.S. states.
The Equality Act , if passed (unlikely in a Republican-controlled Senate), would go even further than even the most favorable of Supreme Court rulings. In addition to adding LGBTQ employment protections to federal civil rights laws, it would expand on that legislation to protect against discrimination in housing, education, and public accommodations.
While a number of Democratic candidates are co-sponsors of the bill , few have said anything about the SCOTUS cases—until now.
In the days following the announcement of the SCOTUS case, just three of the field’s 21 presidential candidates made a statement regarding the precedent-setting case.
Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar both tweeted their support for LGBTQ workplace protections, while out-candidate Pete Buttigieg reiterated his belief that federal civil rights law includes LGBTQ people in an MSNBC interview.
For a Democratic field poised to debate LGBTQ issues in a forum this fall, the initial reticence to sound off on one of the most impactful LGBTQ rights cases in recent memory was a surprise to advocacy groups.
“At this time when marginalized communities are under attack by the Trump Administration, it’s important that candidates running for president from both parties use every opportunity to speak up for equality and acceptance,” claimed Zeke Stokes, chief programs officer for the LGBTQ watchdog organization GLAAD, in a statement shared with The Daily Beast.
When The Daily Beast reached out to the 2020 hopefuls regarding the potentially historic case, a majority took the opportunity to finally weigh in.
However, three Democratic candidates—Julián Castro, John Hickenlooper and Wayne Messam—joined the presumptive Republican nominee, President Donald Trump, in not commenting about the upcoming Supreme Court case.
New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said that for the court to “rule otherwise would give legitimacy to the corrosive idea that LGBTQ people do not have the same rights extended to the rest of us.”
Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur and founder of Venture for America, noted that LGBTQ Americans are disproportionately likely to face poverty or employment. Ruling that queer and trans people are entitled to equal protection under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would help address that disparity.
“LGBTQ Americans… should be considered a protected class under Title VII,” he said. “The Supreme Court should reaffirm this in their upcoming ruling.”
A handful of candidates—like Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney, and Bernie Sanders—noted their support for the Equality Act .
Candidates like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson affirmed their belief in equality for all. Inslee condemned anti-LGBTQ discrimination “in the workplace or anywhere else,” while Williamson claimed any government “should always and without equivocation advocate for the equal rights of all its citizens.”
“Every American deserves an equal opportunity to work and thrive in this country regardless their race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender,” Ryan added.
The Daily Beast reached out to Trump’s reelection campaign multiple times, and his team did not respond before publication time. Trump has already made his feelings on the issue known, however.
Shortly after taking office, the POTUS announced his support for the First Amendment Defense Act, which would give broad license to businesses, organizations, and even private individuals who wish to deny services to LGBTQ people on the basis of faith.
Additionally, his administration has already weighed in on one of the three cases pending before the court.
In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit debated whether Title VII covers Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor in Long Island, N.Y. who says he was fired after one of his clients found out he was gay. With former Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the helm, the Justice Department claimed it did not .
A spokesperson for Julián Castro did not clarify his position by press time. Hickenlooper and Messam could also not be reached prior to publication, despite multiple attempts.
These candidates have markedly different records on LGBTQ rights. Often referred to as an early supporter of LGBTQ rights, Castro became the first San Antonio mayor to act as grand marshal of the Texas city’s Pride parade in 2009.
Among the 2020 hopefuls, Hickenlooper was among the last to evolve on marriage equality, only coming out in favor of the freedom to marry five years ago. (By contrast, Harris personally performed same-sex weddings as the district attorney for San Francisco back in 2004.) Under his tenure as governor of Colorado, the Centennial State continued to house transgender women in men’s prisons, in defiance of the 2004 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).
Messam’s views on equality, however, are unclear. After declaring his intention to run for president in a March video claiming that “America belongs to all of us,” the Miramar, Fla. mayor has yet to expound on his LGBTQ rights platform. There’s no mention of the issue on his campaign website.
Here’s what every 2020 hopeful had to say about the SCOTUS case—from those who tweeted about LGBTQ employment protections to candidates who clarified their beliefs when asked by The Daily Beast.
Michael Bennet
The Colorado senator is one of the co-sponsors of the Equality Act. In a statement sent to The Daily Beast, he wrote, “LGBTQ+ workers should not be fired for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This administration keeps making one shameful attempt after another to move this country backward.”
Joe Biden
Biden did not offer a direct statement on the SCOTUS case. Jamal Brown, national press secretary for Biden for President, spoke on the former vice president’s behalf in an email.
“Vice President Biden’s full support for LGBTQ employment protections, and more broadly, LGBTQ equality, has been clear over the years through his vocal support of the Equality Act, early support for marriage equality, hate crimes legislation, the right for our transgender brothers and sisters to serve openly in the military, and more,” Brown said. “As a supporter of the Equality Act, Vice President Biden believes that LGBTQ people are entitled to equal protection in the workplace under Title VII. And as an out gay man, myself, I am deeply appreciative of Biden's advocacy and impact over the years.”
Cory Booker
A spokesperson for Booker’s campaign initially insisted the candidate tweeted about the SCOTUS case, calling him an “outspoken ally for the LGBTQ community since his time as mayor.” However, the April 23 tweet in question was actually a post about the Supreme Court’s decision to weigh in on whether its constitutional for the U.S. Census to include a question about citizenship.
After The Daily Beast noted the distinction, Booker’s campaign responded with a statement from the New Jersey Senator.
“Discrimination should have no place in the workplace or in our society—period. That's why I’ve championed the Equality Act, which if passed into law would ban discrimination against LGBTQ people and protect them under federal civil rights laws. The Supreme Court should stand on the right side of history and uphold critical protections for all Americans.”
Pete Buttigieg
Although Buttigieg did not tweet about the impending Supreme Court case, he commented on the need for LGBTQ employment protections during an interview with MSNBC on the campaign trail.
“If civil rights law can’t stop people from being fired for who they are, what is it even about?” the South Bend mayor remarked. “And yet, the court may very well kick it out, which is just one more reason why it is imperative that we get a federal equality act to clear this up once and for all.”
Julián Castro
The former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development did not return a request for comment.
John Delaney
Delaney did not offer a direct statement on the Supreme Court case. However, Michael Starr Hopkins, National Press Secretary, Delaney for President claimed in an email, “Congressman Delaney supports equal protections for LGBT people in employment and was a cosponsor of the Equality Act.”
Tulsi Gabbard
“Unfortunately, the LGBTQ community in America still faces discrimination in the workplace, in education, or simply when trying to find a home,” Gabbard said through a spokesperson. “We must ensure equal treatment for all Americans under the law—regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, disability, or national origin. This is why I am a co-sponsor and have been a strong vocal proponent of the Equality Act in Congress—to ensure equal protections for all Americans.”
Kirsten Gillibrand
“I believe that all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, have the fundamental right to live and work without facing discrimination,” Gillibrand said in an email. “It's clear that the intent of Title VII is to prohibit discrimination against any American, not to pick and choose who is protected from prejudice. For the Supreme Court to rule otherwise would give legitimacy to the corrosive idea that LGBTQ people do not have the same rights extended to the rest of us.”
Kamala Harris
“The truth is LGBTQ Americans face real discrimination on the job, in our schools, and when trying to find and pay for a home,” Harris said through a spokesperson. “That needs to end. Federal courts have held that the Civil Right Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. As Attorney General of California, I filed briefs in support of those cases. This is a moment when the Supreme Court can and should reaffirm them to say once and for all that no one should be treated without equality under the law.”
John Hickenlooper
The former Colorado governor’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment through his info page and a generic press email. The Daily Beast also reached out to a campaign manager for his team with no response.
Jay Inslee
“No one should face discrimination in the workplace or anywhere else because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,” Inslee said in an email. “I'm proud that this is the long-standing law in Washington state, and I was proud to cosponsor legislation to do so nationally in Congress. This should be the law across America, and the Trump Administration's attack on the rights of LGBTQ Americans in court is a shameful attempt to turn Americans into second-class citizens because of who they are or who they love.”
Amy Klobuchar
Klobuchar tweeted her support for LGBTQ employment protections on April 25. “This shouldn’t be a question,” the Minnesota Senator wrote. “Firing someone for being LGBTQ is discriminatory and wrong.”
Wayne Messam
Messam did not respond to requests to weigh in on the SCOTUS case. Messages to the Miramar, Florida mayor’s generic press inbox were returned, while emails the The Daily Beastsent through the info page on his website did not garner a response. A spokesperson for Messam claimed to no longer be with the campaign.
Seth Moulton
Moulton wrote in a tweet , “The ability to work for a living without discrimination is a fundamental right. The Supreme Court has the rare opportunity to codify this protection for members of the LGBTQ community—they must take it.”
Beto O’Rourke
“No American should be discriminated against at work or live in fear of losing their job because of who they are or who they love,” O’Rourke said through a campaign spokesperson. “Regardless of what the court decides, we must sign the Equality Act into law, take every other action necessary to put an end to LGBTQ discrimination in this country, and ensure everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.”
Tim Ryan
“Every American deserves an equal opportunity to work and thrive in this country regardless their race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender,” Ryan said in an email. “As president, I'll fight to unite this country by defending these unalienable rights—not to divide us by who we love or our gender identity—because we all deserve to be able to live the American Dream.”
Bernie Sanders
Sarah Ford, a spokesperson for the campaign, pointed to Sanders longtime support for LGBTQ rights, including the Equality Act. Ford also shared a number of recent social statements that Sanders has made in support of LGBTQ people, although none of them about the SCOTUS employment case.
Eric Swalwell
“I believe LGBTQ Americans absolutely are entitled to equal protection in the workplace under Title VII,” Swalwell said in an email. “Who you love and who you are should never subject anyone to discrimination.”
Donald Trump
The president’s campaign team did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Elizabeth Warren
Warren was the first 2020 candidate to tweet about the SCOTUS case. “LGBTQ+ Americans have a right to live free from fear and discrimination—and that includes in the workplace,” she said in an April 24 post. The same statement graced her official Facebook page.
Marianne Williamson
“The principles that form the core of our liberty are these: That ‘all men (and women) are created equal,’ endowed by God with ‘unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,’” Williamson said through a spokesperson. “According to the Declaration of Independence, ‘governments are instituted... to secure those rights.’ That means that government should always and without equivocation advocate for the equal rights of all its citizens. Whether in regards to housing, employment or anything else, as president I would consider the rights of LGBTQ citizens sacrosanct and would use all powers available to me to protect those rights.”
Andrew Yang
“LGBTQ Americans suffer economic marginalization at much higher rates and should be considered a protected class under Title VII,” Yang stated in an email. “The Supreme Court should reaffirm this in their upcoming ruling. To do otherwise would weaken protections for some of our most vulnerable citizens.” READ THIS LIST"

“ Everything in the film was real,” Slick Woods says about her starring role in Goldie , the latest from writer and director Sam de Jong. That’s not, strictly speaking, true.
Woods’ Goldie does have a good deal in common with the model and actress . Both of their mothers were arrested, leaving them to fend for themselves at a young age. Both consistently struggled to make money and find somewhere to sleep. But Goldie is a scripted drama with its own flourishes and fiction; over a period of just a few days, 18-year-old Goldie watches as her mother is arrested in front of her and her two younger sisters. Determined to become a star and provide for her family before Child Protective Services separates them, Goldie goes on a mission to land a spot in a music video and buy a canary yellow fur coat to complete her video girl look. Street shots of Goldie racing through the Bronx —Woods herself largely grew up in L.A.—give way to fantastical visions of Goldie in her aspirational yellow ensemble, alone and out of time. Every so often, animated doodles squiggle across the screen.
Still, sitting across from Woods in a Tribeca hotel room as she leans close to me, tears streaming past her sunglasses, I know that she is telling the truth. Everything in the film was real for her, whether she was experiencing it for the first time or reliving her worst memories. “When you see me crying, I was crying because I have complex PTSD,” Woods explains. Her friend is sitting next to her with a clump of tissues—every so often he wipes the tears off of her face, or rubs her signature shaved head for comfort. “It was a trigger for me to be on the streets, ’cause I’ve been on the streets for 12 years. So that was a big dynamic in the film, because it was like I really lived most of the shit that happened in the film. I have seen my mother go to prison. So reliving those things was very hard for me. I was on the streets for 12 years—that is real. I had cabin fever. Those two things were really big for me, because no one talked to me at all when I was on the streets. No one talked to me at all.”"
Venezuela’s Mess Could Benefit Trump in 2020,www.thedailybeast.com,Matt.Lewis@thedailybeast.com (Matt Lewis),05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/venezuelas-mess-could-benefit-trump-in-2020,"THE NEW CUBANS? Venezuela’s Mess Could Benefit Trump in 2020 Cuban Americans are inching leftward. Meanwhile, 200,000 Venezuelans have settled in south Florida since 2014. Trump’s position make sense to you now? opinion Jim Watson/AFP/Getty
There’s a theory that Elián González defeated Al Gore in 2000. Twenty years later, it’s not absurd to think that a similar dynamic might be shaping up as Venezuelan expats in south Florida are supporting calls for an uprising in solidarity with opposition leader Juan Guaidó’s bid to foment an internal rebellion.
No president since 1960 has been elected without Florida (except for Bill Clinton in 1992). Given that, it’s not hard to see how the turmoil in Venezuela could very well impact the 2020 presidential election.
According to a 2018 University of Miami study, more than 200,000 Venezuelans have settled in south Florida since 2014. To be sure, not all of them can (or will) vote. But when you consider that Donald Trump won Florida by fewer than 113,000 votes in 2016 , you begin to see how this issue could prove vital for Trump’s reelection possibilities.
“The path back to the White House for the president runs through Florida,” Brad Harold, who managed Ron DeSantis’ gubernatorial campaign, told me over the phone this week. “And [President Trump’s] strong stance on the pro-democracy movement in Venezuela is only going to help him among the Venezuela community in south Florida.”
He’s right. Not only is Florida one of a handful of states that will determine the next president, it’s nearly impossible to imagine a path for Trump’s reelection that doesn’t include Florida on the electoral map.
I’m not suggesting that Republican support for Guaidó isn’t sincere. But it is fair to say that this might be one of those rare times where philosophy and political strategy happily overlap.
Whereas Trump has strayed from the hawkish Republican line (at least rhetorically) when it comes to places like Syria, he has been crystal clear ( with apologies to MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace ) when it comes to Venezuela.
Trump visited Miami back in February, proclaiming that “the days of socialism and communism are numbered. Not only in Venezuela but in Nicaragua and in Cuba as well.” Vice President Mike Pence has had several meetings with the Venezuelan exile community .
Both of Florida’s Republican senators are on board. Back in February, Marco Rubio tweeted out images of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, whose regime was toppled in 2011. This was generally interpreted as a warning to Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. Not to be outdone, this week, Rick Scott started pushing for military intervention .
Unlike Trump, Rubio’s position is consistent. Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who has generally taken an interventionist approach to foreign policy, so it’s hardly surprising that he would be taking a hardline stance against Maduro. The fact that it’s also good politics is just icing on the cake.
What is more, the benefits could outlive the 2020 election cycle. The GOP’s support of Guaidó, juxtaposed with prominent progressives refusing to condemn the Maduro regime and accusing the U.S. of aiding a “coup ,” are causing headaches for Florida Democrats. “Just like with the Cuban-American population, I see an opportunity to take that political support for a generation or more,” Michael Touchton, a University of Miami political science professor, told Fox News.
He’s not alone in his opinion. “As a lifelong Democrat, one of my fears is that the next generation of Venezuelan immigrants, the Venezuelans coming here, will somehow be part of the Republican base,” Samuel Vilchez Santiago, a Venezuelan activist from Florida told the O rlando Sentinel in February.
This is the last thing Florida Democrats need. Whereas much of the rest of the country is trending more liberal (see worries about Texas going blue), there’s a sense that Florida is slipping away from Democrats. The state’s governor and both senators are now Republicans, the northern part of the state votes like the Deep South, and a steady influx of old, white retirees seems to have made Florida redder. Without the strong support of immigrants, it’s hard to see how they put together a winning coalition.
To be sure, Latinos aren’t monolithic. The Puerto Rican community in Florida is much more Democratic than the Cuban community, for example. But that’s exactly why the potential to permanently alienate the Venezuelan community is so dangerous for Dems. Consider that in 2016, Cuban-Americans were twice as likely to vote for Trump as other Latinos , and you’ll get a sense for why courting the Venezuelan expat community could pay huge electoral dividends for Republicans. “Maduro’s atrocities help reinforce why the democratic socialism advocated by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is intellectually and morally bankrupt.”
I’m not saying domestic politics is the driving factor here. We shouldn’t downplay the central plot of what is happening in Venezuela. Depending on your politics, the upheaval in Venezuela can be seen as a Manichean struggle for human rights and freedom against authoritarianism—or as the latest example of America continuing to meddle in Latin America. Either way you slice it, this is a big story.
But this story’s subplot—how the unrest in Venezuela is impacting the 2020 elections right here—should not be underestimated, either.
At the national level, Nicolás Maduro’s atrocities help reinforce why the democratic socialism advocated by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is intellectually and morally bankrupt. If Bernie’s the nominee, you can bet that Trump will go all-in on the capitalism versus socialism message. But even if someone like Joe Biden were to win the nomination, Trump’s message might still resonate—particularly if AOC and others step on his message with errant tweets about the Green New Deal or reparations.
But in south Florida, this message is even more acute.
While it’s certainly possible for the politics of Venezuela to change in the next year, it’s not crazy to think that we might look back on this in a few years and say that it was Nicolás Maduro who reelected Donald Trump in 2020. READ THIS LIST"

Kelly interview, sought not only to have her pay package doubled but also to get Norah O’Donnell out of her eyeline. 05.03.19 4:40 AM ET Dia Dipasupil
Gayle King, who was the epitome of dignified restraint in her blockbuster interview with R. Kelly, has pushed out her colleague Norah O’Donnell at CBS This Morning , according to a contested report from Page Six .
Page Six claims that during new contract negotiations, which saw her $5.5m pay package doubled, King insisted she no longer have to share the morning spotlight with O’Donnell.
CBS denied to Page Six that King was behind the ouster of O’Donnell. CBS News president Susan Zirinsky called the story, “100 percent false.” She also told USA Today that “This headline is offensive.” Another source told Page Six that the two women “are close friends,” and that King attended O’Donnell’s “intimate” birthday party a few weeks.
And the fact that O’Donnell has reportedly been offered a new role taking over as anchor of CBS Evening News from Jeff Glor suggests the network are pretty far from being about to abandon one of their star names to the wolves at the behest of another. Glor will likely be offered a correspondent or weekend anchor role, a source told Page Six .
Despite CBS’s forthright defense of O’Donnell, a steady stream of negative rumors against her have been emanating from the network in recent months, and Page Six claims that O’Donnell is suspected of having helped disseminate rumors about the departure of Jeff Glor, anchor at CBS News, in what it alleges was a concerted campaign for his job.
In April, the Daily Mail reported that O’Donnell was often responsible for a “climate of fear” at CBS This Morning .
“Norah is demanding but can be so harsh in her treatment of people—particularly women—I’ve seen a lot of tears. People live in fear around Norah,” one unnamed source told The Mail . READ THIS LIST"
SpaceX Launches Human Tissue Into Microgravity,www.thedailybeast.com,Neel V. Patel,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-launches-human-tissue-into-microgravity,"UP UP AND AWAY SpaceX Will Launch Human Tissue Into Microgravity This latest experiment could be a wild new way of understanding diseases that afflict millions here on Earth. 05.03.19 3:11 AM ET Jim Watson/AFP/Getty
SpaceX’s latest mission will launch during the wee hours of Saturday, when a Falcon 9 rocket will blast into the sky and deliver 5,500 pounds of new supplies and experiments to the International Space Station.
Onboard: living tissue being grown on tiny little chips created by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) that could help us understand and treat human diseases in microgravity.
Space can do a number to the human body. A lot of that has to do with the fact that humans were never really meant to float weightlessly. Without the support of gravity against the body, bone density and muscle mass drop rapidly. The lack of gravity causes all the fluids in the body to shift around, which can wreak havoc on the cardiovascular system, kidney function, and even the shape of the eyes.
These changes occur remarkably fast. And they often rapidly simulate the kinds of diseases and illnesses that afflict people on Earth. The loss of bone density in astronauts, for example, looks a lot like what happens to people on the ground who are grappling with osteoporosis.
“If we’re sending our tissue samples up in space, we can see changes occurring on a really short time scale, that might normally take a really long time here on Earth,” Lucie Low, a scientist with NCATS involved with the experiments, told The Daily Beast.
The use of a tissue chip—a clear plastic device, about half the size of a standard smartphone, possessing carefully designed chambers that organize and house living human tissue in three dimensions—offers up a solution to studying diseases and ailments without the need to have to use animal models or human participants.
Scientists can simply put a chip under a microscope and see bone density loss or kidney stone formation occur in real time without having to slice open a living organism.
The chips traveling to the International Space Station on Friday include tissue models that should simulate some common disease states in humans: lung and bone marrow chips for studying bone marrow activation and immune cell behavior; kidney chips for understanding kidney stone formation and prevention; bone and cartilage chips designed to mimic osteoporosis development; and chips modeling the blood-brain barrier that could potentially reveal new ways of treating many kinds of brain diseases.
Even if we don’t learn anything that could lead to a new sort of treatment for a new disease, we’ll at least learn something new about the cellular behaviors behind many kinds of disease states.
“They’re very specifically designed to recreate the architecture of the cells in your body on a chip,” Low said. “They’re recreating the structure and function of tissues in your own body.”
The lung chip , for example, effectively recreates the mechanical and biochemical movements and functions of a breathing lung, expanding and contracting like our lungs.
Space is an issue, though. The ISS is quite compact compared to state-of-the-art labs on Earth. These experiments are therefore designed to be straightforward and run on their own, requiring relatively minimal crew input apart from minor tasks like changing valves, collecting biological media, and freezing tissue at the end of the trial.
When the chips are brought back to Earth, scientists on the ground will make microscopic observations and run assays to determine exactly how much microgravity has transformed the tissues in such a short time, and clue scientists in on how some common human diseases could be prevented or halted.
That doesn’t mean the astronauts on the ISS will be any less excited to observe them on their own. “I know [the astronauts] get quite keen to see heart cells beating up and down in microgravity, and things of that nature,” Low said. “Where we can, we’d love to involve crew time and keep them engaged.”
Whatever changes we observe could help us understand new ways of treating many different kinds of diseases, revealing new drug pathways or hint at the type of genes that give rise to such ailments. Digesting that information and moving the data into the clinical research realm will take some time, though.
But, as Low put it, science is an iterative process. Every science experiment you do is a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, helping inform other knowledge acquired later. READ THIS LIST"

It wasn’t hard to predict that Fox & Friends wouldn’t be amused by Rep. Steve Cohen’s Thursday stunt when he brought a big bucket of KFC and a plastic chicken to mock Attorney General William Barr’s no-show at the House Judiciary Committee.
What was harder to foresee, however, was pundits on Friday morning’s show inexplicably trying to label to stunt as racist.
Conservative YouTubers Diamond & Silk, who are also “Fox Nation personalities,” were brought on to talk about why Cohen stepped out of line by bringing a range of poultry-themed visual gags to the hearing to ridicule the attorney general’s cowardice.
“He’s racially insensitive, that’s what I think,” said Lynette Hardaway, with no further explanation. “Can you imagine if that was a Republican doing that to a Democrat? Just think about that for a moment.”
It was not clear why Cohen eating some chicken to mock Barr—who are both white men—could conceivably be considered racist.
Hardaway went on: “I want you all to understand, the reason why the attorney general is experiencing all of this slander is because the Democrats are afraid they’re getting caught up in the shenanigans.”
Elsewhere in the segment, host Brian Kilmeade backed Barr’s decision not to show up at the hearing, saying he spent “countless” hours the day before answering questions. READ THIS LIST"
Jay Inslee On Beto O'Rourke's Climate Plan: ‘Better Late Than Never’,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jay-inslee-on-beto-orourkes-climate-plan-better-late-than-never,"I WAS HERE FIRST Jay Inslee on Beto O’Rourke’s Climate Plan: ‘Better Late Than Never’ Washington governor says his plan is the only serious climate-change policy proposed by a Democratic presidential candidate. Gideon Resnick 05.03.19 8:00 AM ET
Jay Inslee , the Democratic governor of Washington, who is prioritizing climate change in his presidential campaign, is launching an expansive and detailed “100 Percent Clean Energy for America Plan” as his first major policy rollout.
The 2020 candidate, who has called for a climate-change-exclusive debate with all his competitors, says no one else in the field holds a candle to his plans to address the crisis. That includes former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), who unveiled a proposal of his own earlier in the week.
“Well, look I welcome anyone who will follow my leadership,” Inslee said, in an interview Thursday night. “I’ve been leading on this for over a decade and a half. I think it’s great that people follow my leadership late, but better late than never. That’s a good thing but I think people, as time goes on, will appropriately find a different level of commitment over the decades.”
According to a draft of Inslee’s 10-year action plan, the U.S. would reach 100 percent zero emissions in new light- and medium-duty vehicles and all buses and 100 percent zero carbon pollution from all new commercial and residential buildings. It would also set a national 100 percent clean electricity standard requiring all carbon-neutral power by 2030 and “putting America on a path to having all clean, renewable and zero- emission energy in electricity generation by 2035.”
The plan, which will be formally announced at a press conference in Los Angeles with the city’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, is designed to meet and exceed carbon-reduction targets laid out in a 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and is built off a clean-electricity plan that passed in Washington state.
In order to implement 100 percent clean electricity, Inslee proposes, among others things creating refundable tax incentives “to speed the development and deployment of clean technologies,” retiring the “increasingly uneconomic U.S. coal fleet by 2030 to eliminate dangerous pollution and repower our economy with job-creating clean energy,” and providing grants for clean-energy projects developed by communities, governments, and academic institutions.
For the clean vehicles arm of the plan, Inslee wants to implement a new standard for clean cars, expand business and consumer tax credits to “ensure availability and affordability” of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), and create a “Clean Cars for Clunkers” program that would offer trade-in rebates for fuel-inefficient cars.
Inslee also proposes creating a national “Zero-Carbon Building Standard” by 2023, directing federal agencies in 2021 to promote zero-emission appliances like water heaters and dryers and “dramatically increasing access to federal financing to fund both retrofits and new construction to upgrade schools and public building stock for federal, state, local, and tribal governments.”
“In his first policy release, it’s clear that Gov. Inslee embraced the goals of the Green New Deal to decarbonize our economy quickly, grow jobs, and address inequity through a just transition,” said Greg Carlock, the lead author for the progressive firm Data for Progress’ Green New Deal report . “The 100% Clean Energy Plan has the greatest detail of any candidate’s plan so far but focuses on only a portion of the energy sector. I look forward to seeing additional policy and investment proposals to address the full scope of the problem and the opportunities it presents the country.”
The introduction of the plan comes on the heels of O’Rourke proposing his own , which included $5 trillion in new investments on infrastructure and innovation, Day One executive actions to cut pollution, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, while getting halfway there by 2030, and a plan to immediately address communities most threatened by extreme weather with pre-disaster mitigation grants, expanding the federal crop insurance program, and legislation to help areas recover more quickly.
Inslee’s campaign responded aggressively after his announcement in a statement from campaign manager Aisling Kerins saying in part: “Beto O’Rourke will need to answer why he did not lead on climate change in Congress and why he voted on the side of oil companies to open up offshore drilling .”
O’Rourke went on to sign the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, a decision he attributed not to pressures from other campaigns but because of students and activists he had met on the trail. The campaign also said it would be returning money that didn’t conform to the pledge, which requires rejecting contributions of over $200 from fossil-fuel company executives.
“I welcome others who now might make some proposals now that they’re running for president but I’ve been making them for over a decade and a half,” Inslee said of the field overall. “And so, mine are much more based on long-term commitment.”"

In a letter to Bill Barr on Friday, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said that his committee was willing to receive specific portions but not all of the underlying evidence from the Mueller report as part of the Attorney General’s document production.
The letter marked the an accommodation from House Democrats as they attempt to jump start negotiations with the Department of Justice for the release of the full, unredacted Mueller report.
Previously, Nadler had been demanding all of the report’s evidence. But in his letter, the New York Democrat said the committee was now willing to “prioritize a specific, defined set of underlying investigative and evidentiary materials for immediate production” including “reports from witness interviews … and items such as contemporaneous notes taken by witnesses of relevant events.”
“Since these materials are publicly cited and described in the Mueller report, there can be no question about the Committee’s need for and right to this underlying evidence in order to independently evaluate the facts that Special Counsel Mueller uncovered and fulfill our constitutional duties,” the letter said.
Nadler has come under some pressure from some Democrats for the approach he’s taken with Barr. Though the chairman did issue a subpoena for the Mueller report, he was criticized for taking his time in doing so. Other top Democrats have publicly ridiculed Barr for his opaque testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Following the news that Mueller had written a note to Barr saying that his summary of the report did not fully capture the nature and context of the special counsel’s work, several lawmakers went as far as to call on the attorney general to resign. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Barr had committed a crime by lying to the Senate.
Nadler has been critical too but he also declined to immediately hold Barr in contempt after the attorney general declined to show up to a committee hearing on Thursday, though the chairman, in his letter, said he would do so ifDOJ did not make steps to comply with the committee’s subpoena.
“The committee is prepared to make every realistic effort to reach an accommodation with the Department. But if the Department persists in its baseless refusal to comply with a validly issued subpoena, the Committee will move to contempt proceedings and seek further legal recourse,” the letter said.
Relations between House Judiciary and DOJ have been contentious, with the sides in disagreement over both how much of the Mueller report should be released, who should have access to the underlying evidence, and what type of hearings should be conducted about its production. Among other matters, DOJ has not agreed to a specific date when Mueller would testify before House Democrats, though sources confirm that the committee is now directly engaging Mueller’s team on the matter.
Things took a turn this week when DOJ said Barr would not show for a scheduled committee hearing because Nadler’s “conditions” were both “unprecedented and unnecessary.” Nadler had proposed that committee attorneys question Barr instead of members—a format that is not unprecedented.
And on Wednesday, DOJ blew past its deadline to respond to the committee’s subpoena for the release of the Mueller report. In a letter to the committee on May 1, DOJ said that it would release the report, though portions of it are still redacted, to only 12 members of the committee. Those members would not be allowed to share or discuss that version of the report with anyone else, DOJ said. READ THIS LIST"

This week: Invoicing Game of Thrones for my new glasses. The best performance on TV this week. A new documentary that will make you cry. Gaying out over the Tony nominations. The Channing Tatum photo everyone needs to see. Game of Thrones Needs to Lighten Up
A constant refrain of my Game of Thrones coverage is the insistence that you don’t have to know what is going on to enjoy the show. I had no idea HBO would take that so literally.
Fans waited eight years for Sunday night’s Battle of Winterfell , and I don’t want to speak for everyone but I feel like we all kind of thought we’d be able to see it when it aired. The entire thing happened in such painful, eye-straining darkness that I wouldn’t be shocked to hear that producers are in cahoots with the optometry industry.
The series has long been criticized for how dark its cinematography has been, making it all the more shocking that it shrouded most of its longest and arguably most important episode yet in inscrutable light. This is an actual screenshot from the episode. What the hell:
All this backlash reached the cinematographer, who blamed viewers for being unable to see what was going on, claiming that the episode wasn’t meant to be watched on iPads or laptops and saying that it’s our fault for not knowing how to tune our TVs properly. First of all, it is entirely accurate that I have no idea how the hell to work my TV. But it’s his final defense that earned a standing ovation from me at my desk: “I know it wasn’t too dark because I shot it.”
So congratulations to Game of Thrones cinematographer Fabian Wagner, man of unwavering confidence, obstinate explanation, and now my new life coach. Christina Applegate Is So Good in 'Dead to Me'
There’s good TV and good movies and good actors and good performances. In fact, there are so many of those things that my DVR melts down in protest on a monthly basis. But there is something a little more special that transcends the glut of good out there, and that’s when you watch something and you know you’re watching an actor do the best work they’ve ever done in the best role they’ve ever had. That’s what’s going on with Christina Applegate in Dead to Me .
The new Netflix series also features Linda Cardellini as her co-leading lady and James Marsden and Ed Asner in supporting roles, so another job well done to the Kevin’s Vision Board Casting Agency. Applegate plays Jen, a mother of two whose husband died after being hit by a car while jogging. She meets Cardellini’s Judy at a grief counseling meeting and they become fast friends, though it soon becomes clear that their friendship meet-cute isn’t as random as it first seems.
The whole vibe of the show makes me nostalgic for the Golden Age of Showtime’s White Ladies With Problems dramedies. It would fit right in alongside Nurse Jackie, United States of Tara, Weeds, or The Big C and provides just as juicy a showcase for its stars as those shows did for their leading ladies. But while Dead to Me tends to be a little tonally messy and imperfect, that stops mattering when Applegate’s bravura performance is taken into account.
Her Jen is a powder keg of rage and resentment, angry that her husband is gone, furious that his killer hasn’t been caught, and sad, kind of always. Applegate is a sitcom pro, but reveals new shades of talent here as a woman whose nerves and emotions are so frayed and exposed you can practically see them. There’s a recognizable humanity that Applegate brings to all of it, a calibration of humor and vulnerability that offsets the intensity of everything Jen is going through. It’s fascinating to watch.
So... yay for Christina Applegate! Always, but especially now. Want this in your inbox? Subscribe here. Surprise! I Cried Through Another Movie
This week I had the pleasure of watching the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus perform a mashup of Cyndi Lauper’s “True Colors” and Sara Bareilles’s “Brave,” as was foretold in the prophecy of my emotional undoing. The treat of a performance was an encore to one of the most moving documentaries to premiere this year at the Tribeca Film Festival , Gay Chorus Deep South .
The film follows 300 of the chorus’ singers who paid their way through a tour of the Deep South in 2017, through states like Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina where some of the most severe faith-based, anti-LGBTQ laws in the country were introduced following Trump’s inauguration. Many of the chorus members were returning to the communities they grew up in for the first time since being disowned by their families and churches because of their sexuality.
It’s both naive to think that change can happen through a song, but also entirely remarkable how many minds and hearts opened because of the chorus’ performances at these southern churches. But the point that conductor Tim Seelig repeatedly drives home as he meets with church leaders and community members is that there’s a difference between tolerance and acceptance, which isn’t enough, and celebration. The tour itself clarifies the difference between activism and provocation, and how the latter is necessary to evoke real change.
It goes without saying that the audience at the Tribeca festival openly wept through 50 percent of this movie, proving just how raw the emotion behind the issues of church, family, and sexuality is. There’s such power, then, in seeing 300 out, proud gay men singing “Amazing Grace” in front of a southern congregation: ”I once was lost, but now am found.” Was blind, but now I still can’t see because I’m crying too much. Getting Over-Excited for the Tony Awards
When you get interviewed to join The Gays, the admissions committee asks you what the most iconic Tony Awards performances of all time are. If you don’t answer either “ Turkey Lurkey Time ,” Michael Jeter performing “ We’ll Take a Glass Together ,” or Jennifer Holliday’s Dreamgirls tour de force , they don’t let you in! Cruel, but I don’t make the rules!
This is all just to say that some cliches are true. Unsurprisingly, I grew up watching the Tony Awards, fully invested in the musicals, plays, and actors lighting up stages hours away from my Maryland home. (In my high school’s dance for musical theater class—I couldn’t believe that was a class either—our final exam was to recreate a dance sequence we’ve seen on TV or in movies, and I did Hugh Jackman’s Boy From Oz dance break. Here’s the video , if you just want to imagine that and laugh for a few hours.)
The Tony nominations were announced this week, and they’re lovely and weird and I can’t wait to watch the show. Hadestown is an unbelievable musicalization of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, unlike anything I’ve ever seen. The Prom is adorable, hammy fun, like a musical version of a Modern Family episode. Stephanie J. Block in The Cher Show is phenomenal. Ditto to the entire cast of The Ferryman, To Kill a Mockingbird , and the horny Oklahoma! Revival.
Little Kevins everywhere are in for a treat when the ceremony airs June 9. Channing Tatum Gave Me a Heart Attack
This photo, impossible to ignore, appeared when I opened my Instagram on a very crowded subway, earning the judgy side-eye of several old ladies standing around me. It is my hope that the same happens to you right now.
What to watch this week:
Tuca & Bertie : The next great animated series for adults.
Long Shot: A high-concept rom-com far funnier than it has any right to be.
Chernobyl: Extremely intense, extremely tough to watch, and that’s exactly why you should.
What to skip this week:
Uglydolls: Shocked—shocked!!!—that a film titled Uglydolls is getting horrific reviews.
Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile: Zac Efron is very good. The movie is not."

The attorney for a Sandy Hook parent suing Alex Jones wants the conspiracy theorist’s lawyer to be removed from the defamation case for attacking him on Infowars. Mark Bankston represents parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in lawsuits against Jones, who wrongly claimed the kids’ murders were a hoax. In a motion filed this week, Bankston said Jones’ attorney, Robert Barnes, should be removed for making incendiary comments that Bankston claimed had placed him and his wife at risk. Barnes said on Infowars in February that the lawsuits are “a coordinated plan, orchestrated plan, by people like Media Matters, people like David Brock, people like the Clinton family, people like George Soros, and other individuals who believe that speech should not be allowed.” A hearing date has yet to be set on the motion by Bankston to remove Barnes from the case, according to the Austin American-Statesman .

President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for over an hour on Friday, discussing the Mueller Report and the crisis in Venezuela, the White House said. They both agreed “there was no collusion” between Moscow and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. Sanders said that the two briefly discussed the report “essentially in the context of that it’s over and there was no collusion,” but did not mention whether the leaders discussed Russian interference in the election.
No details were given about the Venzuelan discussion. The U.S. has supported Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, while many countries, including Russia, still support embattled President Nicolás Maduro. The leaders also allegedly discussed nuclear agreements, denuclearization in North Korea, and trade. Trump later called the conversation a “very productive talk” on Twitter. "

Miami Cop Charged With Misconduct After Violent Arrest of Black Woman,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/alejandro-giraldo-miami-cop-charged-with-misconduct-after-violently-arresting-dyma-loving,"CAUGHT ON CAMERA Miami Cop Charged With Misconduct After Violent Arrest of Black Woman Officer Alejandro Giraldo was placed on desk duty after a viral video showed him throwing 26-year-old Dyma Loving to the ground. Pilar Melendez 05.03.19 1:35 PM ET
A Miami police officer who was caught on video violently arresting a black woman after she called the cops for help has been charged with official misconduct, the State Attorney’s Office confirmed to The Daily Beast on Friday.
Officer Alejandro Giraldo turned himself in Friday morning and has been charged with one felony count of third-degree official misconduct and one misdemeanor count of first-degree battery. A video that went viral showed Giraldo pushing 26-year-old Dyma Loving against a metal fence and putting her in a headlock before forcing her to the ground.
Loving, a mother-of-three, said she called the police on March 5 after getting into a verbal altercation with a white neighbor who allegedly threatened her and a friend with a rifle. But instead of getting the help she needed, Loving said she was physically assaulted by Giraldo and three other officers after asking “to make contact with her children”—an incident that sparked a community outcry.
“I’m happy that officer Giraldo has been charged, but it does seem like it’s a slap on the wrist,” Loving told The Daily Beast on Friday. “And what about the other officers who were there? They should be held accountable for what they did to me too.”
The charges come less than a month after Loving filed a federal civil-rights lawsuit against the Miami-Dade Police Department, Giraldo, and another officer she says deprived her of her civil rights and wrongfully arrested her.
On March 5, the 26-year-old and a friend, Adrianna Green, were walking by the home of a white neighbor, Frank Tumm, when he allegedly began to yell racial slurs at them.
“He called us hookers, called us racial slurs, and suddenly he turned around and put a shotgun in our faces,” Loving previously told The Daily Beast . “He told me he was going to shoot my burnt black ass face off my neck.”
Loving said they immediately called the police, and were shocked when authorities began to hurl questions at them instead of Tumm. In the video, Giraldo can be heard telling Loving she “need[s] to chill out or you will be arrested” before suddenly “grabbing her by the neck, obstructing her breathing, whipping her by the neck and arms to the hard pavement, and drilling their bodies into her back while she was lying on the pavement,” the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit alleges Loving was racially profiled, physically attacked, and falsely imprisoned for over 15 hours in jail during the incident.
Loving was initially charged with two misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, but those charges were dropped five days after the incident, the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office confirmed to The Daily Beast.
Giraldo was “relieved of his duty and his role as a training officer” with pay and has been on an administrative assignment pending the police department’s investigation.
Justin Moore, Loving’s attorney, said Friday that while they “applaud the State Attorney’s Office for seeking formal charges for Officer Alejandro Giraldo, the lead perpetrator of the crimes committed against Dyma Loving,” the other officer named in their lawsuit still remains on the police force.
“At the moment, the officer is still employed at the department, so we haven’t seen whether or not this generated change at the department,” he told The Daily Beast on Friday. “Our fear is that the department will rally behind this officer and will attempt to provide justification of these officers’ actions by allowing them to remain employed.”
The Miami Police Department declined The Daily Beast’s request for comment, saying they will release a statement shortly when they have “gathered all the facts.” The Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office confirmed Giraldo’s bond was set at $5,000."

Frieze Art Fair: The Super-Rich Go Shopping For Art—Including Dick Pics,www.thedailybeast.com,alaina.demopoulos@thedailybeast.com (Alaina Demopoulos),05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/frieze-art-fair-the-super-rich-go-shopping-for-artincluding-dick-pics,"FOR ART'S SAKE Frieze Art Fair: The Super-Rich Go Shopping For Art—Including Dick Pics The international art fair is at Randall's Island in New York City this weekend. A peek inside Frieze's huge tent reveals expensive art, a phallic fixation—and a lot of selfies. 05.03.19 3:10 PM ET TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty
Anyone flirting with the idea of socialism should attend New York’s Frieze Art Fair. Come for the chance to peep-million dollar portraiture, stay to get elbowed by some of the wealthiest shoppers in the world, and leave with a $6 chocolate chip cookie and a strong desire to eat the rich.
The international event, also held in London and Los Angeles, stops on Randall’s Island this weekend. While aboard the short ferry ride from Manhattan, one silver-haired sixty-something woman dressed in pink tweed pointed out Brooklyn to her British companion.
“That’s Greenpoint , where Margaret lives,” she said pityingly. Turning around to face Manhattan, she stared past the Queensboro Bridge. “That’s the Upper East Side, where I live.”
Once on Randall’s Island , attendees spill into the mammoth tents filled with work from over 1,000 artists. The pieces are kept in booths organized by gallery. There are roughly 200 exhibitioners. Certain sections spotlight various themes, like work by Latinx or “overlooked” artists, respectively.
Ostensibly, guests could put their map to good use and view the fair in an organized, station-by-station manner. But for the most part, visitors trudge through the sprawling, maze-like tent as if they are on a very cultured forced march.
Like many old guard institutions, Frieze has struggled to make the work more representative of the cities it lands in. Of course, a hallmark of the fine art world has been exclusivity; it would be ludicrous to demand a festival known and loved for its pricey purchases go mainstream. And yet, Frieze is trying to stay modern, and not just in its art offerings.
Sure, there was the perceptible money grab—a 1960 Max Ernst sculpture went for $500,000 and Jenny Holzer’s linen paintings, based on the redacted Mueller report, reportedly sold at $300,000. “Man, there’s a whole lotta spheres in here.”
But there were also nods toward a newer (but probably still rich) generation. Whether they wanted to be or not, guests were greeted at the front door of the festival by a very Instagrammable installation by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, a hodgepodge of reflective silver balls.
“Man, there’s a whole lotta spheres in here,” one man sighed as he walked by the piece. According to ArtNews , comedian Aziz Ansari was not immune to the pressure of posing with Kusama’s installation.
“Did you see the bus?” was overheard many times, referencing the 1995 Red Grooms sculpture. For twenty-thousand more dollars than $2.75, the cost of an actual bus fare, guests can walk inside the full-size installation. Worth a reported $550,000 , the sculpture also comes equipped with fake straphangers riding inside.
One employee had the very unenviable job of telling people they could not bring their iced coffees onboard.
Lauren Halsey, based in Los Angeles, won this year’s Frieze Artist Award. According to the New York Times , the Yale graduate earned the commission after submitting “Prototype Column for tha Shaw,” two 12-foot columns that include lyrics by the late rapper Nipsey Hussle .
The classical structures are stamped with hieroglyphics with nods to South Los Angeles. Halsey told the Times , “I thought I could sample the function of the hieroglyph—the pharaohs’ record—and remix it into contemporary neighborhood poetics and news to describe this moment for the people.”
In 1974, Linda Goode Bryant opened Just Above Midtown (JAM), a gallery dedicated to promoting African-American artists. This year, Freize honors Bryant and other JAM artists in a much talked-about retrospective section.
Paul Raffin and Aliyah Snisarenko, two New Yorkers who attend Frieze every year, said they felt 2019 felt “more diverse” in terms of its offerings. “It’s doubtful we’ll buy anything,” Raffin said, though the pair had picked up two $20 paintings by artist Steve Keene.
Keene had one of the best-attended booths. His poppy portraits of animals and rock stars like David Bowie , Jonathan Richman, and the Runaways cost between $10 and $50. Unlike other ever-mindful gallerists, lurking around with iPads and waiting to make a sale, Keene set up an honor system slot for visitors to slip in their cash.
“There is a big phallic theme going on this year,” Raffin added. “There are always dicks in art, but there seem to be more. I don’t know why—maybe the Trump effect, I have no idea.”
Snisarenko added, “I don’t like seeing that—I don’t think it’s very aesthetically pleasing.”
“We're in dick avoidance mode,” Raffin explained.
Others were less fazed—even bored—by the fleshy displays. “Yeah, there is a big naked penis and a vagina over there, but yawn,” one attendee said.
Cristina Vere Nicoll, a sales associate at David Zwirner, stood underneath a huge Christopher Williams portrait of a slender matchstick. “I guess you could perceive that as phallic, if you’re in that mindset,” she offered. “I see this more as a stand-in for portraiture. Williams gravitates to everyday objects and motifs and uses them as sights to experiment with.”
Other artists had playful spins on the mundane. One very popular installation by New York-based Olivia Erlanger featured true-to-size washing machines with colorful mermaid tails peeking out.
Michael Seri, from Dumbo, Brooklyn, told The Daily Beast he likes “about 30 percent of the art.” A creator himself, Seri enlisted the model Olya Anikina, who he met on Instagram, to wear a see-through, plastic-looking dress. The mini was embellished with beat-up iPhones and SIM cards and “iPorn” was written on the chest in LED lights.
“I’ve been coming to Freize for a while,” Seri said. “A lot of the art is very commercial, very trendy, redundant, you’ve seen it already. It’s like a high-end mall for art.” Another visitor referred to the event as a “very pretty boat show.”
Two married artists, Jen Catron and Paul Outlaw, got to the fairground around 5 pm, two hours before the day was to end. Catron said that around five years ago, she took count of how many women were showing in Chelsea’s high-end galleries. “I think things are improving. To call the fair 'diverse; might be a stretch, but is it improving? Yes. From the perspective of an old white man, this year probably seem diverse”
“It was about sixteen percent female, which is a shocking number,” Catron said. “But I think things are improving. To call the fair diverse might be a stretch, but is it improving? Yes. From the perspective of an old white man, this year probably seem diverse.”
The two were not planning to buy anything. “We’re about selling [our own work] now,” Outlaw said.
Catron added, “If you have only one home , you cannot buy any of this. Maybe if you have two homes, you can afford some.”
Luis Ortiz, who works at the auction house Christie’s, would not refer to himself as an “insider.”
“I am probably just a ‘sider,’” he quipped. Ortiz said he was not in the market for any personal artwork, but comes to Frieze every year to network. “I might shop for someone who is paying me to buy them something,” he added.
Ortiz said he didn’t see anything “too controversial” while touring the exhibits. “There is a [portrait of a] hippo having sex with a manatee or something—that’s kind of cool.”
“I love coming here because you see all the artists, and they’re interesting people,” Ortiz said. “There is definitely diversity in this space, at the fair right now. But the customers? They are still all white men.” READ THIS LIST"

I get it, but you have to stay focused,’ Susan Zirinsky told CBS Evening News staff after reports Norah O’Donnell was taking over the show—and moving it to Washington. 05.03.19 6:26 PM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos from Getty
CBS News’ brand-new president, Susan Zirinsky , has been grappling for the past day with the fallout from Thursday’s New York Post story about on-air personnel changes that has driven some staffers in her already-nervous news division to the edge of panic.
“It’s hard. I get it, but you have to stay focused,” Zirinsky, who formally took the reins on March 1, advised rattled CBS Evening News staffers after the Post claimed, among other disruptions, that CBS This Morning star Gayle King is forcing Norah O’Donnell off the show as part her contract negotiations, positioning O’Donnell to snatch the job of CBS Evening News anchor away from Jeff Glor and move that program to Washington.
“When there’s something to tell you, I will tell you,” Zirinsky added, according to a witness. “When we’re ready, we’ll do it.”
CBS News pushed back hard against the Post ’s claim in the story that King and O’Donnell were engaged in an epic catfight, objecting especially to the headline, “Gayle King pushes out Norah O’Donnell at ‘CBS This Morning.’”
“This headline is offensive and 100 percent false,” the Post quoted Zirinsky as responding, adding the assertion of “a person close to O’Donnell” that she and King “are close friends.”
O'Donnell's agent, Jay Sures, weighed in with a complaint about blind quotes in the Post story that described his client as difficult to deal with and “toxic.”
“If she was a man, these kind of unsupported accusations would never be reported,” Sures said.
O’Donnell didn’t respond to a request for comment.
On Friday’s installment of the morning show—for which King was absent, on assignment in London for a special on Harry and Meghan’s impending baby , as was John Dickerson , reportedly preparing to leave CBS This Morning to do political segments for 60 Minutes —O’Donnell told viewers : “We are reading lots of things with great interest. I just want you to know we will address them on Monday, when Gayle is back here, and John as well.” “The professional future of Glor—who was installed as CBS Evening News anchor in October 2017 by Zirinsky’s predecessor, David Rhodes—remained unclear”
O’Donnell’s comments suggested that Monday will be the day for an official announcement of the pending personnel changes, possibly including that O’Donnell and Dickerson will be replaced by longtime CBS News veteran Anthony Mason and newcomer Tony Dokoupil as King’s new cohosts.
The professional future of Glor—who was installed as CBS Evening News anchor in October 2017 by Zirinsky’s predecessor, David Rhodes—remained unclear. The Post reported that Glor will likely be demoted to correspondent or weekend-anchor status.
The CBS Evening News has not improved its relatively weak ratings performance since Rhodes booted Scott Pelley off the broadcast— largely out of pique , said insiders, because Pelley’s super-aggressive agent Ari Emanuel squeezed Rhodes during contract talks for more money.
Glor and his own high-powered agent, Olivia Metzger, are said to be resigned to the probability that his days of helming the weeknight newscast are numbered.
CBS News declined to comment on the past day’s revelations.
CBS News veterans, who spoke on condition of not being named, were divided on whether it’s a good idea to give the evening newscast to O’Donnell and move the program’s production center to Washington, where O’Donnell’s husband, Geoff Tracy, owns a chain of restaurants.
“I knew two months ago that this was going to be the plan,” said one, a self-described admirer of Zirinsky. “Rebuild the morning show around Gayle and get her to stay, and put Norah on the Evening News because she’s a better anchor than Jeff. And move it to Washington because that’s where the story is right now, through the election at least, and that’s where her family is and make it stand out a little bit. But long term, not a good idea. You don’t want to keep showing Washington.”
A second CBS News veteran, however, said basing the broadcast in Washington—where the network recently built a state-of-the-art studio in a new bureau—would create a host of problematic logistical challenges, unless Zirinsky decrees that the current New York staff must largely relocate to the nation’s capital.
“It’s not good if it looks like the move is simply trying to satisfy the desire of a single person. Why is it happening? Just because Norah O’Donnell wants to move to Washington because her husband lives there? Is she really that important?” “She has been telling everybody too much stuff since even before she took over the news division”
Meanwhile, television industry insiders told The Daily Beast on Friday that the Post story, along with the accompanying apprehension, is the inevitable result of Zirinsky’s habit of sharing her ideas with a wide array of friends and colleagues.
“She has been telling everybody too much stuff since even before she took over the news division,” said one of the people in whom Zirinsky has confided—including her plans for King, O’Donnell and Glor. “She’s a big talker, and she’s very trustful of all the people that she’s known a long time.”
In early April, barely a month into her new job at CBS News—where she started out 47 years ago as a weekend production assistant in the Washington bureau (and later became the inspiration for Holly Hunter’s type-A character in the 1987 romantic comedy Broadcast News)—Zirinsky was one of the honorees at The Hollywood Reporter ’s celebration of the “35 Most Powerful People in New York Media.”
Christa Robinson, the news division’s senior vice president of communications, led Zirinsky through the glittering party crowd inside Manhattan’s The Pool restaurant, and listened approvingly as her boss smiled sheepishly and repeated to each conversational cluster: “I’m not allowed to think out loud anymore.”
Those words were surprising coming from a 67-year-old woman who is famously gregarious, media-friendly and voluble—that is, someone very comfortable thinking out loud—so much so that several witnesses assumed that Zirinsky had been the object of an intervention. “I know we’re not a patient bunch, but having the time to listen to you—what works, what doesn’t. Call me. Email. Find me. Your ideas matter”
Not so, said a CBS News insider, who pointed out that Zirinsky has been transparent about her intention to make sweeping changes at the news division after widely consulting with employees.
“I will need some time—we have to do a top-down look,” she declared at a meeting of staffers as she took over. “And I know we’re not a patient bunch, but having the time to listen to you—what works, what doesn’t. Call me. Email. Find me. Your ideas matter.”
Zirinsky added: “We have an incredibly gifted group of people…But the important question...[is] we need to make sure eveybody’s in the right place. We’ll be having lots of conversations in the coming weeks to figure that out.”
Her preference, no doubt, was not to have them in public, however. READ THIS LIST"
The Miss USA Pageant’s Feminist Identity Crisis Is Now the Best Part of the Show,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-miss-usa-pageants-identity-crisis-is-now-the-best-part-of-the-show,"WHAT HAPPENS IN RENO... The Miss USA Pageant’s Feminist Identity Crisis Is Now the Best Part of the Show The pageant crowned a new winner Thursday night, amid a strange ode to hairspray, Reno, and women’s empowerment. 05.03.19 5:36 PM ET Frank L Szelwach / Miss Universe Organization
On Thursday night, in Reno, Nevada, a new Miss USA began her reign. These days, beauty pageants aren’t really about beauty—they’re about female empowerment and confidence, about shedding light on issues like mental health, diversity, and women in STEM . They’re about everything and nothing. That means that while every competition brings a consistently admirable cohort of gorgeous, intelligent and toned career women and communications majors to the stage, the particulars of what they’re being tested on appear to change annually. For example, during the swimsuit portion of the competition this year, the commentators (Vanessa Lachey and Lu Sierra), deliberately did not make judgements based on hotness. Instead, they critiqued how deftly each competitor was able to strip off her sarong, with deductions taken if she was still sporting the fabric strip halfway through her runway walk. Other skills that were tested on Thursday night included the feminine art of smiling benevolently at a man while he attempts to croon Frank Sinatra at your face, and the niche ability to perform a really powerful spoken word rendition of Emma Lazarus’ “The New Colossus.”
The pageant world’s obvious identity crisis arguably gives viewers a reason to keep tuning in. In the past few years, we’ve seen contestants engage in group discussions about sexual harassment and passionate defenses of the bikini round. We’ve seen Steve Harvey dedicate an entire pageant to making jokes about how bad Steve Harvey is at hosting pageants. We’ve even witnessed a non-pageant pageant , where “competitors” campaigned for the crown fully-clothed, often in pantsuits. In the rhinestoned firmament of televised pageantry, Miss USA differentiates itself by not being Gretchen Carlson’s Miss America . Instead of taking a stand on the empowerment spectrum, Miss USA has gone a different route—breaking my brain so that I am physically incapable of formulating a take. Is Miss USA feminist? I honestly couldn’t tell you, because I was too busy watching 51 women attempt synchronized hand choreography while “two-time Grammy winner T-Pain” glided through their ranks performing a medley of auto-tuned hits.
There are two main reasons why I’m not particularly mad about Miss USA: it’s only two hours long, and it’s not hosted by Steve Harvey. Viewers are gently ushered through the proceedings by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, who are totally, completely fine. Instead of being tasked with the emotional labor of suffering through Steve Harvey’s on-air objectification and laughing at his bad jokes, these contestants merely have to smile and nod when Nick Lachey says things like, “You know, I grew up in Ohio.” Vanessa does most of the heavy lifting as they begin to cull the contestants down. For background, we’re treated to some footage from the pre-pageant interviews; a clip of one contestant earnestly telling the judges that “being real” isn’t about “not wearing make-up” or about “being against extensions” leaves me wanting more. Speaking of the judges, they include multiple former pageant winners, the CEO and founder of “PowerwomenTV,” the Mayor of Reno, Nevada and the producer of Disney on Ice. And speaking of Reno, Nevada, the entire competition is interspersed with clips of the Miss USA contestants enjoying all that Reno has to offer, from learning about mines to dancing on a log.
Before a new Miss USA is crowned, we have to check in on what the reigning title holder’s been up to for the past year. Nebraska’s very own Sarah Rose Summers graces the stage to tell the Lacheys about the many, many lessons she’s learned. Now, in the proud tradition of unemployed millennials everywhere, she’s off to New York City to work on her podcast. And it’s time for the swimsuit competition! Runway coach Lu Sierra warns Vanessa Lachey that “the cream will rise” during this portion of the pageant, to Lachey’s visible confusion. Nick Lachey has been demoted to bellowing out the states of each competitor, leaving Vanessa and Lu to commentate.
Because of the aforementioned fear of acknowledging that these women are being judged by how they look in bikinis, Lachey and Sierra end up making a lot of comments about confidence and “working it.” One contestant is described as “strong mentally,” and Miss Hawaii is unfortunately referred to as “our little Island girl.” Two women are applauded for wearing one-pieces riddled with cut-outs, and which are therefore basically bikinis. After a brief interlude at a Johnny Rockets, the contestants visit the Nevada legislature, which is majority female. The ladies are inspired! Next, we’re treated to small video packages highlighting individual contestants. Miss Kansas wants to be the youngest Press Secretary in history, Miss Ohio is pledging not to use Photoshop, and Miss Florida is a “glam tomboy” who loves snake wrangling and “all the aspects” of being a survivalist! There are army brats, non-profit founders, attorneys and activists. Someone says something about singing for mental health, and Vanessa Lachey exclaims, “Yes! I love these packages!” Same! When they’re not standing in low water to promote Reno tourism, the contestants are doing backstage spon con for hair products, which mostly means standing behind the hosts, silently pelted with a never-ending stream of hairspray. “Is Miss USA feminist? I honestly couldn’t tell you, because I was too busy watching 51 women attempt synchronized hand choreography while T-Pain performed.”
But no amount of hairspray or general preparation could ever be sufficient for what comes next—Nick Lachey singing “The Way You Look Tonight” as a group of Miss USA contestants in evening gowns stalk around the stage in languorous circles. The fashion commentary here is top-notch; a black velvet number with rhinestone detailing and a massive leg slit is described as “timeless” and “inspired by Audrey Hepburn.” At least the contestant who “channeled Blake Lively” while designing her gown was honest (it appears to include a built-in beaded diaper). Nick Lachey continues to sing until this segment is over, transitioning smoothly into a video of the contestants reciting the Statue of Liberty poem, juxtaposed with footage of a woman’s butt in yoga pants as she balances on top of a Reno rock.
As the competition builds, the remaining contestants must answer a question from a fellow, fallen sister. Miss Colorado asks Miss New Mexico to name one issue that she wants presidential hopefuls to address in the 2020 race. Miss Massachusetts asks Miss North Carolina if Me Too and Time’s Up have gone too far, receiving the pageant equivalent of a “fuck no.” (“What Me Too and Times Up are about are making sure that we foster safe and inclusive workplaces in our country—as an attorney that’s exactly what I want to hear and that’s what I want for this country,” she says.) Miss Oklahoma does not believe that incarcerated people should be able to vote, and Miss Nevada gets justifiably overwhelmed when her questioner references a friend who was shot while asking about gun reform. These questions are extremely hard.
Having successfully addressed some of the most pressing issues of our times with seconds-long soundbites, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Oklahoma advance to a shockingly blonde-free final three. For their final test, they’ll each have to answer the same question. Taking turns, the contestants are asked to describe their generation in a word, and explain their reasoning. Oklahoma’s word is diverse, because “we are a nation of diverse,” and she is a diverse woman! North Carolina very cleverly shouts out the Nevada state legislature in her answer, which is all about innovation, empowered women, and “continued progress.” New Mexico unfortunately strikes out, with a nervous response about social media and her master’s in accounting—she wants to inspire her growing social media following to get a master’s in accounting? It’s unclear.
After one “final look” at our top three walking the runway, as well as a look at the crown, which is sitting on a pedestal surrounded by hairspray, Sarah Rose Summers returns to the stage to surrender her title. She takes a final, victorious lap, as a woman whom I hope is her mother films from the audience, showing off her Sarah Rose Summers iPhone case. Finally, the lights dim and the Lacheys announce the first runner-up, leaving just New Mexico and North Carolina in the running. North Carolina AKA Cheslie Kryst takes the crown—it’s a relatively anti-climactic win, since she clearly gave the strongest answers during both of the question segments, but very well-deserved. Other past winners and competitors surround Kryst onstage, marking the end of this strange ode to hairspray, Reno, and women’s empowerment. READ THIS LIST"

A Texas pastor found dead with his family after a suspicious house fire in February shot himself while his wife and daughters were trapped by the flames, the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office revealed Friday.
While investigators have not yet determined the official cause of the fire, Pastor Eugene Keahey’s self-inflicted gunshot wound raises more questions after authorities said accelerants were found in the home and the pastor left cryptic messages on social media right before his death.
Police confirmed Friday that 52-year-old Keahey shot himself on Feb. 28 while his Cedar Hill home—with his family inside—burned around him in the early morning hours. Police responded to the scene at around 4:30 a.m. and were able to rescue two individuals from a second-story window.
According to the Dallas Morning News , the death of Keahey’s two daughters—17-year-old Darryn and 15-year-old Camryn—have been ruled homicides. Camryn died in the home, while Darryn died after being hospitalized for weeks. Keahey’s wife, 51-year-old DeAnna, also died in the home and her cause of death has yet to be determined.
Local news station KXAS reports that extended family were also staying in the home. Keahey’s other two children were not believed to be inside at the time.
The investigation into the family’s death has reportedly turned into a criminal inquiry after officials said potential fire accelerants were found inside the home. Authorities have said they believe the fire was set intentionally, though they have stopped short of saying who they believe set it.
Investigators earlier said they were reviewing social media posts penned by Keahey shortly before his death. Three weeks before he died, Keahey reportedly changed his Facebook cover photo to an image that read, “We all have secrets.” About a half-hour before the fire was reported to officials, he also posted a message on his profile about “this difficult time in [his] life.” According to KXAS, he ended the message with: “Good Night Y'all.”
Keahey was a pastor at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Sandbranch, and was widely lauded for his efforts to bring attention to the water issues of his community. Sandbranch had reportedly gone decades without running water, and Keahey’s campaign got more steam after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan gained headlines. He also started an organization to help at-risk youth.
“In a city where there was no attention being brought to, he changed that,” family friend Trisha Allen told the newspaper in February. “He changed Sandbranch.” READ THIS LIST "
Mentally Ill Pregnant Woman Forced to Give Birth Alone in Florida Prison Cell,www.thedailybeast.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mentally-ill-pregnant-woman-forced-to-give-birth-alone-in-florida-prison-cell,"33 minutes ago Mentally Ill Pregnant Woman Forced to Give Birth Alone in Florida Prison Cell
A mentally ill pregnant woman was forced to give birth in her jail cell alone after prison officials declined to take her to the hospital during her over six-hour labor, The Miami Herald reports. In a letter sent to Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony asking for an investigation into the matter, Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said the inmate, Tammy Jackson, started complaining of contractions at 3:16 a.m. on April 10. Prison officials attempted to get an on-call doctor rather than take Jackson to the hospital, and she was told at 7:22 a.m. that the physician was on his way. However, the doctor still had not arrived by the time Jackson gave birth at 10 a.m. “She was forced to deliver her baby alone,” Finkelstein wrote. Broward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Gina Carter said a doctor and two nurses arrived to care for both mother and child but she did not say when they showed up.
The sheriff's office said they were notified of the incident two days after Jackson gave birth, and launched an internal affairs probe into the matter. Carter also told the newspaper that Jackson remains in custody for drug-related charges while the child is in the care of an “appropriate caregiver.” No details were given about the baby's condition.

The big news breaking on Friday afternoon was that President Donald Trump had a long talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin about various things, including what Trump described in a tweet as the “Russian hoax.”
After years of falling for it, I can’t help thinking this is classic Trump. He’s just trying to get the media—and the Democrats—to take the bait. And, of course, they always do.
Cable news will now breathlessly report on this BREAKING NEWS, panels of former FBI agents and lawyers will be trotted out to discuss the implications, and Democrats (and Never Trumpers) will virtue signal all over again with renewed calls for impeachment.
And then we will all move on in a couple of days when the next big story comes along.
Part of the hook for this news story is that, as the New York Times noted , this was the “first conversation since the release of the special counsel’s report, which found that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.’”
That’s an interesting piece of trivia, but is it really newsworthy or surprising that Trump would phone the president of Russia? I mean, they were bound to talk, eventually.
Is he now never supposed to call the Russian leader, again?
Granted, the fact that a phone call happened might not have been terribly newsworthy, in and of itself. Trump goosed the coverage by tweeting about the “Russian hoax,” and later by admitting to a reporter that, during the call, he did not warn Putin not to interfere in our elections.
Again, catnip for the media and Dems, who will seize on the “hoax” line—because anything that has to do with Mueller must be RATINGS GOLD.
Like clockwork, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff tweeted : “The 2020 campaign is already in full swing and Trump just told Putin, the man behind the most serious cyber attack on our democracy ever, that he believes it was all a hoax. Once again, he betrays our national security and for what? Nothing more than his own vanity and delusion.”
I’m not sure what Trump gets out of perpetuating this story, but instead of acting like a lucky guy who dodged a bullet and wants to change the subject from Mueller and Russia, he’s actively reveling in it—finding new and improved ways to entice everyone to remain obsessed over the latest development in what is now a very old controversy.
One theory is that Trump knows the American public, for better or worse, isn’t nearly as obsessed with this story as the media. When Trump says that “getting along with Russia, China, and everyone is a good thing, not a bad thing,” it sounds like he’s the one exercising common sense.
Another theory is that the Mueller obsession obscures everything else. Interestingly, there is a related Russia angle that isn’t quite as sexy, but is more timely and relevant. Nevertheless, it has been relegated to below-the-fold status to make room for the “hoax” headlines.
On Friday, Trump said that Venezuela was one of the topics he talked with Putin about. “And [Putin] is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela, other than he’d like to see something positive happen for Venezuela. And I feel the same way. We want to get some humanitarian aid,” Trump said.
Which makes me wonder if he’s ever heard of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been saying for at least a day now that Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro had a plane standing by and was ready to flee, before Russia told him not to.
The fact that this fresher story is (for now, at least) being relegated to second-tier status tells you all you need to know about the level of Trump Derangement Syndrome and the desire to find a way to prove that Trump colluded with Russia during the 2016 elections (and extend a ratings-proven storyline).
No matter how many times it fails to move the needle with the American people, the people invested in the WITCH HUNT storyline, as Trump likes to call it, can’t move on, can’t let go. They keep trying to make “fetch” happen.
And Donald Trump keeps trolling the media, phoning the Russians, and (yes) owning the libs. READ THIS LIST"

In a series of tweets Friday night, President Trump lamented the plight of high-profile conservatives and right-wing conspiracy theorists who he claimed were being “censored” by social media platforms.
“I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms. This is the United States of America—and we have what’s known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH!” Trump wrote in a tweet . “We are monitoring and watching, closely!!”
A number of figures were banned from Facebook on Thursday—including former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos , InfoWars contributor Paul Joseph Watson , and far-right figure Laura Loomer . InfoWars’ Alex Jones, who was already banned from Facebook, was also banned on Instagram.
Trump came to the defense of Watson and actor James Woods in particular, writing in another tweet that he was “so surprised” to see “conservative thinkers” like them banished from social media sites. Watson has spread a myriad of misinformation across YouTube and InfoWars, including conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate, chemtrails, the Virginia Tech mass shooting, and the Oklahoma City bombing.
“We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast about the bans. “The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.”
The president also claimed Woods was banned from Twitter. In reality, his account was suspended for “abusive behavior” after he wrote a tweet with the hashtag “#HangThemAll.”
Twitter reportedly told BuzzFeed News that Woods could have his account access restored if he played by the platform’s rules. “He's been told that all he needs to do is delete the tweet that violates our rules and the account access will be restored,” a Twitter spokesperson reportedly said.
The president also complained that two popular Trump surrogates and sisters, Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson (AKA Diamond and Silk), “have been treated so horribly by Facebook” in another tweet , apparently referring to their oft-repeated claims that Facebook prevents their content from spreading. “They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we’re looking into. It’s getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!” Trump wrote. READ THIS LIST"

Some four days ago, Juan Guaidó and Leopoldo López stood outside a Caracas military base, flanked by soldiers who had apparently switched sides, and declared that the last phase of “Operation Freedom” was under way. Guaidó was, as always, eloquent and impeccably dressed, and López was the image of redemption, smiling and fearless despite his years of hardship. The moment had everything one could have wanted—from the smiling faces of the previously so-feared military to the literal rise of a new dawn.
But then there was nothing, yet again.
“I can’t tell you any exact details, but I will say that the move they made was premature, it was never supposed to happen at four in the morning but instead an organized domino effect that started mid-afternoon. But circumstances forced our hand and here we are.”
Ismael García is an exiled parliamentary deputy who left Venezuela nine months ago, escaping arrest by government intelligence after, as he himself describes it, having blown the whistle on the government’s ties to narco-trafficking.
I sat down with him for a quick cup of coffee in Colombia, hoping to get some insight into the coup that never was, but when I ask him if the opposition has failed, his answers are somewhere between noncommittal and vague.
“Of course we will be victorious! I know things, but I can’t tell you more than that.”
I’ve only worked in this country for three months but even I am tired of that phrase, and I push Diputado García on how there could have been an organized plan, put in place months ago, when Leopoldo López is already seeking refuge at the Spanish embassy in Caracas? Either that was the plan all along, or something went terrible wrong, no?
“I’m not there right now so I can’t tell you what goes on minute by minute, but I do know that things have been set in motion that cannot be undone.”
And that is exactly what Leopoldo López said Friday morning when he gave a statement from within the Spanish embassy—that April 30 had set things in motion that couldn’t be stopped. And although he might be right about that, it seems that the last phase of this operation may be the last phase of a movement rather than a government.
“I’m so angry I could cry. Do you have any idea what it meant to all of us to see Leopoldo there, free in the streets? Everyone I know was sure that that was it, the nightmare was over, but we were only allowed to be happy for one single day.”
Rafael works at a hotel where I’m staying for the night. Given that I’m the only guest, Rafael takes his time checking me in and while he does, two other employees join in the conversation. “A country where trust is a rare commodity and hope is a childhood disease.”
“I’m beginning to think they’re all corrupt,” says Lena, the younger of the two women, and when I ask her why, she shrugs and tells me that corruption is the only way to get anything in Venezuela and that means that anyone who rises to power must be dirty. It’s a very cynical statement, especially coming from someone in her early twenties, but it seems the situation, and this country, warrants it.
There were many promises made three months ago, when all of this began, and the turning of the military forces was surely one of the biggest.
Guaidó claimed to have a plan, an agreement just waiting to be signed, and April 30 seemed to be proof that he could deliver more than crowds in streets and inspirational speeches. The very reason I am here is that my most cynical Venezuelan friends sent me a text on Tuesday morning, saying, “There’s a coup, it’s actually happening.” The people believed, the supporters felt vindicated, and even the darkest minds began to hope for a brighter tomorrow.
“Look at this place.” Rafael gestures at the empty lobby, “we closed the restaurant, the pool and the bar, most of the staff has been let go. ... It feels like death and now that Guaidó failed, what’s the point, really?""
The consequences of a failed coup go far beyond disappointment, as painful and palpable as it is. Those who put their faith in the opposition’s promises may end up paying a steep price if Guaidó is unable to follow through; we already know that the intelligence chief who defected is hiding out in an undisclosed location after the opposition was unable to guarantee his safety, and that several of the soldiers who stepped across the line at the border during highly publicized demonstrations on February 23 have yet to be accounted for.
Having these very public and high profile examples of his inability to protect those who stepped across the line and stepped up for him will undoubtedly hurt Guaidó in a country where trust is a rare commodity and hope is a childhood disease.
So, given that, why did the opposition choose to make an irreversible move if the framework wasn’t there to support it? Was it, as Diputado Garcia said, a question of hands being forced and plans being executed prematurely, or was this the IKEA of coups—simply built to fail?
Venezuela is three months into an uprising, three months of “soon but not just yet” and it seems as if the failure may not have been acting prematurely but rather having waited too long.
Gone is the element of surprise, the window where the Maduro government was caught off guard and reacted out of survival instinct and desperation to a challenger who seemed to stand for action in a passive state. Three months ago, the world looked at Nicolás Maduro expecting a response and a reaction, but now all the eyes are on Guaidó, demanding the very same things.
They say things have been set in motion that cannot be undone.
I think they might be right. READ THIS LIST"
