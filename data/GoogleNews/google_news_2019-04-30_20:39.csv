When President Trump tweeted on Wednesday that Britain’s intelligence service had helped the Obama administration spy on his 2016 campaign, the British metaphorically yawned and issued verbatim their response to the same Trump charge more than two years earlier.

“Nonsense. . . . Utterly ridiculous and should be ignored,” said a spokesman for Government Communications Headquarters, the British equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency.

The same day, when Trump tweeted for the umpteenth time that Mexico “is not doing nearly enough” to apprehend drug smugglers and migrants, and threatened to send “ARMED SOLDIERS” to the border, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador figuratively shrugged.

Mexico would, of course, look into any U.S. concerns, López Obrador said at a Mexico City news conference. But “the most important thing is to tell [Trump] that we are not going to fight with the government of the United States. . . . We are not going to be tripped up by any provocation.”

Friendly countries that have been the target of Trump’s tweets have learned he is not always bluffing. Aluminum and steel tariffs really were imposed on allies, and the Pentagon is sending more troops to assist in Border Patrol operations.

But few now take Trump’s Twitter fulminations at immediate face value. “He has shown us that what’s black at 9 a.m. can be gray at 3 p.m. and white at 7 p.m.,” said a Mexican diplomat of the president’s revolving pronouncements.

Most have learned that responding in kind only makes matters worse. “If you don’t pick a fight with him, you take away from Trump the possibility of further enraging himself and everybody else,” said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid fueling any fires.

Gérard Araud, France’s U.S. ambassador until earlier this month, said he told his government early on that tit-for-tat tweets were counterproductive.

First, Araud said, Trump’s tweets “are largely for domestic consumption. . . . Second, it’s totally useless to answer, because basically it will lead to escalation, and, to be frank in terms of vocabulary, President Trump has an escalation dominance.”

In December, Trump indirectly hammered French President Emmanuel Macron, saying that widespread demonstrations across France were in response to the cost of the 2015 Paris climate agreement from which Trump withdrew. The protesters, Trump tweeted, inaccurately, were chanting, “We Want Trump!”

The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting “We Want Trump!” Love France. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2018

The response was left to Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who noted dryly in a television interview that demonstrators “were not protesting in English, as far as I know.”

Macron, on the advice of aides, “didn’t engage in childish teenaged behavior,” Araud said, so his government “avoided the worst.”

“You can talk to my German or my British colleagues,” he said. “Every European leader has been the target at some moment of tweeting outbursts. That’s part of this strange period that we are living in.”

Trump supporters and some White House officials, however, say that foreign leaders ignore Trump’s outbursts at their peril. Aides said that the president’s tweets are aimed at his domestic audience and meant to give him leverage. Sometimes, he will poll those around him and ask how a particular line of attack might go over with a foreign leader, sizing up their strengths and weaknesses, current and former officials said.

“If they aren’t taking him seriously, that’s a mistake,” said Tom Bossert, former White House homeland security adviser. “The president’s style is an interpersonal negotiation style, whereas we’ve seen other presidents take an institutional style. Even his harsh language is an outgrowth of his interpersonal negotiation style.”

Barry Bennett, a Trump ally and lobbyist for foreign governments, said that, while others may be “getting used to his behavior, they don’t doubt he would act against them.”

“He’s proven that he’s not usually just bluffing,” Bennett said. “The Germans took the [threat of] car tariffs very seriously. . . . I don’t remember the Germans flying over here to talk about zero tariffs on cars during the Obama administration.”

Trump had been insulting Kim Jong Un for years on Twitter before he warned, as president, that he would rain down “fire and fury” on the North Korean leader. It was the only message the dictator understood, Trump told senior aides gathered in the Oval Office. “Man versus man, me versus Kim,” Trump said, according to several aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

When Kim responded in kind, Trump tweeted back asking why the North Korean would “insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ ”

In Kim’s case, trading barbs apparently worked, at least temporarily, leading to two summits and a pause in North Korean nuclear tests and missile launches.

Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ""old,"" when I would NEVER call him ""short and fat?"" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017

There has been no similar result with Iran, an unending target of threatening tweets, many in all-caps for emphasis. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani generally respond with serious-sounding counterpunches, while Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif often strives for wit.

When Trump segued in a November statement on the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi to a litany of complaints about Iran, Zarif called the statement “bizarre” and noted that “perhaps we’re also responsible for the California fires because we didn’t help rake the forests — just like the Finns do?” a take on Trump’s musing that Finland had avoided such conflagrations by clearing their forest floors.

Ostensible friends, at least at the beginning, were often the most unnerved by the tweets and frequently turned to those around Trump for explanation or reassurance.

For Germany, whose Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a frequent target, former defense secretary Jim Mattis was the go-to explainer, although German officials said they usually would find that Mattis agreed with them rather than Trump.

British Embassy officials have invited a raft of officials to the ambassador’s residence for dinner — including former chief of staff John F. Kelly, national security adviser John Bolton and advisers Stephen Miller and Kellyanne Conway — to help them understand Trump’s more puzzling pronouncements.

Kelly, before resigning in December, told military and other officials that Trump’s tweets should not be seen as official government policy and they should wait to see it on paper.

Mexico has long looked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner as an ally, as well as Cabinet members such as Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and U.S. business leaders, when the president channeled his ire over migrants toward Mexico and threatened to impose new tariffs or close the border.

Mexican officials are among the most inured to being in the Twitter crosshairs — charged as they were during the campaign with sending criminals and “rapists” into this country.

“There were a lot of expectations that he was going to be a different political animal once he was in office,” the Mexican diplomat said. “And he wasn’t.” Little has changed over the past two years, but “the surprise element is gone.”

To some Mexican officials, the torrent of tweeted abuse has become a perverse point of pride. “We don’t mean to brag,” the diplomat said, “but no other country has been . . . submitted to his rhetoric and insults the way that we were. We developed a very thick skin.”"
Trump Pushes to Designate Muslim Brotherhood a Terrorist Group,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Charlie Savage', 'Eric Schmitt', 'Maggie Haberman']",04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/trump-muslim-brotherhood.html,"Among the alternative ideas raised at the meeting last week were trying to identify and target a terrorist-linked group with ties to the Brotherhood that has not yet been designated or limiting any designation’s scope to the Egyptian branch, officials said.

A former general, Mr. el-Sisi helped lead a coup in 2013 that deposed Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president and a former Brotherhood leader, and has reimposed strongman rule on Egypt. The Egyptian government deemed the Brotherhood a terrorist organization several years ago as part of a brutal crackdown on its supporters, and Mr. el-Sisi repeatedly pressed the Obama administration to follow suit. But the Obama team refused, for both legal and policy reasons.

The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 in Egypt, and in the 1940s formed a secret, armed wing to fight against British colonial rule. It renounced violence in the 1960s and later embraced electoral democracy instead, although some offshoots and former members have engaged in terrorism.

The push for sanctions on the Brotherhood is the latest of several significant foreign policy decisions by Mr. Trump that appear to have been heavily influenced by talking to autocratic foreign leaders without first being fully vetted by career government professionals — such as his abrupt choice, since partly reversed, to swiftly pull American troops out of Syria.

The Trump administration had weighed whether to designate both the Muslim Brotherhood and an arm of Iran’s military, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, as terrorist organizations during its chaotic first weeks in 2017. But the ideas lapsed amid objections from career professionals and the fallout from other capricious early steps, like Mr. Trump’s ban on visitors from several predominantly Muslim countries.

But this spring, the administration abruptly pushed through the terrorist designation for the Revolutionary Guards. Mr. Pompeo, who has the most important voice in the debate besides Mr. Trump’s because the secretary of state controls the list of designated terrorist organizations, announced sanctions on the Iranian military arm on April 8, the day before Mr. el-Sisi visited the White House.

The move against the Iranian military was the first time the United States had interpreted its counterterrorism laws as permitting an entity of a nation-state government to count as terrorists."

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joy-behar-media-trump-blame-shooting,"Anti-Trump TV host Joy Behar has shockingly referred to the president as ""the culprit"" behind the deadly California synagogue shooting.

During Monday’s ""The View"", the panel discussed the shooting at the Chabad of Poway synagogue on Saturday as worshipers were celebrating the last day of Passover, killing a woman and injuring three others.

PARENTS DISAVOW CALIFORNIA SYNAGOGUE SUSPECT, SAY SON IS PART OF ‘HISTORY OF EVIL’

“I want to say something about Trump. Last week Biden introduced a video where he brought up Charlottesville. We all saw that. It was very well done. It reminded me we’re losing the soul of America,” Behar said, referencing the show's recent interview with former Vice President Joe Biden.

Take responsibility for your actions. Mr. President, you are the culprit. — Joy Behar

“The next day Donald Trump defends Charlottesville once again. Says that these people were historians they were more interested in Robert E. Lee then the fact that they were saying ‘Jews will not replace us,’ they were just historians.”

“Then on Saturday in the morning this assault on the synagogue. Then Saturday afternoon ‘our hearts are with the victims.’ He talks out of both sides of his mouth,” she continued.

“He’s provocative. He gives dog whistles constantly to these people. Then Kellyanne goes out there and defends him and says ‘no no no,’ and he is like ‘no no no.’ Take responsibility for your actions. Mr. President, you are the culprit.”

Behar wasn't alone in attributing some blame for the tragedy to the president, with multiple liberal media figures and pundits also suggesting Trump was partly responsible for the shooting.

MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” co-host Joe Scarborough delivered a fiery monologue Monday, saying “the blood that is spilled” is on Trump’s hands, accusing him of inciting such attacks.

“We are so far beyond dog whistles here, Donald. We are so far beyond dog whistles. The blood, the blood that is spilled, is on your hands. From white nationalists, from people who listen to that sort of rhetoric, any violence to journalists,” Scarborough said.

“The blood, the blood that is spilled, is on your hands.” — Joe Scarborough

“No, we are so past dog whistles now, Donald. You are just inciting violence. It’s just – it’s just obvious... We are calling it out now. You are unfit to be President of the United States.”

Meanwhile, a network contributor on the same program compared Trump to ISIS and Al Qaeda clerics who inspire terror attacks across the world.

“This is intertwined in our own politics today, they are inspired oftentimes by political rhetoric. If you took a lot of the statements by politicians right now in this country and you compare them to what Al Qaeda or ISIS clerics said that inspired attacks around the world over the last decade, they would look remarkably similar,” MSNBC contributor Clint Watts said, later adding that he was talking about Trump specifically. “This is incitement to violence in many cases.”

""If you took a lot of the statements by politicians right now in this country and you compare them to what Al Qaeda or ISIS clerics said that inspired attacks around the world over the last decade, they would look remarkably similar.” — MSNBC contributor Clint Watts

Trump offered his sympathies to the victims Saturday shortly after the shooting.

“Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community,” Trump said later at a rally in Wisconsin. “We forcefully condemn the evils of anti-Semitism and hate, which must be defeated.”

Cory Gardner has a record in the Senate to defend — one that includes getting the president's back more often than not. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo 2020 Elections The silver-tongued GOP star in danger of losing his job Sen. Cory Gardner is a very good politician — even Democrats concede that. But will it be enough in left-leaning Colorado?

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — Cory Gardner stormed into the Senate in 2014 at the height of anti-Obama fervor on the right, a fresh face vowing to be a “new kind of Republican” in a state drifting toward Democrats.

Now up for a second term in Colorado, Gardner is selling himself essentially the same way. Only this time Donald Trump’s in the White House, the president is deeply unpopular here and Gardner has a record in the Senate to defend — one that includes having the president's back more often than not. Compounding his predicament: Colorado Republicans were just blown out in the midterms.

Story Continued Below

But to hear the exceedingly upbeat Gardner tell it, no course correction is in order: There’s still room in Colorado for a conservative but pragmatic Republican who gets along with Trump.

""You talk to some people and it’s like, 'Oh my God, nobody got a single vote other than Hillary Clinton in Colorado,'"" Gardner said in an interview during two days of non-stop barnstorming across the state. “If I were a Democrat, I would say the same thing: 'When Democrats win, it’s permanent. And when Republicans lose it's permanent.' That's just what they want the narrative to be. And it's just not true.""

As he seeks reelection on the front lines of the GOP’s efforts to defend its majority, Gardner’s formidable political skills face an even tougher test than when he pulled off his upset win five years ago over Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. He’s campaigning in a manner that makes Trump seem almost like an afterthought, as Gardner toils away on parochial issues like water management and takes on international ones like confronting North Korea.

He rarely mentions the president, except for when he’s asked directly about him or when he can point to his relationship with Trump as a plus for the state.

At a Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce event, Gardner told the suits in attendance that he’d spoken to the president about permanently locating U.S. Space Command in their region. But at a Lincoln Day GOP dinner in Alamosa — a remote town of about 10,000 near the New Mexico border — he all but avoided Trump. Gardner was introduced there as the “fifth-most bipartisan senator” — a soundbite voters are likely to hear throughout the campaign — before he took the stage and lit into socialism.

It’s far from assured Gardner can walk this tightrope for the next 18 months and keep his job. Democrats have made him their No. 1 Senate target next year, confident the state’s shift left has gone into overdrive since Trump took office. Colorado Democrats carry personal grudges against Gardner for the way he campaigned against Udall, and he's up against a well-oiled Democratic Party machine backed by deep-pocketed outside groups.

Gardner’s opponents argue that his 49 percent support among state Republicans — combined with Trump’s 55 percent disapproval rating in the state and significant Democratic voter registration gains in voter registration — will spell the senator’s doom.

“There’s a lot of momentum at our back,” said former state Sen. Mike Johnston, a leading Democratic contender. The midterm elections were “just halftime.”

Nearly a dozen Democrats are running in the primary to take on Gardner, and the party’s Washington leadership is not picking favorites. Aside from Johnston, who’s already raised nearly $2 million, there’s former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, a favorite among the liberal grass roots; former diplomat Dan Baer; and former U.S. Attorney John Walsh. A few House members are flirting with the race, plus a handful of others.

And some believe former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper could jump in if his presidential campaign stalls.

“There was a lot of speculation early on that there’s going to be some sort of A-list recruit,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young (R-Ind.). There hasn’t been, he said, “because Cory has been doing his work.”

Still, it’s a good time to be a Democrat in Colorado. In the past year alone, the state’s GOP gubernatorial nominee lost by 10 points, Republicans lost a critical swing House seat in the Denver suburbs and Democrats cemented healthy statehouse majorities.

But Gardner predicts the Legislature's liberal ""overreach"" will swing the pendulum back his way. And some Democrats are sounding a note of caution.

“A lot of Democrats underestimate his skills as a politician and overestimate the certainty of a blue wave,” Romanoff said in an interview. “A lot of people have said to me ‘Cory is toast,’” he added, but “that’s completely wrong.”

If upstart senators could be created from test tubes, you’d probably end up with someone like Gardner. A 44-year-old with a streak of silvery hair and boundless energy, his staffers often have to take shifts during the day to keep up with him and Gardner doesn’t even drink coffee.

Gardner’s dexterity with language has served him well. He’s highly disciplined without sounding programmed.

And he has a quick wit: Informed that a Pueblo steel mill he toured last week was established in 1881, Gardner deadpans that just-retired octogenarian Sen. Orrin Hatch was in office at that time. At another point, he complains that his daughter used Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) as a source for a school report on North Korea rather than asking him.

After initially declining to run in 2014, Gardner entered the race just nine months before the election. He launched a furious sprint that caught Democrats off guard.

That won’t happen again, they say.

“‘Look at me, I’m a moderate guy,’” is how state Democratic Party Chairman Morgan Carroll described Gardner’s pitch to voters in 2014. It worked on short notice, Carroll said, but now, “This state hates Trump” and Gardner is “embracing Trump.”

The challenge for Democrats is to contrast Gardner’s claims of bipartisanship with his record. They’re focusing on his votes to repeal Obamacare, confirm Trump’s nominees and support the president’s emergency declaration on the border wall. Gardner did buck the president on votes during the shutdown and on immigration reform, and he condemned Roy Moore's candidacy in Alabama while leading the party's campaign arm.

With Gardner constantly caught between Trump and independent voters, Democrats are drawing a parallel between Gardner’s tactics and former GOP Dean Heller, who faced similar political terrain last year in Nevada. “Dean tried to do the same thing. And lost,” said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.).

Many Republicans were bracing for Gardner to tack left this year in preparation for his campaign. But the idea that Gardner would suddenly vote like a liberal belies who he is. Though he has often tried to work across the aisle, Gardner is reliably conservative on most issues other than immigration. As chairman of the NRSC, he devoted himself for two years to defeating incumbent Democrats.

“People are surprised to find out that I’m a Republican,” Gardner said, when asked about the uproar that ensued when he endorsed Trump’s reelection.

“I believe in limited government, I believe in low taxes,” he added later. “If that makes me a conservative, that makes me a conservative.”

In Pueblo, after speaking about water quality, Gardner was reminded that Trump looms large over everything. In quick succession, he was asked whether he backs the president’s border wall, then what he thinks of the administration’s “assault” on air quality. He said border security is important but that he sympathizes with those attracted to a better life in the United States and agrees that “all of us have an interest to ensure our water and air are clean.""

To the extent that Gardner does talk about Trump, he argues that his state has more influence over the White House with a Republican senator.

“Absolutely,"" Gardner said. The effort he's made to forge a relationship with the president ""is for Colorado.""

Democrats say that approach works for Gardner, but only to a point.

“Trump is likely to do things on immigration and health care that will imperil Sen. Gardner,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who partnered with Gardner on immigration last year. “It will be difficult to distinguish himself from President Trump because he has supported the president’s positions.”

Gardner avoids blanket criticisms of Trump; instead, he’s picked a handful of discrete issues to create some daylight. He held up Trump's judicial nominees in an effort to protect the state’s burgeoning marijuana industry and derailed the nomination of Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve. Gardner complained about the 35-day shutdown but did not go after Trump over it.

The issue where Gardner is most critical of the president is North Korea.

“The president has, I’m afraid, taken pressure off of North Korea. He believes it’s a way for him to negotiate with Kim Jong Un,” Gardner said. “I believe it’s a rope a dope.”

In the Senate, Gardner wants to take up comprehensive immigration reform and steps to stop election interference by Russia. He said he wants to do more than just confirm Trump's nominees. Asked whether that means trying to repeal Obamacare as he's supported in the past, Gardner demurs. “Obamacare has failed,” he offers, but getting rid of it is unrealistic.

Taken together, a campaign blueprint emerges: Hold together Colorado Republicans, then cobble together a coalition of independents and conservative Democrats to put him over the top. In Colorado that means clearing about 48 percent of the vote.

“He appeals to a lot of the unaffiliated voters,” Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) said of Gardner. (Colorado has more than 1.2 million people registered as unaffiliated.) And, “he’ll run ahead of Trump.""

Colorado’s political history indicates its voters are open to splitting tickets: In 2004, Democrat Ken Salazar won a Senate seat as and George W. Bush carried Colorado in his reelection campaign.

But Colorado is seen as a long shot at best for Trump, and Republicans have lost their registration advantage there. There’s likely no other way for Gardner to win than draw crossover voters.

Gardner’s already working on his pitch for those Democrats, the latest iteration of his “new kind” of Republicanism. Except this time, it’s that he’s the same guy who stood in front of windmills in 2014 and said he's ""working across party lines.""

Asked whether he’s changed since his electric run in 2014, Gardner chuckles.

“Yeah,” he said. “I think my suits have all gotten older and more worn out.”"
"‘Bizarre, Dangerous, and Insulting’: Baby Nurses Fed Up With Trump’s Bogus Abortion Rants",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Emily Shugerman'],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/neonatal-nurses-fed-up-with-trumps-bogus-rants-about-executing-babies,"President Trump’s latest rant about babies being executed after birth is riling up neonatal nurses, who say he’s twisted the palliative care they provide for the sickest of infants into an anti-abortion rallying cry that could endanger health providers.

Anna Schmidt, who has worked in a neonatal intensive care unit for five years, told the Daily Beast she was livid when she heard about Trump’s comments at a political rally in Wisconsin on Saturday.

“The families that I've worked with, where I've handed them their babies for the first and last time, they don't deserve this kind of thing,” she told The Daily Beast. “They don’t deserve to be vilified or to be called an executioner.”

Trump’s remark was a continuation of his attacks on later abortions, which he describes as “ripp[ing] babies from their mothers’ wombs right up until the moment of birth.” But while abortion providers may be used to such attacks, the president’s latest criticism has rankled a new group of medical professionals—nurses who take care of babies destined to die.

The nurses claim what they do is sensitive, personal, and has absolutely nothing to do with abortion. And they are not happy with the president’s claims.

“When a baby dies in the hospital it’s because something has gone very, very wrong,” said Julia Puler, a NICU nurse from Michigan. “I can’t point to a single case study of a healthy term newborn that was executed in a hospital. And the mere suggestions of that is just utterly bizarre and dangerous and insulting, frankly, for anyone who is a health-care professional.”

Trump’s latest line of attack started in February, when Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam—to the delight of conservatives—inaccurately described the effects of a bill expanding access to third-trimester abortions. Asked whether the bill would allow women to get an abortion during childbirth, Northam said infants with “severe deformities” would be delivered and kept comfortable while the family and physicians discussed the best course of treatment.

“The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,” he explained in a radio interview.

Trump jumped on the statement, tweeting that Democrats supported “executing babies AFTER birth.” He repeated the line at his State of the Union—as a way to “energize his political base” after an unpopular government shutdown, according to the Washington Post—and again at Saturday’s rally.

“The baby is born; the mother meets with the doctor,” he told the crowd. “They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. Then the doctor and mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”

Doctors and nurses say Trump’s description is radically wrong. What Northam had described—and what Trump seized on—was not third-trimester abortion but palliative care, in which infants born with severe birth defects are kept comfortable while they are taken off life-sustaining treatment. Such care is provided to families of infants with “life-limiting” conditions, such as severe prematurity or a heart defect, that would require extraordinary interventions to keep them alive.

From the perspective of those in the room, it’s not a decision anyone makes lightly.

“Any time a parent has to make a decision about their baby, you can't imagine what it’s like for them. It's just heartbreaking,” said Amy Carle, a NICU nurse of 22 years. “And for him to so carelessly spout off that babies are getting executed is just disheartening for all these families who have to go through these kinds of choices.”

There are few studies on how many families choose palliative care for their newborns, and why. But when Puler, the NICU nurse from Michigan, tweeted in response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the thread was flooded with replies from parents who had chosen to seek palliative care. Some wrote of babies born with tumors in their brains who never made a sound. Others wrote of severe disabilities caused by traumatic births. The thread was retweeted more than 50,000 times.

“Thank you for this thread,” one woman tweeted. “As someone who has experienced this, it means the world to me that you (and so many others) serve(ed) on a bereavement team, and that you are combating this sick rhetoric.”

Still, the “executing babies” line has proved popular with Republicans. GOP legislators in at least seven states have introduced so-called “born alive” bills this year, which would impose prison sentences on doctors who don’t provide medical care to infants born after an abortion attempt. Senator Ben Sasse introduced a version in the U.S. February—despite the fact that a 2002 federal law already grants any born-alive infant the rights of a person. (Executing such an infant, of course, is already illegal under infanticide statutes.)

Trump was responding to similar bills at his Wisconsin rally, after governor Tony Evers vowed to veto the state’s “born alive” bill. In fact, despite Trump’s support, no such bill has been signed into law. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed his state’s version of the bill this month, and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is reportedly leaning toward doing the same.

But several NICU nurses told The Daily Beast they were concerned that if the bills didn’t pass, Trump’s rhetoric would incite anti-abortion zealots to do something more extreme.

“He's putting my profession in danger, and the doctors and the abortion clinics and all kinds of places,” said Carle, the NICU nurse of 22 years. “He's already spewed enough things that have created violence. This is just another notch in his belt.”"
"Lie No. 10,000 is really a whopper",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'April At Pm']",04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-president-trump-your-family-separation-policy-is-not-remotely-humane/2019/04/29/63d189ce-6aae-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html,"AS PRESIDENT TRUMP zoomed past a lowly personal milestone — his 10,000th false or misleading statement in his 27-month-old presidency, according to The Post Fact Checker — he let fly a series of whoppers on a subject that logic would suggest he’d be better off leaving unremarked: family separation. The president, whose own administration imposed and then rescinded a systematic policy of wrenching migrant children from their parents, with no protocol in place to reunite them, now poses as a paragon of compassion that ended cruel laws in place before he took office. This is false.

During an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Trump suggested that his heartless policy had continued practices in place under the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations, among others. In contrast to his predecessors, Mr. Trump said, “we’ve been on a humane basis . . . we go out and stop the separations,” he said. “The problem is you have 10 times as many people coming up with their families. It’s like Disneyland now.”

In fact, the “zero tolerance” policy was formulated (with White House approval) by Mr. Trump’s then- attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The policy mandated automatic imprisonment for undocumented adult asylum seekers apprehended at the border, meaning migrant children would be seized from their parents’ custody and transferred for placements scattered around the country by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Several thousand parents and children were left with no means of contacting each other and no documents to facilitate their eventual reunification. It was an act of singular cruelty by an administration that has not shied from demonstrating malice toward migrants.

Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Bush prosecuted policies remotely similar to Mr. Trump’s. While families were occasionally separated before Mr. Trump entered office, it was generally when there was reason to believe the parents posed a threat to their children. And when the Justice Department announced what it called a “new” policy that separated families a year ago, officials justified it as a response to a surge in undocumented Central American migrants crossing the border.

The resulting national uproar forced Mr. Trump’s about-face, which he now seems to regret. During the interview Sunday, he called the policy’s revocation a “disaster” and blamed it for what he called a tenfold increase in migrant families apprehended after crossing the border. In fact, the increase has been closer to sixfold, which is bad enough — and at least partly a testament to the panic among Central American migrants seeking to enter the country before Mr. Trump fixes on some new draconian course of action.

In the meantime, the damage caused by the policy of separation persists. In court papers filed this month, the administration said it hoped it would take no more than six more months to identify the remaining children and match them with their parents — but said it could take as long as two years. Thus has the administration fused inhumanity with incompetence."
State Department preparing for clash of civilizations with China,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-preparing-for-clash-of-civilizations-with-china,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.

“This is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology and the United States hasn't had that before,” Kiron Skinner, the director of policy planning at the State Department, said Monday evening at a security forum in Washington, D.C.

Skinner is leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations on the scale of what she called “Letter X” — the unsigned essay by George Kennan, who assessed “the sources of Soviet conduct” in 1947 and outlined the containment strategy that guided American strategists for the rest of the Cold War. China poses a unique challenge, she said, because the regime in Beijing isn’t a child of Western philosophy and history.

“The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”

Skinner credited retired Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as White House national security adviser from March 2017 to March 2018, with recognizing the need for a National Security Strategy organized around the return of great power competition with Russia and China. But those two rivals are not equivalent, she said, identifying Russia as a mere “global survivor” that pales in comparison to China.

“We see it as a more fundamental long-term threat,” Skinner told New America CEO Anne Marie Slaughter. “In China, we have an economic competitor, we have an ideological competitor, one that really does seek a global reach that many of us didn't expect a couple of decades ago.”

Slaughter, who served as the head of policy planning for the State Department from 2009 to 2011, suggested that Skinner was offering the U.S.-China relationship as the ""clash of civilizations"" outlined in another landmark essay that discussed how geopolitics would change after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Skinner concurred.

""Some of those tenets, but a little bit different,"" she answered. ""I think we have to take the rose-colored glasses off and get real about the nature of the threat. And, I think we also have to give a kind of respect for, I think, what the Chinese seek to accomplish.""

Trump has made a trade war with China one of the major undertakings of his administration, in pursuit of a trade deal to rebalance the relationship between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. officials have also rebranded the Asia Pacific region as the Indo-Pacific, partly as a nod to China’s surge in Africa and the potential for India to function as a counter-weight to the Communist power.

But Pompeo has sounded the alarm about China’s influence around the world, warning of security threats in Europe and the Arctic, as well as predatory lending in the Western Hemisphere.

“Trade is not the only problem and maybe not the biggest in the long run with China,” Skinner said. “But we're now looking more deeply and broadly at China. And, I think State is in the lead in that broader attempt to get something like a Letter X for China, what Kennan wrote. You can't have a policy without an argument underneath it.”

Pompeo’s team has rebuked China repeatedly for human rights abuses, especially the hostility to religious beliefs displayed by the regime’s mass detention of Uighur Muslims and the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. But Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department.

“It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That's not really possible with China.”"
Defense Department agrees to send approximately 320 personnel to US southern border,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kate Sullivan', 'Barbara Starr']",04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/politics/dod-personnel-us-southern-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan on Monday approved a Department of Homeland Security request for additional support at the US southern border, according to a Pentagon spokesman.

""DoD personnel will assist in driving high-capacity (Customs and Border Patrol) vehicles to transport migrants; providing administrative support, including providing heating, meal distribution and monitoring the welfare of individuals in CBP custody; and attorney support to (Immigration and Customs Enforcement),"" Lt. Col. Jamie Davis told CNN.

Davis said approximately ""320 DoD personnel will be required to support the DHS request for assistance through September 30, 2019, at an estimated cost of $7.4M.""

CNN reported last week the DHS had requested 280 additional US troops and other logistical support for operations on the southern border.

The request comes after CBP released data showing there were more apprehensions on the US southern border in March than in any other month in more than a decade.

Rod Rosenstein Embodies the Republican Surrender to Trump,http://nymag.com,['Jonathan Chait'],04-30-2019,2019,4,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/rod-rosenstein-resigns-letter-trump-mueller-barr.html,"Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images

The most bizarre passage in Rod Rosenstein’s letter to President Trump resigning his post as deputy attorney general is praise for “the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations.” It is not standard practice for the president to have personal conversations with the deputy attorney general at all, certainly not when that person is supervising an investigation into the president himself. And while we cannot know the substance of those personal conversations, we do know that Rosenstein was once so alarmed by Trump’s behavior that he discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to have him removed on account of mental unfitness.

Maybe Trump’s private conversations somehow contain the humor that is completely lacking in his public persona, which consist of boasts, lies, and belittling attacks. Trump’s public treatment of Rosenstein included tweeting an image of him behind bars along with other alleged traitors. That Trump, what a jokester.

Rosenstein’s status as a target of Trump’s rage, and his background as a career official, raised broad hopes that he would check the president’s authoritarian impulses. By all indications, he failed to live up to this heroic destiny. Rosenstein ended his career as a dutiful functionary, allowing Trump to trash the rule of law while claiming he had upheld it.

Rosenstein deserves to be judged by the forgiving standards of a man placed in an untenable situation and having no good options. Trump’s worldview is inimical to the concept of the rule of law. The president believes the Department of Justice can and must be placed at his personal disposal, and used to harass his enemies while giving himself and his friends impunity. Trump can no more grasp a Department of Justice that holds his views at arm length than he could abide the doorman at his hotels subjecting him to strip searches.

Rosenstein’s answer to this dilemma was to bend, and bend, and bend. When Trump demanded personal loyalty from the FBI director and fired him for failing to quash a probe into Trump’s campaign, Rosenstein dutifully wrote a letter supplying Trump with a phony pretext. When Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the offense of following Department rules and recusing himself from an investigation into which he was massively conflicted, he remained loyal. When Trump installed a transparent hack in Matthew Whitaker, prompting more than 400 former DOJ officials to sign a public letter of protest, Rosenstein called the choice “superb.”

And then of course Rosenstein joined with Attorney General William Barr to impose their judgment that Robert Mueller’s investigation would not accuse the president of obstructing justice. One of Trump’s many acts of obstruction included instructing Corey Lewandowski, a private citizen, to order Sessions to violate Department procedure and take control of the investigation. As Ben Wittes notes, “If true and provable beyond a reasonable doubt, it is unlawful obstruction of justice.”

Barr, with Rosenstein’s imprimatur, deemed these and all of Trump’s other efforts to harm the investigation to be non-crimes. He did this despite the fact that Trump’s obstruction of justice successfully obstructed the probe – by dangling pardons to key witnesses, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, thereby preventing Mueller from getting to the bottom of the campaign’s collusion with Russia. Barr and Rosenstein made the comically backward argument that because Trump prevented Mueller from proving criminal collusion, there was no underlying crime, therefore his efforts to halt the probe must go unpunished.

Before his firing, Comey confided his misgivings about Rosenstein. “Rod is a survivor,” he said. And you don’t get to survive that long across administrations without making compromises. “So I have concerns.” This turned out to be a perfect epitaph for Rosenstein’s tenure.

When Trump was poised to fire Rosenstein last fall, Rosenstein pleaded for his job. “I give the investigation credibility,” he said, according to the Washington Post, “I can land the plane.” Trump has a gift for homing in on this kind of weakness, and surrounding himself with morally compromised individuals who will do his bidding. Rosenstein’s desperation to avoid the ignominy of a firing and the torrent of abuse that always followed it – “I don’t want to go out with a tweet,” he said, according to the Post – made him suitably pathetic for Trump’s purposes.

In a farewell speech several days ago, Rosenstein sycophantically quoted his boss: “As President Trump pointed out, ‘we govern ourselves in accordance with the rule of law rather [than] … the whims of an elite few.’” It was perhaps his most overt gesture of submission. Here Rosenstein credited a man he knows perfectly well has contempt for the rule of law with cherishing the principle he has relentlessly undermined, a task at which Rosenstein ultimately aided him. He might as well have quoted Trump proclaiming the importance of truth, chastity and frugality.

We can extend Rosenstein enough credit to assume things did not follow his fondest hopes. He surely did not want the FBI Director and Attorney general to be fired for doing their jobs properly, nor to be publicly belittled by the president. Instead he seems to have convinced himself that the need for normalcy, or the appearance of it, transcended everything else. After principled resignation seemed unthinkable, every new compromise simply kept the plane on track for its landing.

It turns out most of the Republicans in the bureaucracy operate along the same principles as the ones running for office. Trump’s manifest unfitness for office and disdain for democratic norms begin as a shock. Gradually, though, they recede into the background, and take their place as fixed features of the landscape around which everything else must be arranged. That is how Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have worked around and ultimately for a figure they greeted with disgust. And that ultimately is how Rosenstein, too, served Trump."
Kevin McAleenan says administration will ask Congress for more border funds this year,https://www.cnn.com,"['Priscilla Alvarez', 'Geneva Sands', 'Phil Mattingly']",04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/politics/dhs-acting-secretary-kevin-mcaleenan-congress-testimony/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration will be asking Congress for extra money to help pay for the influx of migrants coming across the border this year, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday.

The supplemental request will seek funding for temporary and semi-permanent migrant processing facilities, additional personnel along the border, increased detention capacity and upgrades to ""overtaxed"" information technology systems, he told a House appropriations subcommittee.

""Given the scale of what we are facing, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year,"" he said.

The request will be for less than less than $10 billion and will come as soon as this week, according to sources briefed on the proposal.

It isn't intended to create ""policies to be aggressive on immigration,"" but rather to address the increased flows of migrants, according to a DHS official.

It will include a request for additional bed space and transportation funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the official said. ICE is currently averaging around 50,000 people in custody, which is above the current detention funding levels. The official acknowledged that the request for additional beds is likely to get pushback from lawmakers.

The request is also expected to run into problems on Capitol Hill because of serious Democratic concerns over intent on immigration broadly, as well as the still-languishing disaster relief supplemental, which has imploded the last few weeks.

First test for acting homeland security secretary

McAleenan's appearance is his first congressional hearing since being thrust into the Cabinet-level post three weeks ago after a shake-up in the top ranks at the department, including the departure of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Appropriations chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-New York, acknowledged McAleenan's challenge.

""It seems like the car is driving off the cliff with no one to take the wheel, though I guess, Mr. Secretary, you are now the driver,"" she said.

Democratic Rep. David Price of North Carolina, told McAleenan he was ""grateful"" that he was available to ""steer this ship"" as the head of DHS at a time of ""maximum chaos and political turmoil orchestrated by a vindictive president.""

Immigration has been a critical issue for the department, which has seen a steep uptick in apprehensions along the southern border over recent months. President Donald Trump, who's grown increasingly frustrated by the situation along the border, issued a memo Monday evening calling for sweeping immigration revisions which are already receiving pushback from advocates and Democrats.

Since taking over at DHS, McAleenan, who had been serving as US Customs and Border Protection commissioner, has been on a mini-media blitz, most recently appearing on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday.

Lawmakers are ""realizing that something different is happening with this crisis. It's not manufactured -- it's real. And we've got to sit down at a table and talk about ways to solve it,"" he said on the broadcast.

Last week, McAleenan told NBC's Lester Holt that migrant family separations had resulted in the department ""losing public trust"" such that ""from an enforcement perspective, it's not worth it,"" and that reinstating them is not on the table.

McAleenan told lawmakers Tuesday that the metal chain-link cells used to separate groups inside CBP's McAllen, Texas, detention facility, which came under intense scrutiny last summer, are being taken down and replaced with ""partitions that are more appropriate in terms of appearance.""

""We are gonna take out the chain-link,"" he said. The interior chain-link fencing has been called ""cages"" by some, a characterization DHS has disputed.

The President has denied both accounts.

McAleenan said he will ask Congress for the authority to keep families in custody while they move through the immigration process.

""But in terms of your broader point, the way that we are actually achieving results is when we are able to detain somebody in custody through the pendency of their immigration proceedings,"" McAleenan said in response to Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Texas. ""That's what works with single adults right now, and that's an essential aspect of what we are going to ask from Congress for families -- being able to keep them together in an appropriate setting for a fair and expeditious process.""

The Flores Agreement currently places a limit on how long migrant children can be held in detention. McAleenan knocked down the idea that the department intends to hold children indefinitely, saying, ""The notion that we want to detain children for a long time is just not accurate.""

During the hearing, lawmakers asked a series of questions about the situation along the border and department enforcement actions. Following on a line of questioning by Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York on Immigration and Customs Enforcement courthouse arrests, California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard noted that the concern is not going after criminals, but all undocumented immigrants who may not be the target.

""That's where the concern is and that's where the objection is,"" she said.

On Monday, Massachusetts district attorneys and public defenders filed a lawsuit to stop ICE from patrolling state courthouses.

Tuesday's hearing comes as the number of migrant families arriving at the US-Mexico border has reached record highs and total monthly apprehensions are the highest they've been in over a decade. There were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry on the southern border in March, up from 37,390 in March 2018.

Last month, McAleenan postponed a hearing with the House Appropriations Committee to visit the border in El Paso, Texas, amid the surge in migrant arrivals, which has overwhelmed US Border Patrol facilities and led to the direct release of families from custody.

""The only way to fundamentally address these flows is for Congress to act and to reinstate integrity into our immigration system. In the meantime, we need assistance and additional resources to manage the flow,"" McAleenan said during a news conference in El Paso.

McAleenan is pursuing three changes to the immigration system, according to a senior DHS official:

Amending the Flores agreement, which regulates the amount of time migrant children can spend in custody.

Pursuing moderate changes to credible fear determinations, so they better match asylum approval rates.

Seeking the ability to in some cases repatriate unaccompanied children who aren't from Mexico or Canada.

Migrant families and nowhere to put them: How the acting DHS chief plans to handle the southern border,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-families-how-acting-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-plans-to-handle-southern-border-60-minutes-2019-04-28/,"Earlier this month, President Trump placed Kevin McAleenan in charge of the Department of Homeland Security. The president fired his previous DHS chief, Kirstjen Nielsen, because he said he wanted to go in a tougher direction. As the new acting secretary, McAleenan is facing the largest wave of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border in a decade. 100,000 migrants were detained just last month. So we went to McAllen, Texas, one of the busiest sections on the border, to see for ourselves. We were surprised how many families were crossing, where they were detained and how quickly they were released. We asked Secretary McAleenan how he plans to manage the crisis and navigate what may be the most difficult job in Washington.

Sharyn Alfonsi: How do you keep happy-- a boss, who wants to go in a tougher direction, when it comes to immigration, but also work with a Congress that has absolutely no incentive to get anything done in this area before the election?



Kevin McAleenan: Well, first, I believe you can be tough and compassionate at the same time. I'm gonna do what I've always done –give good law enforcement operational, and policy advice to lawmakers and to policy makers. And that's my intent. I think the ground has shifted in this discussion over the past month.

Sharyn Alfonsi: How so?

Kevin McAleenan: I think the numbers from March, I think more members from Congress coming down and seeing what we are facing at the border. They're realizing that something different is happening with this crisis. It's not manufactured it's real. And we've gotta sit down at a table and talk about ways to solve it.

Acting DHS Secretary Keven McAleenan with correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi

Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan says migrants are crossing the border in record numbers because they know they will be released in the U.S.

Kevin McAleenan: If you come now, and if you come as a family or as an unaccompanied child, you will be allowed to stay. You will be released. Because our court system is so backlogged, and our laws prevent effective repatriation, even if there's no right to stay in the U.S.--

Sharyn Alfonsi: They know, if they come--

Kevin McAleenan: --even if you don't have a valid asylum claim.

Sharyn Alfonsi: --they're gonna be led out the backdoor.

Kevin McAleenan: That's exactly right. And smugglers are advertising that directly in their hometowns.

There is no shortage of people fleeing poverty and crime who want to take the often dangerous trip. We rode with the U.S. Border Patrol deep in Southeast Texas. We saw family after family walking into the U.S. Agent Marcelino Medina asks the migrants if they're okay and points them to where they can turn themselves in to other agents. Further along this dusty stretch of road, he spots a family hiding in the bushes. He asks them if they're okay too, and points the way to where they need to go. Watch their faces when he tells them they are in the United States.



Sharyn Alfonsi: He didn't know where he was, did he?



Agent Marcelino Medina: No. He-- he asked-- how far to the U.S., right? So we were letting him know he's already here. So that's kind of what brought him to tears. He just-- he said he just wanted help.



Last month, a record number of families crossed the border, 53,000 people. Most with only what they could carry. The groups we saw all had children. This woman, eight months pregnant, told us she fled violence in Honduras. She'd been traveling for 15 days.



Sharyn Alfonsi:: You're trying to get her a ride?



Agent Marcelino Medina: I wanted to get her a ride, yeah, but she's-- they're gonna have to walk it.



There are no border agents available to help her. This 277-mile stretch along the Rio Grande River separates the U.S. from Mexico and is one of the busiest sections for illegal crossings. Agents told us they are overwhelmed caring for so many families.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Is this a typical day?



Agent Marcelino Medina: Definitely. You're talking about a sector where recently we've been seeing over 1,000 people a day, and this McAllen Station, the mc-- you can see there's some more coming down that way right now.



Sharyn Alfonsi: It never ends.

Agent Marcelino Medina: You know, it doesn't.

Agent Medina takes us into the brush to show us why so many families cross at this particular area of the border.

Sharyn Alfonsi: So once they get here, they're in U.S. territory. This is U.S. territory right here, and that there--



Agent Marcelino Medina: Correct, this is the-- that's the Mexican riverbank, this is the U.S. riverbank.



In some spots, it takes less than 15 minutes for a smuggler to paddle an inflatable raft full of migrants across. Typically they pay between $3,000 and $9,000 a person.



Agent Marcelino Medina: You gotta keep in mind that all these bo-- everybody that comes across, no matter adult, child, they're paying thousands of dollars.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Is it the cartel running this?



Agent Marcelino Medina: It's-- this-- this is exactly what-- what it is. This is one of their ways they can make money.



We watched as hundreds of migrants walked from the river bank, about three miles, to a levee to turn themselves into Border Patrol. It is orderly and oddly quiet, except for the sounds of the wind and babies crying.

From Honduras to the U.S. border — in a wheelchair





Sharyn Alfonsi: Tell me about your trip here.



Julio Cesar: Muy deficil.



Very difficult, Julio Cesar told us about his 1,600-mile trip from Honduras. Failed crops and threats of violence led him to escape with his daughter. He said his daughter has some sort of chest infection. He hopes he can get her help. As we were talking, his name was called to get on the bus.

This is the beginning of their immigration process. Because they've reached U.S. soil, they are legally allowed to apply for asylum and most will. But first, they are taken to the McAllen Border Patrol Station to be processed. We were allowed to film inside, a first for the facility. They wanted us to see how busy they are. It looked like any other jail except that there were mothers with children peering back at us through the glass. Men are kept separately. Background checks are run and fingerprints are taken. Court dates are scheduled.



Sharyn Alfonsi: How many people-- would you say are in here right now?



Agent Rudy Karisch: How many people would you say?



MALE VOICE: We have 551 subjects here.



Agent Rudy Karisch: Five hundred--



Chief Patrol Agent Rudy Karisch says they are struggling to care for the increasing numbers of families.

Sharyn Alfonsi: What are the agents having to do to deal with this new population that's coming across?



Agent Rudy Karisch: Forty percent of my workforce right now is dedicated to the processing, to the care and feeding, to the hospital watch. So that takes that 40 percent away from their border security mission.



Sharyn Alfonsi: I mean, they're making--



Agent Rudy Karisch: But it is--



Sharyn Alfonsi: --they're making formula. They are bringing juice.



Agent Rudy Karisch: --but it is a strain.



Sharyn Alfonsi: Well there's a pile a diapers right there.



Agent Rudy Karisch: Yeah. And-- that's what we have to do.



The flood of families comes nearly a year after the White House ended its ""zero tolerance"" policy that led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents. Kevin McAleenan was responsible for enforcing that policy as the head of Customs and Border Protection.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Did you have any regrets about the way that was carried out?



Kevin McAleenan: Yeah. I-- I-- I think-- when you lose the public trust in a law enforcement initiative, and you have to c-- recalibrate at the presidential level-- that means that wasn't successful.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Looking back on it, did it work?

Kevin McAleenan: So the-- the enforcement of the law against parents who violated our border laws and brought children with them-- was effective. But it didn't work in the sense that we lost the public trust in the implementation of that initiative. And I agreed with the president's decision to stop it.



President Trump has said he is ""not looking"" to restart family separations. But he has threatened to completely shut down the border.

President Trump Soundbite: In many cases, they put their worst people in the caravan, they're not gonna put their best in.

According to the DHS, since October, less than one percent of the migrants who crossed the border had any criminal history. The families we saw were travelling from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, an area of Central America referred to as the northern triangle.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Why so many people from this northern triangle of countries?

Kevin McAleenan: Right. There's poverty. There's drought that's affected the crop yields. Certainly, there are issues with food insecurity. In other parts of Central America, there are still violence issues and gang-control issues.

President Trump Soundbite: We stopped payment to Honduras, to Guatemala and to El Salvador. We were paying them tremendous amounts of money.

An estimated $700 million in aid a year aimed at preventing violence and curbing extreme poverty and hunger in those countries.



Sharyn Alfonsi: He said, ""We're not paying them anymore, because they haven't done a thing for us."" You've testified in Congress, ""We need to continue to support those areas."" Do you still believe that?



Kevin McAleenan: So I think the president's right, that we need to have aid that has targeted impact. It needs to support American interests. It needs to support economic development. And it needs to help reduce the causes of migration—everything from insecurity on the food side, to security, in terms of the cities and gang issues.



Sharyn Alfonsi: But wouldn't it just push more people to the border, if there's no aid coming in?



Kevin McAleenan: Well-- aid that's not being used effectively-- by an accountable partner isn't helping.

Sister Norma Pimental: We must address the root causes of why these families are coming. I don't think that if they had given a choice, they would come.

Sister Norma Pimental runs the Catholic Charities Respite Center in McAllen. The Border Patrol has no where to take the families after they are released from custody. Luckily, Sister Norma welcomes them all. They are free to go wherever they like but most stay here for a few days. They are exhausted from weeks of travel and hungry. Volunteers hand out donated clothes and meals.



Sharyn Alfonsi: How many meals are you doing a day in here?



Sister Norma Pimental: Well, thousands of meals. Because we may have, like, 300, 400, sometimes up to 600, you know, people we feeding on that day.



Sister Norma took Secretary McAleenan through the respite center. It is noisy and crowded, with more people wanting to come in. Sister Norma says she doesn't turn anyone away.



Sharyn Alfonsi: If you weren't here, where would all these people go?



Sister Norma Pimental: They would be in the streets, begging and asking for help and-- and exposed to so many people taking advantage of them. You know, it's-- it's so sad that people are suffering like they are.

From Sister Norma's, the families go to the bus station. For some, it was just three days ago they crossed the border. They tell us they are headed to places where they have family or cities where they offer free legal help. Catholic charities gives the migrants signs that say, ""Please help me. I don't speak english. What bus do I need to take?""



Sharyn Alfonsi: We saw the migrants leaving Catholic Charities, getting on a bus-- and going off to different parts of the United States.

Kevin McAleenan: Those families are-- are given a court hearing. They're-- they're given a date for a court hearing. And that court hearing could be two years out, five years out, for an initial hearing. That's how overloaded the s-- the system is at this point.

Sharyn Alfonsi: I think a lot of people are gonna be surprised to see that, to see--

Kevin McAleenan: I agree.

Sharyn Alfonsi: -- them get to the bus station. And I think there's that moment when they leave. And you're either gonna think, ""That's great,"" or, ""This is horrifying.""

Kevin McAleenan: Yeah. The reality of the system today is r-- is very hard to understand.

There is a border wall in McAllen. But it's not on the river. At some points, it is miles inland from where we saw the migrants come ashore. Secretary McAleenan says it does slow down drug traffickers and the migrants who are trying to evade capture.

Kevin McAleenan: We don't need it everywhere but we need it in several key places. And the support we're getting to build the additional wall is essential.

Secretary McAleenan is also lobbying Congress to change the law so DHS can detain families while they await a decision on their asylum claims.

Kevin McAleenan: We've asked Congress to modify that law, to allow us to detain families together, through a fair, transparent and expeditious court proceeding. And if they have an asylum claim or a valid right to stay, under our laws they would receive that certainty. And if not, they would be repatriated to their home country.

Keeping families longer would require more facilities. Potentially costing billions of dollars.



Sharyn Alfonsi: What about tent cities? Is that on the table?



Kevin McAleenan: Tent cities, I think, is-- is a misnomer. For-- for us, right now, we are looking at DHS, at putting up some soft-sided facilities. In fact--



Sharyn Alfonsi: Isn't that a tent? (LAUGH)



Kevin McAleenan: It-- it is-- sure, it could be-- it could be a tent. But I wanna explain the purpose for it. We just had a bipartisan r-- report, from the Homeland Security Advisory Council, that looked at the situation we're facing on the border, and said, ""You need additional facilities. You need to be able to take families and children out of a border patrol station,"" which is a police station. It's built for single adults, who have violated laws. And you need 'em in a better setting.



One day after our interview, we learned DHS had already broken ground on two tent cities in Texas to hold migrants for short-term processing. But concerns linger about whether the Department of Homeland Security should be in the business of holding families in any setting. Last year, despite efforts to treat them, two children died in DHS custody.



Sharyn Alfonsi: Are you worried that another child's gonna die in custody?



Kevin McAleenan: So what I know is our agents and officers are doing everything they possibly can to take care of vulnerable people in our custody. When you're looking at people arriving, sometimes, more than 4,000 in a day, so with that level of volume, with children that young-- with-- with the weather getting hotter, I'm very concerned we could have another tragedy.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Is it a humanitarian crisis? Or is it a national-security crisis?



Kevin McAleenan: It's absolutely both.

Veteran commits suicide outside VA hospital in Ohio,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'David Boroff']",04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/04/29/veteran-commits-suicide-outside-va-hospital-in-ohio/23719039/,"A military veteran took his own life outside the Cleveland VA Medical Center early Monday, according to officials.

The VA Northeast Ohio Health Care System said in a statement that “our deepest condolences go out to the loved ones affected by this death.”

The suicide comes after three veterans took their lives in a five-day span in Georgia and Texas earlier this month.

Gary Pressley, 29, was found in the parking lot of a Georgia facility with a gunshot wound on April 5. Olen Hancock, 68, shot himself near Atlanta and was pronounced dead the following day, and another veteran shot himself in a VA waiting room and died on April 9.

“Every one of these is a gut-wrenching experience for our 24,000 mental health providers and all of us that work for VA,” Richard Stone of the Veterans Health Administration said at the time.

More than 6,000 veterans committed suicide in 2016, according to a report from the Department of Veterans Affairs. VA officials said in January that suicide prevention is the organization’s “top clinical priority.” More than 2 million veterans sought and received help for mental health issues through the VA in 2017.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie said earlier this month that ways must be found to combat homelessness, drug abuse and mental illness among veterans.

“The sad thing that we confront every day is that of the 20 veteran suicides that occur across the country 14 of those veterans are outside of our department,” Wilkie said.

“What I’ve envisioned is the opening of the aperture to the states and localities to get them resources to find those veterans. One of the tragedies is that many of those veterans who take their lives come from my father’s era - Vietnam. So we have Americans whose problems in many cases began building when Lyndon Johnson was president. We have to tackle this issue in a way that we haven’t tackled it before.”

Homeland Security Collected Intel on Arizona Family Separation Protests,https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com,"[""Meg O'Connor""]",04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/homeland-security-intelligence-arizona-family-separation-protests-11278067,"If you used Facebook to RSVP to one of 11 family separation protests across the state of Arizona last June, odds are your Facebook friends aren't the only ones who took note.

On Monday, The Intercept reported that a private intelligence company monitored social media ahead of nationwide protests against the Trump administration's family separation policy and shared that information with the Department of Homeland Security.

Documents obtained by The Intercept show the firm, LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, put together a list of more than 600 demonstrations across the country. Eleven of those protests took place in Arizona, in cities including Phoenix, Tucson, Nogales, and Flagstaff.

It appears LookingGlass used Facebook to gather information on protest times, locations, and attendance, then shared that information with DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, who in turn disseminated it to staff and members of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (A DHS official told The Intercept that LookingGlass's information was ""unsolicited."")

""I think it's frustrating, it's frightening, but it's not really surprising coming from this president and his administration,"" said Jalakoi Solomon, Arizona state director for NextGen America, a progressive advocacy organization that participated in the protests. ""We've seen this administration abuse its power time and time again. They've manufactured a crisis at the border; this is just another example.""

As NBC News reported in March, federal agencies created a database to track journalists and activists who had some connection to the migrant caravan. Documents obtained by NBC from the Department of Homeland Security show agents from ICE, DHS, Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Border Control, and the FBI all used the database, which listed 10 journalists, an attorney, and 48 others who were listed as organizers, instigators, or ""unknown."" Some of the individuals on the list were arrested, interviewed, or had visas revoked, NBC reported.

More locally, Phoenix New Times reported in March that the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center monitored responses to a controversial tweet about Colin Kaepernick shared by Arizona Department of Public Safety Director Frank Milstead.

I’m often amazed, but really surprised. I won’t mention your name, I refuse. If you’re in search of those who paid the Ultimate Sacrifice I would look to the men and women who wear a uniform and are killed/murdered keeping us safe & protecting those who can’t protect themselves. pic.twitter.com/fD5kYhMhmq — Col. Frank Milstead (@frank_milstead) September 6, 2018

The center examined replies to Milstead's tweet: a criminal intelligence analyst took screenshots of the replies and the images were shared with DPS employees via email.

Some of the Arizona protests noted in the LookingGlass list took place outside churches, city halls, child detention sites, and government buildings. Nearly 800 people attended the Phoenix demonstration against Trump's family separation policy, which took place outside the Arizona Senate building.

The rallies in Arizona followed Trump's announcement of a ""zero-tolerance"" policy separating children who crossed the border from the parents or guardians they crossed with, and jailing them separately.

More than 3,000 children were separated from their families under the Trump administration's family separation policy. The policy did not include a plan to reunite separated families; the true number of separated children is unknown due to poor record keeping. Federal officials have said it could take up to two years to reunite the imprisoned children with their families. Meanwhile, thousands of immigrant children have said they were sexually abused in U.S. detention centers, according to a February report from the Justice Department.

""I think it's really concerning,"" said Solomon from NextGen when asked about the list of protests acquired by DHS. ""It's pretty clear to see what they're trying to do: intimidate opponents who raise their voice and push back against this hateful ideology."""

WASHINGTON, April 30, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Microsoft Corp. announced a new collaboration to enhance opportunities for education, recreation and therapy for Veterans with mobility limitations by introducing the Xbox Adaptive Controller — a video game controller designed for people with limited mobility — in select VA rehabilitation centers around the country.

Microsoft company logo. (PRNewsFoto/Microsoft Corp.) (PRNewsfoto/Microsoft Corp.) More

The partnership, which was formalized April 18, will provide controllers and services to Veterans as part of therapeutic and rehabilitative activities aimed at challenging muscle activation and hand-eye coordination, and greater participation in social and recreational activities.

""This partnership is another step toward achieving VA's strategic goals of providing excellent customer experiences and business transformation,"" said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. ""VA remains committed to offering solutions for Veterans' daily life challenges.""

Together, VA and Microsoft identified an opportunity to introduce or reintroduce gaming to Veterans with spinal cord injuries, amputations, and neurological or other injuries at 22 VA medical centers across the United States. Microsoft is donating its Xbox Adaptive Controller, game consoles, games and other adaptive gaming equipment as part of the collaboration.

Designated VA staff will engage with Veterans using the equipment and share feedback with Microsoft on therapeutic utility and the Veteran experience.

""We owe so much to the service and sacrifice of our Veterans, and as a company, we are committed to supporting them,"" said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. ""Our Xbox Adaptive Controller was designed to make gaming more accessible to millions of people worldwide, and we're partnering with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to bring the device to Veterans with limited mobility, connecting them to the games they love and the people they want to play with.""

Microsoft and VA have a long-standing strategic partnership, working together for more than 20 years to provide the best possible care and service to Veterans. Gaming is a popular pastime of military personnel, and access to the Xbox Adaptive Controller in VA rehabilitation centers provides the opportunity for Veterans to experience gaming's various benefits, including staying connected with friends and family across the world, building esprit de corps through competitive or cooperative gameplay, and providing stress relief.

Microsoft's initial contributions will be allocated across 22 VA facilities. In addition, the controllers and other equipment will be available for Veterans to use at events hosted by VA's Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events, such as the National Veterans Wheelchair Games.

The following 16 centers have confirmed participation to date, with at least six additional centers to come: Augusta VA Medical Center (VAMC), Central Alabama VA Health Care System (HCS), Central Texas Veterans HCS, Chillicothe VAMC, Dayton VAMC, Memphis VAMC, Minneapolis VA HCS, Richmond VAMC, VA St. Louis HCS, South Texas Veterans HCS (Audie L.

Department of Energy’s $2B cloud migration moves forward,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Dave Nyczepir'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.fedscoop.com/department-energy-2-billion-cboss-cloud-migration/,"Written by Dave Nyczepir

The Department of Energy awarded Accenture a contract valued at $2 billion to handle next steps in the agency’s cloud migration.

Known as the CIO Business Operations Support Services, or CBOSS, contract, the five-year blanket purchase order agreement also covers cybersecurity and customer-centric solutions.

DOE is in the “early stage” of its cloud migration, having moved applications and storage from one of its legacy data centers over in 2018 with plans to do so with two more by 2020, said Jake Brody, managing director and DOE client account lead at Accenture.

“The mission of DOE is so varied and diverse from core IT services to the National Nuclear Security Administration, to labs, to science offices,” Brody said. “All of those missions require that cybersecurity is embedded at the start.”

That DOE is making cloud-based services available to the entire department gives agencies more choice, Brody added.

Three months ago, Accenture Federal Services expanded its Washington, D.C.-based Federal Digital Studio with data scientists and other experts to improve its rapid prototyping capabilities. The studio focuses on human-centered design and accelerated IT modernization.

AFS formed a contractor teaming arrangement with Unisys, General Dynamics Information Technology and Red River to deliver on the contract. Red River is heading up hardware and software purchasing.

CBOSS was awarded to Accenture in October, but competitor ActioNet protested the decision in December on the grounds quotes were “unreasonably evaluated.” The Government Accountability Office denied the protest in March finding Accenture gave a “technically superior” quote and calling ActioNet’s pricing advantage “illusory” because its quote was “unrealistically low.”

DOE did not respond to a request for comment by publication.

“We’re going to have to move at the pace at which the program can move,” Brody said, when asked if Accenture planned to speed up its timeline after the delay. “And that’s a joint decision we will make with the government.”"

The message, which urged the voluntary departure of all U.S. citizens from the country, also ordered that all school-age family members of U.S. government employees leave Sri Lanka.

""Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, hospitals, and other public areas,"" the State Department said on its website.

The guidance came the same day a Sri Lankan raid on a suspected militant hideout killed at least 15 people.

The raid on the country’s eastern coast followed a shootout nearby, after which authorities found explosives, detonators, “suicide kits,” military uniforms and ISIS flags.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, though local extremist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) has been blamed for Sunday's bombings.

Catholic leaders on Friday morning also announced that Sunday Masses across Sri Lanka would be canceled indefinitely as the country grapples with the ongoing security threat.

Despite reports that it won't be approved, the chief of the Department of Justice antitrust division said he has yet to come to a decision on Sprint and T-Mobile's planned merger.

""I have not made up my mind,"" Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice antitrust division, told CNBC's David Faber during a ""Squawk on the Street "" interview Monday from the Milken Institute Global conference in Beverly Hills, California.

The Wall Street Journal earlier in April reported the $26 billion planned merger is unlikely to be approved in its current structure, citing people familiar with the matter. The report casts doubt on the fate of the mega-deal. The most immediate hurdle, according to the Journal, came from Delrahim's antitrust division, which is reportedly considering whether a deal would present an ""unacceptable threat to competition.""

Shares of Sprint fell as much as 12% after that Journal report, while T-Mobile dropped by 4%. Sprint shares were slightly positive after Monday's CNBC interview, while T-Mobile's stock was down more than 2%.

Delrahim said his department does have an eye on price competition and the potential for more consolidation in the industry to raise bills for the average consumer. The DOJ is looking into ""coordinated effects,"" meaning companies would not compete on prices anymore if it's no longer in their best interest.

""Those are the factors, and there are strict guidelines that we follow, based on case law handed to us; we are continuing to investigate that,"" he said. ""My job is to make sure the analysis is done properly and make sure the facts are there.""

The $26 billion deal would combine the third- and fourth-largest wireless providers in the U.S., a market with only two other participants: AT&T and Verizon. Sprint and T-Mobile have argued that the merger is necessary to compete with the two larger carriers, and would provide greater access to 5G. T-Mobile CEO John Legere defended the deal before Congress in February, arguing that the deal would create jobs and lower prices.

""With 5G and other technologies, you're going to be able to use that phone for more than just communicating with your best friend or texting,"" DOJ's Delrahim said. ""You're getting your media, you're getting video — we want to be sure to encourage that, but ultimately, is there going to be a price effect when those two combine?""

While more players in any market typically means more competition, Delrahim said there was no ideal number for the total amount of wireless companies.

""There is no magical number — it's what the facts and the economic evidence shows us,"" Delrahim said.

SANTA TERESA - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has issued waivers of environmental and other laws, expediting the construction of ""new bollard wall"" in New Mexico and Arizona.

The barriers are needed to help ""impede and deny illegal border crossings and the drug and human smuggling activities of transnational criminal organizations,"" according to a statement released Friday by Homeland Security.

The construction projects cover 53 miles, with most of the wall going up in New Mexico in Doña Ana and Luna counties. The new bollard wall would replace ""dilapidated and outdated designs, in addition to road construction and improvement and lighting installation,"" according to Homeland Security.

The new section of bollard wall will extend the existing structure 20 miles west of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry through the rest of Doña Ana County into Luna County and about four miles west past the Columbus Port of Entry.

The waivers published in the Federal Register on Wednesday clear the way for construction because the Department of Homeland Security does not have to comply with laws involving public lands, water and wildlife.

""It is going help maintain a secure border. It is going to establish the operational control that the president has mandated,"" El Paso Border Patrol Sector Chief Aaron Hull said when construction was officially announced. (Photo: RUBEN R.

""The waiving of these laws sends a clear message to our border communities that our rights and our voices do not matter,"" said Amanda Munro, field organizer for the Southwest Environmental Center.

The Las Cruces-based conservation organization said the waivers cover 27 laws ranging from those affecting endangered species to archaeological and historic preservation.

""These laws are intended to protect people from bad decisions that will negatively impact their environment, health and history, and yet we border residents are deemed unworthy of even the right to give our opinion on the construction happening in our own backyards,"" Munro said.

The Southwest Environmental Center is among 22 organizations that sent a letter Thursday asking Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost for a 30-day extension to the comment period in Doña Ana and Luna counties.

The letter points out that CBP issued a $789 million construction contract for the New Mexico project one day after the comment period began.

Others who submitted the letter include the Indivisible Tohono, a border tribal organization; the National Parks Conservation Association; and the Center for Biological Diversity.

""This wall will destroy New Mexico's incredible public lands and hurt the local economy, which relies on the outdoor industry. And it could deal a death blow to Mexican gray wolves in the U.S.,"" said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity.

But some New Mexico farmers and ranchers on the border support building a wall in New Mexico and want it done quickly.

""We're pleased that the government recognizes the urgency of the situation,"" said Caren Cowan, executive director of New Mexico Cattle Growers and Wool Growers associations.

Cowan said she is not concerned about the waivers being used to expedite the building of the wall. ""Our members deserve protection, and this is a step in that right direction, and we greatly appreciate it,"" she said.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to approve the $5.7 billion he wanted to pay for his promised border wall. The president is diverting up to $1 billion in Department of Defense funds to add barriers in New Mexico and Arizona.

""It's bad enough that Trump's bulldozing the borderlands for a senseless wall, but now he's stealing money from the military to do it,"" Jordahl said.

Construction on the wall in New Mexico is expected to begin next month, despite multiple lawsuits.

""The only thing permanent about Trump's wall will be the destruction to wildlife and wild places,"" Jordahl said. ""It will do nothing to stop asylum seekers or illegal drug smugglers. Waiving these laws is an affront to borderland communities, and we'll continue to challenge this in court.""

Kingston Awaits EPA Tests On Potential Public Health Risk From PFAS,https://www.nhpr.org,['Annie Ropeik'],,,,https://www.nhpr.org/post/kingston-awaits-epa-tests-potential-public-health-risk-pfas,"Officials in Kingston say they’ll wait for more data before taking action on potential water contamination around a long-dormant Superfund site.

The Ottati and Goss Superfund site, off Route 125 near the Newton town line, is surrounded by campgrounds, homes, businesses and a popular swimming and fishing area, Country Pond.

Between the 1950s and 1980s, the site housed a business that cleaned chemicals out of steel drums and sold the drums for reuse.

That process contaminated soil, sediment, groundwater and surface water at the site with a range of chemicals, including cyanide, pesticides and PCBs. Cleanup for the initial contaminants was extensive and ended years ago.

But in the past few years, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun testing Superfund sites for PFAS chemicals.

These industrial chemicals, used for decades in a plethora of consumer goods and commonly-used firefighting foams, have been linked to serious health effects, including some cancers.

In late 2018, during a routine review, the EPA says the chemicals turned up in monitoring wells at the Kingston site at levels up to 5,600 parts per trillion.

The state groundwater cleanup standard for PFAS is 70 parts per trillion. Some federal research suggests the chemicals may pose health risks at even lower levels.

At a selectmen’s meeting with a few concerned neighbors Monday night, EPA project manager Jim Brown said the contamination in the monitoring wells is “undeniably” coming from the Superfund site.

He also said the contaminated groundwater generally appears to be flowing in the direction of Country Pond, the swimming and fishing area. But he says, over the years of monitoring, the EPA has not found that other contaminants migrated from the site into drinking water wells.

However, the contamination that existed at the site before remediation did appear to migrate into Country Pond. The EPA's original 1987 Record of Decision for the site, dictating the terms and method of clean-up, says pollution in the 1970s appeared to lead to ""fish kills in Country Pond, dying vegetation along [adjacent] South Brook, and skin irritation of swimmers in Country Pond.”

Brown says the EPA doesn’t yet have the data to confirm whether PFAS from the site poses a public health risk, and he appeared to downplay the high levels of PFAS that were found.

“The PFAS levels that we’re talking about, in the PFAS world, are high,” Brown said. “But [5,000 parts per trillion] is 5 parts per billion. For most of our contaminants of concern at this site, 5 parts per billion is the goal.”

In the coming weeks, he says, state and federal officials will test adjacent drinking water wells – and surface waters in and near the swimming pond – to see if the PFAS does pose a threat. Results of those tests will be out in late May or early June.

“Depending on the results that we get back in June, we might have to expand the sampling effort to an even bigger area,” Brown said.

Brown called Country Pond a “bonafide swimming exposure scenario” and said the EPA would notify the town immediately if any “significant” contamination is found in the upcoming tests.

Selectmen say they’ll wait on that notification or for final test results before considering any new restrictions on swimming or fishing at the pond.

And state officials said they will immediately provide bottled water if any residents are found to have unsafe levels of PFAS in their drinking water wells.

The EPA is due to transfer control of the aging Superfund site to the state this fall. The businesses that contaminated the site settled their liabilities there years ago, and the state also now owns the property.

The town of Kingston declined to buy the site years ago – out of concern, selectmen said Monday, that new contamination would someday turn up.

“It just seems like what was a great success story seems to be a never-ending saga that we’re going to have to deal with,” said selectman Kevin St. James at Monday’s meeting.

Brown, with the EPA, said the site could still end up a “success story.”

He added that this is the first Superfund site he knows of where PFAS contamination has emerged in the midst of a transfer process to the state."
"64% oppose Trump's move to build a wall; On asylum, just 30% support stricter rules",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/64-oppose-trumps-move-build-wall-asylum-30/story?id=62702683,"Americans by nearly 2 to 1 oppose Donald Trump’s attempts to build a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border and just three in 10 in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll support making it harder for undocumented immigrants to request asylum protection in the United States.

Interested in Immigration? Add Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

Sixty-four percent oppose Trump declaring a national emergency in order to build a wall without congressional approval, while 34% back him. That includes 55% who “strongly” disapprove, vs. 28% who strongly support.

See PDF for full results, charts and tables.

Just 30%, moreover, favor making it harder for undocumented immigrants to seek asylum, as Trump has proposed. Essentially as many, 27%, would make it easier, while 34% favor leaving the law as it is now.

Majority opposition to Trump’s policies stands even as a sense of the seriousness of the situation has risen. Thirty-five percent now see a crisis, up from 24% in January. That said, 64% still don’t ascribe to the president’s claim of a border crisis.

Overall, 57% in the poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, disapprove of how Trump is handling immigration, with 39% approving. (This matches Trump’s overall job approval rating.) Disapproval has eased a bit, from 62 percent when last tested in September 2017.

In a comparatively better result for Trump, the public divides about evenly on who’s mainly to blame for the border situation. Thirty-five percent chiefly blame the Democrats in Congress and 32% chiefly blame Trump, with an additional 27% blaming neither or both.

Groups

Views of the border situation as a crisis have risen across groups, but most steeply among Democrats, up 17 percentage points from 7% in January to 24% now. It’s up similarly, by 16 points, among Hispanics, from 20% in January to 36% now.

Seeing a crisis peaks among very conservative Americans, 62%; Republicans, 56%; rural residents, 54%; and evangelical white Protestants, 52%.

Other opinions likewise are sharply partisan. But even among Republicans, just fewer than half, 46%, favor making it harder for undocumented immigrants to request asylum. Support for the idea is highest, 54%, among strong conservatives. That falls to a third of independents, a quarter of moderates and about one in seven Democrats and liberals alike.

Assignment of blame, for its part, may be a concern for Trump and his party looking ahead to the 2020 election. Whites blame the Democrats in Congress over the president for the immigration situation by a broad 43-23%. But nonwhites, a growing share of the population, see it quite differently. Blacks blame Trump over the congressional Democrats by 57-14%; Hispanics do so by 50-19%.

Further, whites only divide on Trump’s handling of immigration overall, 49-47%, approve-disapprove. Seventy-four percent of Hispanics, as well as 87% of blacks, disapprove.

Methodology

This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone April 22-25, 2019, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 29-26-36%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

DOD needs technical support for office in charge of $8B DEOS,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.fedscoop.com/deos-technical-engineering-support-contract-disa-sd3/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

The Pentagon office in charge of the military’s unified communication tools is looking to re-up a contract for technical and engineering support ahead of a big move to the cloud.

The Defense Information Systems Agency’s Enterprise Services Division issued a sources sought announcement last week for independent technical expertise to support its portfolio of classified and unclassified communication and collaboration tools, both on-premises and in the cloud.

“The contractor shall be a demonstrated expert on both traditional IT infrastructure as well as on Cloud Computing, with expert knowledge of DoD enterprise policies, guidance, and directives for emerging technologies and Unified Capability specific needs within the DoD enterprise,” the announcement says.

The Enterprise Services Division, referred to as SD3, manages the Department of Defense’s enterprisewide efforts around global video communications, collaboration services and, most recently, the acquisition of next-generation collaboration and communication tools as part of the $8 billion Defense Enterprise Office Solution (DEOS) cloud contract. The General Services Administration is leading the DEOS acquisition of cloud-based communication tools on DOD’s behalf through its IT Schedule 70 contract. GSA has yet to issue the final request for proposals for the contract but is expected to do so soon.

The announcement stresses the need for a contractor with expertise in cloud computing, particularly as the Pentagon anticipates launching DEOS sometime in the next year.

“Throughout the duration of this contract, it is anticipated that the Government will acquire cloud-based technologies elsewhere within the SD3 portfolio that will be supported by this contract,” it says. “As such, the SD3 Engineering Support contractor may be required to establish formal or informal business relationships with various cloud OEMs in order to have reach back capability and technical expertise.”

The proposed contract will have a five-year base period of performance. It is a follow-on to a previous contract awarded to Booz Allen Hamilton. Those interested have until May 17 to issue a response to DISA."

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was 1.33% higher at around 2.5355, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at around 2.9519.

Consumer spending rose 0.9% overall and 0.7% when adjusted for inflation, driven by a jump in expenditures on motor vehicles and health care. Meanwhile, the core personal consumption expenditures was flat for the month and up 1.6% year over year, and the headline number rose 0.2% for a 1.5% increase over the year.

Market participants eagerly await a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the publication of Chinese factory data for further clues on policy direction in the world's largest economies.

It comes after the U.S. reported stronger-than-anticipated growth over the first three months of the year. Official data showed gross domestic product (GDP) stood at an annualized rate of 3.2% in the first quarter, beating analyst expectations.

"China able to grab ‘entire digital identity’ of Western citizens, State Department says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/china-able-to-grab-entire-digital-identity-of-western-citizens-state-department-says,"Chinese surveillance tactics “pose an existential threat"" to the nations of the Western Hemisphere, a senior State Department official warned Friday.

“Citizens living in democracies in the Western Hemisphere could potentially have their entire digital identity under the control and surveillance of an authoritarian government,” Kimberly Breier, the State Department’s top diplomat for the region, told the Council of the Americas.

Breier was chiefly addressing Latin America, with a focus on how China distributes surveillance technology and wireless internet services that leave Westerners exposed to Beijing’s prying eyes. China has been selling its high-tech authoritarianism to dictators such as Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, and even countries friendlier to the United States have been opening their telecommunications networks to Chinese tech companies.

FBI Director Christopher Wray, speaking separately at the Council on Foreign Relations, emphasized the same day that the Communist power is targeting the United States as aggressively as any regional neighbor.

“China has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation any way it can, from a wide array of businesses, universities, and organizations,” Wray said. “They’re doing this through Chinese intelligence services, through state-owned enterprises, through ostensibly private companies, through graduate students and researchers, and through a variety of actors working on behalf of China.”

Breier and Wray made their warnings as China is trying to allay international worries about the Belt and Road Initiative, an overseas investment plan that U.S. officials regard as a “predatory” lending scheme to purchase influence over impoverished nations. China is hosting an international summit in Beijing on Friday, convening Russia and other partner nations to tout the initiative.

“Naturally, it is important for China to successfully promote this large-scale project,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in advance of Friday’s second Belt and Road Forum. ""And all Eurasian states should stand to gain from participation in it.”

Breier countered that China uses “bags of cash” to induce corrupt government officials to strike agreements that harm their countries. Those deals threaten long-term consequences beyond financial trouble. She stressed that the Chinese companies pioneering the next generation of wireless technology are under the thumb of Chinese spy agencies, meaning that partnerships with the tech giants could “have a generational impact on national security, on our economies, and on our societies.”

And she raised similar worries about simpler surveillance technologies, such as the security cameras that some Latin American governments have purchased from the Communist power, which has built a high-tech surveillance state to control its own population.

Governments, she said, ""need to rethink whether they want Chinese firms and indeed the Chinese government to replicate some of those same practices and, in so doing, erode protection of human rights in the hemisphere and cede national sovereignty."""
Ron Chernow delivers a history of presidents and the press — and takes down Trump at correspondents’ dinner.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Gillian Brockell', 'Staff Writer For Retropolis']",04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/04/28/museum-presidential-decorum-chernow-touts-presidents-respect-press-correspondents-dinner/,"If President Trump was hoping he would be roasted less at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner because comedians had been axed from the program, well, he may need to delete the recording from his TiVo without watching it.

Historian Ron Chernow, whose book on Alexander Hamilton became the basis of a musical you may have seen, was the keynote speaker, and he dinged the president over and over in his 28-minute speech, referring to the Trump administration as “a topsy-turvy moment” and a “surreal interlude in American life.”

[Ron Chernow is a historian. Now he’s taking a comedian’s job. Huh?]

Chernow opened with a yarn from George Washington’s first term, during which the founding father was relentlessly pounded by an opposition press, which even “charged that he’d been a secret British agent throughout the Revolutionary War.”

“Obviously, the British had gotten a very poor return on their investment,” he quipped.

At one point, a State Department official named Philip Freneau — who, under a pseudonym, was running a newspaper that repeatedly and mercilessly attacked Washington — printed a cartoon showing Washington being beheaded “a la Louis XVI,” Chernow said.

“But despite this extreme provocation, Washington always honored the First Amendment,” he said. Like every future president, Washington felt maligned and misunderstood by the press. But he never generalized that into a vendetta against the institution.”

Chernow then zipped through what he called “a museum of presidential decorum,” recounting other presidents’ relationships with the press.

“Our best presidents have handled the press with wit, grace, charm, candor and even humor,” he said.

Here are some highlights:

Teddy Roosevelt: The Bull Moose had a “natural affinity” for the press, Chernow said.

Roosevelt “devised a midday ritual called ‘the barber’s hour’ in which reporters would cluster around him as he was being shaved. The babbling president would spout a never-ending stream of opinion while his poor barber, bobbing and weaving with his razor, gamely tried to shave [him] without slitting the presidential throat.”

Calvin Coolidge: Coolidge started the first regularly scheduled news conferences, Chernow said.

“Reporters had to submit their questions in advance, and ‘Silent Cal’ sat stiffly behind his desk, working his way through a tiny stack of index cards.”

Franklin D. Roosevelt: FDR treated reporters “like grown-ups,” Chernow said. He got rid of written questions and held more than a thousand news conferences and 30 “fireside chats” in his 12 years as commander in chief.

“Even [first lady] Eleanor Roosevelt held her own news conferences, where she invited only female reporters,” Chernow said. “This proved a tremendous boon to women journalists across the country, because even the most hidebound publishers realized they were now forced to hire women journalists.”

John F. Kennedy: Chernow noted Kennedy’s charm and self-deprecating sense of humor. In January of 1961, Kennedy held the first televised news conference, and 60 million people tuned in, “a record only eclipsed by the 70 million who watched the Beatles debut on ‘The Ed Sullivan Show’ three years later in 1964.”

Ronald Reagan: Reagan had been scheduled to attend the 1981 White House correspondents’ dinner, Chernow said, but had to cancel after he was shot on March 28, 1981. So he called into the dinner instead, joking to the audience: “If I could give you just one little bit of advice, when someone tells you to get into a car quick, do it.”

“That was a touch of class that has been sorely missing in our political culture in recent years,” Chernow said. “It was a subtle reminder that, whether Republicans or Democrats, we are all bona fide members of Team USA and not members of enemy camps.”

From the audience, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the one of the myriad House committees investigating Trump, applauded.

[Video: Ron Chernow's entire White House correspondents’ dinner speech]

It wasn’t all nostalgia and reminiscences, however. Chernow also recounted President Richard M. Nixon’s frosty relationship with the media. In 1971, Nixon followed his press secretary’s advice and attended the White House correspondents’ dinner, Chernow said.

“After his next press conference,” Chernow said, “Nixon grumbled privately, ‘The reporters were considerably more bad-mannered and vicious than usual. This bears out my theory that treating them with considerably more contempt is a more productive policy.’”

"Feds Surveilled South Florida Immigration Protests in 2018, Report Says",https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Jerry Iannelli'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/homeland-security-monitored-miami-immigration-protest-intercept-reports-11159935,"June 30 of last year, activists in more than 600 cities planned demonstrations against President Donald Trump's policy of separating children and parents who'd arrived at the U.S. border seeking asylum. According to public records obtained today by the Intercept, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security monitored those protesters as if they were security threats.

Emails obtained by the news outlet show that a private contractor working with DHS, LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, monitored numerous locations in South Florida — including protests in Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Hollywood, and Miami-Dade College's Wolfson Campus in downtown Miami. (The list includes locations in virtually every other major city in America as well.) Ultimately, LookingGlass advised DHS to closely monitor a few specific demonstrations, including one at a high school in Sebring, just north of Lake Okeechobee.

“LookingGlass has compiled a spreadsheet for State Fusion Centers detailing over 600 planned ‘Family Separation Day Protests’ across the US on June 30,” one email to DHS states. “These originated from Cyber Threat Center (CTC) and are broken out by City and State; they provide physical location and the Facebook event ID.”

In response, LookingGlass declined to speak to the Intercept, and DHS claimed the list provided by the company was ""unsolicited.""

The news is just the latest in a series of revelations showing how the federal government has been monitoring activists and journalists critical of U.S. immigration policy. In March, NBC San Diego obtained a cache of documents showing the federal government monitored activists, reporters, and social media influencers who were tied to or covering the movements of a migrant caravan approaching the U.S.-Mexico border. In some cases, the government placed alerts on the passports of journalists and U.S. citizens who were reporting critically on the government.

The station reported:



One photojournalist said she was pulled into secondary inspections three times and asked questions about who she saw and photographed in Tijuana shelters. Another photojournalist said she spent 13 hours detained by Mexican authorities when she tried to cross the border into Mexico City. Eventually, she was denied entry into Mexico and sent back to the U.S.

The El Paso Police Department recently issued an arrest warrant for Miami artist Alexandra Mondolfi after her protest group placed stickers honoring people killed by border agents at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum in Texas.

Videos show Miami's family-separation protest in June 2018 was well attended. The Miami Herald posted footage of hundreds of people blocking traffic by marching on Biscayne Boulevard. At the time, at least 2,300 children had been separated from their parents at the U.S. border in an all-but-certain violation of international law:

Actor Lin-Manuel Miranda led the main Families Belong Together protest in Washington, D.C., that day. Most of the Miami protest was led by Marleine Bastien, who heads the Family Action Network Movement, a group that fights for the rights of immigrants in Miami, especially those in the Haitian community.

""They are not criminals!"" Bastien was filmed shouting into a megaphone in front of Miami's Freedom Tower, a former immigration building that for decades was a gateway for Cuban refugees to enter America."

(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

The main lobby of the State Department throbbed with music Friday. “Happy” by Pharrell boomed out of a loudspeaker on the wall of the cavernous space where coveys of suited diplomats scurry past rows of national flags, followed by the voice of Bruno Mars singing “Uptown Funk.”

Then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made his way through a small throng of employees and scaled a stairway to a lectern near a giant placard hanging from a wall covered by a blue cloth awaiting a theatrical reveal. It was an unusual event, marking Pompeo’s first anniversary at the agency, and seemed to reflect his vision of leadership instilled in him at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in N.Y.

But the splashy atmosphere surrounding the unveiling of Pompeo’s new “Professional Ethos” was more dramatic than the ethos itself, a nine-sentence statement that begins, “I am a champion of American diplomacy.”

[On the road to swagger: A year defending Trump’s worldview]

Many of the concepts in the ethos are already embedded in the State Department’s official mission statement, common human resources values or just the Golden Rule — professionalism, accountability, honesty and respect. Pompeo said they had been working on it since last fall, and the final product was preceded by more than 30 drafts.

“Never forget who it is that we work for,” he said, explaining what it means to protect the American people. “Their interests, not ours. Not yours.”

“It’s about disagreeing without being uncivil,” he said of professionalism.

Respect is about showing “unfailing respect for each other,” he said. “Simply because we are all human beings created by God.”

Pompeo acknowledged some of the people listening were probably wondering whether anything would change because of the short ethos statement.

“I think by highlighting the principles in this ethos, we can encourage each other and hold each responsible to these standards and take it to a new level,” he said.

He announced a new Ethos Award would be handed out later this year to the State Department employee who best incorporates the values. But it is impossible to know how many employees actually heard his remarks. The lobby was less than half full, but most would have listened on a closed circuit channel broadcast in the building.

After finishing his 15-minute speech, Pompeo lingered to shake hands with employees and pose for photos and selfies taken by some of the 75 members of the newest class of fledgling diplomats to complete classes at the Foreign Service Institute."

But Mills isn’t new to the White House beat. He has photographed six presidents over the course of three decades, going back to Ronald Reagan. Along the way, he has earned the trust of his subjects (he was a regular at President George H.W. Bush’s horseshoe games) and captured many memorable images—like those featured below. Covering the White House can be stifling, but Mills has pushed the limits of his environments, negotiating for better access and creative ways to frame his shots. His dedication to the White House beat has made him a witness to history, too, as when he photographed the moment that President George W. Bush learned about the 9/11 attacks.

Department of Labor appeals ruling against 'Trumpcare' plans,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/department-of-labor-appeals-ruling-against-trumpcare-plans,"The Department of Labor on Friday filed notice that it will appeal a ruling by a federal judge that struck down a Trump administration rule letting individuals and small businesses pool together to buy health insurance.

The decision on March 28 by U.S. District Judge John Bates, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, threatens a program the Trump administration created for customers to use as an escape hatch from high Obamacare premiums.

The administration will be appealing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The notice filed by the Department of Labor did not say whether the Trump administration is asking for a stay on the decision, meaning that people may be left in the lurch regarding their health insurance coverage. Bates in his opinion asked the Department of Labor to state whether any part of the rule could still stand.

In his ruling, Bates concluded that the Trump administration's rules were ""clearly an end-run around"" Obamacare and agreed with the 11 states and District of Columbia that had challenged the rules, saying they also violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA.

The health insurance alternatives are known ""association health plans,"" and they let people who are self-employed or who are in small businesses act as a large business for the purpose of buying medical coverage.

Obamacare had ended the plans to encourage more people to go into its exchanges and also because past plans had become insolvent, leaving people holding the bag for costly medical expenses.

But the Trump administration had tried to reinstate them through rulemaking, and they are already up and running in many states: Health insurers have been allowed to run the plans since September 2018, and association-created coverage was only allowed beginning in January 2019. New associations that form were supposed to kick off in April.

At least one state — Vermont — has asked for the plans to be halted entirely as the case is litigated. States are otherwise allowed to put their own restrictions on association health plans.

Association health plans have been covering the same benefits that Obamacare plans do, even though they are not obligated to, according to analyses by the industry publication Modern Healthcare and another by AssociationHealthPlans.com.

But critics have warned that it is too early to conclude these benefits would remain. Unlike Obamacare, the plans are allowed to charge people more based on their health status, and prices could increase for next year. People who have pre-existing conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, can be asked to pay higher premiums that lead them to be priced out of the plans entirely."
"House committees launch probe into DHS shakeup, as White House blocks Miller testimony",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-committees-launch-probe-into-dhs-shakeup-after-miller-declines-invitation-to-testify,"Democrats on several top House committees launched an investigation Thursday into the massive shakeup in leadership at the Department of Homeland Security due to allegations that President Trump removed top officials for refusing to carry out his desired immigration policies.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md.; Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.; and Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie Thompson sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Thursday seeking documents related to recent immigration-related actions by the president and White House aide Stephen Miller ""to remove senior leaders throughout DHS who reportedly refused orders to violate the law.""

WHITE HOUSE DECLINES CUMMINGS' INVITATION FOR STEPHEN MILLER TO TESTIFY ON TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES

The request comes amid a staffing shake-up at the agency which began earlier this month with the resignation of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

“We are deeply concerned that the firing and forced resignation of these officials puts the security of the American people at risk,” they wrote. “We are also concerned that the President may have removed DHS officials because they refused his demands to violate federal immigration law and judicial orders.”

They added: “Moreover, we are concerned by reports that, even as he has removed the Department’s leadership, the President has sought to empower a White House aide, Stephen Miller, to ‘be in charge of handling all immigration and border affairs.’”

The letter was sent to DHS just hours after White House Counsel Pat Cipollone notified the House Oversight Committee that Miller would decline Cummings’ invitation to testify before the panel, and instead, offered cabinet secretaries and other agency officials to appear instead.

“In accordance with long-standing precedent, we respectfully decline the invitation to make Mr. Miller available for testimony before the Committee,” he wrote. “The precedent for members of the White House staff to decline invitations to testify before congressional committees has been consistently adhered to by administrations of both political parties, and is based on clearly established constitutional doctrines.”

He added: “In light of the Committee’s interest, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the Administration’s immigration policy priorities and note that many Executive Branch officials, including cabinet secretaries and other agency leaders, have testified on multiple occasions regarding the Administration’s efforts to secure the border.”

“Testimony by such Executive Branch officials with responsibilities defined by statute would be a reasonable accommodation to the Committee’s questions and legislative goals,” he wrote.

The White House’s decision comes after President Trump vowed this week to fight “all” subpoenas against the administration.

TRUMP, AGAIN, SAYS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WILL BE 'GIVEN' TO SANCTUARY CITIES, STATES

But the Oversight Committee did not subpoena Miller. Cummings invited Miller to testify on why he believes it is “good policy for the Trump administration to take the actions it has. Cummings noted the administration’s unofficial policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border, “transferring asylum seekers to sanctuary cities as a form of illegal retribution” against political adversaries, and “firing top Administration officials who refuse orders to violate the law.”

The invitation from Cummings came after Trump announced that illegal immigrants would be “given” to sanctuary cities, pending official decisions from the Department of Homeland Security. Also, earlier this month, Trump said that the administration has no plans to revive the controversial policy that allowed for family separations at the border.

That announcement came amid a massive shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security. Earlier this month, President Trump announced that Nielsen would be resigning, and replaced with former CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who would serve as acting secretary of the agency.

Since then, McAleenan appointed John Sanders to serve as acting CBP commissioner; former head of the Transportation Security Administration David Pekoske to be his acting deputy secretary at DHS; and Patricia Cogswell as acting TSA administrator. The White House earlier this month announced that James M. Murray would become head of the U.S. Secret Service—replacing Randolph “Tex” Alles.

The Trump administration is slapping economic sanctions on Venezuela's foreign minister as it ratchets up pressure on the government of President Nicolás Maduro.

The Treasury Department Friday announced the penalties against Minister of Foreign Affairs Jorge Alberto Arreaza Montserrat and Carol Bealexis Padilla de Arretureta, a judge.

The sanctions are part of an effort to punish Maduro's administration, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said was illegitimate and starving the Venezuelan people ""of their wealth, humanity, and right to democracy."" Last week, Treasury announced sanctions against Venezuela's central bank.

“Treasury will continue to target corrupt Maduro insiders, including those tasked with conducting diplomacy and carrying out justice on behalf of this illegitimate regime,"" Mnuchin said. ""This Administration stands with the Venezuelan people, and alongside an international coalition committed to holding accountable those who are responsible for Venezuela’s tragic decline.”

DOJ Inspector General Probe of Carter Page Warrants Update,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Eric Felten', 'Kevin D.

The DOJ inspector general is on the case, and there are signs he’ll be tough on the agencies.

Department of Justice inspector general Michael Horowitz announced in March 2018 that his office was reviewing the DOJ’s and FBI’s “compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” In other words, he was asking whether the agencies abused their power in getting warrants to surveil (by then, former) Trump-campaign foreign-policy adviser Carter Page.

More than a year later, we still don’t know much about the course of the IG’s investigation. But that may finally be changing.

Horowitz has one of the best-caulked tubs in town: His team doesn’t leak. But that’s not the only reason info on the Horowitz investigation has been so hard to come by. In addition, his job doesn’t entail bringing revealing indictments along the way.

Robert Mueller’s shop wasn’t particularly leaky either, but long before the special counsel filed his final report, we had learned a lot about where that report was headed. We learned it from looking at who got indicted, what they were indicted for, and the many details in each indictment and descriptive “criminal information.” Those who were paying attention to the special counsel’s various prosecutions couldn’t help but notice that Paul Manafort was jailed for sundry financial improprieties and sheer tackiness (don’t forget the ostrich jacket), but not for conspiring with Russia. Similarly, when the special counsel’s office brought a raft of indictments against a group of Russian-military-intelligence hackers, missing was any knowing connection between team Trump and the accused. Indeed, so professional were the hacking operations described in Mueller’s indictment of the Russians that it is hard to imagine what the hackers could possibly have needed from the amateurs in Trump’s orbit. Such details led many to surmise that Mueller had yet to find collusion, deductions that proved correct.

No such intermediate actions have been taken by IG Horowitz, which has left us in the dark about what sort of report he is preparing. The IG is trying to establish how the counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign got started. That much we know. What we haven’t had any idea about is just how tough Horowitz is willing to be with DOJ and FBI officials should he discover they abused their power.

There have been reasons to doubt he would be very tough. Recall how the IG’s report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation went out of its way to avoid damaging conclusions. Horowitz catalogued the compendious anti-Trump texts sent between FBI agent Peter Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page, but he determined he could not prove their attitudes and opinions biased their official actions. Though “these messages cast a cloud” over the email investigation, Horowitz wrote, “we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.” In other words, short of a memo from Strzok admitting his aversion to Trump was the reason for particular actions, Horowitz was not willing to declare there had been political bias in play.

It may be different this time around. Natasha Bertrand is a reporter with extensive sources among the cadres of senior DOJ and FBI elites who have been fired, been demoted, or retired in the last couple of years. These are the very people who are the objects of the IG’s efforts, and they don’t like where things are headed.

“Former U.S. officials interviewed by the inspector general were skeptical about the quality of his probe,” Bertrand wrote in Politico last week. “They emphasized to Horowitz that information in a warrant application need not be wholly verified, as long as the reliability of the source of the information is disclosed to the court.” Democrats have insisted that the FISA court was given fair warning that Christopher Steele’s dossier was opposition research; Republicans have scoffed at the way Steele working for the Clinton campaign was described: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person [Steele] was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.” Horowitz seems to have been unpersuaded that weasel words such as “speculates” and “likely looking” fulfilled the Justice Department’s obligations to the FISA court. Or as the unhappy former officials put it, “the inspector general seemed neither well-versed in the FISA process nor receptive to the explanations.”

Advertisement

Not only is the IG misinformed, according to Bertrand’s sources, he’s prickly. Consider this description of Horowitz’s frame of mind regarding demoted DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr: “The Inspector General is apparently irked by Ohr’s decision to maintain contact with Steele after the bureau temporarily cut ties with the British operative in October 2016.” Bertrand wrote. Not “concerned.” Not “disturbed.” Not “alarmed.” No, the IG is “irked,” a word that conveys an unprofessional personal pique.

Add up all this criticism — that the IG’s probe is of dubious “quality”; that Horowitz exposed his ignorance of the “FISA process”; that he is too hardheaded to listen to “explanations”; that the IG is prone to being “irked” — and what comes through isn’t a frustration with Horowitz’s failures, but fear of what he may do. Thus the need to discredit him preemptively.

That it hasn’t worked yet doesn’t mean the “former U.S. officials” won’t keep trying."
Joe Biden’s pitch: Make America great again. Sound familiar?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael Scherer', 'National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns', 'Congress', 'The White House']",04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-bidens-pitch-make-america-great-again-sound-familiar/2019/04/27/c7a041a0-6858-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html,"Former vice president Joe Biden also wants to make America great again — just not like that.

There will be no red ball caps or lock-him-up chants, but the underlying focus on a festering nostalgia for a prior era has been unmistakable in the opening days of his presidential campaign.

Whereas President Trump evoked an idyllic past of greater economic prosperity and less political correctness, the bygone era that Biden pines for is a time before Trump, when American presidents sought to unify the country and build up national institutions.

“This is not who we are, the way we are treating people,” Biden said in his first interview as a candidate on ABC’s “The View” on Friday. “There is an American creed. It’s about decency, honor, including everyone, leaving no one behind.”

In that way, Biden has rejected the conventional wisdom ascendant in Democratic politics by framing the campaign as a referendum on Trump’s character and his behavior in office. Biden and his advisers have bet his candidacy on the idea that a focus on the incumbent, more than new policy ideas, anti-establishment crusades or ideological innovation, will win back the White House for Democrats.

The decision led to launching the campaign with a video about Trump’s reaction to the 2017 Charlottesville protests, a circumstance the Biden team felt presented a clear contrast in values.

“The president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s comment that “very fine people” were among the white nationalists and neo-Nazis at the violent conflict. “And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.”

People familiar with Biden’s thinking say that the Charlottesville protests and the president’s reaction caused a real shift in 2017 in the former vice president’s desire to run for president. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the campaign, said Biden found the events “profoundly disturbing.”

Two weeks later, Biden decided to break the tradition of former presidents and vice presidents by writing an article that compared Trump to “the charlatans and the con-men and the false prophets who have long dotted our history.”

“I think Charlottesville brought home to him in graphic terms what was at stake for the election in 2020,” said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and adviser who worked on both of Biden’s previous presidential campaigns. “When he is the most energized is with situations where some strong person is exerting power over someone weaker.”

While reelection efforts are commonly referendums on the incumbent, a credo for other Democrats this year has been a rapt focus on either policy or personality — in both cases, their own, and not Trump’s. That flowed from Democratic congressional successes in the midterm elections that hammered issues like health care and education and consigned the president to an afterthought.

As Biden planned a campaign launch, he and his aides decided they did not need to follow the traditional playbook of biographic details attached to a list of policy pronouncements, according to people familiar with the effort. Unlike most of his Democratic rivals, polls show he has nearly universal name recognition 46 years after he first became a federal officeholder.

The pending debate over the ideological direction of the Democratic Party was not an ideal starting place for a candidate aiming to keep the sheen of an heir apparent, his advisers counseled. That was particularly true given that Biden’s moderate and incremental instincts don’t jibe with the ascendant and loudly liberal voices that have dominated the Democratic conversation so far.

The strongest place to begin was on the question of character, where they contend Biden has an advantage over the president in a head-to-head matchup.

“Even Mitch McConnell would probably tell you that,” said one person familiar with the discussions, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, in reference to the Senate majority leader’s long track record of cutting deals with Biden.

Biden’s ability to control the story line of his campaign, however, is certain to be tested. Before his announcement, he has been hit with questions about his past opposition to school busing and his friendships with former segregationist lawmakers, with whom he said he disagreed. His campaign announcement was disrupted by news that Anita Hill, the sexual harassment accuser of Justice Clarence Thomas, was still not satisfied with Biden’s contrition for how he ran the confirmation hearing at which she appeared in 1991.

Biden’s rival candidates also welcomed him to the race with criticism. On his first day as a candidate, Biden attended a fundraiser at the home of a Comcast executive and former lobbyist in Philadelphia, prompting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to send an email to supporters noting that he was not spending time “at the home of a corporate lobbyist.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told an audience Thursday in Iowa that during a fight over bankruptcy reform more than a decade ago, “Joe Biden was on the side of credit card companies.”

Biden’s confidants say they have no illusions about how hard the campaign will be, and Democratic strategists not on the campaign predict that Biden will have to pivot away from Trump and emphasize voter-pleasing policy positions to get through the primary.

“The central rationale for Joe Biden’s candidacy is that Trump represents an existential threat to core values and that Biden is the best candidate to defeat Trump,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who is not working for his campaign. “Biden still will need to lay out his progressive agenda for the next four years, presumably one that will focus on economics, especially creating jobs, rewarding work, and making it easier for people to get to and stay in the middle class.”

The early signs are that Biden will also approach that task by referencing the better days. Rather than simply talk about the middle class, he spoke on “The View” about the need to “restore the dignity of work.” His speech and rally at a union hall in Pittsburgh on Monday has been teased as a discussion about “rebuilding America’s middle class.”

The focus backward could exacerbate concerns about Biden’s age, 76, which would make him the oldest president to ever take the oath of office. In recent months, he has been one of the only presidential contenders who has regularly appeared in public with note cards, including a paper he brought with him to his Friday morning appearance on ABC.

In that interview, he initially struggled to answer a question about how his presidency would differ from Barack Obama’s administration. He spoke about his close relationship with the former president and quiet disagreements, without offering specifics. But then he pivoted to the challenge ahead for his campaign.

“On a philosophic basis, it’s about moving to the future,” he said. “It’s not about re-creating what we did. It’s about taking the same decency and philosophy that we had and taking it into the future. There is so much we can do. My Lord.”

Just what that will look like has not yet been described."
Should we shutter the Department of Education?,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/should-we-shutter-the-department-of-education,"Since its inception 40 years ago as a political payoff from President Jimmy Carter to the National Education Association, the Department of Education has engaged in scores of dubious actions that have made millions of Americans yearn for its expulsion.

The most recent example of comes from a long string of audits showing the federal department is doing a lousy job keeping tabs on the $38 billion it receives to administer federally funded K–12 programs. “Complex and persistent” is how Congress’ spending watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, described the agency’s mismanagement of data, oversight, and evaluation.

It’s not surprising a colossal central bureaucracy cannot efficiently run 100,000 schools attended by 50 million children in 50 gloriously variegated states. The U.S. is a richly diverse country, and its families have widely different educational interests and needs.

The founders of our constitutional republic anticipated the pitfalls posed by big, intrusive government. They did not include education among the powers granted to the federal government. In fact, under the Bill of Rights (the often-overlooked 10th Amendment), they left authority over matters such as education expressly with the states and the people — where it rightfully belongs.

So, what is the expiration date for a federal education behemoth that shouldn’t exist in the first place?

Unfortunately, very few laws contain sunset provisions and “regulations almost never do,” Institute for Policy Innovation President Tom Giovanetti noted a few years ago. In other words, “we are piling up taxes, laws, and regulations that are outdated, ineffective, redundant, sometimes contradictory, and otherwise simply past their prime.” In 2015, Giovanetti proposed that every new law or regulation should contain a sunset clause after five years and after 10 years for any and all new agencies. If that commonsense guideline were actually in place, the Education Department would have probably been on the chopping block 30 years ago.

Partly by design and partly by accident, Idaho could be on the verge of providing a national test case for the sunset strategy. The Gem State stipulates that agency regulations will expire unless the legislature votes to reauthorize them. This year’s session ended in feuding, with House and Senate voting down each other’s bills. One of the casualties, the Associated Press reported, “was a bill approving 8,200 pages containing 736 chapters of rules and regulations that touch on just about every aspect of daily life in Idaho.”

The upshot of that fortuitous gridlock is that Republican Gov. Brad Little — a critic of excessive governmental regulations who in January ordered agencies to kill two regulations for every one they birthed — must decide by July 1 which regulations are important enough to be reinstated. News accounts suggest Little and his budget chief, Alex Adams, are downplaying the likelihood of sweeping policy changes.

Of course, some rules, such as those licensing hunting and fishing, are fairly innocuous. However, Wayne Hoffman, president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, says Little could do more than simply tap the brakes on the administrative state: “He has a chance to discontinue a plethora of bad public policies.” For instance, he could pull out the failed Common Core education standards by their regulatory roots.

Regardless of what happens in Idaho, there is a lesson here for other states and the federal government in the value of having termination dates — not just for regulations, but for entire agencies too.

Meanwhile, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., offered a sunset bill for the Department of Education, abolishing it at the end of 2020. A dissolution deadline would likely prompt a thorough examination of everything the department does and fails to do. Even better, it could devolve obsolete one-size-fits-all education federal programs, return taxing power to the states and localities, or transfer certain activities to other federal agencies.

Obviously, the Massie bill will not see the light of day in the current Democrat-led House of Representatives, where socialist schemes are the cause du jour. But if a sunset clause is never implemented, will inept and costly bureaucracies such as the Department of Education ever be dissolved?

Scandals mount under David Bernhardt just two weeks after being confirmed to lead Interior,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-scandals-bernhardt-investigation-bears-ears-ethics-violations-b095ba71cea8/,"It’s been just two weeks since David Bernhardt was confirmed as head of the Interior Department (DOI), and already his tenure is mired in at least four controversies.

From the day he was confirmed earlier this month — despite uproar from Democrats over his conflicts of interest and a prior career as an oil and gas lobbyist — Bernhardt has faced a wave of scandals.

The Interior Department’s watchdog is currently investigating Bernhardt over ethics concerns, along with a half-dozen other DOI senior officials. Those investigations come as the department faces renewed scrutiny over its decisions regarding Bears Ears, the Utah national monument dramatically reduced by Bernhardt’s equally scandal-ridden predecessor, Ryan Zinke.

And on Thursday, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) called for yet another investigation, this time into the department’s record-keeping, arguing Bernhardt’s daily schedule is not being fully documented and that controversial meetings are “intentionally” being left off the calendar.

“Under Bernhardt, the command appears to be granting favors to extractive industries, science be damned, while fighting tooth and nail to keep the public in the dark,” said Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an email to ThinkProgress on Thursday.

Earlier this week, the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into potential ethics violations by six senior DOI officials. The decision came in response to a request by the nonpartisan watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, which requested in February that certain DOI staffers face a probe over potentially violating an ethics pledge due to interactions with former employers and clients.

The deputy inspector for the OIG, Mary L. Kendall, said that her office will look into “potential ethics violations committed by multiple Department of Interior senior executives.” The Campaign Legal Center named current Interior officials Benjamin Cassidy, Lori Mashburn, Doug Domenech, Todd Wynn, and Timothy Williams in its complaint. Vincent DeVito, a sixth person named, left the department in August and joined an offshore oil and gas company.

The complaints against the six officials vary, but all relate to their former employers. Cassidy, a former National Rifle Association (NRA) lobbyist, has been called out for his ongoing work on gun-related issues, including on projects backed by the NRA. Mashburn, a former employee of the right-wing Heritage Foundation, is criticized for staying in close touch with the think tank since leaving. Meanwhile, exchanges show Domenech met with representatives from the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), another think tank that has actively downplayed climate change.

Domenech, who is currently assistant secretary for insular and international affairs, previously worked for the Koch-backed right-wing think tank, which has notched political victories under the Trump administration. DeVito and Wynn similarly engaged with former employers or clients while acting in their capacity as DOI officials.

Senior political appointees are largely limited in the interactions they are allowed with former employers under an ethics pledge imposed by President Donald Trump. The investigation into the DOI staffers will examine whether they are in violation of those limitations.

Bernhardt is similarly accused of breaching that ethics pledge. The Interior secretary, known for carrying around a card listing all of his conflicts of interest, is under investigation in relation to at least seven different complaints, according to an OIG letter sent April 15 to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). That probe was launched four days after the Senate voted to confirm Bernhardt, 56 to 41, largely along party lines.

It is unclear what the full scope of the complaints entail, but Wyden and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) had both pushed for an investigation into Bernhardt’s role in blocking an assessment examining the impact of pesticides on certain endangered species. Bernhardt has previously lobbied on behalf of agribusiness and against endangered species protections.

Recent disclosures have also shown that Bernhardt continued working on policies at DOI that would help his former lobbying clients, despite the Trump administration’s ethics pledge. That work includes shaping certain water policies despite lobbying on them previously while working for California farmers.

He has similarly strayed from the practice of maintaining a detailed daily calendar, instead having staff overwrite a Google document daily, erasing its previous content in the process, which watchdog organizations have worried is eroding transparency.

CREW wrote to Deputy Inspector General Kendall on April 25 urging an investigation. In its complaint, the watchdog group noted that there may be a possible link between the already-opened ethics investigation and the apparently deliberate record-keeping violations, “which appear designed in part to shield from public view and congressional scrutiny his contacts with industry lobbyists.”

DOI has argued that Bernhardt “is in complete compliance with his ethics agreement” and has followed department policy. But Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups are skeptical of the Interior secretary, as well as other senior-level officials at DOI.

“The fish rots from the head,” wrote Wyden in a tweet this week responding to the two investigations.

Chris Saeger, executive director for the nonprofit Western Values Project, told ThinkProgress on Thursday that Bernhardt’s “special interest conflicts are longer than a CVS receipt” and that his leadership at DOI has already been disconcerting for public lands advocates.

“Preventing the rot of corruption within America’s largest land managing agency will clearly require vigilant oversight and enforcement outside of the department’s leadership,” Saeger said, arguing that ongoing scandals and ethics lapses at DOI have come “at the expense of America’s outdoor heritage.”

Bernhardt’s critics are drawing comparisons to Zinke, who announced his exit from the department in December in the midst of more than a dozen scandals relating to spending and ethics violations.

But Zinke’s policy legacy is also living on under Bernhardt. One of the former secretary’s most controversial actions as secretary remains the decision to dramatically shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, two Utah national monuments, the largest reduction in U.S. history. Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) have shown that oil and gas drilling opportunities played a major role in the decision to reduce the monuments.

The decision was widely panned by indigenous tribes, along with environmental groups and public lands advocates. But their opposition remains unnoticed by DOI. Last Friday, the department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM), released the names of the 15 committee members selected to provide guidance on managing Bears Ears — the list included only critics of the monument.

That move has been slammed as “political” by tribal groups, who say the Trump administration is willfully ignoring the wishes of native communities. Supporters of Bears Ears applied, but none were chosen.

Bernhardt’s critics have pointed to that development as yet another indicator that the new secretary will be much like his predecessor, in policy as much as in scandal. Prentice-Dunn argued that Bernhardt has “established a track record of helping his former clients in the drilling and mining industries,” in keeping with the legacy set by Zinke.

Moreover, Prentice-Dunn said, with investigations mounting so early in his tenure, Bernhardt “is already on track to be as scandal-plagued as his predecessor… if not more so.”"
"Corruption and Mismanagement at USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service’s Put Consumers at Risk, Whistleblower Says",https://www.counterpunch.org,"['More Articles', 'Joseph Natoli', 'Paul Street', 'Jack Rasmus', 'Jonah Raskin', 'Robert Fantina', 'Patrick Cockburn', 'Nick Alexandrov', 'Martin Billheimer', 'Binoy Kampmark']",04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/26/corruption-and-mismanagement-at-usdas-food-safety-and-inspection-services-put-consumers-at-risk-whistleblower-says/,"by



The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which operates under the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and employs more than 10,000 people, is tasked with ensuring the safety and proper labeling of U.S. meat, poultry and eggs.

FSIS inspectors are present at over 6,200 U.S. slaughter, food processing and import facilities to check for diseased animals, compliance with the Humane Slaughter Act, bacterial contamination and the presence of antibiotic, pesticide and other residues. FSIS investigators monitor sales and distribution of finished products to prevent disease outbreaks and to help initiate recalls of contaminated products when they occur.

The agency’s No. 1 job is to protect consumers. Yet according to a compliance operations official who worked at FSIS for many years, internal corruption, mismanagement, low morale and undisguised conflicts-of-interest within the agency often prevent FSIS inspectors and investigators from doing their jobs. It’s a public health crisis “just waiting to happen,” the official told us, on condition of anonymity.

Moreover, large meat producers like Cargill, Tyson, Smithfield, Swift (JBS) and Sanderson Farms are often given a “pass” thanks to their high-paid lobbyists: “The same misbranding or adulteration of product that would force an immediate recall from a small, ‘Ma and Pa’ company is overlooked with big meat companies,” says the official.

Inspectors in the line of fire

There are two kinds of inspector positions at FSIS––those who work the kill line in slaughter facilities, and consumer safety inspectors who check companies for compliance with their hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) plans. HACCP plans seek to prevent biological, chemical and physical hazards in food processing.

In the dysfunctional FSIS systems, said the official, slaughter line inspectors might have the toughest job of all––there are serious obstacles that prevent them from doing their jobs.

For example, FSIS inspectors can push a button and stop the slaughter line if they suspect a violation is occurring—but “they better be damn right or their head is going to be on the stick,” the official said. Stopping the line was estimated to cost a plant $5,000 a minute several years ago and costs have only risen. Inspectors are further deterred from taking action because they “may not be supported by their frontline supervisor or by the district office/management team.”

Under the Humane Slaughter Act, cattle and hogs first must be “stunned” with a blow to the head or an electric shock so they won’t feel the pain of slaughter. Yet the law is frequently broken, say insiders.

“In plants all over the United States, this happens on a daily basis,” said Lester Friedlander, a veterinarian and formerly chief government inspector at a Pennsylvania hamburger plant. “I’ve seen it happen. And I’ve talked to other veterinarians. They feel it’s out of control.”

The late Tim Walker complained about similar violations to a USDA veterinarian in the Florida slaughter plant where he was employed, as well as to all his supervisors. But no action was taken. Employees were afraid to speak out for fear they might lose their jobs.

Going directly to FSIS about violations feels to FSIS employees like “they are tattling on themselves,” according to our insider source, who said that some inspectors have even received death threats. When inspectors have been stationed at a particular plant for a while, they also may identify as that plant’s employee. In at least one major violation case, which became a scandal, an onsite inspector was having affair with an employee greatly complicating compliance. Fewer than 10 percent of inspector issues get to FSIS, our source told us, adding: “In fact inspectors are not even allowed to go directly to Compliance but rather must go through the chain of command at their plant.”

Nor are FSIS employees always backed up by their supervisors when they do seek to cite violations. Dr. Dean Wyatt, an FSIS supervisory public health veterinarian stationed at Vermont-area slaughterhouses testified at Congressional hearings that he was specifically instructed by his supervisors notto file violation reports–not to do his job–and that official reports were sanitized and deleted. Plant managers, sensing the lack of support, openly defied inspectors, and workers followed suit. In his testimony, Wyatt said:

“I was always shot down, so to speak, by my supervisors. I would walk by a plant foreman; they would laugh at me. I would go up to trim—I would give a rail inspector his break. Plant foreman would come up and tell my trimmer: ‘This guy doesn’t know anything. Don’t trim what he tells you. Just trim what you see.’ I mean, that is an example of the most egregious action a supervisor can take, because when you don’t support your inspectors you are just as guilty of breaking the law as the establishment, in my view.”

Cow heads exhibiting evidence of eye cancer switched to fool inspectors

Death threats, reluctance to stop the line and diminished inspector authority can allow unsafe food to be passed along to the public, according to the FSIS official who spoke to us. For instance, federal law prohibits dead and dying animals from being processed for meat for human consumption. Yet non-ambulatory animals (sometimes called “downers”) are “often” simply brought through a back door and still allowed into the food supply, the official said.

Such subterfuge led to one of FSIS’s most impressive actions, citing in instance where “We got the message that rendering was doing a lot of pickups at a particular location and investigated.” Rendering plants process animal by-products to make tallow, grease and high-protein meat and bone meal. FSIS’s investigation led to the 2014 recall of 8.7 million pounds of beef products processed by Rancho Feeding Corp. in Petaluma, California, because Rancho Feeding had processed sick animals, including some with eye cancer.

The recall included Walmart Fatburgers, Kroger Ground Beef Mini Sliders and several Nestle products, and encompassed California, Florida, Illinois and Texas. It included both familiar beef cuts and offal, which refers to the head, intestines, liver, tongue, feet, hearts, bones and trim derived from cattle.

While local beef ranchers had been taking their cattle to Rancho for slaughter, Rancho also often purchased spent dairy cows to sell as meat, many of which had eye cancer and other diseases. For more than a year, Rancho had operated an elaborate scheme to swap uninspected cows infected with cancerous eyes with cattle that had already passed ante mortem inspection. According to Food Safety News, government attorneys accused Rancho co-owner Jesse J. Amaral Jr.,

“of ordering Rancho employees to process cattle that were condemned by the USDA veterinarian. At his instruction, [co-owner Felix] Cabrera allegedly had workers cut the ‘USDA Condemned’ stamps out of the cattle carcasses so they could be processed for sale and distribution. At about the same time, court documents state that Amaral gave the foreman, Cabrera, and the yardman,[Eugene] Corda, directions on how to circumvent inspection procedures for cows with cancerous eyes. Both Amaral and [Robert] Singleton told their employees to swap out uninspected cows with cancerous eyes with cattle that had already passed ante mortem inspection, according to the documents.”

According to the federal indictment:

“Cabrera, or another kill floor employee at his instruction, placed heads from apparently healthy cows, which had been previously reserved, next to the cancer eye cow carcasses. The switch and slaughter of uninspected cancer eye cows occurred during the inspectors’ lunch breaks, at a time during which plant operations were supposed to cease.”

When the inspectors “returned from lunch for post mortem inspections, they were unaware that the carcasses they were inspecting belonged to cancerous cows that had escaped ante mortem inspection.”

In defending Rancho co-owner Amaral, his attorney blamed “significant errors” by FSIS inspection staff who were supposed to watch as condemned animals were destroyed “before their eyes.”

For government attorneys to take on a food case it must be airtight, as those attorneys are busy with arson and murder cases, the FSIS official told us. The Rancho Feeding case fit that criteria. In addition to the “yuck” factor of eating meat from beheaded cows with eye cancer, Rancho’s plot presented serious and deadly risks, the official said. The Rancho meat, sneaked past inspectors, could well have contained specified risk materials (SRMs) which could transmit BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) commonly known as Mad Cow Disease.

This was not the first time the safety of Rancho’s operations was called into question. In late 2013, two cows slaughtered there had penicillin levels in their kidneys at 30 and 68 times the federal limits.

In 2014, Amaral was sentenced to one year in federal prison and a year of supervised release.

Impediments to recalls

The Rancho investigation, recall and legal proceedings that resulted in guilty pleas, convictions and jail time shows how the system is supposed to work.

But all too often, food lobbyists and lawyers are able to override recalls, according to the FSIS official who told us:

“The recall committee would be on the phone with perhaps 25 people including the food producer, lawyers, policy, science and public affairs personnel and investigators. Then there would be a sidebar––in which lawyers talk without FSIS staff being able to hear and the entire tone and then topic would have changed after the sidebar was finished.”

When a food safety violation is identified, FSIS typically tries to convince the food producer to do a voluntary recall. FSIS has the authority to seize products on its own. But neither party wants the red tape nightmare and heightened publicity for fear of casting the food producer, and even the U.S. supply, in a bad light. Still, it was not uncommon, according to our source, when FSIS personnel would say “if you don’t voluntarily recall, things could get rough for you,” that the food producer’s lawyer would respond with: “Show me the science. How do you know the problem is my guy’s canning and not someone else’s? You don’t have enough evidence.”

Not unlike other government-regulated industries, a revolving door and “old boys’ network” characterizes the relationship between the USDA and FSIS, and the captains of the meat industry, our source told us. Lobbyists, like those at the influential North American Meat Institute, are often former government workers or regulators who know how the game is played.

For example, in 2017, former FSIS deputy undersecretary Alfred Almanza left the agency to joinmeat giant JBS global which describes itself as “a leading processor of beef and pork in the U.S. and majority shareholder of Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation, the second largest poultry company in the U.S.”

The old boys’ network is enhanced by the fact that FSIS is housed within the USDA headquarters, instead of in separate, independent offices which would allow inspectors greater latitude.

While major food producers can often obviate recalls, smaller operations can’t the official told us: “What is very disturbing is the unfair application of FSIS regulations such as recalls. The little guy gets beat to death while a Cargill, Tyson or JBS will get a walk for the same violation.”

More threats to public health

In addition to FSIS’s many inspectors, investigators regularly visit food wholesalers, retailers and processors to regulate packaged and ready-to-sell items. Yet again, their work can be impeded. “If something does not look right to our inspectors, we ask to see records but they can be in a foreign language,” the official said.

Seafood can be especially tricky. In a 2011 USDA report assessing U.S. Food & Drug Administration third-party certification of Southeast Asian shrimp production, for example, there were found to be major language barriers. Six out of eight auditors didn’t even know what drugs and chemicals were approved in U.S. exports. When a country is blocked from shipping shrimp it often “transships” through a country that is believed to be safe, say seafood safety experts.

As with slaughterhouses, food processors and vendors are also known to deliberately attempt scams. According to the FSIS official: “My investigators found that a supplier of meat to prisons was misbranding and greatly inflating the amount of meat in their product which was actually only 80/20 ground beef. These are felonies for which people could potentially go to jail.”

When serious food safety risks are detected, FSIS quickly assesses the national marketplace and traces the risks back to their source. If patients have been hospitalized, FSIS acquires samples and will interview the patients along with local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the face of a contamination outbreak, FSIS investigators will quickly visit wholesalers, retailers and processers with questions like “Where else did you ship product?” “Did you separate lots?” and “Did you wash and clean machinery on the line?”

But in addition to concerns about bacterial content, unlabeled ingredients/allergens, foreign substances/adulteration, misbranding and elaborate deception schemes as seen with Rancho Feeding, something else haunts the compliance operations official––agroterrorism:

“There is so much the general public doesn’t understand about food in general and meat in particular, and security itself at a meat processing is extremely loose. It does not even have to be international terrorism––it could be local. Employees could deliberately introduce a razor into product or unintentionally contaminate product with dangerous, infectious diseases.”

In recent years, the meat industry has rolled out many “post hoc” treatments to curtail meat pathogens—from the ammonia puffs used to make “pink slime,” to irradiation, chlorine, carbon monoxide and of course antibiotic sprays. Yet, “it is a bad way to do business,” the official told us, because different meats and different pathogens require different treatments.

Clearly there’s a lot wrong at FSIS that needs to be fixed. Similar corruption and product adulteration was seen with early alcohol production, our source told us. But the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was eventually able to rid the agency of industry lobbyists and influence.

FSIS needs to do the same.

Meanwhile, working at FSIS to protect the food supply can be a frustrating job for those who want to make a difference “against all odds” said the FSIS official.

Kentucky Agriculture Helps Keep Economy Strong,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Dave Knopf', 'Eastern Mountain Region Director', 'National Agricultural Statistics Service In']",04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/04/29/kentucky-agriculture-helps-keep-economy-strong,"Posted by Dave Knopf, Eastern Mountain Region Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in Research and Science

While horses are an important part of our agriculture, poultry, cattle, and several field crops contribute significantly to farm sales.

Kentucky is best known for horses at this time of year, and the most recent Census of Agriculture shows horses aren’t the only livestock contributing to the agricultural economy. Results from the 2017 Census of Agriculture show that producers raised and sold over $5.7 billion worth of crops and livestock.

The 145th Kentucky Derby is May 4 and likely the winner will have been raised in Kentucky. In fact, 110 of the previous winners have been Kentucky born horses, including 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify. While horses are an important part of our agriculture, poultry, cattle, and several field crops contribute significantly to farm sales.

Production of chickens and eggs accounted for $1.3 billion in sales, the leading enterprise on farms in 2017. Most of the poultry is raised in Western and South Central Kentucky near grain production. Kentucky ranked 8th in the sale of chickens nationwide, and 14th in the sale of chickens and eggs.

Cattle can be seen all across the state dotting the Bluegrass pastures that give Kentucky its nickname. Almost half of all farms in the state raise beef cows and Kentucky ranks 8th in the nation for the number of beef cows on farms. Sales of cattle counted for $1.0 billion in sales and is second to poultry.

Horses and cattle eat a lot of grass from the pastures, but Kentucky farmers also cut grass to be made into hay. In 2017, our farmers harvested more than 4 million tons of hay from over 2 million acres.

And then there’s corn and soybeans, with combined sales of more than $1.75 billion. Much of the corn and soybeans which are produced are converted livestock feed for poultry and hogs. Some of the corn is also marketed to the many distilleries in the Commonwealth.

Tobacco production is declining, but Kentucky still ranks number one in tobacco farms in the United States. In 2017, more than 2,600 of our farms grew this crop dropping from about 4,500 tobacco farms in 2012.

As you can see, Kentucky has a diverse agriculture. Learn more about the livestock, crops and producers in the Bluegrass state from the 2017 Census of Agriculture."
On Cybersecurity: What’s Next for Homeland Security?,https://www.govtech.com,['Dan Lohrmann'],,,,https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/cyber-security-whats-next-for-the-us-department-of-homeland-security.html,"Back in early March of this year, I was honored to speak with Jeanette Manfra after the National Cyber Security Alliance’s annual luncheon at the RSA Conference in San Francisco.

Manfra is the assistant director for Cybersecurity for the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). During the luncheon, which highlighted DHS activities, she described CISA’s current actions and future vision in a “fireside chat” with NCSA Executive Director Kelvin Coleman.

This was the second time I’ve heard Manfra speak, and on both occasions she was clear, articulate, and spoke with passion, expertise and personal stories that reminded me of similar conversations with former DHS cyber leaders like Phyllis Schneck and Mark Weatherford.

When we talked after that event, Manfra (and her team) agreed to be interviewed “on the record” for my blog on a wide-ranging list of cybertopics. I am pleased to offer you that interview here.

Before we start the interview, you can get a sense of Jeanette Manfra’s speaking style by watching this Washington Post video excerpt from an interview in 2017.

At DHS, Manfra has held multiple positions in the Cybersecurity Division, including advisor to the assistant secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications and deputy director of the Office of Emergency Communications, during which time she led the department’s efforts in establishing the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network. You can see her professional biography here.

Exclusive Interview Between Jeanette Manfra and Dan Lohrmann

Dan Lohrmann (DL): What are the greatest cyberthreats facing our nation in 2019?

Jeanette Manfra (JM): Cyberthreats to federal networks and critical infrastructure are one of our most pressing national security challenges. We have seen advanced persistent threat actors, including cybercriminals, nation states and their proxies, increase the frequency and sophistication of malicious cyberactivity. They are developing and using advanced cybercapabilities in attempts to undermine critical infrastructure, target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our national security secrets and threaten our democracy.

Over the last few years, we have issued several alerts to help network defenders and system administrators protect their systems from various threats and adversaries, to include state sponsored actors from China, Russia and North Korea. In addition to the interagency, we routinely collaborate with our international partners.

The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre joined us in an alert about Russian global exploitation of network infrastructure devices. With Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, we published a joint product that highlighted publicly available tools that have been used for malicious purposes in recent cyberincidents.

DL: The new CISA agency has been in place for several months now. How have activities evolved?

JM: Under the leadership of former-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and CISA Director Chris Krebs, we hit the ground running. We are working closely with Congress to ensure they are aware of our plans as we position ourselves as the nation’s risk adviser.

Restructuring and alignment is well underway to streamline our organization over the course of the next two years. For example, we are integrating some of the Cybersecurity Division capabilities with the National Risk Management Center and the Infrastructure Security Division.

We are working to successfully align communication and coordination across our agency. We have several hundred employees out in the field, from coast to coast, working to safeguard our critical infrastructure. We are one CISA and we are working to change and break down the culture of internal silos.

DL: What are CISA’s top priorities for 2019-2020?

JM: For cybersecurity, our priorities are industrial control systems, federal civilian networks, election security and China/supply chain, to include 5G.

We are taking a renewed focus on industrial control systems (ICS), the processes that provide vital services in critical infrastructure, such as electricity, transportation, water/wastewater, manufacturing, communications, etc. The convergence of information technology (IT) systems with operational technology (OT) puts devices increasingly at risk in a hyper-connected world. We want to assess how we — collectively with owners and operators, law enforcement, intelligence and international partners — can reduce risk in a converging cyberphysical landscape.

In protecting the federal civilian executive branch networks, or “.gov”, I want us to lean forward in using our authorities as well as assessing and improving our tools, resources and capabilities, such as Continuous Diagnostic Mitigation (CDM) and the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which includes “EINSTEIN.” Since 2015, we have issued several binding operational directives (BOD) for departments and agencies (D/A) to take specific actions to improve network protection and resilience. In response to the global threat to the domain name system (DNS), we issued our first emergency directive that mandated D/As assess and strengthen the protection of their DNSs. We make these directives publicly available at https://cyber.dhs.gov so our private-sector, state/local government and international partners can see what we’re doing to better protect the federal domain — part of our collective defense effort. Another important effort in this area is working with the Commerce Department and Census Bureau to protect Census 2020, which includes the integrity and security of their data and mission.

For election security, we are building on the positive outcomes and relationships from the 2018 mid-term elections. These critical relationships with state and local election officials, voting machine vendors and interagency partners will be leveraged to the fullest extent to protect the 2020 elections.

We are actively leading supply chain risk managements in both government and industry. There are many benefits to the upcoming deployment of 5G technologies, however it also increases access points that could be used by our adversaries to get into our networks. We know that China is a persistent cyberespionage threat to the U.S. government, corporations and allies. Our top priority is stopping China from tampering with the U.S. supply chain, including 5G networks.

We view our priorities as the priorities of the American people, federal civilian government and critical infrastructure owners and operators.

DL: Can you elaborate on a few specific projects you are working on within DHS?

JM: One project is the Information and Communication Technologies Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force, with members from government and the IT and Communications Sectors. It is examining and developing consensus recommendations to identify and manage risk to the global technology supply chain. The Task Force participants include 40 of the largest companies in the IT and communications sectors as well as 20 federal partners.

Another project is the Tri-Sector Executive Working Group with senior representatives from the financial services sector, communications sector, and electricity sub-sector, and Treasury and Energy. The objectives of this group is to help direct intelligence collection requirements, build cross-sector risk management playbooks, and better understand system risk.

The Pipeline Cybersecurity Initiative is a partnership with the Transportation Security Administration. With TSA expertise, we are working with asset owners and operators on in-depth review and evaluation of the control system’s network design, configuration and interdependencies.

DL: What is being done at CISA regarding election security for 2020?

JM: First, we recognize that America’s election processes are governed and administered by state and local election officials in thousands of jurisdictions across the country. When DHS designated elections as critical infrastructure, we had to reach out to a community that didn’t know us and a community that is somewhat political. I think now we’re pretty good at understanding elections, reaching out, listening, and engaging vendors and election officials in all 50 states and more than 1,400 local jurisdictions.

For 2020, we are doubling down on our information sharing, assistance and increasing our outreach to local officials to #Protect2020. Working with the self-organized and self-governed councils for election infrastructure, a few of our goals are to achieve 100 percent auditability by 2020, improve audits and incentivize patching of election systems.

We will continue to build and strengthen the partnership between federal, state and local government and private-sector entities, such as voting machine vendors. There is no silver bullet for securing election infrastructure.

DL: How is CISA working with state and local governments regarding cybersecurity and infrastructure?

JM: We partner with state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) and major organizations on strategic initiatives focused on reducing cyber-risk across the SLTT enterprise. These partnerships that act as force multipliers and promote DHS services include: National Association of Counties (NACo), National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO); National League of Cities (NLC); National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL); and National Governors Association (NGA). One example is our partnership with NASCIO that led to the development of a State Cybersecurity Governance Report and series of State Cybersecurity Governance Case Studies exploring how states govern cybersecurity.

Primarily supported by us (CISA), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) provides access to analysis services and intrusion detection for SLTT governments. We work closely with MS-ISAC and consider it to be a principal conduit for sharing cybersecurity information.

Our work with SLTT was in place before the designation of elections as a critical infrastructure, but it was more toward the chief information officers. We understand that local governments have some unique challenges when facing cyber-risks like ransomware. So we offer free access to training, assessments, information sharing and incident response. CDM tools are available to state and local governments on GSA IT Schedule 70 through the cooperative purchasing agreement. And we have cybersecurity and physical security advisers regionally based and, upon request, available to provide onsite consultation.

DL: Are there resources available to help security professionals at the front line with their missions?

JM: In nearly all our alerts about malicious activity, we recommend the application of cyberhygiene and best practices. These are not new ideas, but they are critical because we know that malicious cyberactors routinely seize on government and industry that have weak security practices.

For security professionals, our website, www.us-cert.gov//ccubedvp, offers preparedness support, assessments, training of employees, best practices advice and cyberhygiene resources.

Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) is a great tool for bi-directional sharing of cyberthreat indicators in real time through a confidential and secure format. Threat indicators are pieces of information like malicious IP addresses or the sender’s address of a phishing email. AIS is designed for volume and velocity; it does not provide much context, but we are working to improve this. To sign up for this service, go to www.us-cert.gov/ais.

We offer vulnerability scanning of Internet-accessible systems for known vulnerabilities on a continual basis as a no-cost service. We have more than 1,100 customers participating in this service from the private sector, SLTT and federal government. When we detect a concern, we notify the customer so they may proactively mitigate risks to their systems prior to exploitation.

For those working in industrial control systems, we offer online and classroom training from the beginner level to the advanced network defender.

DL: You have focused a lot of energy on attracting and retaining talent. How is DHS, and specifically CISA, dealing with this issue now?

JM: For several years, we have using every tool available to recruit and retain talent with laser focus on building a talent bench of cyberprofessionals, and incentivizing talent to start and grow a career with CISA. Our challenges aren’t unique, but are felt throughout the industry.

In the president’s budget proposal, we are asking for funding to launch the Cyber Talent Management System that we think will be a more agile and innovative personnel system. A few positive things we think will occur are a speedier hiring process, larger talent pool to draw from and, depending on aptitude, allowance for rapid acceleration in careers.

The hiring process for cybertalent is the same as for traditional government skills and we want to change it. We are in the final stages of developing this program and plan to make our first hires later this year.

DL: Is there anything else that you would like to add?

JM: It is an exciting time as we enter in our next chapter at DHS in the newly created CISA. The CISA director and I know that ahead of us lie great challenges, but even greater opportunities.

If we continue to strengthen our collective defense, I think we can create an environment where the advantage is with the defender.

Final Thoughts

I want to thank Assistant Director Manfra for her time and for answering important questions regarding CISA’s vital mission and future plans.

I encourage state and local governments as well as private-sector partners to engage with CISA on these projects to strengthen our cyberdefenses. Also, visit the hyperlinks in this interview for more details on these cutting-edge DHS projects."
Interior Dept. Delays Its Plan to Open U.S. Coastline to Drilling,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/climate/offshore-drilling-delay.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday confirmed that it will likely delay the release of a long-awaited plan that had been expected to open most of the nation’s coastline for offshore oil drilling, pending the final outcome of a recent court decision that blocks drilling off the Alaskan coast.

The delay appears to be an acknowledgment that the court decision is a significant setback for what President Trump has called his policy of “energy dominance” — an effort to rapidly expand oil and gas drilling across the country.

The reason given for the delay was a March decision by a federal judge in Alaska to reinstate an Obama-era ban on Arctic drilling. “Given the recent court decision, the Department is simply evaluating all of its options to determine the best pathway to accomplish the mission entrusted to it by the President,” a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Molly Block, wrote in an email.

The delay was reported by The Wall Street Journal, quoting the Interior Department’s new secretary, David Bernhardt, as saying, “By the time the court rules, that may be discombobulating to our plan,” adding, “What if you guess wrong?” in reference to the uncertain outcome of the legal appeals process."
