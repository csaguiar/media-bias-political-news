F.B.I. Sent Investigator Posing as Assistant to Meet With Trump Aide in 2016,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Adam Goldman', 'Michael S. Schmidt', 'Mark Mazzetti']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/fbi-government-investigator-trump.html,"Ms. Turk went to London to help oversee the politically sensitive operation, working alongside a longtime informant, the Cambridge professor Stefan A. Halper. The move was a sign that the bureau wanted in place a trained investigator for a layer of oversight, as well as someone who could gather information for or serve as a credible witness in any potential prosecution that emerged from the case.

A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mr. Halper, Robert D. Luskin. Last year, Bill Priestap, then the bureau’s top counterintelligence agent who was deeply involved in the Russia inquiry, told Congress during a closed-door hearing that there was no F.B.I. conspiracy against Mr. Trump or his campaign.

The London operation yielded no fruitful information, but F.B.I. officials have called the bureau’s activities in the months before the election both legal and carefully considered under extraordinary circumstances. They are now under scrutiny as part of an investigation by Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general. He could make the results public in May or June, Attorney General William P. Barr has said. Some of the findings are likely to be classified.

It is unclear whether Mr. Horowitz will find fault with the F.B.I.’s decision to have Ms. Turk, whose real name is not publicly known, meet with Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Horowitz has focused among other things on the activities of Mr. Halper, who accompanied Ms. Turk in one of her meetings with Mr. Papadopoulos and also met with him and other campaign aides separately. The bureau might also have seen Ms. Turk’s role as essential for protecting Mr. Halper’s identity as an informant if prosecutors ever needed court testimony about their activities.

Mr. Barr reignited the controversy last month when he told Congress, “I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal.” He backed off the charged declaration later in the same hearing, saying: “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”"
"Nadler likens Trump to 'dictator,' threatens Barr with contempt after hearing boycott",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nadler-likens-trump-to-dictator-while-threatening-barr-with-contempt-after-hearing-boycott,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler vowed a ""reckoning"" Thursday after Attorney General Bill Barr boycotted a scheduled hearing before the panel, speaking in grave terms as he likened President Trump to a dictator and threatened the Justice Department leader with contempt.

Nadler, D-N.Y., spoke at what was slated to be a hearing for Barr to testify on his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Barr, who testified for hours on the same topic a day earlier on the Senate side, did not show up amid a disagreement over the terms for his appearance in the House.

BARR VOWS TO 'RECONSTRUCT' ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE, LEARN EXTENT OF FBI SURVEILLANCE

Nadler -- at a bizarre session complete with an empty chair for Barr where one Democrat placed a prop chicken -- lashed out at both Barr and Trump, who has vowed to fight all subpoenas amid an escalating confrontation with Congress over an array of investigations. Barr himself has not been subpoenaed, and it's unclear whether Democrats might take that step, but his DOJ has refused to comply with a subpoena for the full Mueller report.

“The president of the United States wants desperately to prevent Congress from providing any check whatsoever on even his most reckless decisions,” Nadler said Thursday. “The challenge we face is that if we don’t stand up to him together, today, we risk not being able to stand up to any president in the future.”

He added: “The very system of government of the United States, the system of limited power, the system of not having a president as a dictator, is very much at stake.”

Nadler then slammed Barr, saying he has “failed” to do his job.

“He has failed to check the president’s worst instincts. He has not only misrepresented the findings of the special counsel, he has failed to protect the special counsel’s investigation from unfair political attacks,” Nadler said. “He has, himself, unfairly attacked the special counsel investigation. He has failed the men and women of the Department of Justice by placing the needs of the president over the fair administration of justice. He has even failed to show up here today.”

Nadler said committee Democrats would “continue to negotiate for access to the full report.”

“And yes, we will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith,” Nadler said, adding that “we should stand up to this president,” and should not “let the moment pass us by.”

“We’ve seen in other countries what happens when you allow such moments to pass by,” Nadler said.

Meanwhile, committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., called the entire situation a “circus political stunt.”

“The reason Barr is not here today is because Democrats decided they didn’t want him here today. That’s the reason he’s not here,” Collins said. “What’s amazing to me is that you say he’s scared of answering questions…yet yesterday he sat for over six hours in the Senate answering questions.”

He added: “We’re not getting that opportunity today because the stunt and circus continues over here.”

Nadler and Collins delivered their opening remarks to an empty chair Thursday, representing where Barr would have sat. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., who showed up with a KFC bucket and was seen enjoying the fried chicken, left a prop chicken by that chair.

“Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions,” Cohen told reporters later Thursday morning.

The committee was informed late Wednesday that Barr would not testify at the planned hearing, even as Democrats who lead the committee threatened a possible contempt citation against him.

NADLER SLAMS BARR'S DECISION TO SKIP HOUSE HEARING, THREATENS CONTEMPT CITATION: 'HE IS TERRIFIED'

Barr’s decision not to appear before the committee as scheduled came as Democrats decided that their committee staff, rather than only members of Congress, would question Barr on his handling of Mueller’s report. Justice Department officials said members should conduct the questioning, and said it was unclear why Democrats did not propose having staffers simply provide questions to the members during the hearing.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Thursday called it “pathetic” that Democrats tried to have staff attorneys question Barr, adding that if Nadler is “not capable of asking the attorney general questions, then maybe he should step down or resign.”

DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec, meanwhile, called Nadler's demands ""inappropriate"" and said Barr remains open to speaking to members directly.

“Chairman Nadler’s insistence on having staff question the Attorney General, a Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, is inappropriate. Further, in light of the fact that the majority of the House Judiciary Committee – including Chairman Nadler – are themselves attorneys, and the Chairman has the ability and authority to fashion the hearing in a way that allows for efficient and thorough questioning by the Members themselves, the Chairman’s request is also unnecessary,” Kupec said in a statement late Wednesday. “The Attorney General remains happy to engage directly with Members on their questions regarding the report and looks forward to continue working with the Committee on their oversight requests.”

It is unusual for committee staff and committee counsels to question a witness—especially a high-ranking Cabinet official like the attorney general.

The standoff between Barr and the House Judiciary Committee comes a day after a heated hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing covered everything from Barr’s decision not to pursue an obstruction of justice offense against President Trump, to process delays in transmitting a redacted version of Mueller’s report to the public, to Mueller’s concerns about how Barr initially relayed his findings to Congress.

The Washington Post first reported, in a late-breaking article Tuesday night, that Mueller had penned a letter to Barr and spoken to him over the phone on March 27, expressing concerns about his initial report summary and saying the media had “misinterpreted” the results of the investigation concerning obstruction of justice.

Barr, on Wednesday, called Mueller’s comments “a bit snitty,” and said the situation was “mind-bendingly bizarre” political theater, given that the report has been released to the public already.

The Mueller report itself said the investigation did not find evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller also led an obstruction of justice inquiry into the president but did not come to a conclusion on the matter. Barr determined the evidence found in the investigation was not sufficient to charge the president with an obstruction of justice offense.

Democrats have blasted Barr for redacting the report, and are calling for the release of the full report, without redactions, for their review. Barr has already offered to make the report, with fewer redactions, available to certain members of Congress.

Trump Won’t Nominate Stephen Moore for Fed Board,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Jim Tankersley', 'Maggie Haberman', 'Emily Cochrane']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/business/stephen-moore-fed.html,"In an interview with the Fox Business Network on Thursday, Mr. Moore blamed a “sleaze campaign” for the decision to withdraw, saying that “if I had any sense that this would happen — people would be looking at my writings from 20, 25 years ago — I would have told the president, ‘Wait a minute, I can’t do a Senate confirmation.’”

He said some of his writings “were insulting to women and they were meant to be a joke.”

“They were meant to be humorous and they weren’t,” he continued.

In choosing Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain, Mr. Trump turned to men he considered friends and whom he saw as potential allies at the central bank, which he has criticized as an impediment to economic growth. Mr. Trump has selected four of the Fed’s seven board members, including its chairman, Jerome H. Powell. But the Fed’s decision last year to raise interest rates four times has angered Mr. Trump, who has urged the Fed to cut rates by one point and engage in other types of economic stimulus.

Fed officials have expressed few anxieties about the two remaining vacancies, and it is not unprecedented for the board to operate without a full slate of governors. Both Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke led the Fed without a full seven-member board during large parts of their tenure.

Republican lawmakers urged the president to take his time before floating another name.

“Read people’s articles that they write,” said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia. That, she said, “would be a good start.”

The president selected Mr. Moore after Larry Kudlow, his National Economic Council director who was a best man at Mr. Moore’s wedding, showed the president a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in which Mr. Moore called for the Fed to cut interest rates and said the central bank posed the biggest risk to the American economy.

Mr. Trump told reporters he planned to nominate Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain before White House officials had performed a traditional background check, including reviewing writings, finances and past public controversies. That left his nominees to endure intense public scrutiny before being subjected to the kind of internal vetting that would typically determine whether a person could pass congressional muster."

(Yahya Arhab/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

The Senate on Thursday fell short of the votes needed to override President Trump’s veto of legislation demanding an end of U.S. support for the Saudi-led military coalition operating in Yemen, a country plagued by more than four years of a devastating civil war.

The measure, sponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), passed the Senate and the House earlier this year, with the support of all Democrats, seven Republican senators and 18 House Republicans. Those same Senate Republicans — Lee was joined by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Steve Daines (Mont.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Todd C. Young (Ind.) — voted with the Democrats on Thursday to override Trump’s veto in a 53-to-45 vote. Two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 senators, would have been necessary to sustain an override.

The legislation sought to use Congress’s war powers to curtail U.S. logistical and intelligence support for the Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s exiled government and its fight against Houthi rebels backed by Iran.

The measure gained support among lawmakers after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last fall, which American intelligence officials believe was ordered by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. But Trump — who has been criticized for his continued embrace of Saudi leaders in the wake of Khashoggi’s death — used the second veto of his presidency to block it.

[In Saudi rebuke, Democrats see a path to unseat Trump in 2020]

It brought along some Republicans troubled by the worsening humanitarian situation in Yemen, where more than 20 million people are at risk of starvation, and others frustrated by the lack of clear congressional authorization for participation in the conflict. But most Republican lawmakers objected to using Congress’s war powers to end what amounts to a support operation.

Under pressure, the Trump administration late last year scaled back U.S. involvement, halting an aerial refueling mission for coalition warplanes. And earlier this year, the administration issued sanctions against several Saudi officials in response to Khashoggi’s killing.

But lawmakers remain upset that the administration has ignored deadlines to hear from the president about whether other officials, including the Saudi crown prince, should be held responsible for the journalist’s death, and whether the Saudis are taking sufficient action to end Yemen’s civil war.

Yet bipartisan efforts to take other steps — such as a bill to end all nondefensive weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia and to impose sanctions on the perpetrators of Khashoggi’s slaying and those who provide support to the Houthi rebels — have failed to secure the backing of Senate Republican leaders.

The way forward will depend mostly on Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho), who has indicated a willingness to do something addressing the Yemen war but has not specified what that might be.

“We are attempting to craft legislation that can garner support in the committee, address concerns on both sides of the aisle, and actually become law,” Risch said on the Senate floor just before the override vote Thursday.

Pressure also is coming from the Trump administration, which is wary of rocking U.S.-Saudi relations with a definitive congressional step on Yemen.

As lawmakers were preparing to vote, senior defense officials reiterated the Pentagon’s opposition to moves constraining U.S. assistance to Saudi Arabia’s Yemen operation. Military officials have long said that their support provides the United States leverage it can use to nudge Riyadh and its allies toward a more professional conduct of the war.

They also highlight the limited nature of American assistance, which until last fall included aerial refueling of Saudi and Emirati jets but now consists primarily of intelligence sharing.

Katie Wheelbarger, acting assistant defense secretary for international security affairs, told reporters at the Pentagon that U.S. support does not constitute U.S. involvement in hostilities. “There is no military involvement in the Yemeni civil war,” she said.

Such arguments have fanned frustrations among the measure’s supporters, who call it an excuse to shield U.S. operations from legitimate public scrutiny.

“If you’re so confident that we should be involved in this war, let’s debate it, let’s vote on it, let’s let the American people have some say,” Sanders said before the vote Thursday.

Lawmakers who support the resolution also argued that U.S. arms sales and advising the Saudi-led coalition have worsened the already dire humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

“Every time we have a vote on this resolution, and every day the numbers get worse, but let me be clear: These numbers are people,” Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said on the Senate floor Thursday. “Even the coalition countries themselves insist there is no military solution to this man-made conflict.”

Michael Mulroy, deputy assistant defense secretary for the Middle East, said he hoped a United Nations effort to foster peace talks would bring about a swift end to the war. “If the international community were to come together and chart a comprehensive way ahead for Yemen, we could start to see a change in the status quo,” he said.

Mulroy, who recently visited Aden to meet with officials from the internationally recognized Yemeni government, said congressionally imposed constraints would impede the Pentagon’s ability to provide Saudi Arabia with training related to the Law of Armed Conflict and other topics relevant to air operations. Despite such training, coalition warplanes have continued to strike civilian targets, including a hospital supported by aid group Save the Children.

Trump erases offshore drilling rules enacted after BP oil spill,https://www.politico.com,"['Ben Lefebvre', 'Eric Wolff', 'David Siders', 'Marianne Levine']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/02/offshore-drilling-rules-1404098,"The sun sets behind two under construction offshore oil platform rigs in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, June 14, 2010. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images energy & environment Trump erases offshore drilling rules enacted after BP oil spill

The Trump administration on Thursday dismantled safety rules for offshore drilling put in place by the Obama administration after the disastrous BP oil spill fouled the Gulf of Mexico nearly a decade ago.

The rollbacks are a major victory for the oil and gas industry that has criticized the Obama rules as too onerous and costly to comply with, but which supporters say have helped prevent a repeat of the accident that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil in 2010.

“Incorporating the best available science, best practices and technological innovations of the past decade, the rule eliminates unnecessary regulatory burdens while maintaining safety and environmental protection offshore,"" Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a statement.

The final version of the changes to Well Control Rules come shortly after the Interior Department said it was pushing back plans to open up vast new areas of coastline for oil and gas exploration in federal waters, a move that would delay the controversial expansion until after the 2020 election.

That new rules are designed to ease drilling in places like the Gulf of Mexico, where oil production reached a record 1.9 million barrels a day at the end of last year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The new rule, which takes effect in 60 days from Friday, reduces the frequency of tests to key equipment such as blowout preventers, which sit at the wellhead at the ocean floor and are the last-ditch defense against massive gushers. It also allows drillers to use third-party companies instead of government inspectors to check equipment and gives them more time between inspections, among other things.

The energy industry welcomed the new rule, and the National Ocean Industries Association President Randall Luthi said in statement the Obama rule ""while well intentioned, was flawed with technical problems that actually detracted from the goal of safe operations.”

The revisions, he said, ""leave the original rule largely intact, further manage risks and better protect workers and the environment, making drilling safer.”

Environmentalists say the rollback puts both the Gulf waters and workers' safety in jeopardy.

“The well control rule was one of the most important actions we took, as a nation, in response to the BP-style disaster at sea,” Earthjustice, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council and the Wilderness Society said in a joint statement. “If the Trump administration’s final rule weakens these protections, as its proposed changes did, it will put our workers, waters and wildlife at needless risk. That’s irresponsible, reckless and wrong.”

The rollback is also opposed by Rep. Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican from a coastal district, who last year joined in a bipartisan letter with 20 other members of the state's congressional delegation calling on then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to reverse course.

Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acknowledged in the final rule that “a large majority of the approximately 118,000 comments that BSEE received voiced significant concerns about the proposed changes.”

But it defended the changes as a way to get rid of burdensome rules that it contends wouldn’t have made rigs any safer, even though it said at times that the changes were driven by industry’s worries about costs. In one example, BSEE said it was allowing companies to test blowout preventers less often because of industry complaints about the cost of such tests.

“In recent years, the industry has raised concerns related to the benefits of pressure and function testing of subsea [blowout preventers] when compared to the costs and potential operational issues associated with such testing, including wear and tear,” the agency said in the rule.

Green groups are studying the rules and looking for flaws they can challenge with lawsuits, said Chris Eaton, an attorney for Earthjustice. He said that as with other Trump administration regulatory rollbacks that courts have blocked, the new Well Control Rule fails to show why loosening the Obama safeguards was necessary.

“You’ve got this prior rule that was promulgated on factual findings — the original rule would reduce loss of control, make things safer, and it cited tons of studies,” Eaton said. “Then you have this rollback that just says we’ll get rid of that and be just as safe, but doesn’t look at the factual findings that went before that. It’s a change of position that doesn’t actually address the evidence.”

Critics are also slamming Interior for a lack of transparency: The new rules reference standards written by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, that could only be read on the group's website. To download or print the standards, members of the public must register with the trade association on its website and pay a fee.

“To add insult to injury, in order to know what the final rule entails, the public is again being forced to be beholden to the regulated industry,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the group Project On Government Oversight. “If this isn't the perfect example of a government agency being captured by the industry it regulates, I don't know what is.""

An API spokesperson denied the allegation, and said the group had met accessibility requirements set by the Office of Management and Budget — and that it goes beyond those rules by keeping the standards accessible beyond the public comment period.

Trump says he leaned on God to survive Mueller probe,https://www.politico.com,['Katie Galioto'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/02/trump-god-mueller-probe-1298656,"Heading into 2020, President Donald Trump will look to appeal to white evangelical Christians, a voting bloc that played a huge role in his victory in 2016. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo White House Trump says he leaned on God to survive Mueller probe

President Donald Trump said Thursday he leaned on one thing to get through special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election: his faith.

“People say, ‘How do you get through that whole stuff? How do you go through those witch hunts and everything else?’” Trump said at the White House during a National Day of Prayer service.

He looked over to Vice President Mike Pence and shrugged.

“We just do it, right?” the president continued. “And we think about God.”

Since a redacted version of Mueller’s report was released last month, Republicans and Democrats have clashed over the implications of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the president obstructed justice.

Mueller wrote that there was insufficient evidence to find that the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin. The special counsel did not take a position on whether the president obstructed justice but detailed a number of instances in which the president attempted to interfere in Mueller’s investigation.

Democrats have used the report as justification to ramp up congressional efforts to investigate the president and his actions, with some lawmakers calling to launch impeachment proceedings immediately. The White House, meanwhile, has led Republicans in arguing that Mueller found “no collusion.”

Heading into 2020, Trump will look once again to appeal to white evangelical Christians, a voting bloc that played a huge role in his victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The president has touted his Christian faith in the past and filled his administration with advisers who are outspoken about their faith, perhaps most notably Pence.

The Trump administration has also pursued key policies sought by evangelicals, such as restricting abortion access, allowing religious nonprofits to make political contributions and establishing a Justice Department task force on religious liberty — accomplishments he trumpeted at the prayer service.

The president also condemned the “evil and hate-filled attacks” on religious communities throughout the world in the past year, inviting victims of a shooting at a California synagogue Saturday to speak.

“Every citizen has the absolute right to live according to the teachings of their faith and the convictions of their heart,” Trump said. “This is the bedrock of American life.”

"White House rips Mueller in letter to DOJ, says team ‘failed in their duty to act as prosecutors’",https://www.foxnews.com,"['John Roberts', 'John Roberts Currently Serves As The Chief White House Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc . He Joined The Network As A Senior National Correspondent In January', 'Based In The Atlanta Bureau.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-rips-mueller-in-letter-to-doj-says-his-team-failed-in-their-duty-to-act-as-prosecutors,"The White House tore into Robert Mueller and his investigators in a recent letter to Attorney General Bill Barr that argued the special counsel's team included ""political statements"" in their Russia report and ""failed"" to act as traditional prosecutors -- while stating President Trump reserves his right to invoke executive privilege on matters related to the report.

In the April 19 letter to the Justice Department obtained Thursday by Fox News, White House Counsel Emmet Flood laid out a series of concerns with the Mueller report, specifically on the team's handling of the investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice.

TRUMP: 'NO REASON' TO HONOR DEMS' 'VERY PARTISAN' SUBPOENAS

“The Special Counsel and his staff failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors,” Flood wrote, complaining that the report ""suffers from an extraordinary legal defect"" by failing to comply with the ""requirements of governing law.""

Flood raised concerns that the team did not reach a determination on the obstruction question while still going into great detail about the probe's findings and including a pointed passage that stated the probe did not exonerate the president. That passage read: “The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Flood noted prosecutors “simply are not in the business of establishing innocence” and described these as ""political statements.""

The letter was sent a day after the redacted version of the Mueller report was made public. But the points in the letter aligned with testimony from Barr himself this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he said he did not understand why Mueller did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question.

Flood, in his letter, said ""the one thing the SCO (Special Counsel's Office} was obligated to do is the very thing the SCO -- intentionally and unapologetically -- refused to do. The SCO made neither a prosecution decision nor a declination decision on the obstruction question."" Flood complained that the report was instead “laden with factual information that has never been subjected to adversarial testing or independent analysis.”

He also said Mueller ""produced a prosecutorial curiosity,"" describing the report as ""part 'truth commission' report and part law school exam paper.""

Despite Trump himself claiming the report exonerated him, the document only said Mueller did not find evidence of collusion with Russia while leaving the obstruction question open. Barr determined the obstruction evidence did not constitute a crime, but the report's section on that issue included extensive and damaging details about the president's actions, including the allegation that he told his former White House counsel to have Mueller removed.

Flood took issue with the analysis that Mueller intentionally didn’t issue a conclusion on obstruction, but rather decided to provide information about his investigation so Congress could decide whether to take action, like impeachment.

WHITE HOUSE DENIES DEMS INFO ON SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS

“By way of justifying this departure, it has been suggested that the report was written with the intent of providing Congress some kind of ‘road map’ for congressional action,” Flood wrote, adding if that’s the case, “it too serves as additional evidence of the [Special Counsel Office’s] refusal to follow applicable law.”

Flood, meanwhile, asserted that Trump waiving executive privilege on the report does not constitute a blanket waiver, as senior aides face subpoenas on Capitol Hill related to the Russia investigation.

The letter comes as the White House has signaled it intends to vigorously oppose subpoenas that might run up against executive privilege, a power sanctioned by the Supreme Court that allows the president and members of the executive branch to shield certain internal communications from disclosure, absent a compelling overriding justification.

“We're fighting all the subpoenas,"" Trump told reporters at the White House last week.

Trump has argued that he has been “transparent” as president and had already turned over documents to Mueller’s team – suggesting it’s not necessary to cooperate with the Democratic probes.

The White House has signaled plans to fight House Democrats' subpoena of testimony and documents from ex-White House counsel Don McGahn. The brewing fight over the McGahn subpoena was poised to set up a series of other contentious legal showdowns as Democrats seek to publicly question more current and former Trump aides who featured prominently Mueller's report on the Russia investigation.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday made public its rollback of a major offshore-drilling safety regulation, significantly weakening an Obama-era rule that was put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and sent 4.9 million barrels of oil gushing into the sea, causing the worst oil spill in American history.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed by the Senate last month to head the agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and waters, announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Port Fourchon, La., the vast industrial hub that serves as the onshore base for most companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico.

The oil industry praised the move. Environmental groups warned that the rollbacks could pave the way for similar crises to happen again.

The weakened safety rules come as the Trump administration has also sought to vastly expand offshore drilling in the nation’s waters. Last year the Interior Department proposed opening almost the entire United States coastline to drilling, although Mr. Bernhardt recently said the administration may delay those plans while court challenges are addressed."

VA Comes Out Against Bills on Medical Marijuana for Veterans,https://www.military.com,['Patricia Kime'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/02/va-comes-out-against-bills-medical-marijuana-veterans.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs opposes three legislative proposals that would expand research on medical marijuana at the VA and give veterans access to the drug in states where it is legal.

During a hearing Tuesday on eight VA health-related bills under consideration by Congress, VA officials told House lawmakers that as long as marijuana is illegal under federal law, the department cannot support legislation that promotes its role at the VA.

""[The House Veterans Affairs Committee] can make strong proposals for us to move forward with recommendations of filling out forms and such but, in the end, we need to go back to the [Drug Enforcement Agency] and [Justice Department] for their opinion,"" said Larry Mole, chief consultant for population health at the VA.

Three of the bills before the House Veterans Affairs health subcommittee relate to medical marijuana. One, the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 1647, sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, would allow VA health providers to recommend medical marijuana to their veteran patients and fill out the necessary paperwork for them to enroll in state marijuana programs.

Related content:

Blumenauer, who has introduced the bill in every Congress since 2014, said that, for some veterans, marijuana and cannabis derivatives are lifesavers that keep them from using addictive medications such as opioids to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, seizures and glaucoma. Yet VA health care providers are not allowed to recommend it.

""Opioids steal the lives of 115 Americans every day ... as veterans with PTSD, chronic pain and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong,"" he said.

Another bill, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, H.R. 712, would direct the VA to conduct a large-scale clinical trial on the effects of cannabis on conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain.

Bill sponsor Rep. Lou Correa, D-California, said the research would examine the effectiveness of cannabis on various health conditions, as well as delivery methods.

""It's time to do research. It's time for veterans to know what cannabis is good for and what cannabis is not good for,"" Correa said.

A third, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, H.R. 2192, would protect veterans' benefits by prohibiting the VA from denying health care and compensation for veterans participating in a state medical marijuana program.

Keita Franklin, the VA's national director of suicide prevention, said that while the department supports medical marijuana research and is currently involved in a trial for treating PTSD, it opposes the bills.

According to Franklin, VA doctors would be subject to criminal prosecution if they recommended medical marijuana or made referrals to state agencies, as specified by DEA guidance.

And Correa's bill, she said, would not follow standard practice in medical research.

""Typically, a smaller early-phase trial would advance our knowledge and the benefits and risks regarding cannabis before moving to the expansive approach described in this legislation,"" she said. ""Any trial involving human subjects must include an evaluation on the risks and the safety, and include the smallest number of participants to avoid putting the subjects at increased risk unnecessarily. For these reasons, we don't support this legislation.""

She added that the third piece of legislation is unnecessary because VA policy states that the department cannot deny benefits based on marijuana use, although VA physicians are allowed to tailor a patient's prescription medications based on whether they are using cannabis.

Veterans advocates who testified expressed varying levels of support for the bills.

Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the VFW does not support the Veterans Equal Access bill because it doesn't think the VA should recommend unproven medical treatments, nor should it authorize a treatment for a veteran that would require the former service member to get it outside the VA, where they would be responsible for finding a quality product and paying for it.

The VFW does, however, support VA research on cannabis.

""VA's overreliance on opioids to treat chronic pain and other conditions has led to addiction and even deaths. To its credit ... VA has reduced the number of patients to whom it has prescribed opioids by 22 percent. Now, VA must expand research on the efficacy of nontraditional alternatives to opioids,"" Fuentes said.

Joy Ilam, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, agreed.

""We want to make sure there is no harm done. Research is the first step in doing that,"" Ilam said.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America research director Stephanie Mullen said the IAVA supports cannabis research and access to it.

""It's past time for VA to catch up,"" Mullen said. ""Veterans are suffering from their injuries today.""

Among the other bills and draft bills discussed at the hearing was one that seeks to expand complementary and alternative therapies and treatments at VA medical facilities, and another that would require the VA to report suicides and attempts that occur on VA campuses within a week of them happening.

Franklin said the VA supports both proposals.

U.S. DOJ Moves to Detain Defendant in Crypto ‘Shadow Banking’ Case,https://www.coindesk.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.coindesk.com/u-s-doj-moves-to-detain-defendant-in-crypto-shadow-banking-case,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking to detain Reginald Fowler until his trial for operating an unlicensed money transmission business which may have processed funds for the Bitfinex crypto exchange.

In a court filing Wednesday – which was shared online but is not yet available on the government’s Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system – first assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Strange and assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino detail concerns that Fowler may flee the country if he is not held in custody, citing his “disregard” for the FBI’s investigation last year.

Moreover, because “this scheme involves a staggering amount of money,” the U.S. government believes that Fowler may be able to avoid prosecution by accessing funds around the world.

“The government, through email search warrants, has obtained a document entitled ‘Master US Workbook,’ which details the financial operations of the scheme as of January 2019,” the filing says, adding:

“This workbook indicates that the scheme had received over $740 million in 2018 alone. It lists approximately sixty different bank accounts, held at both domestic and international banks, with a combined account balance of over $345 million as of January 2019. Notably, this workbook indicates that approximately $50 million is held in domestic accounts, with the rest located abroad.”

Fowler was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission service earlier this week by the U.S Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

Alongside an associate, Tel Aviv-based Ravid Yosef, Fowler is alleged to have provided cryptocurrency exchanges with banking services illicitly and may be an operator of Crypto Capital, the payment processor at the heart of the Bitfinex/Tether scandal.

Indeed, the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigation may be one reason why Crypto Capital’s funds were frozen, which in turn hampered Bitfinex’s ability to process its customers’ withdrawals.

It was Bitfinex’s loss of access to some $850 million through Crypto Capital which resulted in its taking out a $625 million loan from Tether, the stablecoin issuer it is closely affiliated with.

The filing appears to confirm this, noting that “recent public reporting, which is corroborated in part through interviews conducted in the course of this investigation, indicates that companies associated with defendant have failed to return $851 million to a client of defendant’s shadow bank.”

Other crimes

Fowler may have also been involved in other crimes, the filing said. Roughly $14,000 in counterfeit bills – largely $100 bills – were recovered from Fowler’s office, indicating that he may have been involved in producing counterfeit money.

“Thus, it may be that this case is only one of multiple criminal and legal proceedings facing defendant,” the filing says.

Therefore, unless the prosecutors come to an agreement with Fowler with “a package of conditions,” his appearance at a hearing cannot be “reasonably assure[d],” and so he should be detained, Strange and Restaino wrote.

Fowler was arrested on April 30, and faces a maximum sentence of 30 years on the bank fraud charge.

Trump’s Justice Department doesn’t understand that four is less than five,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-obamacare-case-texas-fifth-circuit-871aecda0599/,"There is literally no rule more basic to U.S. litigation than the rule of five. The Supreme Court has nine seats. It takes a majority to decide a case. A decision joined by five or more justices is a binding interpretation of the law that controls all other court decisions. An opinion dissenting from such a decision is just someone’s views.

And yet, a pair of briefs filed Wednesday evening by a team of anti-Obamacare lawyers — including one filed by the Trump Justice Department and another filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on behalf of several red states — fails to grasp this rudimentary rule. Both briefs, in a case asking a federal court to repeal the entirety of Obamacare, rely heavily on a dissenting opinion by four of the Supreme Court’s most conservative members. And a dissenting opinion, by definition, is not the law.

The case is Texas v. United States.

Making something of nothing

As originally enacted, the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate” required most Americans to either obtain health insurance or pay higher income taxes. The Supreme Court famously upheld this provision of the original, 2010 law as a valid exercise of Congress’ power to tax.

Advertisement

Seven years later, after Congress spent the better part of the year debating plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety and failed to enact any one of these plans, Congress passed a tax law which contained a single provision changing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance to zero dollars. Thus, Congress chose to leave the entire law intact, with the exception that it effectively repealed the individual mandate.

Although the 2017 version of the mandate does nothing — it requires individuals to either carry insurance or pay zero dollars — the Texas plaintiffs claim that it is now unconstitutional on the theory that the Supreme Court upheld it as a tax, but it no longer functions as a tax because it doesn’t collect any tax revenue. That’s a plausible argument, but it should be a purely academic one. Who cares if a provision of the law that literally does nothing is unconstitutional?

Indeed, the fact that the challenged provision does absolutely nothing should be the end of this case. In order to file a federal lawsuit, a plaintiff must have “standing,” meaning that they must be able to show that the law they are challenging injures them in some way. But a zero dollar tax injures no one, so no one has standing to challenge it.

Nevertheless, the Texas plaintiffs ask the courts to ignore this standing requirement and strike down the neutered mandate. Then they seek much, much more.

4 > 5

When a court declares one provision of a larger federal statute unconstitutional, it often must ask whether other, constitutional provisions of the law must fall with it — an inquiry known as “severability.” Severability, by its very nature, is a speculative inquiry. It asks whether Congress would have enacted the constitutional provisions of a law if it had known that the unconstitutional provisions could not take effect.

When engaging in this speculation, moreover, courts must apply a very strong presumption that Congress did not intend for additional provisions to fall. As the Supreme Court explained most recently in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, “in order for other . . . provisions to fall it must be ‘evident that [Congress] would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of [those] which [are] not’”

So Texas is a very easy case, even if you ignore the fact that these plaintiffs lack standing. And even if you concede that the zeroed-out mandate is unconstitutional, we already know what Congress would have done if it had known that the powerless mandate would be struck down. Again, Congress spent the better part of a year debating whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ultimately decided not to repeal the law, and then passed a law that canceled just one provision of Obamacare — the individual mandate. That’s conclusive proof that Congress intended to eliminate the mandate while leaving the rest of law intact.

To get around this proof, the Texas plaintiffs and the Trump administration rely heavily on a dissenting opinion penned by four conservative justices in NFIB v. Sebelius, the 2012 decision upholding most of the Affordable Care Act.

In that opinion, the dissenting justices claimed that the original version of the individual mandate — the version that actually did something — is unconstitutional. They then argued that the Affordable Care Act is a carefully balanced machine made up of interlocking regulations, subsidies, and taxes. Remove a major cog in this machine, they argued, and the entire apparatus must fall because each moving part depends on the others.

Texas and the Trump administration argue that this logic should also apply to a decision striking down the zeroed-out, 2017 version of the mandate.

There are more problems with this argument than one can count. The most obvious one is, again, that a dissenting opinion is not the law. Texas’ and the Trump administration’s argument rests on the assumption that four justices are more than five.

Moreover, not only is a dissenting opinion not the law, but a majority of the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the dissent’s argument that the Affordable Care Act is collection of interlocking parts that must stand or fall together. While NFIB left most of the law intact, it did strike down a provision that imposed strict financial consequences on states that rejected Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.

But NFIB did not hold that, because this one important cog was removed from Obamacare’s machine, the entire law must fall. “We have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the controlling opinion, “but we do not believe Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply because some may choose not to participate.” The bulk of the law, he noted, “will remain ‘fully operative as a law,’ and will still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress’ basic objectives in enacting the statute.’”

The same logic should apply to Texas. After all, the practical difference between the post-2017 version of the law, which contains a powerless “mandate” that does absolutely nothing, and a different version of the law with the zeroed-out mandate excised, is absolutely nothing. With or without the gelded mandate, the law functions exactly the same. And thus it remains “fully operative as a law” and will “still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress basic objectives'” in enacting the 2017 version of the statute.

And there’s another major problem with Texas and the Trump administration’s reliance on the NFIB dissent. Even if that dissent were the law, it was written in 2012. Murphy was handed down in 2018. Thus, to the extent that the NFIB dissent conflicts with Murphy, it is superseded by Murphy. Courts must uphold the bulk of the Affordable Care Act unless it is “evident” that Congress would not have enacted the bulk of the law without the do-nothing mandate.

The theory behind Texas, in other words, does not have any basis in American law. But the two briefs’ reliance on the NFIB dissent is still revealing. The real premise underlying Texas is that, now that the courts have taken a sharp right turn, dissenting opinions penned by the Supreme Court’s most conservative members should be treated as if they were the law, and the law itself should be ignored.

A least some members of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will hear Texas in July, appear to agree with this premise — as evidenced by a recent abortion case where the Fifth Circuit defied a recent Supreme Court decision handed down before Justice Anthony Kennedy left the bench. Significantly, Chief Justice Roberts voted to stay the Fifth Circuit’s defiance, signaling to lower courts that they cannot simply ignore the Supreme Court’s decisions.

Texas will be a good test of whether the Fifth Circuit got the message."
ICE starting 90-minute DNA tests on immigrant families at border,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ice-to-start-administering-90-minute-dna-tests-on-immigrant-families-at-border,"Federal immigration officers working on the U.S.-Mexico border will start “as early as next week” carrying out rapid DNA tests on immigrants in custody who claim to be related, a Department of Homeland Security official told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday evening.

The official said Immigration and Customs Enforcement will start a trial with the 90-minute DNA tests at unspecified locations on the southern border in an effort to verify familial claims and refer for prosecution adults who try to use an unrelated child to take advantage of U.S. policy.

ICE told the Examiner it has seen 29 verified fake families, each with an unrelated child and adult, since April 18. Forty-five cases were referred for prosecution for fraud and the U.S. attorney’s offices accepted 33 of those referrals. The agency hopes the pilot will allow them to increase the number of cases referred to the Justice Department.

The debut marks the first time DNA testing of any sort has been at the border. Currently, ICE and Customs and Border Protection employees must use verbal statements and written documents to verify family connections.

“We’ve never done anything like this before,” the DHS official said.

The Examiner reported last month that Homeland Security and ICE were looking at adopting ANDE, an automated system that processes cheek swabs and other DNA, to verify familial relations.

Annette Mattern, spokeswoman for the company, told the Examiner the upside to relying on science is that it cannot make a biased or flawed decision, unlike with human error.

“Identifying an individual at the border today probably requires an officer to say, ‘I don’t know if this is their kid or not their kid,’” Mattern told the Examiner. “DNA doesn’t have to make those judgments. It’s just science.”

Members of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations arm will not carry out the actual tests. Technicians with ANDE will be on site at all locations at which its mobile tests are present to handle the machines.

Adults will have to consent to self-administering a cheek swab as well as doing one for the child he or she is claiming to be related to. The swab is then inserted into the machine by the ANDE technician. ICE employees will have no contact with the swab at any point in the test, the official said.

“All of the DNA is destroyed within the machines,” said the Homeland Security official. “It’s not hooked up to any government systems.”

The official did not share who decided to go forward with the pilot or how long it will carry out the trial until a decision is made on whether to employ the technology at all ICE locations on the southern border, but described it as another tool HSI officers can use in their investigations.

“We’re looking at all the investigative tools available. This is something that we’re trying out,” the Homeland Security official said, adding there is “no silver bullet” for this type of immigration work. “Agents will have to continue relying on their training and experience.”

Homeland Security deployed special agents, forensics interviewers, and other immigration experts to the border earlier this year to help process the growing number of people who have illegally crossed into the U.S. and claimed to be part of a family. Families from Central America make up the largest demographic of immigrants arriving at the southern border.

[Also read: Number of Democrats concerned about illegal immigration more than triples]

Roughly 53,000 of the 92,000 people arrested at the southern border in March claimed to be traveling with a family member, the highest percentage and number of people in Border Patrol history.

The department has documented 3,000 incidents in the past six months in which an adult and child who claimed to be related were not. That’s a small portion of the 361,000 people Border Patrol took into custody in that timespan.

A 2015 court ruling in the Flores settlement agreement mandated families going through asylum proceedings not be held in ICE custody more than 20 days. The Trump administration has repeatedly said the ruling created an “incentive” to travel to the U.S. with real or faux family members.

The company’s technology was co-developed with the military when the Pentagon needed mobile DNA processing for missions in the Middle East and elsewhere. It had to be “ruggedized,” Mattern said, and able to be done in the back of a Humvee, making it a good fit for the border.

Last June, the FBI approved the use of ANDE. In October, it was used on human remains found after wildfires swept through Northern California. A company representative who spoke at the ConnectID conference in Washington Wednesday said each system used to identify remains in the California fire cost $225,000.

The DHS official said a ""full blown privacy impact"" study would need to take place if the department chose to roll out ANDE to the entire southern border."
"EPA says Roundup weed killer is safe, in a win for Bayer",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kate Gibson'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-weed-killer-is-safe-epa-says-giving-bayer-a-win/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave Bayer a boost when it decided that its Roundup week killer didn't cause cancer.

Two recent court cases found just the opposite, ruling against Bayer and Roundup.

Environmental advocates, including the National Resources Defense Council, denounced the EPA's decision.

After two recent defeats in court, Bayer has won a round — this one delivered by regulators — as it contends with more than 10,000 lawsuits claiming a chemical in its widely used Roundup weed killer causes cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said it ""continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen.""

The agency said its findings were consistent with those of ""many other countries and other federal agencies."" But environmental advocates, including the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) denounced the decision.

""Health agencies and credible non-industry experts who've reviewed this question have all found a link between glyphosate and cancer,"" Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at NRDC said in a statement. The World Health Organization in 2015 termed glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

Jury finds Monsanto's Roundup weed killer contributed to man's cancer

Bayer, which acquired Roundup in 2018 when it purchased U.S. agricultural chemical company Monsanto, called the agency's review ""significant,"" reiterating its stance that ""science supports the safety of glyphosate-based herbicide."" The EPA's stance reaffirmed earlier findings by the agency on the safety of the glyphosate, but it differs greatly from that of jury rulings in recent years that found the chemical caused cancer in two people.

Since acquiring Roundup with its purchase of Monsanto last year for $66 billion, Bayer's legal losses have helped knock $39 billion off its market value. In addition to lawsuits, Bayer has found itself trying to tamp down a bout of unwelcome PR that came with reports by consumer groups contending traces of the chemical were showing up in beer and wine, as well as some children's cereals. Bayer dismissed the claims as ""misleading.""

Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in U.S. agriculture. Beyond its use by farmers, Roundup is sprayed on golf courses and residential lawns to kill weeds.

Bayer has also helped finance damage control on behalf of Scotts Miracle-Gro, to which it licenses its consumer business. Scotts CEO Jim Hagedorn told analysts in a conference call that the controversy made the future less than clear. ""I can't predict that it's going to be as good next year,"" Hagedorn said Wednesday. ""It's the court of public opinion and consumers that matter here."""
Mark Meadows sends criminal referral targeting Nellie Ohr to DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-criminal-referral-targeting-nellie-ohr-to-doj,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, is the subject of a criminal referral sent to the Justice Department on Wednesday.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., wrote up the referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election.

The Hill reported Meadows, a member of House Oversight, has filed a referral with the Justice Department in the evening Wednesday. The Washington Examiner has not independently confirmed it has been sent and has reached out to Meadows' office.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows wrote in the referral.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony,"" he added.

Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and President Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS, the same opposition research firm behind the infamous Trump dossier. Meadows pointed to emails made public though a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that show Ohr was in contact with Justice Department officials in 2016.

""For example, in March 2016, DOJ official Lisa Holtyn sent Bruce Ohr an email asking if Nellie would be able to speak with Ivana Nizich and Joe Wheatley to discuss her research as part of an ongoing investigation as she was told 'Nellie might be a great resource.' When Mr. Ohr checked if Nellie would feel comfortable speaking with DOJ, Nellie emailed 'Sure!'"" Meadows said.

""A separate email chain indicates Ms. Ohr shared her research on Russian organized crime in contradiction to her testimony. Specifically, on a separate email chain between Nellie Ohr, Mr. Ohr, Ms. Holtyn, and DOJ officials Joe Wheatley and Ivana Nizich, Ms. Ohr provides the Department of Justice with analysis of Shakro, a Russian mafia boss, and the separatists in the Donbass war,"" he added.

""Taking these communications into account, in addition to other information we have reviewed, Meadows said, ""Ms. Ohr misled the committees when she testified she would not have any knowledge of what was going on in an ongoing DOJ investigation, and that she had not shared her research outside of Fusion GPS, her husband, and Christopher Steele. Truthful witness testimony is crucial to the integrity of investigations conducted by the House of Representatives. Ms. Ohr violated her oath to tell the truth by making demonstrably false statements during her testimony before the Committee. Accordingly, I am referring Nellie Ohr to the Department of Justice for investigation of potential violation(s) of 18 U.S.C.§1001 et seq.""

Ohr testified to the Oversight and Judiciary committees in October. The transcript was made public by Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins in March.

The testimony focused heavily on her time with Fusion GPS and its relationship with the DOJ. Nellie Ohr said she met three times with Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier that contained unverified claims about Russia having compromising information about Trump. The last of those meetings took place on July 30, 2016, a day before the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It is believed that FBI agent Peter Strzok, now-infamous for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with a colleague, signed the order that launched the inquiry.

Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr, acted as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The FBI suspended its relationship with Steele in October 2016 for unauthorized contact with the media. Despite this, the FBI maintained an unofficial back channel with Steele up to at least November 2017 via Ohr

More criminal referrals from Meadows could be in the works. At an event Tuesday, the congressman said he knows of ""two or three individuals"" tied to Fusion GPS who could be the subject of criminal referrals for lying to Congress."
U.S. may have to stop borrowing later this year: Treasury,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jason Lange', 'Min Read']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-refunding/us-may-have-to-stop-borrowing-later-this-year-treasury-idUSKCN1S73U4,"FILE PHOTO - A man walks away from the U.S Treasury Department in Washington, U.S., August 6, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have to stop borrowing money between July and December if Washington doesn’t agree to raise a legal restriction on public debt, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.

Hitting that so-called “debt ceiling” could trigger a U.S. default on its debt and an immediate recession, a risk that has become a regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade.

The current debt limit was set in March. Treasury has been able to continue borrowing from investors by using accounting measures such as limiting government payments to public sector retirement funds.

“Treasury expects that the extraordinary measures will be exhausted sometime in the second half of 2019,” Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement announcing the department’s quarterly debt issuance plans.

Wall Street also sees Treasury exhausting its borrowing authority in the third or fourth quarter, according to the minutes of a meeting of a Treasury advisory committee of financiers.

The debt ceiling is already affecting how the government funds itself. Issuance of Treasury bills - short-term debt - is expected to gradually decline over the second quarter due to debt ceiling constraints, Smith said.

Treasury said it was holding issuance size steady for auctions of debt coupons during the third quarter, and that it anticipates no changes in the following three-month period either."
Trump’s Labor Department weighed in on gig workers’ rights.,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/1/18525459/gig-economy-labor-department-trump-uber-lyft-doordash-taskrabbit,"Approximately 57 million people in the US do some sort of work in the gig economy. Some of them drive cars for Uber and Lyft, deliver groceries for Instacart and Doordash, walk dogs for Wag and Rover, clean houses through Task Rabbit and Handy, and manage apartment properties on Airbnb.

The market has grown quickly over the past few years, bringing in as much as $864 billion annually, according to some estimates. And with it, there’s been a lot of talk about the rights of these workers. They’ve been fighting for fair treatment for a while now; since they’re considered contractors, they don’t get benefits like insurance, worker’s comp, or paid vacation. Sociologists, labor experts, and economists have all weighed in on the issue, largely agreeing that gig workers deserve the same fair treatment as regular employees.

On April 29, the United States Labor Department offered its own interpretation on the matter. After a lawyer working for an unnamed cleaning company reached out to clarify how gig workers should be classified, the department responded in a letter that’s since been posted online. In the letter, the Labor Department said it classifies gig workers as contractors, not employees:

“Based on the facts you provide in your letter, it appears that the service providers who use your client’s virtual marketplace are independent contractors. Your client provides a referral service. As such, it does not receive services from service providers, but empowers service providers to provide services to end-market consumers.”

The letter could have huge implications for the future of the gig economy. It essentially renders gig workers exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law written in 1938 that guarantees overtime pay and a minimum wage to many who work more than 40 hours.

It’s caused plenty of disagreement. On Monday, the National Employment Law Project tweeted that the letter essentially allows gig economy companies to “underpay and overwork” this class of workers.

DOL opinion letter attempts to allow an unnamed #GigEconomy company to underpay and overwork its workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors. But if workers have all the restrictions of employees, they should get the protections. https://t.co/b6m5NFlFaF — NELP (@NelpNews) April 29, 2019

So what’s the department’s logic? It reasoned that, because the unnamed cleaning company doesn’t pay for professional certification, licensing, or let workers expense products, they should clearly be seen as contractors. It also points out that since workers don’t have set hours or shifts, they should be free to “pursue any and all external opportunities at their leisure,” which means that the company should not be seen as the main party responsible for them.

This type of reasoning is pretty different from how the Labor Department under Barack Obama’s administration viewed the gig economy. In 2015, for example, it issued a new interpretation of the word “employ,” writing that the administration believes “most workers” should be included in the FSLA. Obama’s Labor Department called on Uber and Lyft to reconsider how they classify their workers, pointing out that one crucial detail in the debate of contractor versus employee was whether the workers are “integral,” and that drivers were, indeed, integral to Uber and Lyft.

This opinion, though, has all but been abandoned by the Trump administration, as the New York Times points out. Trump’s Labor Department largely tossed Obama’s favorable interpretations of gig workers in favor of Silicon Valley.

The Labor Department’s letter does not necessarily represent the law; the opinion currently only applies to the unnamed cleaning company that had written to the agency. But as Reuters notes, though, it “can be presented in court to boost claims by plaintiffs or defendants in cases involving similar issues.”

Public opinion can work in favor of these workers’ rights, however. Back in February, for example, grocery delivery app users were outraged to learn about allegations of tipping theft at Instacart and DoorDash, and vowed to stop using these services. This response led Instacart to revamp its tipping policy. Uber and Lyft, too, have responded to public pressure, and agreed in December 2018 to pay drivers in New York City a minimum wage of $17.22 an hour. So even if the current administration isn’t on the side of gig workers, outside pressure could still result in change.

Dems grill top Interior lawyer alongside nominee who will investigate him,https://thehill.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/441843-dems-grill-interior-lawyer-alongside-next-department-investigator,"Senate Democrats had tough questions Thursday for the nominee to lead the Department of Interior’s legal department and the inspector general nominee who would start the job by investigating him.

Seated together at the witness table at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing were Daniel Jorjani, the Department of Interior’s main legal adviser, and Mark Lee Greenblatt, who has been nominated to take over the office responsible for sorting through a number of potential ethical lapses from Interior’s highest-level employees.

ADVERTISEMENT

The committee’s Republican members were largely absent from the meeting as Democrats narrowed in on a variety of ethical issues that have come up at Interior under Jorjani, who has been formally nominated to be Interior’s solicitor but is already serving in the position.

“The way Interior has acted under the Trump administration is the textbook definition of a political cartel, using state resources to help the special interests,” said Sen.

“Mr. Greenblatt, if you’re confirmed, you’re going to have your work cut out for you,” Wyden said later. “I want to know what you’re going to do to maintain your independence and avoid an appointee like Mr. Jorjani attempting to interfere with your work.”

The hearing provided an interesting look at two roles that are often in conflict.

“It’s certainly not a sleepy office, let’s put it that way,” Greenblatt told The Hill. “There are emerging issues that are of intense public debate.”

Many environmental groups say Jorjani is at the center of a number of ethical missteps and controversial decisions that have become a focus of investigation.

“ ‘OIGs love travel investigations — they’re easy to document and spin in a negative way,’ ” King said reading from one of Jorjani’s emails.

“What the hell do you mean by that?” King asked. “Doesn’t that imply disrespect for the Office of the Inspector General?”

“I can only say I have the highest level of respect for the Office of the Inspector General,” Jorjani said.

“I can only say that’s inconsistent with what you said in your email,” King replied.

Jorjani’s career was dissected by the Democratic members, ranging from his time working for groups backed by the conservative Koch brothers to decisions he has made while working for the department.

“I’m not aware of any particular industry that benefits from this, I’d like to think the American people benefit,” Jorjani said, before being cut off by Hirono.

“Yes, I’d like to think so too, but you cannot escape the conclusion that the people you used to work for before — the Koch brothers — said this is one of their biggest issues they wanted to have done away with,” Hirono said. “So I’d say the oil and gas industries are the biggest beneficiaries.”

Another chief concern of Democratic senators involved Jorjani’s dual role as head of the office that oversees public records requests.

Wyden said Jorjani was using that role to hinder investigations, holding back necessary documents.

“By my count there are four investigations that were closed or found inconclusive based on a lack of cooperation,” Wyden said, resurfacing a 2017 email from Jorjani that said it was his job to “protect the Secretary.”

“Last time I looked, Interior lawyers are responsible for protecting the best interests of the American people before those of the secretary or special interests,” Wyden said. “I found that comment especially troubling.”

Jorjani said that comment was directed at a political appointee for his poor use of taxpayer money, something Jorjani said would damage the image of the department."
Presidents Should Not Investigate Themselves,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Suranjan Sen', 'Victor Davis Hanson', 'Jim Geraghty', 'Kevin D. Williamson', 'Jonah Goldberg', 'Kyle Smith', 'Ben Shapiro', 'Read More', 'The Week', 'The American Conservative']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/congress-should-police-president-executive-branch/,"(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

Congress and the people should police the executive.

How, exactly, does a man investigate himself?

This is the question that met President Trump from the moment he took office. As the FBI, the attorney general, and the special counsel all serve under the president’s authority, President Trump effectively held ultimate control over investigations into his own behavior. Then, while the Mueller report largely cleared President Trump of colluding with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election, it declined to reach any conclusion regarding whether Trump used his presidential power to obstruct the investigation. Hence, the discussion has moved from possible interference in the election, to possible interference in the investigation into possible interference in the election.

Forgive me for finding this entire scenario rather absurd.

The federal government’s tripartite structure imbues the president with the executive power, which includes prosecution. Neither the courts nor Congress may force an individual prosecution. Furthermore, any officer with prosecutorial discretion must, ultimately, be subject to the president’s supervision and removal. In turn, Congress and the people —through impeachment or the ballot box, respectively — may hold the president accountable for the abuse of this prosecutorial power.

We learned long ago that efforts to undermine this structure are dangerous. After the Watergate scandal, the Democratic Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act, creating the Office of Independent Counsel. Under this regime, either party in Congress could effectively require the judiciary to appoint an independent counsel to investigate and potentially prosecute any given matter. At the same time, the president (through the attorney general) could not remove the independent counsel absent “good cause.” This all but ensured an endless parade of unchecked, unaccountable independent counsels essentially harassing succeeding administrations. Following a series of expensive, disastrous investigations — most famously the Kenneth Starr investigation, which lead to the impeachment of President Clinton — both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let the act expire in 1999.

Yet, 20 years later, here we are. To be fair, the special counsel does not, on its face, pose the same constitutional issues presented by the independent counsels of yesteryear — Special Counsel Mueller was both appointed by the president (through Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) and subject to the president’s at-will removal. As the president retains ultimate executive authority, the basic constitutional structure is preserved. However, this creates a new conceptual challenge: The special counsel effectively grants the president control over an investigation into himself.

This is the strange situation in which a president may act manifestly within his constitutional authority, yet be accused of obstructing justice. As a matter of constitutional law, President Trump could have removed Robert Mueller; he also had the power to fire James Comey and Jeff Sessions and was under no obligation to provide any reason whatsoever. These are all executive officers. But the issue of obstruction requires that we inquire into the president’s mental state, asking whether the president took an otherwise-lawful action with the intent of impeding the investigation. It’s a Rorschach test: Was Trump trying to “obstruct,” or was he simply making administrative decisions within his executive authority?

Whether or not this is constitutional, it is certainly not ideal. A president under investigation by his own branch of government may innocently make staffing changes, only to face impeachment or, more disturbingly, indictment under a subsequent administration. Or perhaps he might end an investigation he considers to be an expensive, unwieldy, partisan distraction, given that he knows he is innocent: Is that obstruction? Conversely, a guilty president may intentionally obstruct an investigation, yet plausibly deny such intent. In any case, the specter of future obstruction charges may, in practice, be just as constraining as the “good cause” requirement for removal of the independent counsels of old.

There are better ways to fight potential presidential corruption. First and foremost, we are fortunate to have a robust First Amendment that allows for vigorous criticism and truly independent, investigative journalism. This allows the American people to decide for themselves whether a presidential candidate or incumbent is corrupt or incompetent. Popular accountability is, ultimately, the cleanest and most natural protection against corruption within the elected branches.

Second, the Constitution grants Congress the power to conduct its own investigations. Congress may hold hearings and issue subpoenas, enforceable through contempt. Congress may then use the results of its investigations — or any unwillingness of the president or his subordinates to cooperate with such investigations — to justify impeachment, to pressure the executive into taking prosecutorial action, or to inform the voting public of possible executive corruption. Thus, executive corruption may be discovered and remedied without violating the formal, structural separation between the legislative and executive branches.

That said, the manner in which Congress currently exercises its oversight authority is in dire need of reform. Note that congressional investigations into the Trump administration’s alleged ties with Russia did occur, and to a large extent the results of these investigations fell on deaf ears. With good reason, onlookers are suspicious of congressional investigations into the president as being little more than either partisan witch hunts or rubber stamps, depending on whether the president’s party controls the relevant chamber.

But Congress itself can work to obviate these concerns. Either chamber may facilitate investigation into the president by, for example, creating a bipartisan standing committee whose members are selected by opposing parties, or whose chair must belong to the party in opposition to the president. Further, Congress may delegate its investigatory authority to another body, which then reports its findings to committee or to the chamber as a whole. In fact, Congress could even have appointed Robert Mueller to investigate the Trump administration, and while Mueller would not have had prosecutorial authority, he could have enjoyed Congress’s delegated authority to issue enforceable subpoenas. Had this been the case, we would be exactly where we are now, but without the trail of process crimes and, more important, without having to discuss whether the president attempted to obstruct the investigation.

Congressional oversight of the executive branch can work. Congress has successfully utilized its investigative power since the administration of George Washington. A century ago, it was a congressional investigation that uncovered criminal wrongdoing connected to the Teapot Dome scandal. Within living memory, a Senate committee uncovered evidence of presidential corruption related to Watergate. Neither corruption nor partisanship are new phenomena; there is no reason why the modern Congress should be unable to investigate the president on its own.

Regardless of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, he never should have been supervising an investigation into himself. Policing the executive is a role for Congress, and, ultimately, the American people. We decided this two centuries ago, we rediscovered it two decades ago, and now we are discovering it yet again. Let this be the time we finally learn our lesson."
Schiff refers Blackwater founder Prince to DOJ over alleged false statements to Congress,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-refers-blackwater-founder-erik-prince-to-doj-over-alleged-false-statements-to-congress,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., formally referred Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation over whether Prince lied to the panel about a 2016 meeting in the Seychelles islands with a Russian banker tied to Vladimir Putin.

In a statement, the committee said it had “identified at least six categories of materially false statements” Prince made about the meeting with Kirill Dmitriev when he appeared before the committee in November 2017.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Schiff said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials “strongly indicates that Erik Prince knowingly and willfully provided materially false testimony,” which Schiff argued “hindered the Committee’s ability to fully understand and examine foreign efforts to undermine our political process and national security, develop appropriate legislative and policy remedies to counter future malign influence operations targeting campaigns and presidential transitions, and inform the American public, as appropriate.”

SCHIFF HEDGES ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT, SAYS INSTEAD, 'VOTE HIS A-- OUT OF OFFICE'

“I do believe that there is very strong evidence that he willingly misled the committee and willingly made false statements to the committee,” Schiff told The Washington Post’s Bob Costa during a panel event earlier Tuesday.

“The evidence is so weighty that the Justice Department needs to consider this. His testimony, which I can discuss because it is public record, was that his meeting in Seychelles with this Russian banker [Dmitriev] was purely by chance. He just happened to go to Seychelles for about a day and have a chance meeting with the Russian banker.”

Prince, the founder of the private military contractor Blackwater, and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, testified in 2017 that the meeting with the Russian banker was a chance encounter. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed that the meeting was set up ahead of time.

“We know from the Mueller report that this was not a chance meeting,” Schiff said Tuesday. “We know there were communications after he returned.”

Schiff added that Prince had “discussions” with former White House adviser Steve Bannon about the meeting before he left, and “communications” after he returned from the meeting, a claim the lawmaker said was contradicted by the Mueller report.

SCHIFF REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON CLAIMS AGAINST TRUMP, SAYS HE HAS NO REGRETS

“Somehow, mysteriously, magically, the communications between Prince and Bannon have apparently fled their devices,” Schiff said. “In very material ways, I think the evidence strongly suggests that he willingly misled our committee and the Justice Department needs to consider whether there’s a prosecutable case.”

Schiff added that when Bannon appeared before his committee, he “refused to answer almost all of our questions.”

“He said he was not answering questions because the White House asked him not to,” Schiff said.

Schiff was also asked whether his panel felt that President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner gave false testimony.

“I don’t want to comment on any others. We have reached the point of ripeness with Prince’s testimony that we feel it appropriate to refer it,” Schiff said. “I don’t want to comment on any others.”

Schiff’s comments come in the midst of a heated battle between Congress and the White House over subpoenas for former and current officials to testify before House committees leading sweeping Trump-focused probes. Schiff’s panel is currently investigating the president’s finances.

DOJ lays out case for striking down Obamacare in its entirety,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/politics/affordable-care-act-lawsuit-trump/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration offered its first full argument Wednesday for its reversal on the Affordable Care Act, arguing in new court filings that the entire law ""should not be allowed to remain in effect.""

The government argues in the filings that the so-called ""individual mandate"" requiring Americans to have coverage is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law should therefore also be struck down, even if the government ""might support some individual provisions as a policy matter.""

The landmark legislation provides health care coverage to millions of Americans.

In the filing, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt acknowledged that the administration had previously argued that parts of the law could remain in effect even if the individual mandate were struck down, but he said, the administration had come to believe it could no longer defend that position. He suggested that rewriting the statute by ""picking and choosing which provisions to invalidate"" would interfere with the role of Congress and the ""proper course"" for the courts would be to strike down the law in its entirety.

The brief was filed with the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which will hear arguments in July and possibly tee up a Supreme Court case next term that could finally decide the fate of the law and render a decision during the heart of the presidential election.

William Barr: DOJ to probe possibility of Clinton-Russia collusion,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/1/william-barr-doj-probe-possibility-clinton-russia-/,"Attorney General William P. Barr revealed Wednesday that the Justice Department is looking into the possibility that Russian operatives fed disinformation to the Hillary Clinton campaign during the 2016 presidential election season.

Mr. Barr told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the expanded scope of a review into “the activities over the summer of 2016,” which included vehemently anti-Trump FBI senior officials making key decisions on the investigations of Mrs. Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump.

One key question is how much the FBI relied on the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, using information gleaned from Russian sources, which helped spur the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. The dossier was funded by payments from the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee that were hidden in campaign finance reports behind payments to a law firm.

Republican senators said it’s possible that Mr. Steele’s Russian sources were intentionally feeding him disinformation, which then made it to the highest levels of the FBI. Indeed, former FBI Director James B. Comey’s first personal interaction with Mr. Trump was to brief him on the Steele dossier shortly before his inauguration in January 2017.

“That’s the definition of collusion,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chamber’s senior Republican.

Mr. Barr said he doesn’t know the answer — yet.

“That is one of the areas that I’m reviewing. I’m concerned about it, and I don’t think it’s entirely speculative,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Democrats were incensed at the prospect of a counterinvestigation. They said the focus should stay squarely on Mr. Trump and what they believe to be his team’s efforts to coordinate with Russia in 2016 — and then obstruct the investigation that resulted. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin ran a major disinformation campaign in 2016 to hurt Mrs. Clinton and boost Mr. Trump in the race.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, called the Republican efforts “the so-called lock-her-up defense,” a reference to a popular Trump campaign trail chant against Mrs. Clinton for her use of a secret unsecured email account while she served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama.

Mr. Durbin said Mrs. Clinton’s troubles were old news. “That is totally unresponsive to the reality of what the American people want to know,” he said.

Mr. Barr was on Capitol Hill to testify about his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on the Russian hacking operation, submitted to the Justice Department in late March and revealed to the public in lightly redacted form two weeks ago.

Mr. Mueller concluded that despite their shared interest in defeating Mrs. Clinton, there was no evidence that Mr. Trump or his aides coordinated efforts with Moscow in the election. Mr. Mueller said there was evidence that Mr. Trump tried to hinder investigations into Russia and his presidential campaign, but he didn’t reach any firm conclusions on criminality. Mr. Barr, however, did reach conclusions, saying it would have been impossible to make a prosecutable case.

That, ironically, is the same conclusion Mr. Comey came to in 2016 when he exonerated Mrs. Clinton for her emails.

It was later revealed that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign figures several weeks afterward, though the agency never informed Mr. Trump or his team.

FBI ‘overreach’

Mr. Barr described the zealous pursuit of Mr. Trump as the work of a few high-placed officials who engaged in “overreach” — and who have since been ousted from their jobs.

“It was a few people in the upper echelons of the bureau and perhaps the department. But those people are no longer there,” he said.

Mr. Barr previously revealed that he was looking into FBI and Justice Department decisions surrounding the 2016 campaign. Congressional Republicans have long pressed the theory that the FBI investigation began illegitimately, fueled by agents who were intent on discrediting the Republican nominee.

Mr. Barr said he will piggyback on work of the inspector general and investigations completed by congressional committees and Mr. Mueller.

Those promises are likely to thrill Mr. Trump, who has long maintained that any criminal behavior during the campaign is connected to Mrs. Clinton.

The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee made payments — hidden in campaign finance documents behind a law firm — to Fusion GPS, a Democratic research operation that paid Mr. Steele to investigate reports of Mr. Trump’s financial links to Russia.

Mr. Steele produced the dossier that claimed secret meetings between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives and suggested salacious events such as blackmail-style tapes of a Trump encounter with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room. The Mueller report found no evidence to corroborate either of the allegations.

Mr. Barr said he will review how and when the FBI learned of the Democratic backing for the Steele dossier.

The attorney general said Mr. Trump probably should have been briefed on Russian meddling in the election, including efforts to reach out to his campaign.

“I can’t fathom why it did not happen,” he said. “If you are concerned about interference in the election and you have substantial people involved in the campaign who are former U.S. attorneys, you had three former U.S. attorneys there in the campaign. I don’t know why the bureau would not have gone and given a defensive briefing.”

Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, asked whether Mr. Barr would support a change to legislation mandating that presidential nominees be given those kinds of briefings as a matter of course, given foreign governments’ interests in subverting U.S. elections.

Mr. Barr said that was a good idea.

“The danger from countries like China, Russia and so forth is far more insidious than it has been in the past because of nontraditional collectors that they have operating in the United States, and I think most people are unaware of how pervasive it is and what the risk level is,” he said. “I think it actually should go far beyond even campaigns where people involved in government have to be educated on this.”

The Justice Department Suddenly Changed Its Mind About the Constitution to Defend Trump’s Businesses,http://time.com,['Kathleen Clark'],,,,http://time.com/5581308/trump-emoluments-justice-department/,"When Justice Department lawyers introduce themselves in court, they proclaim a specific affiliation: “I represent the United States.” That’s because the Justice Department has the responsibility by statute to represent the interests of the nation. That obligation to act on behalf of the nation has also motivated the Department’s legal advice on a question central to the integrity of our democracy — until now. Recent arguments show that the Department is putting President Trump’s interests before the nation’s.

For more than 150 years, the Department interpreted the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause to protect the government from the corrupting influence of foreign powers through gifts, emoluments and titles. The Department has issued more than 50 legal opinions declaring that the clause prohibits important federal officials from accepting anything of value — even token gifts — from such powers, unless Congress consents.

The prohibitions went further. Engineers and scientists who work for the federal government are prohibited from accepting any benefit (including consulting fees or travel reimbursement) that comes from a foreign government. The Department even prohibited a part-time federal employee who was also a partner in a law firm from accepting any money from the firm’s legal work for foreign governments, even though he had not worked on those cases, because “the partnership would in effect be a conduit” for foreign governments. When it interpreted this constitutional clause, the Department explicitly examined whether the particular payment “would raise the kind of concern [i.e.,] the potential for ‘corruption and foreign influence’… that motivated the Framers in enacting the constitutional prohibition.” At every turn, the Justice Department was on the lookout to ensure that federal officials did not accept direct or indirect foreign government payments.

But starting two years ago, the Department veered away from this long track record. In response to three lawsuits filed by an anti-corruption group, Democratic members of Congress and, jointly, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, the Department chose to defend President Trump’s ability to receive money from foreign governments instead of defending the republic. (On April 30, a U.S. District Judge ruled that the Congressional Democrats’ case can move forward.)

Trump’s personal lawyers have argued that the emoluments clause allows Trump — and all federal officials — to accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments, as long as those payments are in the form of commercial transactions with a business owned by the federal official. Contradicting its entire history, the Department adopted Trump’s lawyers’ argument, contending that the emoluments clause only prohibits compensation in exchange for a “personal service in his capacity as [an] officeholder” — in other words, a bribe.

Under this new interpretation of the emoluments clause, the government’s engineers and scientists would still be prohibited from accepting travel reimbursements from a foreign government, but any federal official who owns a company may accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments through commercial transactions. In effect, the Justice Department now claims that our founders only wanted to prohibit officials from receiving a second salary from a foreign government.

Foreign governments appear to be falling over themselves to spend money at Trump properties. Saudi Arabia’s lobbyists spend lavishly at Trump’s hotels in Washington, D.C., and New York City. Bookings at Trump’s Chicago hotel from Saudi Arabia have more than doubled since 2016, while bookings from Qatar have increased 17 times over the same period. The governments of Kuwait, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and the Philippines host multiple events at Trump properties, with the Philippines ambassador acknowledging that such spending is “a statement that we have a good relationship with this president.”

Trump wants to personally benefit from foreign government payments, and therefore seeks a narrow interpretation of the emoluments clause. He has a right to advocate for that narrow interpretation, but it is his personal attorneys — not the Justice Department — that should make such arguments. While we do not know the exact source of this new logic, Trump’s Justice Department is effectively acting as if it is a private law firm. Government employees are supposed to act in the public interest, not anyone’s personal interest. This is a fundamental principle of government ethics. If Justice Department lawyers are going to say that they “represent the United States,” they better have the interests of the country — not the financial interests of the President — at heart.

The way Trump is asserting the rights of his office is not impeachable,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael W. Mcconnell', 'May At Pm']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/01/trump-resists-congressional-subpoenas-thats-what-presidents-do/,"

Michael W. McConnell, a former federal appellate judge, is a law professor and director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Never before have so many congressional committees issued so many subpoenas demanding documents and testimony from so many executive-branch officials, with so little attempt at negotiation or accommodation. President Trump says he will invoke executive privilege on “all” of them. Attorney General William P. Barr balks at appearing before a House committee to discuss the Mueller report without changes in the format. Democrats threaten impeachment, and solemn commentators proclaim that Trump’s refusal to comply subverts America’s constitutional system of checks and balances.

How quickly Washington forgets — when it is convenient. Trump is not the first president to resist congressional investigation of the inner workings of his administration, and Barr is not the first Cabinet officer to negotiate the terms of his appearance before a committee. In fact, the responses are unremarkable.

Does anyone remember President Barack Obama? In 2011, the House Oversight Committee investigated a disastrous Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation, intended to track illegal gun sales, that put weapons in the hands of Mexican criminals. An assistant attorney general denied to Congress that the Obama administration even knew of the program. The administration later admitted the claim was false.

The Oversight Committee subpoenaed Justice Department documents about “Operation Fast and Furious” and the deceptive claim. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said he would comply with the subpoenas only if the House committee agreed in advance to close its investigation. The committee threatened to hold the attorney general in contempt.

Obama invoked executive privilege. The administration claimed that compliance with the subpoena would “inhibit the candor” of executive-branch deliberations and that “compelled disclosure would be inconsistent with the separation of powers established in the Constitution.”

The House voted 255 to 67 declaring Holder in contempt of Congress — but Holder unsurprisingly declined to prosecute himself. The House went to court seeking to force his compliance, but the Obama administration ran out the clock. Holder never complied with the subpoena and went unpunished for the contempt.

Then there was President George W. Bush and his response to the House Judiciary Committee subpoenas regarding his administration’s 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys: Bush invoked executive privilege. The House voted White House Counsel Harriet Miers and Chief of Staff Josh Bolten in contempt of Congress and went to court seeking enforcement of the subpoenas: the first such lawsuit in American history. The House won in district court, but a court of appeals immediately stayed the decision, which ceased to matter at the end of the Bush administration.

Resistance to congressional demands for documents and testimony goes back to America’s earliest days. After Gen. Arthur St. Clair’s calamitous encounter with native tribes in the Ohio territory in 1791, the House launched the first oversight investigation into executive malfeasance. The House empowered a committee “to call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.” The House demanded relevant papers and testimony from Secretary of War Henry Knox.

President George Washington convened a Cabinet meeting to discuss the demand. According to the notes of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, the Cabinet unanimously agreed that the House had the right to conduct an inquiry (apparently because it involved the expenditure of public money) but that congressional requests for information from a Cabinet officer must be presented through the president himself. Washington and his Cabinet also concluded that the president has the right to withhold any papers he believed “the disclosure of which would injure the public.”

In response, the House passed a substitute motion “that the President of the United States be requested” to provide what papers “of a public nature” as might be “necessary to the investigation.” In the end, after exercising his discretion, Washington sent the House all the papers it had asked for.

What does this history tell us? That disputes over congressional demands for documents and testimony are as old as the republic. Congresses demand; presidents resist. Generally, after a political tussle the two sides meet somewhere in the middle. As a leading scholar of the subject, Cornell law professor Josh Chafetz, has written, “most disputes between the executive and legislative branches over information have historically been settled by negotiation and accommodation.”

This process cannot take place if one side assumes that it has unilateral authority to demand whatever it wishes and that any delay or resistance from the other branch is categorically illegitimate. Trump should abandon his attempt to defy “all subpoenas,” but the House should recognize that the executive is an equal branch of government with constitutional privileges of its own. For a president to assert the rights of his office, as almost every president has done, is neither blameworthy nor impeachable.

Top Veterans Affairs official hits back at AOC's claim the VA doesn't have enough money,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-va-official-hits-back-at-aocs-claim-the-va-doesnt-have-enough-money,"Richard Stone, the Department of Veterans Affairs executive in charge, poked a hole in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claim the agency is not fully funded.

Stone was asked Monday during a House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs hearing on the trend of veterans committing suicide and, specifically, addressing the recent number of veterans committing suicide on VA property.

""I think having sat through the last couple hours here with me, you understand, well understand very well my answer. This is not a financial problem,"" said Stone. ""This is a problem of the society that we live in. And this is about the interpersonal connections that we each have, to each other as a society.

""I can hire another 20,000 mental health providers and what I can say to you is that people in crisis will get great care. And they will come in or be seen in the same day as they are today,"" Stone said. ""I can hire additional people for at risk, but this is about moving to the left, moving towards the fact that we need to reduce risk. And it goes back to your colleagues’ comments earlier about whole health and identifying what connects us as humans, to other humans, and finding stabilization, as a society, that is much different than it was for those veterans that came home 30, 40, and 50 years ago.""

[Related: Veterans slam Ocasio-Cortez for her fierce defense of the VA]

During the hearing, the VA officials noted how of the more than 20 veterans who commit suicide every day, only a fraction of them are receiving care through the VA, with a majority never accessing the resources available to them.

The hearing took place hours after a veteran committed suicide at the Cleveland VA Medical Center, according to Fox 8.

After the hearing, Stone told the Washington Examiner the issue of veteran suicide is a multifaceted one that money alone cannot solve.

""Ten years ago we had a $4 billion budget for mental health, today I have an $8.9 billion budget for mental health,"" he said. ""I've doubled the number of mental health providers over these years, but yet we haven't changed the suicide rate. What I'm saying this is not just about adding more personnel. Certainly we can always add more personnel and we can go move from one to two day wait time for mental health.""

When asked by another reporter what the VA needs from Congress right now, instead of saying money, Stone said the bureaucracy needs be clearer and faster on certain issues.

""No. 1, we need clarity on the never-activated guardsmen and reservists: Are they veterans or aren't they veterans? Should they be allowed to come in?"" he said. ""Our option is, we're here. We have an established system. These are people who had served in uniform. The fact they just weren't activated shouldn't keep them from coming in.""

Stone said it takes too long to build new intake centers, as approval can take four to seven years before construction begins: ""We need to be much more agile in that.""

Stone's comments are in stark contrast to New York Democrat Ocasio-Cortez's insistence that the VA is not fully funded, at least when it comes to preventing veteran suicide.

Like many public systems, GOP want to rip the battery out + say the whole car doesn’t work, so they can sell it for parts.

His resignation is effective May 11.

“I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education and prosperity,” Rosenstein wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Rosenstein’s successor, Jeffrey Rosen, currently the No. 2 official at the Transportation Department, is awaiting a likely confirmation by the Senate. Rosenstein made no mention of the special counsel in his resignation letter. He instead wrote of the Justice Department’s responsibility to avoid partisanship.

""In the best of times, DHS is unruly and difficult to manage organization and we are not in the best of times,"" said former Inspector General John Roth during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing. Vacancies, ""particularly those that remain vacant for a long time, cripple the ability of the Department to move forward,"" wrote Roth in testimony.

A little over three weeks ago, amid the ouster of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a shakeup in the leadership ranks at DHS left the department with numerous acting officials in top posts and the departure of senior leaders. After the purge in leadership , Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan was tapped to take on the acting secretary role, leaving CBP with an acting leader as well.

""This lack of settled leadership contributes to the significant morale problems that are endemic to DHS components,"" Roth said in his written testimony.

There are currently acting officials serving in eight positions at DHS that require Senate confirmation, according to the Government Accountability Office.

"EPA: Glyphosate, the Herbicide in Roundup, Does Not Cause Cancer",https://www.usnews.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-04-30/epa-glyphosate-the-herbicide-in-roundup-does-not-cause-cancer,"The EPA deemed Tuesday that glyphosate, an ingredient in the Monsanto-made herbicide Roundup, does not cause cancer. Reed Saxon/AP

The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday reaffirmed its finding that the most widely used herbicide in the country does not cause cancer.

Glyphosate does not pose a public health risk when used as directed, EPA found in its proposed interim registration review , which is the latest step in the agency's review process for the herbicide.

""The agency's scientific findings on human health risk are consistent with the conclusions of science reviews by many other countries and other federal agencies,"" EPA said in a press release.

This finding comes roughly a month after a federal jury awarded a California man $80 million in damages after finding that the popular weed killer Roundup, which contains glyphosate, played a substantial role in his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bayer, the company that owns Roundup's producer, Monsanto, is appealing the verdict. Thousands of similar cases are pending at the federal and state level.

The latest step affirms EPA's findings in its preliminary risk assessments from 2017.

Many public comments on the agency's preliminary risk assessments focused on the herbicide's possible cancer risk as well as its potential harm to monarch butterflies and pollinators like bees. EPA responded to the comments in its proposed interim registration review, saying that there are scientific uncertainties behind the decline of monarch and pollinator populations.

The proposed interim registration review found that ""the benefits that glyphosate confers to growers outweigh the geographically limited risks to non-target organisms.""

It did identify potential risks to mammals and birds, but said these would be limited to at or near the application area of the pesticide. The agency is proposing spray drift management measures to reduce risk to non-target organisms.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue cheered the finding, saying it is based on science and consistent with the findings of other regulatory authorities.

""If we are going to feed 10 billion people by 2050, we are going to need all the tools at our disposal, which includes the use [of] glyphosate,"" Perdue said.

Green groups continue to stand by research that ties glyphosate to cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

""Health agencies and credible non-industry experts who've reviewed this question have all found a link between glyphosate and cancer,"" said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""EPA should take the advice of its own science advisors—who have rejected the agency's no-cancer-risk classification.""

Environmental Working Group, an activist group that petitioned EPA to reduce the tolerance level of glyphosate in food like oats, pointed to a toxicological report on glyphosate from an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services that found that ""a possible association between exposure to glyphosate and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could not be ruled out, based on conflicting results.""

""We think EPA's finding is not accurate and makes the rest of the risk assessment hard to interpret,"" says Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist for the Environmental Working Group.

Registered pesticides must undergo review at least once every 15 years. EPA's review process for glyphosate is intended to make sure that as changes in science, public policy and pesticide use occurs, ""products in the marketplace can continue to be used safely,"" according to EPA.

EPA plans to release a decision in late 2019 with enforceable restrictions for the use of glyphosate.

Once the notice is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to comment on it.

State Department preparing for clash of civilizations with China,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-preparing-for-clash-of-civilizations-with-china,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.

“This is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology and the United States hasn't had that before,” Kiron Skinner, the director of policy planning at the State Department, said Monday evening at a security forum in Washington, D.C.

Skinner is leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations on the scale of what she called “Letter X” — the unsigned essay by George Kennan, who assessed “the sources of Soviet conduct” in 1947 and outlined the containment strategy that guided American strategists for the rest of the Cold War. China poses a unique challenge, she said, because the regime in Beijing isn’t a child of Western philosophy and history.

“The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”

Skinner credited retired Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as White House national security adviser from March 2017 to March 2018, with recognizing the need for a National Security Strategy organized around the return of great power competition with Russia and China. But those two rivals are not equivalent, she said, identifying Russia as a mere “global survivor” that pales in comparison to China.

[Related: Pompeo: China threatens 'our continued democracy']

“We see it as a more fundamental long-term threat,” Skinner told New America CEO Anne Marie Slaughter. “In China, we have an economic competitor, we have an ideological competitor, one that really does seek a global reach that many of us didn't expect a couple of decades ago.”

Slaughter, who served as the head of policy planning for the State Department from 2009 to 2011, suggested that Skinner was offering the U.S.-China relationship as the ""clash of civilizations"" outlined in another landmark essay that discussed how geopolitics would change after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Skinner concurred.

""Some of those tenets, but a little bit different,"" she answered. ""I think we have to take the rose-colored glasses off and get real about the nature of the threat. And, I think we also have to give a kind of respect for, I think, what the Chinese seek to accomplish.""

Trump has made a trade war with China one of the major undertakings of his administration, in pursuit of a trade deal to rebalance the relationship between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. officials have also rebranded the Asia Pacific region as the Indo-Pacific, partly as a nod to China’s surge in Africa and the potential for India to function as a counter-weight to the Communist power.

But Pompeo has sounded the alarm about China’s influence around the world, warning of security threats in Europe and the Arctic, as well as predatory lending in the Western Hemisphere.

“Trade is not the only problem and maybe not the biggest in the long run with China,” Skinner said. “But we're now looking more deeply and broadly at China. And, I think State is in the lead in that broader attempt to get something like a Letter X for China, what Kennan wrote. You can't have a policy without an argument underneath it.”

Pompeo’s team has rebuked China repeatedly for human rights abuses, especially the hostility to religious beliefs displayed by the regime’s mass detention of Uighur Muslims and the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. But Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department.

“It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That's not really possible with China.”"
DeVos hires consultants to examine student loan portfolio,https://www.politico.com,['Michael Stratford'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/02/devos-student-loans-1402546,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said that “in the commercial world, no bank regulator would allow this [student loan] portfolio to be valued at full, face value.” | Zach Gibson/Getty Images education DeVos hires consultants to examine student loan portfolio

The Trump administration has enlisted several outside consultants to examine the costs of the Education Department’s $1.5 trillion student loan portfolio and has considered options for selling off some of the debt to private investors, according to federal procurement records and department officials.

The Education Department last month hired FI Consulting, an economic consulting firm, to conduct an analysis of the “economic value” of the federal government’s student loan portfolio, according to procurement records.

Story Continued Below

Selling off parts of the federal student loan portfolio would be at least unusual, if not unprecedented. And it would also face a number of legal and political complications.

The Education Department has for decades had the authority under the Higher Education Act to sell federal student loans after consulting with the Treasury Department and only if the transaction would not cost taxpayers money. Most federal student loan programs operate at a profit to the government, so their sale would likely be booked as a cost to taxpayers, at least under the current accounting rules.

Administration officials were preparing to advise President Donald Trump “with regard to the potential economic impact of impairment to the collectability of outstanding balances” in the federal government’s student loan portfolio, according to the procurement document. Department officials also wrote that the consulting firm was being hired on an “urgent” basis.

McKinsey & Company has also been hired by the Education Department to analyze the student loan portfolio and make recommendations on how to manage it, officials said. McKinsey for the past two years has also been advising the department on its major overhaul of student loan servicing and other issues.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news of the McKinsey study on Wednesday. The Journal also reported, citing administration officials, that a potential sale of federal student loans is under consideration by the White House.

Several Education Department officials who were not authorized to speak publicly also told POLITICO this week that the Trump administration had internally discussed and considered selling off parts of the federal student loan portfolio.

The analysis of the student loan portfolio — and discussion of potential sale options — has been led, in part, by A. Wayne Johnson, the chief strategy and transformation officer, according to department officials. The project has also involved Jeff Courtney, a former J.P.Morgan executive whom DeVos hired last year as a consultant for the Office of Federal Student Aid.

Johnson said in 2017 when he was head of the Office of Federal Student Aid that that selling off parts of the federal government’s student loan portfolio was something on the table for discussion. A student loan industry group floated such a proposal shortly after Trump’s election in 2016.

Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill said in an email earlier this week that “selling off the portfolio isn’t what we’re doing.” She added: “There might be some folks who are misinformed or misinterpreting our actions.”

The hiring of consultants to evaluate the costs of the federal student loan portfolio “has nothing to do with selling off the loan portfolio,” Hill said. “It’s about getting a clear understanding of the state of the portfolio, which is the responsible thing to do since we’re charged with overseeing it and it has ballooned to nearly $1.5 trillion.”

DeVos “takes very seriously the fact that the portfolio is $1.5 trillion and growing and she has pulled in outside resources to take a deeper dive into the numbers,” Hill said. She did not respond to requests for further information on Wednesday.

DeVos has previously raised concerns about the amount of outstanding federal student loan debt, describing it as part of a “crisis” in higher education in a speech last fall at her agency’s annual student financial aid conference.

“Only through government accounting is this student loan portfolio counted as anything but an asset embedded with significant risk,” DeVos said. “In the commercial world, no bank regulator would allow this portfolio to be valued at full, face value.”

It’s not clear how the consulting firms will pursue their analysis of the federal student loan portfolio or what data they will be provided.

The Education Department already estimates and calculates the cost to taxpayers of federal student loans on a regular basis according to the accounting rules that are set by Congress. Critics of those accounting standards say they do not properly take into account the full risk to taxpayers of the student loans.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that new student loans disbursed in 2019 would save taxpayers $4.1 billion over the life of the debt. Under fair-value accounting methodology, the CBO said that the same loans are projected to cost taxpayers $16.1 billion."
Senate Fails to Override Trump’s Yemen Veto,https://www.usnews.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-02/senate-fails-to-override-trumps-yemen-veto,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged his colleagues to reject the override vote, Thursday, to block President Donald Trump's veto that would end U.S. military assistance in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)

The GOP-controlled Senate on Thursday fell short of overriding President Donald Trump's veto against a resolution that ends U.S. support for a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, which is considered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.

In a 53-45 vote, the Senate didn't garner the two-thirds of support, or 67 votes, needed to block the president's veto. Seven Republicans joined all Senate Democrats to override Trump's veto.

Both chambers of Congress made history by using the War Powers Act of 1973 for the first time to cease military support for a foreign war. Yemen's four-year civil war has been deemed by the U.N. as the worst humanitarian crisis in the word amid famine and civilian deaths.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urged his colleagues to reject the override vote. Republican critics of the resolution have argued that it fails to address threats posed by Iran.

""Abandoning our Saudi partners and Yemini partners is hardly the way to give them the confidence to take the hard diplomatice steps that are necessary,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor prior to the vote. ""An abrupt withdrawal would be good news for Iran, the Houthi rebels they support and for al-Qaida as well.""

The adoption of the Yemen resolution in both chambers was a rare moment of rebuke against the president, particularly in the GOP-led Senate. The White House signaled its intention to block the measure and in mid-April, issued the second veto of his presidency.

""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" Trump said after he vetoed the measure.

A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 on behalf of the country's internationally recognized government against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who had taken the capital and ousted the country's president. But the Saudis, who employ U.S.-provided weapons and intelligence, have faced international condemnation for the indiscriminate killing of civilians and for the deterioration of humanitarian conditions.

The resolution has also been seen as a congressional vehicle to ramp up pressure on Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. U.S. intelligence concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the journalist's assassination. But Trump has appeared reluctant to directly call him out.

Trump's veto of the Yemen resolution came a month after he issued the first veto of his presidency against a disapproval resolution that would have blocked his emergency declaration at the southern border to appropriate funds for a border wall.

Kaul switches DOJ stance in 2 environmental lawsuits,https://www.channel3000.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.channel3000.com/news/kaul-switches-doj-stance-in-2-environmental-lawsuits-1/1074637391,"Copyright 2018 by Channel 3000.

MADISON, Wis. - Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has changed the state Department of Justice stance to support an environmental advocacy group in lawsuits dealing with dairy farm expansion and high-capacity wells.

Environmental group Clean Wisconsin filed a lawsuit in 2015 challenging the DNR's decision to allow a farm in Kewaunee County to expand.

The group filed another lawsuit in 2016 alleging the DNR must consider the impact a high-capacity well will have on surrounding groundwater levels before granting permits for such wells. Both cases are now before the state Supreme Court.

The DOJ under Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel had sided with the DNR in both cases. Kaul defeated Schimel in November's elections. He filed briefs Thursday with the Supreme Court saying the agency is now aligned with Clean Wisconsin.

State Department official has a really racist take on U.S.-China relations,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/state-department-official-makes-xenophobic-argument-against-confronting-china-on-human-rights-aae491dfb32b/,"On Monday evening, a State Department official claimed that the United States can’t focus on human rights if it wants to combat China — and that China presents the first time the United States has faced a great power competitor that isn’t “Caucasian.”

The comments from Kiron Skinner, the State Department’s director of policy planning, came during the New America Future Security Forum in Washington.

Questioned by New America CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter about the Trump administration’s China policy, Skinner attempted to draw a clear line between American policy regarding the Soviet Union and the United States’ developing policy regarding China.

However, instead of focusing solely on economic competition or Chinese territorial aggression in places like the South China Sea, Skinner discussed how China presents a different “civilization” than previous adversaries like the USSR. According to Skinner, U.S. efforts to highlight Soviet human rights abuses — including the United States’ push for the landmark Helsinki Final Act in 1975, which pledged support for human rights — helped topple the USSR in 1991. However, focusing on highlighting China’s human rights abuses is apparently a futile task.

Said Skinner:

Not to make light of the Cold War, and the reality of nuclear war that could have happened — and the fact that we came close in some instances — but when we think about the Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family. Karl Marx was a German Jew who developed a philosophy that was really within the larger body of political thought … that has some tenets even within classical liberalism. And so, in that way, I think it was a huge fight within the Western family. And you could look at the Soviet Union — part West, part East — but it had some openings there that got us the Helsinki Final Act in 1975, which was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles. That’s not really possible with China. This is a fight with a really different civilization, and a different ideology, and the United States hasn’t had that before.

It’s unclear why focusing on China’s human rights abuses — which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has actually done, especially as it pertains to China’s internment camps for Muslims — is futile.

A State Department spokesperson did not respond to questions on Skinner’s comments.

Disturbing. Leaders at the @StateDep seem to think that ""human rights"" is a ""Western"" idea. There's nothing ""Chinese"" about China's Leninist one-party system. Chinese who are not directly under the CCP's rule are among the most rights-respecting people. https://t.co/oFNiG9ZsBN — Yaqiu Wang 王亚秋 (@Yaqiu) May 1, 2019

Slaughter, who was the director of policy planning under the Obama administration, followed up by asking if Skinner’s discussion of China’s “different civilization” relied on political scientist Samuel Huntington’s maligned theory of a “Clash of Civilizations.”

“Some of those tenets, but a little bit different,” Skinner replied.

Memorialized in a 1996 book by a similar name, Huntington’s theory posits a number of different “civilizations” across the world, ranging from “Western” to “Buddhist.” Few geopolitical theories have fallen from favor more swiftly than Huntington’s, not least because of the countries Huntington tried to lump together — or break apart, depending on the country’s supposed “civilization.” For instance, Huntington claimed Papua New Guinea was part of a “Western” civilization, while Kazakhstan remained “Orthodox.” Huntington even claimed that countries as distant as Mauritania and Indonesia were, in reality, part of the same “civilization,” but that countries like Guyana or Bosnia and Herzegovina comprised multiple “civilizations” within them.

6. If Kenya's Muslim minority should be green, so should Ethiopia's.

8. Sierra Leone is mostly Muslim.

9. Guinea-Bissau is half Muslim. All this even if we accept Huntington on his own terms. — Gennady Rudkevich (@grudkev) April 11, 2019

Skinner also claimed that China presented the first time that the United States faced a great power competitor who isn’t white.

“I think it’s also striking that it’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian,” Skinner said.

If accurate, this is a rather appalling, racist-based assessment of the nature of the Chinese threat. And coming from the State Dept. makes it even worse. Apparently the problem is not CN’s system; it’s Chinese culture? We sink to new lows every day. https://t.co/g9vpu80Web — Michael D. Swaine (@Dalzell60) May 1, 2019

Skinner is incorrect: In addition to the multi-ethnic nature of the Soviet Union — one-third of the post-Soviet countries are in Central Asia, after all — the United States‘ predominant rivalry during the first few decades of the 20th century centered on countering Japan in the Pacific theater. Even prior to the events that led to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, which remained an American colony through the Second World War, American administrations were so concerned about Japanese threats in the Pacific that they actively lobbied for domestic legislation to assuage Japanese concerns — with President Teddy Roosevelt even advocating for racial equality on the West Coast in order not to anger the Japanese government.

But Skinner, one of the United States‘ most prominent State Department officials, has apparently forgotten that history. Skinner’s comments not only severely misread American history, but they are also based one of the most flawed theories on international relations of the past few decades — all at the expense of diminishing the push for human rights in the world’s most populous country."
Barr 'working very closely' with DOJ inspector general to investigate FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-working-very-closely-with-doj-inspector-general-to-investigate-fisa-abuse,"Attorney General William Barr told Congress he was “working very closely” with the Justice Department’s Inspector General Michael Horowitz as they both conduct investigations into the investigators who ran the Trump-Russia investigation at the DOJ and FBI.

Horowitz has been looking into possible Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse for more than a year. Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday that he was looking into the origins of the investigation into Trump, any criminal leaks from the FBI or DOJ to the media, the possibility the ""Steele dossier"" — compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele — was Russian disinformation, and more.

Barr said: ""I talked to Mike Horowitz a few weeks ago about it. It's focused on the FISA, basis for the FISA and handling of the FISA applications. But by necessity, it looks back a little earlier than that. The people helping me with my review will be working very closely with Mr. Horowitz.""

He suggested the investigation into Trump may be broader than previously thought: “Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant. I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort to stop the threat as it is being represented.

“As I've said before, the extent there was any overreach I believe it was a few people in the upper echelons of the bureau and perhaps the department. But those people are no longer there, and I'm working closely with [FBI Director] Chris Wray, who I think has done a superb job at the bureau, and we're working together on trying to reconstruct exactly what went down.”

Earlier in the hearing, Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked, “Do you share my concerns about the FISA process?”

Barr replied simply: “Yes.”

The Steele dossier was used in applications to the FISA Court to justify warrants against at least one Trump associate, Carter Page. Steele was paid for his research by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was funded in part by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny, with Barr saying Wednesday the DOJ is now investigating whether his dossier was based in part upon Russian disinformation.

Last year, Horowitz announced the launch of the FISA abuse investigation after requests from both then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Republican members of Congress. The lawmakers claimed the Justice Department and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign, as well as during the Trump administration.

Horowitz said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Page].”

He stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

Barr, who stood by his use of the word “spying” in front of the Senate Wednesday, said the DOJ inspector general report could be in by the end of June."
"Plan to move USDA jobs, possibly to Georgia, pits Perdue against ally",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/plan-move-usda-jobs-possibly-georgia-pits-perdue-against-ally/cVzwBZ6sQOhlAvvIg51IZJ/,"Leaders in dozens of states covet the headquarters of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture for their 600-plus high-paying jobs and expected spinoff investments from vendors. Some observers think, because Perdue was governor of Georgia, the two Peach State cities have an inside track against the 66 other locations still in contention.

But standing in the way is U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, one of Perdue’s longtime allies who holds a key post in the new Democratic-controlled House.

The political friction threatens to throw a kink into Georgia’s pitch as Perdue angles for a decision this summer.

In his 26 years on Capitol Hill, Bishop has honed a reputation for steering federal dollars to his poor, largely rural southwest Georgia district. But Bishop panned Perdue’s proposal to move the agencies out of Washington, calling it “a bad idea” that would harm morale and potentially hamper the agencies’ objectivity.

And Bishop hasn’t shied from wielding his position as chairman of a powerful House subcommittee to try to block the move using Congress’ power of the purse.

“It does not make any sense and it seems to be a solution in search of a problem,” Bishop told Perdue at a recent budget hearing.

Perdue says shifting the bulk of the agencies’ employees out of Washington will help cut costs and bolster the department’s relationship with farmers. Even though he’s made overtures to Bishop in recent months, Perdue suggested he could circumvent Congress entirely.

“Congressman Bishop … is one of the ones we want to satisfy,” Perdue said during a recent stop at a USDA facility in Newnan. “We’ve been trying to be very patient with his people. If you’ve got questions, please let us address them and we’ll tell you the why, what, when, how that we’ve proceeded in this.”

The spat has created an awkward public rift between two powerful Georgians whose friendship dates to their days as Democrats entering the state Senate together in 1991. It’s also put Bishop at odds with other members of Georgia’s congressional delegation, many of whom support relocating the agencies.

State economic development officials, meanwhile, find themselves in a bind. They view Bishop as a friend in Washington, and they need his support for other issues such as Hurricane Michael relief. But they also desperately want the new headquarters and quietly hope the dust settles.

Bert Brantley, the chief operating officer for the state Department of Economic Development and an aide to Perdue when he was governor, steered clear of the political controversy. Instead, Brantley touted the potential for spinoff jobs and the chance to attract companies wanting to serve the USDA.

He pointed to the U.S. Army Cyber Command, scheduled to relocate from Maryland to Fort Gordon near Augusta next year and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as two federal headquarters — albeit on larger scales — that have become a boon to their communities.

“We are hopeful that all of our delegation and political leaders see the benefit of a project like this coming to Georgia,” Brantley said of the USDA facilities. “We completely understand and respect everyone’s differing perspective.”

‘No hard data’

Bishop holds immense power over Perdue as chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that writes spending bills for the Department of Agriculture. The two are chummy and have generally been in sync on major policy issues.

Over the past two years, Perdue has put his stamp on the USDA, taking the first steps to reorganize several chunks of a massive bureaucracy and the 100,000-person department he oversees. Still, his announcement in August about wanting to move the ERS and NIFA — which conduct and fund agricultural research — reportedly caught many of his own staff members off guard.

Cutting costs and moving researchers closer to the field, Perdue said, “will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone.’ ”

The move infuriated Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, who said they were blindsided and didn’t receive a cost-benefit analysis from the USDA.

In a swipe at Perdue, Bishop called it “ironic” that the proposed move of two research agencies had “no hard data supporting it.”

A top Perdue adviser testified that analysis will be released closer to when the USDA picks the winning city. The search, which started with 136 expressions of interest from 35 states, was recently narrowed to 68 cities, including Athens and Griffin. Another cut is pending.

Both of Georgia’s candidates rely heavily on the University of Georgia, a land-grant university and agricultural powerhouse. Airport access is a critical need outlined by the USDA, and both sites are within about an hour of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, depending on traffic.

Brantley, the Georgia economic development official, said Griffin and Athens check all the boxes of the USDA’s criteria, including low costs for operations and living, easier commutes than the D.C. metro area and high quality of life.

For Bishop, “it’s not a question of parochial interest,” he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Quality of life

Republican members of Georgia’s delegation largely support the state’s bids.

“We believe relocating ERS and NIFA would build upon USDA’s capacity and improve the agency’s ability to recruit top talent from universities across the nation while being closer to rural America and reducing taxpayer expenditures,” 32 GOP House members, including U.S. Reps. Austin Scott of Tifton and Rick Allen of Evans, wrote in March.

Bishop’s four Georgia Democratic colleagues, meanwhile, are publicly sidestepping the fight.

Scientific groups including the American Statistical Association, the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and the Union of Concerned Scientists, support Bishop. They fear a relocation would undermine the quality of the agencies’ work.

“If it’s such a good idea and (Perdue) has some real reasons, why wouldn’t he share them and build a coalition of people that support it?” said Gale Buchanan, a former USDA official and onetime dean of UGA’s College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences who opposes the relocation. “Getting Congress on board, to me, would be a step in the right direction.”

Bishop tried to block the move earlier this year in a must-pass spending bill, though the provision was eventually watered down.

The USDA hired the consulting firm Ernst & Young to evaluate sites, and Perdue said he’s committed to conducting “a very transparent and professional” search.

Though Perdue said he’s willing to work with Congress, he said he’d take unilateral action if necessary.

“I do believe I have the legal authority to do this (within the powers of) the executive branch,” Perdue said, “but I would love to do it with Congress’ blessings.”

The USDA’s internal watchdog is currently reviewing whether that is indeed the case and if Perdue followed proper relocation procedures.

In a recent hearing, Bishop said Perdue’s plan would hurt morale in agencies already battered by staff departures and proposals for deep budget cuts. Keeping ERS and NIFA staff near other federal research agencies, he said, would help them meet their mission.

John Boyd, a site selection consultant in New Jersey, called government agency relocations “the next frontier of headquarters attraction.”

Modern communications and air travel lessen the need for government to be centrally located, Boyd said.

Many real estate interests want the federal government to move some functions out of the Washington area because office space is so expensive. Amazon recently selected a site in Northern Virginia for its second headquarters, a move that’s only going to make office space and talent even pricier, Boyd said.

The sprawling USDA could be a prime candidate for other relocations. It’s also something that could draw support from Republicans and rural Democrats, Boyd said.

For his part, Bishop said the tiff hasn’t harmed his relationship with Perdue. The two recently appeared together at an event at Fort Valley State University.

“Reasonable minds can disagree,” he said.

As for whether Perdue has the authority to circumvent Congress, the longtime appropriator was more tart.

“Well, maybe he does,” Bishop said, “but he has to have money to spend to do it.”

Grijalva demands DHS explain release of migrant families into Yuma instead of Phoenix,https://www.azcentral.com,"['Daniel González', 'Published P.M. Mt May']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2019/05/01/grijalva-why-dhs-releasing-migrant-families-yuma-not-phoenix/3647231002/,"Arizona U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva (Photo: Rick Scuteri/AP)

Rep. Raul Grijalva is asking the Department of Homeland Security to explain why the Border Patrol is releasing large numbers of migrant families in Yuma, overwhelming the city's one shelter, even though much larger Phoenix has more shelters and plenty of bed space.

In a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Grijlava, an Arizona Democrat whose district includes Yuma, said he traveled to the border city last week, where humanitarian groups told him more migrant families are being released in Yuma and fewer in Phoenix.

""In the past, your agency was releasing a higher number of families in Phoenix, but it appears that there was a change in your agency's internal policy and practices,"" Grijalva wrote.

Grijalva said in the letter that DHS needs to coordinate with humanitarian groups providing assistance to migrants released by the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""Additionally, I would like more details about why your agency is now releasing more families n Yuma, Arizona, where capacity is severely limited instead of a more centrally located city like Phoenix with more available resources,"" Grijalva wrote. ""With increasingly high numbers of asylum-seeking families arriving at our southern border, I expect an expedient reply to this letter.""

The Arizona Republic published an article about community groups questioning why in late March the Border Patrol decided to suddenly start releasing large numbers of migrant families on their own recognizance in Yuma, rather than continuing to transfer them to ICE custody for release in Phoenix.

In recent months, community groups have developed a network of nearly 30 churches to temporarily house migrant families released by ICE until arrangements can be made for them to travel by air or bus to unite with relatives or sponsors in other states. They are required to report to immigration authorities or immigration courts in those states.

Some community groups have questioned whether the Trump administration is intentionally creating chaos in border communities by haphazardly releasing large groups of migrant families in an effort to justify calls for Congress to end ""loopholes"" that require the government to release migrant families seeking asylum rather than detain them for long periods.

Yuma's mayor, Doug Nicholls, declared a state of emergency in April, after the city's one migrant shelter, run by the Salvation Army, exceeded its 200-person capacity.

Is America Ready for a Gay President? ‘You’re Going to See the Wall Crumble’,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeremy W. Peters'],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-2020.html,"A lot of the younger generation grew up with kids who were out in high school, or in middle school even. So they wouldn’t see that as extraordinary. But does that make you worry about losing perspective on the progress that has been made?

It’s worthy of celebration that they lived their adolescence and young adulthood in a far different culture than I did. It’s what we worked so hard for all these decades. I try talking to them about what it was like growing up in the ’70s. And I never even fantasized or dreamed of getting married, of having kids, of having job protection, of being able to be open and in politics. I never dreamed that I would be anything but fearful and hide. Or the alternative was to move to Greenwich Village or San Francisco.

For people who are not quite there yet, do you think that in order for them to support a gay candidate they need to see something else first, something other than gay? Like small-town mayor or veteran, as is the case with Mr. Buttigieg?

But isn’t that true of any candidate that isn’t a straight white male? The women candidates, the African-American candidates, the Latino candidates, Asian candidates. We all have to prove ourselves as worthy of being elected rather than simply saying, “Oh, I have this difference, so elect me.” You don’t see candidates start off with whatever their diversity is. What they talk about is what their experience is, what they bring to the office.

There’s no question the “first” aspect of Obama’s 2008 campaign motivated people, especially African-Americans, in historic numbers. Do you expect something similar with Mr. Buttigieg or are there not enough people who will think that the first gay president is an equivalently significant milestone?"
Let’s grade the State Department’s director of policy planning on her grand strategy musings!,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Daniel W. Drezner', 'Daniel W.

On the first anniversary of taking office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addresses unveils a new departmental ""ethos"" in the lobby of the State Department in April 2019. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything

Once upon a time, the director of policy planning for the State Department was a pretty prestigious job. George Kennan, he of the “Long Telegram” and “Sources of Soviet Conduct” fame, was the first director. Some of the others — Paul Nitze, Bob Bowie, Walt Rostow, Dennis A. Ross, James Steinberg, Richard Haass, Anne-Marie Slaughter — have been among the more distinguished foreign policy thinkers in this country. A strong director of policy planning can serve as a vital adjunct to the secretary of state and act as a reminder about the nation’s strategic interests. A good policy planning director is adept at avoiding trivia, distinguishing the important from the urgent, and acting as a check against an administration’s worst impulses.

Brian Hook, the director of policy planning under Rex Tillerson, was granted a tremendous amount of authority but stumbled badly. He was a relative neophyte attempting to counsel a complete neophyte on the ins and outs of the job. He did ... poorly.

When Mike Pompeo came on, he hired Kiron Skinner to run policy planning. In contrast to Hook, she has thought about this stuff for a while. She has the academic credentials and publishing record one would expect for that job. She is also an African American woman, a rarity in the upper echelons of the Trump administration (particularly in the diplomatic corps).

Since coming on in September of last year, however, Skinner has made some odd statements. She penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed last December that made it clear she had written Mike Pompeo’s badly received Brussels speech that caricatured multilateralism beyond all recognition. In the op-ed, she claimed that “the Trump administration is acting to preserve a just, transparent, and free world of sovereign states,” which sounds way too close to Vladimir Putin’s notion of “sovereign democracy” for my comfort.

On Monday, she sat down with Slaughter to chat about the Trump administration’s grand strategy at the New America Foundation. The New Yorker’s Masha Gessen attended and found it unnerving:

A large part of Skinner’s job is listening to what the President says and trying to make sense of it. She said as much. “The president provides the hunches and instincts,” she said, “and it’s my job, and that of Secretary Pompeo, to turn those hunches and instincts into hypotheses.” She called the hypotheses the “Trump Doctrine” and the “Pompeo Corollary.” Slaughter, logically, asked what the Trump Doctrine was. “That’s a tough one,” Skinner responded, without a hint of irony. “It is, in a kind of broad way, a set of pillars that address 21st-century realities.” The pillars were: the “return to national sovereignty”; national interest; reciprocity in international relations and trade; “burden sharing,” particularly in defense; and “new regional partnerships” for what she described as “particular crises.”

Skinner’s comments unnerved Gessen for the same reason that her WSJ op-ed unnerved me: “I had heard the isolationism and destruction of Putin’s rule be framed in phrases such as ‘sovereign democracy’ and in a lot of other plausible-sounding policy gobbledygook that served to rob every word of familiar meaning.”

To be fair, however, Skinner did say some things that were a lot of things, but decidedly not gobbledygook. The Washington Examiner’s Joel Gehrke reported on that element of Skinner’s comments, in which she was described as leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations akin to what Kennan did for the Soviet Union:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.... “The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”.... Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department. “It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That’s not really possible with China.”

So there’s a lot going on in just those few paragraphs. Because I was just handed a whole bunch of final papers to grade, I have grading on the brain right now. Here’s how I would grade Skinner if she had made an oral presentation like this one for my Art and Science of Statecraft class:

Kiron,

You observe, correctly, that Donald Trump has forced the foreign policy community to revisit “first principles.” And what you said to Slaughter was certainly consistent with the key components of the Trump’s administration’s National Security Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition as the priority for the United States going forward. Furthermore, although controversial, your implicit use of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” frame does get at one aspect of the Chinese challenge: to Beijing, this is not about a rise to great power status, it is a return to that status, consistent with its civilizational history.

That said, there are some real flaws with your oral defense. For one thing, your claim that China represents the first non-Caucasian great power competitor to the United States is factually incorrect, unless the Germans really did bomb Pearl Harbor. For another thing, why in the name of all that is holy would you make a racial distinction with respect to the great powers?! If you want to say that China is Confucian, or based on a different set of civilizational principles than the United States, sure, give it a try. Why say “not Caucasian”?! Does this mean India or Japan or South Korea should also be approached differently, because they are not white civilizations?! Why use race as your unit of analysis?

Furthermore, if you are going to use a Huntingtonian frame, you should know that he treated Russia as “Orthodox” and therefore distinct from Western civilization. Sure, the Soviet Union incorporated the very Western thought of Karl Marx, but last I checked — hold on a sec — yep, I just checked again and it turns out that China’s ruling party is also totally into Marx! Why is China so different?

Finally, I am very unclear as to why China’s civilization renders it less vulnerable to human rights treaties than the Soviet Union. If you recall, conservatives really disliked the Helsinki Final Act when it was actually negotiated, and it caught many of them by surprise that it helped inspire the Charter 77 movement and other acts of dissidence. It is not like China has no history of dissident appeals to Western liberal values (see here and here). Furthermore, you should be familiar with works by Iain Johnston, or Stacie Goddard, or Rosemary Foot and Andrew Walter, that discuss how China’s participation in Western institutions has had an impact on its self-perception.

There are perfectly valid reasons for the Trump administration to prioritize China as a strategic threat. This is one of the few Trump statements that generates bipartisan support. If you are trying to articulate a “Sources of Chinese Conduct” essay, however, it would be a very good idea to get beyond the fact that China is not a country filled with Caucasians. In fact, maybe just disregard the race angle altogether. It inflames far more than it illuminates.

Kennan could write “Sources of Soviet Conduct” because he was a longstanding expert on Soviet politics. Your comments on China suggest you could use a few old Asia hands to help with some tutoring. You clearly have a lot more work to do to persuade me that American grand strategy isn’t doomed.

US Treasury yields rebound after Fed says inflation decline is 'transient',https://www.cnbc.com,"['Thomas Franck Fred Imbert', 'Thomas Franck', 'Fred Imbert']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/01/us-bonds-federal-reserve-meeting-in-focus.html,"U.S. government debt yields rebounded on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank sees a decline in inflation as merely temporary and not yet a worrisome sign for the economy.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note trimmed losses to around the flatline at 2.514%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 2.919%. The 2-year Treasury note yield, which moves inversely with price, reversed an initial 6-basis-point drop and was last seen 4 basis points higher at 2.312%.

The central bank held its benchmark rate in a target between 2.25% and 2.5%, matching investor expectations. The Fed, however, did adjust its language about inflation, noting a more anemic rise in prices during the first few months of 2019.

However, in a press conference following the Fed's statement, Powell added that while the Fed did observe the inflation downtick, he and others at the central bank believe that the lethargic price action is just temporary.

""We think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment and we don't see a strong case for moving in either direction,"" Powell told CNBC's Steve Liesman. ""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%.""

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Inflation, a critical topic for the Fed, threatens the value of government bonds by eroding the purchasing power of their fixed payments and is often cited by the central bank when it raises borrowing costs to try to cool down the economy. The central bank uses rates to try to balance maximum U.S. employment with stable price growth.

Fed officials have historically viewed 2% inflation as a level consistent with that of a healthy economy. Some Fed officials have grown more cautious as so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy categories, as struggled to hold at the central bank's target.

That could leave the Fed without much room to cut rates should it ever want to combat a downturn in the economy with cheaper lending.

Still, the Fed's statement didn't mark a significant change from their prior commentary and provided little evidence for those thinking the central bank could cut its overnight rate later this year, J.P. Morgan Chief U.S. Economist Mike Feroli told CNBC.

Wednesday's statement ""isn't trying to send a message. I think it's trying to convey how they're reading things. Which is: Growth is better, inflation is softer – all of that we knew before,"" Feroli said. ""If you thought they were kind of teeing up for a cut I would have thought you'd change something more than they did. They didn't change anything on inflation expectations."""
DOJ finalizes argument for gutting Obamacare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/doj-finalizes-argument-for-gutting-obamacare,"The Department of Justice on Wednesday spelled out its arguments siding with a federal judge who ruled last year that Obamacare was unconstitutional and needed to be thrown out.

""Instead of rewriting the statute by picking and choosing which provisions to invalidate, the proper course is to strike it down in its entirety,"" officials from the Department of Justice wrote in a brief filed ahead of the deadline Wednesday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans. The hearing on the case, Texas v. United States, is expected in July.

The appeal comes after a federal judge in December ruled that the healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, was unconstitutional. The judge sided with Republican state officials who filed the initial lawsuit and want the law to be thrown out as a result of the Trump-signed tax law that zeroed out Obamacare's fine for the uninsured. They argue that without the provision requiring individuals to have insurance, the rest of the law must fall, and the federal judge, Reed O’Connor, agreed.

Democratic attorneys general appealed the case, and the ruling is being stayed in the meantime.

The Trump administration's latest position is a shift from when the law was argued before O'Connor. The Trump administration previously argued that only the rules involving protections for people with pre-existing illnesses should fall. The protections say that insurers must cover a range of medical services and that they are not allowed to turn away sick people or charge them more than healthy people.

The administration changed its position to side with the GOP officials to have the whole law thrown out, writing in the brief filed Wednesday that ""upon further consideration and review of the district court’s opinion, it is the position of the United States that the balance of the ACA also is inseverable and must be struck down"" and that the fine on the uninsured ""works part and parcel with the other health-insurance reforms in the ACA.""

If all of Obamacare were to be declared unconstitutional, then other provisions in the healthcare law would be undone, including the expansion of the government's Medicaid program to the poor, cuts to drug prices in Medicaid, and a rule that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance plan until age 26."

Most people in this country do not support Donald Trump and never have. As The New York Times recently reported, he “is the only president in the history of Gallup polling never to earn the support of a majority of Americans even for a single day of his term.” This simple fact should be the starting point for all analysis of the 2020 presidential election, but rather than stating it at the outset, most pundits and columnists ignore a crucial reality. In doing so, they distort their coverage and default to Trump. Ad Policy

I almost hesitate to point this fact out because we need to sustain a strong sense of urgency in order to win back the White House, but it is important to allocate time, energy, and resources in the most informed and effective fashion. What we think has to happen in order to win in 2020 will drive our efforts in 2019, so we need to have this discussion now. Mathematically and empirically, as we enter this election cycle, Donald Trump is not favored to win reelection. The president is not the front-runner.

In normal election cycles, incumbent presidents are seen as likely to win reelection by virtue of their name recognition and media attention. Trump has both in droves, but this is no normal election cycle. The country is currently engaged in a titanic struggle that is evocative of the 1860s Civil War era and 1960s civil-rights movement. CNN political analyst Ron Brownstein describes it as a battle between the “coalition of restoration” and the “coalition of transformation.” The essence of the struggle, as Brownstein explains, is whether one embraces or opposes the “relentless economic, demographic and cultural changes reshaping American life.”

Brownstein’s framework is more on point than the pervasive view that the 2020 contest is a boxing match in which victory will belong to the party that selects the most effective pugilist. What will decide the 2020 election is not how many blows one can land on Trump, but how many bodies one can get to the polls to vote him out.

If we fail to learn the right lessons from 2016 (and 2018), we will waste many millions of dollars, squander precious time, and fail to properly reassemble the coalition that twice voted to put a Black man in the White House. An essential fact to keep in mind is that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. But her opponent won more electoral votes, so he must be in the stronger position today, right? Wrong.

Three things conspired to make the 2016 election a perfect and catastrophic storm, whereby the election was determined by a mere 78,000 votes in three states: Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (none of which, notably, gave Trump 50 percent of the popular vote). First, African-American turnout plummeted to its lowest level in nearly 20 years. Second, many Obama voters defected to the third- and fourth-party candidacies of Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. (The vote increase for Stein in Michigan from 2012 to 2016 was greater than the margin of difference between Clinton and Trump). Third, some Obama voters likely did vote for Trump, but not nearly as many as people think. More Obama voters switched to Johnson and Stein than to Trump, and Trump received fewer votes in Wisconsin than Romney did in 2012, troubling the popular perception that a wave of voters switched sides to swell the Republican ranks. Had any one of those three developments gone differently, Clinton would likely be president.

Obviously, since Trump is in the Oval Office, it is possible for him to win again. But is he favored to do so? No. Just as three key factors handed the election to Trump, three significant changes to the country and the electorate since 2016 now give the electoral advantage to the Democrats. First, the country continues to get browner by the hour (hence this administration’s maniacal focus on restricting and reversing immigration trends). Based on the analysis I did of census and government data for my book Brown Is the New White, there are 7,000 more people of color added to the US population every single day—as compared to just 1,000 whites—through a combination of births, deaths, and legal immigration. The Center for American Progress and other think tanks released a report last year showing that, if we had a do-over of the 2016 election, with every demographic group voting in 2020 exactly as they did in 2016, including third-party votes, Trump would lose, simply because there will be that many more people of color in the electorate in 2020. Roughly one-third of all eligible voters will be people of color next year, in what will be the “least white and most diverse electorate ever.” Current Issue View our current issue

The second changed reality on the electoral landscape is the tangible effect of the 2018 elections, which brought a new slate of Democratic leaders and a push to expand the electorate. Whereas the previous Republican governors of Wisconsin and Michigan worked overtime to restrict the franchise and aid and abet voter suppression, those states now have Democrats in their governor’s mansions (and African Americans in the lieutenant governors’ offices). The governmental apparatus can now be brought to bear to remove obstacles to voting instead of erecting them. In states that were decided by 11,000 (Michigan) and 22,000 (Wisconsin) votes, that’s a major development.

The work done to expand the electorate for the 2018 elections also created new battleground states out of formerly comfortable Republican territory. Democrats fielded historically strong gubernatorial candidates in Georgia, Florida, and Arizona last year, with the nominees all winning more votes than any prior Democratic gubernatorial nominee in their state. Although their candidacies fell agonizingly short of prevailing, the states saw major infrastructural changes: Florida restored the right to vote to people with felony records; Georgia was forced to overturn a harsh automated voter-purge system; and Arizona elected a secretary of state who supports automatic voter registration and has pledged to keep a close eye on the rolls. These changes will give Democrats a competitive edge in the three states, all of which are on the front lines of the demographic revolution. Moreover, the gubernatorial candidate standard-bearers in Florida and Georgia (Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams, respectively), among the party’s top rising stars, are focused on turning their 2018 supporters into permanent political forces.

The third development is that, finally, some whites who supported Trump have had enough. The 2018 election saw Republican support among white college-educated women drop from a 10-point GOP advantage to a statistical tie between the parties. That shift helped the Democrats take back control of the House. In determining political priorities and investment strategy, it is critical to realize that the data shows that the most movable white Republicans are white college-educated women, who many Democrats seem to have forgotten in their obsession over white working-class male Trump supporters.

To be sure, Democrats and progressives could still mess this up (I’m looking at you, Jill Stein and Howard Schultz). But the mathematical foundation is plain and simple: Trump starts out behind. The coalition of transformation is bigger than the coalition of restoration. The majority of people don’t support this president, and never have. If we can keep them from splintering or becoming dispirited, the Democratic nominee will become the 46th president in January of 2021."
"Alan Dershowitz: Barr is right, Mueller is wrong",https://thehill.com,[],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/441726-alan-dershowitz-barr-is-right-mueller-is-wrong,"Despite efforts by Democratic senators and some in the media to cast the dispute between Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrWall Street Journal editorial board: Dems vilifying Barr for 'acting like a real Attorney General' Biden says Barr 'should' resign: 'He's lost the confidence of the American people' Clinton: Calling for Barr resignation 'makes perfect sense' MORE and special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE as political, or even as a personal argument between close friends, it actually is much more about the substance of the law than it is about whether Barr accurately summarized the Mueller report.

Barr and Mueller fundamentally disagree about the law governing obstruction of justice by a president.

Even before Barr was nominated, he took the position, in a letter he wrote to the Justice Department, that for a president to obstruct justice he must go beyond committing a presidential act authorized under Article II of the Constitution.

Applied specifically to the case of President Trump Donald John TrumpConservatives seize on Alabama state Dem's abortion comments NYT disciplines editor after publishing cartoon depicting anti-Semitic tropes Wall Street Journal editorial board: Dems vilifying Barr for 'acting like a real Attorney General' MORE, Barr has argued that President Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyCNN to host James Comey town hall on 2-year anniversary of Trump firing him Alan Dershowitz: Barr is right, Mueller is wrong Comey on Barr: 'Amoral leaders' reveal 'character of those around them' MORE could never — regardless of the motive — constitute the act component of the crime of obstruction of justice, because a president has the constitutional authority to fire anyone in the executive branch.

Muller apparently disagrees with that legal and constitutional conclusion. In his report, he lists the firing of Comey as one among several acts that could form the basis of an obstruction of justice charge. The other acts that he lists also generally fall within the authority of a president.

Whose view of the law is correct? The answer should look to precedent. The two precedents most directly on point in resolving this important legal and constitutional question are the cases of Presidents Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush.

Nixon clearly exceeded his presidential authority when he ordered the payment of hush money to potential federal witnesses, when he destroyed evidence and when he told his subordinates to lie to the FBI. These are all independent crimes which are beyond the authority of anyone, even a president. Together, they constitute obstruction of justice, and Nixon was almost certainly guilty of that crime.

Contrast the Nixon case with the act committed by President Bush on the eve of the most significant criminal trial involving the Iran-Contra scandal. President Bush exercised his constitutional authority to pardon former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and a handful of other defendants. His purpose was clear: to end the Iran-Contra investigation and to prevent prosecutors from pressuring Weinberger and the others to testify against him.

Had similar actions been committed by anyone but a president, they clearly would have constituted an obstruction of justice. The special prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, described it in terms that left little doubt about Bush’s unlawful purpose. Walsh condemned their pardons as part of the “cover-up” and “deception and obstruction.” But because the act of pardoning is authorized by the Constitution, no president can be charged with obstruction by acting pursuant to his constitutional authority.

The same is true of the firing of James Comey by President Trump. As Comey himself has acknowledged, President Trump acted within his constitutional authority when he fired Comey, and such a constitutionally authorized act cannot form the basis for a criminal charge of obstruction, regardless of why the president may have done it.

It is shocking that the Mueller report never discusses the difference between the Nixon and Bush cases. That difference is central to a proper application of the obstruction of justice statute to presidential decisions. It draws a clear line between presidential acts that are within the authority of Article II, such as pardoning and firing, and presidential acts that fall outside Article II authority, such as bribing witnesses, suborning perjury or destroying evidence.

Both Barr and Mueller were aware of the Bush precedent, since both served in the Bush Justice Department. Perhaps they did not want to say anything negative about their former boss, especially so shortly after his death.

There are no Supreme Court decisions or even Justice Department positions that directly resolve the issue of whether “the President’s exercise of his constitutional authority to terminate an FBI director and to close investigations” can constitutionally constitute an obstruction of justice. The Mueller report also acknowledges the principle that “general statutes must be read as not applying to the President if they do not expressly apply where application would arguably limit the President’s constitutional role.” And it correctly concludes that “the obstruction statutes do not disqualify the President from acting in a case simply because he has a personal interest in it or because his own conduct may be at issue.”

Those three principles should end the matter. In the absence of a contrary precedent, the general obstruction of justice statute should not be deemed applicable to the commission of an act by a president authorized by the Constitution, even if it was self-serving. This conclusion applies not only to the firing of Comey, but to all actions taken by President Trump pursuant to constitutional authority under Article II.

So, the controversy between these two experienced lawyers goes well beyond whether Barr inaccurately described the Mueller report. That is a moot issue, since all Americans can decide that for themselves now that both the report and the letter have been made public.

The real controversy is whether President Trump’s actions, that were authorized by the Constitution, could constitute the crime of obstruction of justice. Barr is right in concluding it couldn’t. Mueller is wrong in concluding it could.

More trouble for Mallinckrodt: DOJ joins the fray in Acthar whistleblower suits,https://www.fiercepharma.com,['Kyle Blankenship'],,,,https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/more-trouble-for-mallinckrodt-doj-joins-fray-acthar-whistleblower-suits,"Mallinckrodt is no stranger to legal challenges, having fought through payer lawsuits on its extravagant price hikes and federal subpoenas for its sale of powerful opioids. Facing claims an acquired company paid off doctors for scripts, the drugmaker will now square off against the feds once again.

The U.S. Justice Department joined a pair of whistleblower suits alleging Questcor Pharma, acquired by Mallinckrodt in 2014, paid doctors to boost sales of its controversial H.P. Acthar Gel and retaliated against employees who threatened to blow the company’s cover.

A newly unsealed complaint alleges Questcor ran a “high-tiered strategy” to illegally market Acthar through “deceptive, false and misleading methods” and defrauded government healthcare programs through false claims.

Mallinckrodt said it is negotiating with the feds on a settlement and expects to reach an agreement quickly.

“Mallinckrodt has cooperated fully with the DOJ in its review of this historical conduct, voluntarily providing documents and information to the government,” the company said in an emailed statement. “While we are disappointed the DOJ has elected to proceed with the lawsuit, we have been in advanced settlement talks with the government over the past several months.”

RELATED: Mallinckrodt used 'dirty data' to snow payers on Acthar, whistleblower suit says

Federal prosecutors' decision to join in adds weight to the whistleblower allegations, which first surfaced in 2012. The lawsuits say Questcor cultivated a culture of impropriety around its Acthar marketing, including using “dirty data” to mislead payers.

Whistleblowers also allege the company retaliated against them after sham internal investigations turned up no wrongdoing.

Rasvinder Dhaliwal, a former associate director of market access for Questcor, said in a separate whistleblower suit—which the government has not joined—that she was fired and intimidated by company officials after bringing her concerns to management.

The renewed scrutiny on Questcor’s marketing strategy is just one of a slew of black marks for Acthar, which was previously targeted for its exorbitant price hikes.

In a payer lawsuit filed in October 2017, Medicare Advantage organizations accused Questcor and Mallinckrodt of sidelining a potential Acthar challenger to avoid competition and hiking the price of the drug to $34,000 from $40 per vial over the course of six years, an 850-fold increase.

The payer suit followed a $100 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that investigated claims that Questcor bought out competitor Synacthen Depot to hike Acthar’s price.

RELATED: Mallinckrodt subpoenaed, again, over sales of oxymorphone in growing opioid crisis

The DOJ's complaint against Mallinckrodt is not the company’s first run-in with federal prosecutors.

In February 2018, the company was hit with a subpoena from U.S. prosecutors in Florida requesting information on the company’s sales of its oxymorphone generics. A year earlier, Mallinckrodt settled with the DOJ for $35 million after massive diversions of the company’s opioids were reported on the streets of Florida"

Labor Department says gig workers aren't employees,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Irina Ivanova'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/labor-department-says-gig-workers-arent-employees/,"The U.S. Department of Labor sees those who labor for companies like Uber and Lyft as contractors rather than employees.

That decision will help the many such virtual marketplaces that have been sued for wrongful classification of workers.

A key reason the DOL cited for its decision is that these platforms give workers a great deal of control.

The Trump administration is no fan of big tech companies. But a recent decision from its Department of Labor could give a long-term boost to tech giants like Uber, Lyft and the soon-to-go-public Postmates.

These companies -- and many like them -- rely on a wide pool of on-demand workers who sign up through the companies' platforms to drive cars, make deliveries, run errands, walk dogs or clean houses. Many people doing this work disagree with the companies' assertion that they're not employees, but rather solo small-business proprietors using the platform of choice to perform their cleaning (or driving, or delivery) business.

Now the Department of Labor has weighed in, with an opinion letter stating that an on-demand company that appears to provide a cleaning service is correct to classify its workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The decision adds more heft to behemoths like Uber and Lyft and house-cleaning company Handy, all of which face lawsuits accusing them of wrongly classifying workers as independent contractors.

""For that particular company, the letter is sort of a get-out-of-jail-free card,"" said Maya Pinto, a senior researcher at the National Employment Law Project. ""It will be used by this one company and could prod other companies to get similar letters. We believe in most cases, if not all cases, the workers are under control of the company and are in fact employees,"" she said.

In the ""gig economy,"" more injuries for construction workers and truck drivers

Handy, which wasn't named in the letter, is ""a virtual marketplace company that ""operates in the so-called 'on-demand' or 'sharing' economy,'"" the DOL wrote. The marketplace requires workers' name, email and Social Security number to sign them up. It connects them with customers who pay on a per-job basis, and it provides training materials that workers can choose to review or not. The app does allow customers to rate workers and removes workers after they haven't been ""active"" for some time.

A key reason the DOL cited for its decision is that the workers on Handy's platform have a great deal of control. The platform itself doesn't require a minimum of cleaning jobs, allows the workers to sign up with competitor apps or to work directly with customers, and it allows workers to sometimes ask for higher pay than the platform sets.

Thousands of lawsuits



That's substantially different from Uber and Lyft drivers, whose rates are determined by the companies' ever-shifting policies and who are liable to get thrown off the platform once their customer rating dips below about 4.3 stars. Lyft, which went public recently, faces six class actions and ""thousands"" of individual actions accusing it of misclassifying employees, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission. Uber faces two such lawsuits, according to securities filings. Handy has been sued five times by workers.

""If workers are misclassified as independent contractors, and [a] court were to find they're employees, the employer could be responsible for back pay, overtime and minimum-wage violations and record-keeping violations. There could be [family and medical leave] implications, tax implications, workers' compensation implications,"" said Susan Harthill, a partner at Morgan Lewis, representing employers. ""Classification is a big concern for all businesses.""

The nature of ""platform"" work can sometimes create a truly gray area on the employee-contractor spectrum. But the cost difference between paying a employee and an independent contractor is so large, companies often choose to err in their favor while the decisions are fought out in court, saving themselves potentially millions of dollars. (A study last year on ride-hail drivers in New York found that if Uber considered its drivers employees, it would be the largest employer in the city.)

Hitting low-wage workers hardest



In exchange for freedom and flexibility, independent contractors give up most benefits that employees get, such as paid sick time, family leave, overtime or minimum-wage laws, and the right to start or join a union. That tradeoff often hits lowest-paid workers the hardest, labor advocates say.

""Where we see misclassification of workers is a lot of low-wage jobs that have a service sector aspect, or in construction, where companies have a lot of workers and they're trying to cut costs,"" said NELP's general counsel, Catherine Ruckelshaus. ""But the gig companies have made this a key part of their profitability."""

Sopkin, 54, has been working on energy, environment and telecommunications matters for a private law firm following his PUC service from 2003 to 2007. He’ll replace Doug Benevento at the EPA, who has been promoted to a national advisory role.

And he intends to build on Benevento’s approach of prioritizing uncontested core air quality and clean-up priorities of the agency, he said Tuesday in an interview with The Denver Post.

“I’m going to focus my attention on the most pressing problems, which are Superfund sites and ozone (air quality standard) attainment, and also to make sure states are doing their own jobs where they have primary authority,” Sopkin said.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to announce the appointment Wednesday morning. Sopkin will oversee environmental protection efforts in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana.

“Greg’s experience in public service and familiarity with the western region make him a great fit to lead the Region 8 office,” Wheeler said in a statement sent to The Post. “I look forward to working with Greg to advance the agency’s mission and protect human health and the environment for our mountain west residents.”

At the PUC, Sopkin favored a pro-market approach, conducting quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative proceedings. He drafted legal decisions, met with state lawmakers and looked into utility service outages. He previously worked as an assistant state attorney general representing the PUC in state and federal court.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser issued a statement praising Sopkin’s commitment to public service.

“The protection of our land, air and water depends on sound leadership at the EPA Region 8 office,” Weiser said. “Having a Coloradan with a background steeped in law and government administration will be valuable as we take on important issues in the future.”"
Defense Department agrees to send approximately 320 personnel to US southern border,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kate Sullivan', 'Barbara Starr']",04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/politics/dod-personnel-us-southern-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan on Monday approved a Department of Homeland Security request for additional support at the US southern border, according to a Pentagon spokesman.

""DoD personnel will assist in driving high-capacity (Customs and Border Patrol) vehicles to transport migrants; providing administrative support, including providing heating, meal distribution and monitoring the welfare of individuals in CBP custody; and attorney support to (Immigration and Customs Enforcement),"" Lt. Col. Jamie Davis told CNN.

Davis said approximately ""320 DoD personnel will be required to support the DHS request for assistance through September 30, 2019, at an estimated cost of $7.4M.""

CNN reported last week the DHS had requested 280 additional US troops and other logistical support for operations on the southern border.

The request comes after CBP released data showing there were more apprehensions on the US southern border in March than in any other month in more than a decade.
