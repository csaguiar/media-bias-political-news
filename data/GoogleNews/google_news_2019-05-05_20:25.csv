"Trump says tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will increase to 25%, blames slow progress in trade talks",https://www.cnbc.com,['Spencer Kimball'],05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/05/trump-says-tariffs-on-200-billion-of-chinese-goods-will-increase-to-25percent-on-friday.html,"Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump attend a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on November 9, 2017.

President Donald Trump said Sunday that tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will increase to 25% on Friday, despite repeated claims by the administration in recent weeks that trade talks with Beijing were going well.



The tariff rate on those goods was originally set at 10%. Trump had initially threatened to increase the tariffs at the start of the year, but postponed that decision after China and the U.S. agreed to sit down for trade talks.

In addition, Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $325 billion of Chinese goods ""shortly.""

The president said that trade talks with China are continuing, but are moving too slowly as Beijing tries to re-negotiate.

The U.S. imports goods from China totaling $539.5 billion and the trade deficit stood at $419.2 billion in 2018, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. If Trump follows through with his threats, virtually all goods imported from China to the U.S. would face some sort of tariff.

On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC that Trump remained hopeful that he could strike a deal with China.



The White House said Wednesday the latest round of talks had moved Beijing and Washington closer to an agreement. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said, ""Discussions remain focused toward making substantial progress on important structural issues and re-balancing the U.S.-China trade relationship.""

There had been multiple reports that China and U.S. were close to a trade deal, and an agreement could come as soon as Friday.

Major sticking points between the U.S. and China have been intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. There has also been disagreement as to whether tariffs should be removed or remain in place as an enforcement mechanism.

The S&P 500 is up more than 17% this year, partly on optimism that a trade agreement with China is coming soon. Apple CEO Tim Cook, for example, said on the company's earnings call last week that improved dialogue on trade and Beijing's economic stimulus had improved consumer confidence in the country.



""We certainly feel a lot better than we did 90 days ago,"" Cook said.

In January, Apple cut its earnings guidance due in large part to softening demand for iPhones in China.

""If you look at our results, our shortfall is over 100 percent from iPhone and it's primarily in greater China,"" Cook told CNBC at the time. ""It's clear that the economy began to slow there for the second half and what I believe to be the case is the trade tensions between the United States and China put additional pressure on their economy.""

However, Apple's stock has rebounded amid White House optimism about a China trade deal. The company's shares are up 34% year to date.

Biden labels Trump a 'clown' during campaign stop in South Carolina,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-labels-trump-a-clown-during-campaign-stop-in-south-carolina,"Former Vice President Joe Biden took a page out of President Trump’s playbook on Saturday when asked at a South Carolina fundraiser if he had a nickname for the president.

The 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner said he didn’t want to get down in the mud with Trump, but if he had to choose a moniker for the current White House occupant it would be a “clown.”

“There’s so many nicknames I’m inclined to give this guy,” Biden said, according to Politico. “You can just start with clown.”

Trump, who, during his 2016 presidential run, famously began doling out nicknames like “Crooked” Hillary Clinton, “Lyin” Ted Cruz and “Low Energy” Jeb Bush – has labeled Biden as “Sleepy Joe” when the former vice president declared his White House bid in April.

TRUMP HITS BIDEN'S 'DUMB' COMMENT IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW

At the private fundraiser on Saturday, Biden said Trump’s nicknames were part of his war of words with his political rivals that are meant to keep the discussions away from the issues.

“On every single issue and on every demeaning thing he says about other people, I have no problem responding directly,” Biden said. “What I’m not going to do is get into what he wants me to do. He wants this to be a mud wrestling match.”

The president has recently stepped up his attacks on social media – blasting everyone from the media reporting on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report to social media for being an alleged partner of the Democratic Party.

Biden said that Trump’s behavior – both on and off social media – has worried his fellow world leaders and that ""at least 14 world leaders"" have called him during Trump's tenure to express their unease.

Biden said British Prime Minister Theresa May asked him directly for reassurance that the U.S. and the United Kingdom ""still have a special relationship.""

BIDEN TOPS NEW NH POLL AS WELL AS NEW NATIONAL SURVEY

Biden said the U.S. under Trump ""is about to squander alliances"" built over generations. He noted that he's ""spent my entire adult life"" in foreign affairs, first with 36 years in the Senate then eight years as President Barack Obama's vice president.

The former vice president’s comments came on the same day that he lambasted Trump and the Republicans for pushing for stricter voter identification laws and charged that Jim Crow is ""sneaking back in.”

In criticizing Republican efforts to adopt more stringent voting rules, including identification requirements and curtailing early voting hours, Biden recalled the racial segregation laws of the past.

""You've got Jim Crow sneaking back in,"" he said, referring to the era before the civil rights movement. ""You know what happens when you have an equal right to vote? They lose.""

Biden centered much of his trip to the third state in the nation to hold a primary on the need to restore decency to the White House. ""Your state motto is, 'While I breathe, I hope,'"" he said at the rally after continuing his full-throated denunciation of President Trump. ""It's not a joke. We're breathing, but God, we have got to have hope.""

Biden will continue his trip Sunday by worshipping at Brookland Baptist Church in West Columbia.

The 2020 candidate’s trip to the Palmetto State comes after Biden opened his latest run for president with explicit appeals to white, working-class voters across the Midwest, pledging his support for unions and promising to rebuild the middle class. Now, Biden is trying to gauge whether his message will resonate among more diverse electorates. Black voters accounted for a solid majority of Democratic presidential primary ballots in 2016.

"Trump Names Mark Morgan, Former Head of Border Patrol, to Lead ICE",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'Michael Tackett']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/politics/trump-ice-mark-morgan.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Sunday named Mark Morgan, a former Obama administration official who has aligned himself with some of Mr. Trump’s hard-line positions on border security, as the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Mr. Morgan served as the Border Patrol chief at the end of the Obama administration, and was also previously an F.B.I. agent. He will lead the agency that arrests, detains and deports people who are in the United States illegally, after Mr. Trump last month withdrew his previous nominee, Ronald D. Vitiello, saying he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher direction.”

“I am pleased to inform all of those that believe in a strong, fair and sound Immigration Policy that Mark Morgan will be joining the Trump Administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ICE,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet. “Mark is a true believer and American Patriot. He will do a great job!”

The move continues a leadership churn at the Department of Homeland Security as Mr. Trump seeks to overhaul the department. In recent weeks, the president has forced out multiple top officials, including former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen."
Trump: 'Mueller should not testify',https://www.politico.com,"['Quint Forgey', 'Darren Samuelsohn', 'Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/05/robert-mueller-special-counsel-cicilline-1302632,"President Donald Trump’s tweet on Sunday could set up the most consequential legal battle related to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. | Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images Congress Trump: 'Mueller should not testify'

President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Robert Mueller “should not testify” before Congress, hours after a Democratic lawmaker confirmed that the House Judiciary Committee was still seeking to schedule a hearing with the special counsel later this month.

“Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!” the president wrote on Twitter, following a post in which he excoriated Mueller’s 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

“After spending more than $35,000,000 over a two year period, interviewing 500 people, using 18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats & 49 FBI Agents — all culminating in a more than 400 page Report showing NO COLLUSION — why would the Democrats in Congress now need Robert Mueller … to testify,” Trump tweeted.

“Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION,” the president added.

Attorney General William Barr has previously told Congress that he has no objection to Mueller, who is technically a Justice Department employee, testifying before lawmakers. Peter Carr, the special counsel’s spokesman, declined to comment on the president's tweet.

Earlier Sunday, a Judiciary Committee member, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), told “Fox News Sunday” that Mueller was tentatively scheduled to testify on May 15, but he later walked back that remark on social media.

“Just to clarify: we are aiming to bring Mueller in on the 15th, but nothing has been agreed to yet,” Cicilline wrote online . “That’s the date the Committee has proposed, and we hope the Special Counsel will agree to it. Sorry for the confusion.”

The House Judiciary chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), has previously said the committee was eyeing May 15 for Mueller to testify. The committee did not immediately respond to Cicilline’s comments.

The White House, Cicilline said in the Fox interview, has indicated it will not interfere with Mueller’s attempt to testify and “we hope that won’t change.”

Trump’s tweet — if interpreted by the attorney general as a direct order to stifle Mueller’s testimony — could set up the most consequential legal battle of the entire special counsel’s probe: Whether executive privilege can be used to halt executive branch employees from testifying about their investigation into the president.

The president’s post also aggravates a partisan fight over Mueller’s findings that was already underway Sunday morning, when Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) criticized the special counsel for not revealing sooner that he found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy by the Trump campaign to aid the Kremlin’s meddling in the 2016 election.

“It couldn’t have taken Bob Mueller that long to find that out,” King told a New York radio show. “The reports we get are that they knew a year ago there was no collusion. Well, didn’t he have an obligation to tell the president of the United States that? To let the world know?”

Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, later tweeted a news report on King’s comments, adding: “More evidence that Mueller probe was part of a political plan,ie., insurance policy, to remove or hurt ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩. They failed because people wouldn’t lie.”

It is possible that Mueller could also soon appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, after Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) asked him in a letter Friday whether he “would like to provide testimony regarding any misrepresentation” by Barr concerning an exchange he had with Mueller about the special counsel’s report.

Michael Goodwin: Did the NY Times just admit -- and defend -- Obama’s spying on Trump?,https://www.foxnews.com,['Michael Goodwin'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/michael-goodwin-did-the-ny-times-just-admit-and-defend-obamas-spying-on-trump,"They’ve done it, they’ve finally done it! The New York Times has picked up the scent of the scandalous spying on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and is joining the hunt for the truth.

That’s how the president and some supporters reacted after the Times reported the FBI sent a “cloaked investigator” to a London meeting with Trump aide George Papadopoulos in September of 2016. The cheering section saw the story as evidence that, in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, the facts were forcing even the Gray Lady to abandon its notorious anti-Trump agenda.

HILLARY CLINTON SLAMS TRUMP FOR FRIENDLY CALL WITH PUTIN, BLASTS BARR AS 'PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE LAWYER'

If only that were true. In reality, we’ll see pigs fly before we see the Times fully committed to getting to the bottom of what Trump calls ­“Spygate.”

The paper is still defending the dirty tricks of Barack Obama’s White House and its own role in spreading the Russia, Russia, Russia hysteria. It’s a relationship neither side can quit.

Instead of proving the Times is coming to its senses, Friday’s article about the 2016 London meeting is better seen as spin designed to protect deep-state sources feeling the heat. Attorney General Bill Barr’s promise to investigate the investigators spooked them and they are using their favorite media handmaiden to fight back.

The result is a story that takes a “modified limited hangout” approach, where fragments are presented as revelations while the full picture ­remains artfully hidden.

How the ACLU is setting up Trump for a field day in 2020,https://www.politico.com,"['Christopher Cadelago', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Darren Samuelsohn', 'Holly Otterbein']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/05/aclu-democrats-trump-2020-civil-liberties-1300563,"Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks during a Fox News town hall. | Matt Rourke/AP Photo 2020 elections How the ACLU is setting up Trump for a field day in 2020 The group is deploying hundreds of people to get Democratic candidates on video taking positions on hot-button topics like felon voting.

The debate over allowing the Boston Marathon bomber to vote started with a man named Rick in Muscatine, Iowa.

At a town hall in early April, he reminded Bernie Sanders that prisoners in his home state of Vermont are allowed to vote and asked whether that right should be extended nationally. Sanders agreed it should, and before he knew it, he was being asked variations of the question at Fox News and CNN town halls. Sanders critics pounced, and the conservative outrage machine kicked into gear, fueled by President Donald Trump.

Story Continued Below

The chain of events didn't start by accident: Its genesis was orchestrated by the American Civil Liberties Union, which is coaching activists like Rick as part of a multimillion-dollar, below-the-radar campaign to get the 2020 candidates on record about its civil liberties priorities. In Hanover, N.H., an ACLU-linked voter got Kamala Harris’ commitment to support adding a third-gender marker on federal ID cards. The group is also putting Democratic hopefuls on the spot with sensitive questions about immigration and abortion rights.

Each of the exchanges has been captured on video and posted to YouTube, and the answers largely reflect a Democratic primary field that’s veering further left. But the ACLU is making that shift happen far more quickly and visibly than it might have otherwise — to the apparent delight of Trump and his supporters.

In the opening months of the campaign, the organization has trained hundreds of volunteers in early voting states and sent them to more than 150 events at which they ask questions around planned topics. To the organizers, the field of more than 20 candidates has a long way to go to meet their demands. But already the effort is forcing some staunch civil liberties and voting rights advocates to grapple with how their priorities are playing out on a large stage.

Sentencing Project Executive Director Marc Mauer, who wrote a Howard Law Journal article in 2011 arguing felony disenfranchisement policies are inherently undemocratic, acknowledged having mixed feelings about the sudden burst of public attention. “I wouldn’t have guessed that it would surface this quickly and this broadly,” Mauer, who is not a part of the ACLU effort, told POLITICO.

“It jump-started the issue, and I’ve seen a lot of support for that position that I wouldn’t have guessed was out there,” Mauer added. “But I would hate to see us have another Willie Horton election where we just get a very distorted discussion of an issue that’s important to democracy, but it’s one of 100 issues that should be debated, not the sole one debated.”

A few weeks after he appeared in Iowa, Sanders said at the CNN town hall he believes the right to vote is inherent in American democracy — “even for terrible people.” Moderator Chris Cuomo — presumably because the debate was held in New Hampshire — had provocatively framed the issue around whether the Boston Marathon bomber should be allowed to vote.

“Once you start chipping away and you say, ‘Well, that guy committed a terrible crime — not going to let him vote,’” Sanders said. “‘Well, that person did that. Not going to let that person vote’ — you’re running down a slippery slope.”

Trump seized on Sanders’ answer: “Let the Boston bomber vote — he should be voting, right?” Trump told members of the National Rifle Association last week. “I don’t think so. Let terrorists that are in prison vote — I don’t think so. Can you believe it? But this is where some of these people are coming from.”

Ronald Newman, the ACLU’s national political director, said it isn’t his job to worry about the political firestorm. He held up Sanders’ answer in Iowa as a model of what the group is trying to accomplish: to inject its priorities into the political bloodstream and, over time, sway public opinion.

Along with the incarcerated voting query, the ACLU is asking candidates for specific proposals to cut the federal prison population by 50 percent, end the use of detainers, reduce immigration detention by 75 percent and lift the Hyde Amendment and other government bans on insurance coverage of abortion.

In Las Vegas, Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro — who during an earlier stop in Concord, N.H., had agreed to back phasing out the detention of immigrant families seeking asylum or refugee status — said local law enforcement shouldn’t act as pseudoimmigration agents for the federal government.

ACLU staffers and volunteers have pushed several candidates on ending cash bail, expanding voting registration opportunities and making Election Day a federal holiday. Candidates Kirsten Gillibrand and Beto O’Rourke separately agreed to support a third-gender classification at the federal level, joining Harris.

The ACLU plans to spend $30 million in the 2020 cycle. After gathering more videos, officials plan to send questionnaires to the candidates and invite each of them to meet with people affected by the policies for which the group is advocating. The ACLU also plans to conduct a voter education drive. “Not only giving them that information but pushing turnout to make sure they take that information with them to the ballot box,” Newman said.

Despite the early attention, it’s unclear how much the program will register with early-state voters. But the ACLU looks intent to execute its plan.

During internal debates over what questions to get Democratic candidates to weigh in on, the ACLU focused on issues that would reveal meaningful distinctions between the candidates. On voting rights for incarcerated people, only Sanders has been unequivocal, while others, including Castro and O’Rourke, have said they would separate nonviolent offenders.

“That’s something we will continue to push them on,” Newman said of the specificity of the answers coming in.

“If you do give us one of those classic no-substance, boilerplate responses,” he added, “there’s a 50 percent chance that when you show up at the next coffee shop, you’re going to run into one of our volunteers.”"
Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

KAMALA HARRIS TEARS INTO BARR AT SENATE HEARING, AS 2020 DEMS PILE ON AG

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.

‘My dad died at their hands’: WWII vet fatally injured in VA nursing home,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/04/veteran-death-after-traumatic-injury-in-va-nursing-home/3402591002/,"CLOSE Surveillance video captured the deadly blow to the head of 91-year-old James “Milt” Ferguson Sr. Specialists say it could have been prevented. USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Iowa, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backwards. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes a massive brain bleed that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines – which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections – inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection-control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide, but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't transported to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m. and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was transported to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to adequately evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at? That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father.

He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at the Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility just outside Des Moines, where his mother worked as a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm – his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter – an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few aggressive outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over again. He was agitated and again, he ""wandered into and out of peers rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team – psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers – met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" during the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor quickly had a sedative administered and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, the policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day, in agitation and confusion, they should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such situations can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody, somewhere who could have seen that this happened and – particularly when he wheeled himself – to have gone in and intervened, 'Let me help you, let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, the executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and then does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson still has his father’s wheelchair in the garage. He keeps the sweatshirt his father was wearing when he last used the chair. Ferguson has retained a lawyer, Brad Biren, to help him figure out next steps and how to hold the VA accountable.

“Somebody didn’t watch my dad and let him die,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a safe place.”

DOJ attorneys defend Mueller's ability to investigate Trump in Roger Stone filing,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/03/politics/doj-mueller-trump-investigation/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department attorneys prosecuting Roger Stone -- who no longer work under special counsel Robert Mueller -- defended the special counsel's investigation of President Donald Trump Friday, saying it inherently did not hamper his ability to lead the country.

The argument came amid a series of filings Friday night in Stone's case, in which prosecutors pushed back on the longtime Trump ally's legal attacks on Mueller and the criminal charges he faces . Stone has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and asked the court to dismiss them.

""While the Department of Justice's position is that 'the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions,' it also takes the position that a criminal investigation during the President's term is permissible,"" the prosecutors wrote.

If the Constitution ""prevented any investigation of a President or his campaign while he was in office, the government could not preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documentary materials are available. Nor, it would seem, could the government conduct an investigation that may clear the President of alleged wrongdoing.""

Pentagon departure expands vacancies in DOD,https://thehill.com,[],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/442041-pentagon-departure-expands-vacancies-in-dod,"Another Pentagon official is stepping down later this month, adding to the void of confirmed top-tier officials within the Department of Defense (DOD).

Robert Daigle, the director of DOD’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office, will leave after two years in the role.

“On behalf of the entire Department of Defense, I thank Bob Daigle for his extraordinary service over the past two years,” Shanahan said.

He adds that Daigle and his team “have been key architects of the investment strategies that ensure our military is ready to compete, deter, and win in any high-end fight of the future. These investments have formed the foundation for our Department's FY19 and FY20 strategy-driven budgets, enabling DoD to field new technologies and weapons systems at the speed of relevance.

“We wish Bob and his family all the best in his future endeavors. His strong leadership will be missed across the Department.”

Defense News reported that Daigle is leaving in mid-May to rejoin the private sector.

Daigle had led CAPE since August 2017, overseeing several major decisions, including the move to shutter the USS Truman aircraft carrier — a plan overturned by the Trump administration earlier this week. He also was behind the requirement that the Air Force buy more F-15X fighter aircraft, though service leaders had not asked for them.

His departure adds to the growing number of top positions left empty or filled by individuals in an acting basis, including the secretary and deputy secretary of defense, the Pentagon's chief management officer, the office of the undersecretary of personnel and readiness and the Air Force secretary."
Code Pink refusing to leave Venezuela’s DC embassy as State Dept. slams ‘trespassers’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/code-pink-refusing-to-leave-venezuelas-dc-embassy-as-state-dept-slams-trespassers,"Liberal activists from the anti-war group Code Pink are refusing to leave the abandoned Venezuelan embassy in Washington, vowing to protect the building from a “hostile takeover” as the U.S. State Department labels them “trespassers” and calls on them to leave.

About 50 pro-regime activists have been living inside the building for several weeks in support of embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro. In recent days, they’ve clashed outside the embassy with supporters of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has called for a military uprising in Venezuela and has the support of the Trump administration.

VENEZUELANS CLASH WITH PRO-MADURO CODE PINK ACTIVISTS IN TENSE SCENE OUTSIDE DC EMBASSY

“We feel that the elected government and the government that holds power and the government that’s recognized by the United Nations is the Maduro government, and they deserve to have their embassy here,” Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin told Fox News in an interview outside the embassy in D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood, as rain drenched the activists outside. “That’s why we’ve been here.”

The United States and others countries believe Maduro's most recent election was fraudulent and have said he's not the legitimate president of Venezuela. But Benjamin has repeatedly said activists are there to prevent a “hostile takeover” of the embassy. Benjamin said the group has the permission of the Maduro government to stay in the embassy.

A State Department spokesperson in a Thursday statement called for the activists to leave, saying, “Any unauthorized individuals on the property are trespassers.”

“The Venezuelan government, led by interim President Juan Guaido, has legal authority over the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, D.C.,” the spokesperson said, adding, “We encourage the remaining unauthorized individuals to vacate the building and to conduct any future protest peacefully and through legal means.”

On Tuesday, flag-waving and national-anthem singing demonstrators, many of whom were born in Venezuela, quickly outnumbered those from Code Pink. They gathered outside the embassy to protest Code Pink members' presence, demanding they leave.

“This group – the Code Pink – has taken the embassy,” one pro-Guaido protester, Giuliano Gandullia, 40, told Fox News outside the embassy. “We want to enter. We want to take over. And demonstrate that it belongs to us.”

The gathering of protesters on Tuesday forced city police in Washington to close down 30th Street, as uniformed Secret Service officers stood between the Maduro and Guaido protesters.

ILHAN OMAR FACES BACKLASH AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT US 'BULLYING' IN VENEZUELA

But while law enforcement has been on the scene during protests, the activists inside have not been arrested or forced out.

Alaina Gertz, a spokeswoman for the D.C. police, said any police “involvement would be on public space and not diplomatic property.”

A Secret Service spokesman official said the Secret Service Uniformed Division’s Foreign Missions Branch patrols diplomatic locations in Washington’s embassy district, and officers have been on scene to public safety during ongoing demonstrations.

Two Code Pink protesters standing at the door of the embassy this week held a sign that said: “Hands off Venezuela.” Another sign hanging from the building read, “Nicolas Maduro is the president.”

VENEZUELA SEES UNREST AS GUAIDÓ SEEKS POWER

On Thursday afternoon, amid a downpour, Benjamin said the group isn’t afraid of being evicted and wouldn’t contemplate what the activists would do if Maduro leaves the country.

“I think it’s a silly question,” Benjamin said. “Because Maduro is not going to leave.”

Code Pink refers to the group's presence as the “Embassy Civilian Protection Collective” and says the pro-Guaido protesters are stopping new people, food and supplies from getting inside the building. Until recently, the group said, they were enjoying themselves.

“Inside it’s a very good collective – until this very aggressive mob showed up,” Benjamin said. “We were having events every single night. We were doing educational activities. We had over 100 hundred people coming into the events.”

Meanwhile, the pro-Guaido protesters are outside the embassy holding signs like “Venezuela wants Democracy, not another Cuba.” In interviews, these protesters emphasized that they are from Venezuela – unlike many of the Code Pink protesters.

“Those people right there, they’re not Venezuelan. They don’t have a passport. They don’t have our IDs,” said 32-year-old Clemente Pinate, who said he is from the country and came to the United States when he was 12.

The Guaido protesters are using bullhorns to call on Code Pink to the leave the embassy, which was officially closed by Maduro earlier this year.

“We’re here today to denounce the trespassing of Code Pink,” said Carla Bustillos, 39. “This is a property of the people of Venezuela. It’s an asset of the nation, and the nation is now facing a transition -- a transition to democracy.”"
A gay president? The majority of Americans believe the country isn't ready,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Harry Enten'],05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/politics/poll-of-the-week-gay-president/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show Beverly Hills, 90210.

A new Quinnipiac University poll finds that 70% of voters (including 86% of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic) say they are open to electing a gay president.

The same poll also discovered, however, that only 36% of voters (including 40% of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic) think the United States is ready to elect a gay president.

What's the point: Right now, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is one of the top 5 contenders vying for the Democratic nomination process. He is a married gay man.

These poll results suggest that most Americans -- and Democrats in particular -- are open to electing him president, so long as he meets other qualifications.

Yet, it seems like Buttigieg may run into electability concerns for the simple reason that Democrats don't think (perhaps wrongly if you believe this poll) the country is ready. It's also possible that some voters are not willing to admit to homophobia, while signaling it by saying essentially, ""I'm ready, but others may not be.""

Either way, this poll suggests that Buttigieg might hit a wall in a Democratic primary in which voters are placing a high emphasis on the ability to beat President Donald Trump.

I should note that polling on whether the country is ready for a gay president differs significantly from polling on whether Americans thought the country was ready for a black president in 2007 or a woman president in 2015.

Fox News poll taken after then-Sen. Barack Obama declared in February 2007 found that 69% of Democrats and 69% of voters thought the country was ready to elect a black president. In other words, electability was less of a problem for Obama then than Buttigieg now.

Voters were even more sure that the country was ready to elect a woman president after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared a second bid for the presidency in April 2015. A CBS News poll conducted in the spring of that year showed that 89% of Democrats and 78% of all Americans said the country was ready for a woman president.

Interestingly, in all three instances, more voters said they were ready for a black, female or gay president than thought the country was ready for one.

But even if Americans are more tolerant of gay Americans than voters think they are, more are prejudiced against gay Americans than they were against black Americans in 2007 or women in 2014. Today, about a quarter of all voters (including 10% of Democrats) told Quinnipiac that they weren't open to vote for a gay man for president. Back in 2007 and 2015, 5% or less of Americans and Democrats said they weren't willing to vote for a qualified black person and woman to be president, respectively.

Prejudice against gay Americans is evident in other polling as well. About 35% of Americans openly admitted in the 2018 General Social Survey that they thought ""homosexual sex relations"" were almost always or always wrong. Even more than 25% of Democrats said it was almost always or always wrong.

Now, Americans have certainly become more comfortable with the idea of a gay president than they used to be. The percentage of Americans who say they would vote for a gay person for president is up 15-20 points since 2007 , depending on the poll you look at. The percentage of Democrats who say they would vote for a gay person for president is up around 25 points.

Further, it's possible that if Buttigieg becomes successful on the campaign trail, then Americans may become even more open to the idea of a gay president.

Still, it's pretty clear from the numbers that there is still a portion of the electorate for whom Buttigieg's sexuality is an issue."
Trump says Robert Mueller should not testify before Congress about Russia probe findings,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Michelle Fox Spencer Kimball', 'Michelle Fox', 'Spencer Kimball']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/05/trump-says-robert-mueller-should-not-testify-before-congress.html,"President Donald Trump on Sunday said special counsel Robert Mueller should not testify before Congress about his investigation's findings in the Russia probe.



Trump had previously said he would not stand in the way of Mueller testifying and would leave the decision up to Attorney General William Barr, who has said he has no objection to the special counsel going before Congress.

On Sunday, House Democrat David Cicillin told Fox News that the Judiciary Committee was aiming for the special counsel to testify on May 15.

Trump later responded on Twitter, saying that Mueller's report found no collusion. In fact, the Mueller report said the special counsel did not investigate collusion, which has no legal definition, but instead examined allegations of coordinating and conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Though Mueller found extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, he said in his report that there was not sufficient evidence to establish conspiracy or coordination.

Trump questioned why the Democrats need the special counsel to testify.

""There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION. Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!"" Trump said.

Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction, but pointedly declined to exonerate the president. Instead, the special counsel documented several instances of possible obstruction crimes. Attorney General William Barr ultimately concluded that Trump did not commit obstruction in a four-page summary of the report's findings.

There have been growing calls for Mueller to testify after it was revealed he wrote Barr a letter complaining about the attorney general's summary of the special counsel's investigation, which was sent to Congress and later released to the public.

In his letter, Mueller said Barr's summary ""did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office's work and conclusions"" and had caused ""public confusion about critical aspects of the results.""

The attorney general has also refused to turn over to Congress notes from a phone call he had with Mueller about Barr's summary of the Russia probe."
Trump official names former Secret Service head to top DHS post,https://thehill.com,[],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/442096-trump-official-names-former-secret-service-head-to-top-dhs-post,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has named Randolph “Tex” Alles, the former head of the Secret Service, to a top Homeland Security post.

McAleenan announced Friday that Alles, who stepped down as Secret Service director this week, will take over as acting Deputy Under Secretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

ADVERTISEMENT In his role, Alles ""will oversee all aspects of the Department’s management programs, including financial, human capital, information technology, procurement, security, and asset management,"" according to the DHS statement.

The post has been held by Chip Fulghum, who stepped up to fill the position following the departure of Claire Grady. Grady, who served as DHS's acting deputy secretary, resigned last month amid a shakeup at the department.

""Mr. Fulghum has served the men and women of DHS with distinction since first joining in 2012, and we are forever grateful for his service. I wish him the very best in the years ahead,"" McAleenan said in the statement Friday.

The White House announced last month that Alles was being replaced as Secret Service director by James Murray, the former deputy assistant director of the Office of Protective Operations.

Alles departed the agency amid reports that his relationship with Trump had soured for months. Trump reportedly made fun of the Secret Service director’s appearance, calling him “Dumbo” because of his ears.

"White House rips Mueller in letter to DOJ, says team ‘failed in their duty to act as prosecutors’",https://www.foxnews.com,"['John Roberts', 'John Roberts Currently Serves As The Chief White House Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc . He Joined The Network As A Senior National Correspondent In January', 'Based In The Atlanta Bureau.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-rips-mueller-in-letter-to-doj-says-his-team-failed-in-their-duty-to-act-as-prosecutors,"The White House tore into Robert Mueller and his investigators in a recent letter to Attorney General Bill Barr that argued the special counsel's team included ""political statements"" in their Russia report and ""failed"" to act as traditional prosecutors -- while stating President Trump reserves his right to invoke executive privilege on matters related to the report.

In the April 19 letter to the Justice Department obtained Thursday by Fox News, White House Counsel Emmet Flood laid out a series of concerns with the Mueller report, specifically on the team's handling of the investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice.

TRUMP: 'NO REASON' TO HONOR DEMS' 'VERY PARTISAN' SUBPOENAS

“The Special Counsel and his staff failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors,” Flood wrote, complaining that the report ""suffers from an extraordinary legal defect"" by failing to comply with the ""requirements of governing law.""

Flood raised concerns that the team did not reach a determination on the obstruction question while still going into great detail about the probe's findings and including a pointed passage that stated the probe did not exonerate the president. That passage read: “The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Flood noted prosecutors “simply are not in the business of establishing innocence” and described these as ""political statements.""

The letter was sent a day after the redacted version of the Mueller report was made public. But the points in the letter aligned with testimony from Barr himself this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he said he did not understand why Mueller did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question.

Flood, in his letter, said ""the one thing the SCO (Special Counsel's Office} was obligated to do is the very thing the SCO -- intentionally and unapologetically -- refused to do. The SCO made neither a prosecution decision nor a declination decision on the obstruction question."" Flood complained that the report was instead “laden with factual information that has never been subjected to adversarial testing or independent analysis.”

He also said Mueller ""produced a prosecutorial curiosity,"" describing the report as ""part 'truth commission' report and part law school exam paper.""

Despite Trump himself claiming the report exonerated him, the document only said Mueller did not find evidence of collusion with Russia while leaving the obstruction question open. Barr determined the obstruction evidence did not constitute a crime, but the report's section on that issue included extensive and damaging details about the president's actions, including the allegation that he told his former White House counsel to have Mueller removed.

Flood took issue with the analysis that Mueller intentionally didn’t issue a conclusion on obstruction, but rather decided to provide information about his investigation so Congress could decide whether to take action, like impeachment.

WHITE HOUSE DENIES DEMS INFO ON SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS

“By way of justifying this departure, it has been suggested that the report was written with the intent of providing Congress some kind of ‘road map’ for congressional action,” Flood wrote, adding if that’s the case, “it too serves as additional evidence of the [Special Counsel Office’s] refusal to follow applicable law.”

Flood, meanwhile, asserted that Trump waiving executive privilege on the report does not constitute a blanket waiver, as senior aides face subpoenas on Capitol Hill related to the Russia investigation.

The letter comes as the White House has signaled it intends to vigorously oppose subpoenas that might run up against executive privilege, a power sanctioned by the Supreme Court that allows the president and members of the executive branch to shield certain internal communications from disclosure, absent a compelling overriding justification.

“We're fighting all the subpoenas,"" Trump told reporters at the White House last week.

Trump has argued that he has been “transparent” as president and had already turned over documents to Mueller’s team – suggesting it’s not necessary to cooperate with the Democratic probes.

The White House has signaled plans to fight House Democrats' subpoena of testimony and documents from ex-White House counsel Don McGahn. The brewing fight over the McGahn subpoena was poised to set up a series of other contentious legal showdowns as Democrats seek to publicly question more current and former Trump aides who featured prominently Mueller's report on the Russia investigation.

DOJ Asks Courts To Lighten Up On Qualcomm As It Battles China For 5G Supremacy,https://dailycaller.com,"['Chris White', 'Energy Reporter']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/03/doj-qualcomm-technology/,"The Department of Justice wants the legal system to go lenient on Qualcomm as the telecommunications giant wrestles with a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit claiming the company is a monopoly.

“[I]n the event that the court finds liability on any of the FTC’s claims, the court should order additional briefing and hold a hearing on issues related to a remedy,” the DOJ said in a statement of interest filed in a U.S. district court in California. The court should be careful, the DOJ added, noting its concerns that a punishment could affect fifth generation mobile phone development.

“There is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,” the DOJ wrote Thursday. “Such an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.”

Officials are not happy with the lawsuit. Representatives with the Department of Defense, for instance, had sit-down discussions with the FTC in March to encourage the agency to stop suing Qualcomm. They argued that financial losses from a court defeat would hamper Qualcomm’s ability to compete with China’s top chip maker, Huawei.

Qualcomm’s legal troubles began in 2017 when Apple started complaining that some of the technology in the telecom’s patent bundle also is in its chips. In short, Qualcomm is getting paid twice for the same technology, Apple argued. The FTC sued Qualcomm in January 2017 as well over the same complicated reason.

Apple licensed Qualcomm’s technology for the iPhone, helping the phone maker break into the wireless industry. The decision allowed Apple to concentrate on making touchscreen computers and helped turn marketing genius Steve Jobs’ project into the most valuable company on Earth. (RELATED: DOD Officials Warn Trump Administration To Stop Hassling Giant 5G Developer)

The companies finally agreed in April to dismiss all litigation stemming from the disagreement, with both companies hammering out a six-year licensing agreement and a multiyear supply agreement. Apple will pay Qualcomm an unspecified amount, according to the companies’ statement.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is targeting Huawei, one of Qualcomm’s biggest competitors, in a seemingly unrelated matter. The DOD charged the Chinese telecommunications giant in January on several counts of fraud as President Donald Trump applies more pressure on China’s beleaguered economy.

Officials accused executive Meng Wanzhou of bank fraud, wire fraud and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng, the CFO of Huawei and daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested in December 2018 in Vancouver by the Canadian Justice Department. China warned Canada in December that it faces “severe consequences” if officials don’t release the executive.

Trump continues to press U.S. telecommunications companies to blow past China. “I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard,” the president told his Twitter followers in February.

FTC did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment and Qualcomm refused to make a statement.

DOJ confirms: Girls found in Seymour home were murdered,https://www.weau.com,[],,,,https://www.weau.com/content/news/509502961.html,"The Wisconsin Department of Justice is declaring the deaths of two girls in Seymour last month were homicides.

Mattelin ""Mattie"" Annie Samson, age 4, and Hailey Kaye Poppe, age 3 months, were found dead on April 19 after the Outagamie County Emergency Response Team entered their home.

A man, 35-year-old Andrew R. Poppe, was also found dead. The DOJ confirmed Friday he died of a self-inflicted wound.

Documents obtained by Action 2 News earlier this week said all three had wounds consistent with stabbing.

The mother is not a suspect in the investigation, the statement from the DOJ says.

Police had responded to the home to execute a search warrant based on a domestic violence incident the day before, on April 18. The victim victim of the domestic violence said Poppe threatened to kill her and her children if she called police.

On April 19, at 6:59 a.m., Seymour Police attempted to make contact with Poppe by telephone but he did not answer.

About one hour later, the emergency response team forced entry into the home and found the girls and Poppe dead in an upstairs room. An affidavit states that they ""showed no signs of life and each had wounds consistent with that of a stabbing.""

The affidavit states that Poppe had a history of domestic violence. Police records show an arrest in June 2015 for battery/domestic violence.

Police also executed a search warrant after the deaths and seized a cell phone, electronic devices, clothing and documents.

Mattie and Hailey were laid to rest on April 25. Donations are being collected through the Muehl-Boettcher Funeral Home website. CLICK HERE for information on making a donation to the family.

The Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation is leading the investigation into the deaths at the request of the Seymour Police Department.

""Law enforcement recognizes that this event was a truly awful tragedy. Our sympathies go out to the mother of the children, the family, and the community,"" the statement from the DOJ reads."
VA Comes Out Against Bills on Medical Marijuana for Veterans,https://www.military.com,['Patricia Kime'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/02/va-comes-out-against-bills-medical-marijuana-veterans.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs opposes three legislative proposals that would expand research on medical marijuana at the VA and give veterans access to the drug in states where it is legal.

During a hearing Tuesday on eight VA health-related bills under consideration by Congress, VA officials told House lawmakers that as long as marijuana is illegal under federal law, the department cannot support legislation that promotes its role at the VA.

""[The House Veterans Affairs Committee] can make strong proposals for us to move forward with recommendations of filling out forms and such but, in the end, we need to go back to the [Drug Enforcement Agency] and [Justice Department] for their opinion,"" said Larry Mole, chief consultant for population health at the VA.

Three of the bills before the House Veterans Affairs health subcommittee relate to medical marijuana. One, the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 1647, sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, would allow VA health providers to recommend medical marijuana to their veteran patients and fill out the necessary paperwork for them to enroll in state marijuana programs.

Related content:

Blumenauer, who has introduced the bill in every Congress since 2014, said that, for some veterans, marijuana and cannabis derivatives are lifesavers that keep them from using addictive medications such as opioids to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, seizures and glaucoma. Yet VA health care providers are not allowed to recommend it.

""Opioids steal the lives of 115 Americans every day ... as veterans with PTSD, chronic pain and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong,"" he said.

Another bill, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, H.R. 712, would direct the VA to conduct a large-scale clinical trial on the effects of cannabis on conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain.

Bill sponsor Rep. Lou Correa, D-California, said the research would examine the effectiveness of cannabis on various health conditions, as well as delivery methods.

""It's time to do research. It's time for veterans to know what cannabis is good for and what cannabis is not good for,"" Correa said.

A third, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, H.R. 2192, would protect veterans' benefits by prohibiting the VA from denying health care and compensation for veterans participating in a state medical marijuana program.

Keita Franklin, the VA's national director of suicide prevention, said that while the department supports medical marijuana research and is currently involved in a trial for treating PTSD, it opposes the bills.

According to Franklin, VA doctors would be subject to criminal prosecution if they recommended medical marijuana or made referrals to state agencies, as specified by DEA guidance.

And Correa's bill, she said, would not follow standard practice in medical research.

""Typically, a smaller early-phase trial would advance our knowledge and the benefits and risks regarding cannabis before moving to the expansive approach described in this legislation,"" she said. ""Any trial involving human subjects must include an evaluation on the risks and the safety, and include the smallest number of participants to avoid putting the subjects at increased risk unnecessarily. For these reasons, we don't support this legislation.""

She added that the third piece of legislation is unnecessary because VA policy states that the department cannot deny benefits based on marijuana use, although VA physicians are allowed to tailor a patient's prescription medications based on whether they are using cannabis.

Veterans advocates who testified expressed varying levels of support for the bills.

Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the VFW does not support the Veterans Equal Access bill because it doesn't think the VA should recommend unproven medical treatments, nor should it authorize a treatment for a veteran that would require the former service member to get it outside the VA, where they would be responsible for finding a quality product and paying for it.

The VFW does, however, support VA research on cannabis.

""VA's overreliance on opioids to treat chronic pain and other conditions has led to addiction and even deaths. To its credit ... VA has reduced the number of patients to whom it has prescribed opioids by 22 percent. Now, VA must expand research on the efficacy of nontraditional alternatives to opioids,"" Fuentes said.

Joy Ilam, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, agreed.

""We want to make sure there is no harm done. Research is the first step in doing that,"" Ilam said.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America research director Stephanie Mullen said the IAVA supports cannabis research and access to it.

""It's past time for VA to catch up,"" Mullen said. ""Veterans are suffering from their injuries today.""

Among the other bills and draft bills discussed at the hearing was one that seeks to expand complementary and alternative therapies and treatments at VA medical facilities, and another that would require the VA to report suicides and attempts that occur on VA campuses within a week of them happening.

Franklin said the VA supports both proposals.

Devin Nunes: Clinton 'dirt' tipster Joseph Mifsud has ties to State Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-clinton-dirt-tipster-joseph-mifsud-has-ties-to-state-department,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud — the man who told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails — likely has links to ""U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services"" and the State Department where Clinton served as the country's top diplomat.

Mifsud, a London-based professor and former Maltese diplomat, has long been suspected of deep ties to Russian intelligence. He is an elusive figure who has stayed out of the spotlight and is the subject of a letter Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee ranking member, sent to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department on Friday seeking relevant documents.

Nunes told Fox News on Sunday there were many questions that arose from special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which his letter said “omits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals,"" that still need to be answered.

""They can't even tell us who Joseph Mifsud is,"" he told host Maria Bartiromo, adding, ""We believe he has ties to the State Department."" He noted how in 2017 Mifsud attended an event at the U.S. Capitol hosted by Global Ties U.S., a nonprofit group that partners with the State Department and featured ambassadors and U.S. congressmen at the event.

Nunes' letter also photographs of Mifsud in close proximity to Western officials at events hosted by Rome-based Link University Campus, where Mifsud taught.

Mueller's 448-page report, released last month with redactions, states that Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, after which he met Papadopoulos in London. It was at this meeting that Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that during his trip he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and was President Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the FBI and prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign in July 2016.

Although Mueller's team portrayed Mifsud as a Russian asset with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nunes said the team decided to""cherry pick"" information from news reports, leaving out that he was described as a Western intelligence asset. ""It seems like Mifsud has an awful lot of ties to U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services,"" Nunes said.

The FBI spoke with Mifsud in early February 2017, and believe he left the U.S. on Feb. 11. The FBI accused Papadopoulos of misleading the bureau about his communications with Mifsud in January 2017, which they alleged ""undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor [Mifsud] or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States.""

As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year.

Papadopoulos, who also was contacted by FBI assets during the 2016 campaign, including informant Stefan Halper, now feels he could have been the target of entrapment.

Appearing on Fox News before Nunes, he said he got caught in a ""perjury trap."" He also said he is ""pretty sure there are a lot of recordings and transcripts between myself and a lot of these assets and I'm very hopeful that these are going to get public soon.""

Nunes said his letter to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department seeks ""all of the underlying information,"" adding, ""so if the FBI does in fact have transcripts of Papadopoulos talking to anyone, whether it's Mifsud, or Downer, or whoever, I think Congress and the American people have the right to know this.""

In his letter, Nunes asks Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hand over all documents they have on Mifsud by May 10."
Did the Department of Justice Give the Mueller Letter to the Post to Screw the Times?,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Joe Pompeo', 'Vanity Fair', 'Bess Levin', 'Kevin Fitzpatrick']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/did-the-department-of-justice-give-the-mueller-letter-to-the-post,"It was a familiar one-two in the age of Trump. On Tuesday, the day before Attorney General William Barr’s Senate testimony, The Washington Post published a staggering scoop, one that’s driven the news ever since: Robert Mueller had written a letter to Barr complaining that his initial summary of the Mueller report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the special counsel’s work.

Minutes later, The New York Times published a story with almost precisely the same reporting. “I felt a flashback to the days of 2017 and 2018 when the Times and the Post published dueling scoops the way fighters trade blows,” CNN’s Brian Stelter remarked in his newsletter that night.

The Times and the Post are both well sourced and are often in pursuit of the same stories. In this instance, however, the Times has been left with the distinct impression that the Department of Justice intentionally screwed it by helping its competitor get the scoop. “We’ll certainly be more cautious going forward when we deal with D.O.J.,” a Times reporter familiar with the matter told me. (A D.O.J. official likewise told me the department will do the same when dealing with the Times.)

Here’s what happened, as far as I’ve been able to piece it together from multiple sources with direct knowledge of how things went down: the D.O.J. learned on Sunday that the Times was working on a story about the letter, which Mueller sent to Barr on March 27. The Times believes it was the first news outlet to nail down reporting on the letter and reach out to the D.O.J. On Tuesday, the D.O.J. confirmed the letter not to the Times, but to Devlin Barrett of the Post, and also allowed him to review it. Barrett and Matt Zapotosky broke the story for the Post just after 7 P.M. The Times immediately rushed out a story by Mark Mazzetti and Michael Schmidt, followed by other news outlets. By the next day, Times reporters had heard from contacts within the D.O.J. that the department had wanted “to teach Schmidt a lesson.” Here’s where the plot thickens: It turns out the Post had its first conversations about the letter with the D.O.J. the previous week, and from its perspective, it got the story fair and square.

In recent days, within the club of journalists who report on federal-law enforcement, there’s been a lot of chatter about how the Mueller letter leaked, and depending on who you talk to, the D.O.J. either laid some dark arts on the Times, or played ball with the Post in a respectable way. But the one thing that’s abundantly clear, based on hours of conversations I had about the episode on Friday, is that the tiff has only inflamed tensions between the D.O.J. and at least some of the Times reporters who cover it. (The Times and the D.O.J. declined to comment, as did the Post.)

Even before this, it’s safe to say there was no love lost between the D.O.J. and the Times, which by now has logged a deep backlist of stories—many carrying Schmidt’s byline—that have triggered conniptions at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, such as last year’s article about Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein reportedly suggesting that he might secretly record President Donald Trump, or that piece from April 3 reporting that some members of Mueller’s team thought Barr “failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry.” At least one D.O.J. official has communicated to Times reporters that the department believes the Times sits on stories, only to drop them at crucial moments—say, immediately before a high-profile congressional hearing. As a journalist from another news outlet observed, “In general, there’s a lot of bad blood at this point.”

At the same time, the truth is that reporting can be a film-noir activity, filled with horse-trading and dirty tricks and black eyes. As another Times reporter familiar with the situation put it, “If you’re gonna play in this sandbox on a big story, shit like this happens. But the game goes on.”

"EPA Seeks Public Comment on Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller, Glyphosate on Oats Used in Foods Marketed to Kids",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/epa-seeks-public-comment-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-glyphosate-oats-used-foods-marketed-kids,"WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is formally requesting feedback on a petition submitted by EWG and food companies seeking to significantly limit the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer/Monsanto’s weedkiller Roundup, on oats that are used to make a wide array of children’s foods, like breakfast bars and cereals.

EPA announced today that it will open up a 30-day public comment period beginning Monday, May 6.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG considers protective for children’s health.

“No parent should worry whether feeding their children healthy oat-based foods will also expose them to a chemical linked to cancer,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil.

“If EPA ultimately supports this petition, it could be the beginning of the end for one of the primary sources of glyphosate exposure in the diets of both children and adults,” said O’Neil. “We can be sure that the pesticide/agrichemical lobby won’t sit on the sidelines, though. Over the next month, it will be paramount that EPA hear from as many Americans as possible in order to build the necessary pressure to finally prohibit this needless use of Monsanto’s cancer-causing weedkiller.”

“For far too long, millions of Americans have been getting a dose of this toxic herbicide along with their breakfast,” said EWG Senior Science Advisor for Children’s Environmental Health Olga Naidenko, Ph.D. “If the EPA really cares about children’s health, it should cut off the largest source of glyphosate exposure from foods that children eat daily.”

The EPA’s legal limit on glyphosate residues is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, joined by 18 industry leaders, asks the EPA to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

Over the past 25 years, the EPA has increased the amount of glyphosate residue allowed on oats 300-fold. The first increase, to 20 ppm, was granted in response to a 1997 petition from Monsanto, when farmers around the world first began using glyphosate widely as a late-season drying agent. It was increased to the current 30 ppm level in 2008.

Since then, scientists have linked glyphosate to cancer, and researchers around the world have called for stricter limits on glyphosate exposures.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

A new analysis of glyphosate, released in April by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, gives weight to studies connecting glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and recommends monitoring children’s exposure to this toxic weedkiller.

The petition, first filed in September by EWG, now includes MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Organic, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions and PCC Community Markets.

"America’s Presidents have been far from perfect, but many historians say ours was the worst",https://www.pennlive.com,"['Joyce Davis', 'Joyce M. Davis', 'Jdavis Pennlive.Com']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2019/05/americas-presidents-have-been-far-from-perfect-but-many-historians-say-ours-was-the-worst-commentary.html,"Pennsylvania has the distinction of producing what many historians consider to be the worst President of the United States, at least for now.

As the new book “The Presidents” points out, it can take some time before history really judges a President, and those ridiculed, rejected and even despised during their day may be viewed as heroes a few generations later. Or vice versa.

As the new book “The Presidents” points out, it can take some time before history really judges a President, and those ridiculed, rejected and even despised during their day may be viewed as heroes a few generations later. Or vice versa.

It’s one of the main points authors Brian Lamb and Susan Swain emphasize in the book they’ve compiled from interviews with historians interviewed on C-Span. Lamb is founder and CEO of the cable news channel and Swain is co-CEO. Over C-Span’s four decades of providing access to newsmakers, it’s featured its share of historians assessing U.S. Presidents. Both were recently in Harrisburg to promote their book at a forum at the Midtown Scholar Bookstore.

“The Presidents” is based on C-SPAN’s noted Historians Survey of Presidential Leadership and the text from their TV interviews with famous historians such as Ron Chernow, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robert Caro and others.

In “The Presidents,” they’ve compiled a readable, if subjective, ranking of the men who have occupied the Oval Office. There’s a section on Donald Trump’s potential legacy, but he can’t be assessed until he actually leaves office.

Chambersburg, Pa., Dec. 6, 1952. The cabin where President James Buchanan was born. It was moved there from Cove Gap and in 1953 was moved to the grounds of Mercersburg Academy.

There’s little disagreement, the worst, so far, has been our own John Buchanan, a lifelong bachelor who ascended into office at a critical time in the nation’s history – just before the Civil War.

He proved the wrong man for the job.

“He couldn’t make a decision,” Swain said. “He was a consummate waffler . . . He was bad.”

If Buchanan is generally perceived to be the worst President, there is also general consensus on the best – Abraham Lincoln.

Abraham Lincoln’s contemporaries attacked him in editorials, speeches, journals, diaries, and private letters. Even without Twitter and social media, they criticized his upbringing, his lack of formal education, and even his appearance.

Unlike Buchanan, Lincoln had the backbone to make a decision and stick to it, even if it meant Civil War.

So decisiveness is one of the chief factors that signals whether a President will go down in history as great leader or as a loser. But it turns out it’s hard to predict greatness based on a resume.

Buchanan had a resume chock full of accomplishments. Lincoln did not.

“No man ascended to the office with a longer resume,” said Swain of Buchanan, while Lincoln had very few qualifications to recommend him for the highest office in the land one of the most critical times in the nation’s history.

Truth be told, history is in the pen of the writer. And perspectives of who’s great and who’s not can change over the centuries.

Take Andrew Jackson. For a long time, he was considered among the nation’s best Presidents.

Decisive and a great military leader, Jackson’s ranking among our Presidents has dropped in recent years.

“Some of the things we reflect on now, like the Indian Removal Act, will hurt him from now on.” Thousands of Native Americans died upon orders of President Jackson to remove them from their ancestral lands. Today, we would call it genocide.

History, especially Presidential history, has frequently been whitewashed, and key facts, such as genocide have been downplayed or completely omitted.

So what would America's 3rd president make of his country's current mess?

Take another President considered among the greats – Thomas Jefferson. “He had a lot of slaves,” Lamb said, and for a long time, no one talked about Sally Hemings, the black woman who bore him at least six children. It took modern times and the irrefutable evidence of DNA to add Ms. Hemings to the history books.

And while Presidential dalliances were once hush-hush, all the lured details are now written in plain English in the annals of America’s greats.

We already know about President Bill Clinton. But what about Warren G. Harding and Nan Britton? Not to mention our beloved JFK. Our Presidents were not always men of morality or integrity, and even the good ones had their lapses.

“Presidential scandals go all the way from Thomas Jefferson using James Calendar to write nasty things about John Adams . . . all the way up to Clinton and the different women in his life . . . to JFK , who got away with all of the affairs with women,” said Lamb. “It’s pretty bad stuff.”

And it’s all right there in “The Presidents.”

There are few surprises, as well. Did you know Barack Obama ended his courtship with a long-time girlfriend, allegedly, historians speculate, because she might not be the right Presidential wife material?

Seems he always had his eyes on the Presidency and wound up among the best at number 12, at least according to “The Presidents” rankings.

How these rankings will change after President’s Trump’s stint in office is anyone’s guess. But “The Presidents” provides a glimpse of how history judges the men who have held the office, and how it is likely to judge the man there now."
Interior Dept. Loosens Offshore-Drilling Safety Rules Dating From Deepwater Horizon,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/climate/offshore-drilling-safety-rollback-deepwater-horizon.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday made public its rollback of a major offshore-drilling safety regulation, significantly weakening an Obama-era rule that was put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and sent 4.9 million barrels of oil gushing into the sea, causing the worst oil spill in American history.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed by the Senate last month to head the agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and waters, announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Port Fourchon, La., the vast industrial hub that serves as the onshore base for most companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico.

The oil industry praised the move. Environmental groups warned that the rollbacks could pave the way for similar crises to happen again.

The weakened safety rules come as the Trump administration has also sought to vastly expand offshore drilling in the nation’s waters. Last year the Interior Department proposed opening almost the entire United States coastline to drilling, although Mr. Bernhardt recently said the administration may delay those plans while court challenges are addressed."
"Devin Nunes demands CIA, FBI, NSA, and State Department hand over documents on Joseph Mifsud",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-asks-cia-fbi-nsa-and-state-department-for-docs-on-joseph-mifsud,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is requesting documents from a slew of federal agencies about Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, the man who told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails.

The House Intelligence Committee ranking member seeks information about who Mifsud was working for at the time and wrote in a letter that special counsel Robert Mueller “omits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals"" in his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Mifsud, a London-based professor, has long been suspected to have deep ties to Russian intelligence and is an elusive figure that has stayed out of the spotlight in recent years.

Mueller's 448-page report, released last month with redactions, states that Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, after which he met Papadopoulos in London. It was at this meeting that Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that during his trip he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, President Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the FBI and prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's campaign in July 2016.

As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year.

The FBI interviewed Mifsud in the U.S. about his communications with Papadopoulos in early February 2017. The special counsel’s sentencing memo to the District Court for the District of Columbia said Papadopoulos hindered the FBI's ability to ""challenge"" Mifsud. ""The defendant’s lies undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States. The government understands that the Professor left the United States on February 11, 2017 and he has not returned to the United States since then,"" the memo said.

In his letter, Nunes says it is ""still a mystery how the FBI knew to ask Papadopoulos specifically about Hillary Clinton’s emails"" if the bureau had not spoken with Mifsud.

Nunes asks Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Chris Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hand over all documents they have on Mifsud by May 10.

The letter, obtained by the Washington Examiner, contains photographic evidence of Mifsud in close proximity to Western officials.

""If he is in fact a Russian agent, it would be one of the biggest intelligence scandals for not only the United States, but also our allies like the Italians and the Brits and others. Because if Mifsud is a Russian agent, he would know all kinds of our intelligence agents throughout the globe,"" Nunes said during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity."
William Barr’s Justice Department Just Filed the Most Nakedly Political Brief in the Agency’s History,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-doj-obamacare-brief-partisan-hack.html,"Attorney General William Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images

On Wednesday afternoon, after Attorney General William Barr finished his truculent and mendacious testimony before the Senate, the Department of Justice filed perhaps the most embarrassing, illogical, and nakedly political brief in the history of the agency. With Barr’s assent, the DOJ argued that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because Congress zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty in 2017. The timing couldn’t be worse. After obliterating his own credibility at the Senate hearing, Barr scorched the Justice Department’s legitimacy, deploying fatuous pseudo-legal arguments to further the Trump administration’s partisan goals. The DOJ will not soon recover from Wednesday’s body blow.

Texas v. United States, the latest assault on the ACA, is built upon a series of sophistries. The case was brought by a coalition of conservative states, led by Texas, which recruited two consultants to serve as plaintiffs. They assert that when Congress reduced the ACA’s penalty to zero dollars, it inadvertently destroyed the whole law—the tax credits, the exchanges, protections for preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion, everything. According to Texas’ theory, the Supreme Court only upheld the ACA because it interpreted the penalty as a tax. But, they claim, a tax that collects zero dollars is not a true tax. So the individual mandate can no longer be viewed as a tax, rendering it unconstitutional. And because Congress never intended the ACA to function without the individual mandate, the rest of the law must be struck down too.

This leap in logic makes no sense. It is true that taxes typically collect revenue, so perhaps the mandate cannot fairly be called a tax anymore. It could even be true that the zeroed-out penalty is now unconstitutional. But that does not matter, because if the penalty is illegal, it should be severed from the rest of the law. As the Supreme Court recently explained, when one provision of a statute is invalidated, courts should preserve the remainder of the law unless it is “evident” that Congress “would not have enacted those provisions … independently.” In other words, courts that strike down part of a law should not eviscerate the rest of it without evidence that Congress would’ve wanted that extreme result.

Here, congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In 2017, Congress declined to repeal the entire ACA but chose to zero out the individual mandate’s penalty in the tax bill. By doing so, it declared its belief that the law could function without an operative penalty, a lawful exercise of its legislative powers. But Texas claimed that by amending the ACA, Congress inadvertently demolished it, because the law cannot function without a penalty—even though Congress decided that it could. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, courts should simply sweep aside this legislative intent and invalidate the law top to bottom.

Congressional intent is about as clear as it can get.

In an opinion panned by liberals and conservatives alike, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor embraced this theory late last year and ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. This view was too militant even for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department, which opted for a compromise position: It alleged that the mandate was unconstitutional but that only a few other provisions must fall with it. This half-measure was still a big deal, because the DOJ urged the courts to kill a centerpiece of the law: its bar on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. And the DOJ’s brief at the time reflected, as University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley put it, “enormous contempt for the rule of law.” It was, as other scholars noted, “excruciatingly stupid.” But at least the DOJ did not go whole hog, adopting Texas’ radical position that courts should reject Congress’ authority to amend its own law.

Until now. After Barr took control of the DOJ, the agency changed its position and has now told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas is right—the full ACA is now unconstitutional. With a straight face, the Justice Department argues that, by reducing the mandate to zero dollars, Congress gave Americans a “legal command” to buy health insurance. The Supreme Court has said that such a direct command would be unconstitutional because the mandate could only be justified as a tax. Moreover, the justices who discussed severability said that the ACA cannot function without the mandate. In sum, the DOJ wrote, the mandate is now illegal, it cannot be severed, and so the whole law is unconstitutional.

Where to begin with this lunacy? Start with the DOJ’s framing of the mandate as it stands now. As a factual matter, the ACA currently gives Americans a choice between buying health insurance and paying nothing. There’s no real dispute here; if you forgo insurance, you will suffer no legal consequences. Yet the DOJ interprets the mandate as a “command” that gives Americans “no choice” but to purchase insurance. And its brief insists that Congress created this command in its 2017 tax bill—even though legislators surely knew that the Supreme Court already ruled that such a command would be unconstitutional in 2012’s NFIB v. Sebelius.

It requires willing suspension of disbelief to surmise that by giving Americans a choice not to buy insurance by zeroing out the mandate, Congress actually gave them a “command” to insure themselves. And it taxes credulity to believe that Congress would create this “command” after the Supreme Court stated that such a rule would be unconstitutional.

But imagine for a moment that the DOJ is right—that the Republican-led Congress of 2017 didn’t actually relieve Americans of their duty to buy health insurance but forced them to do so (without any enforcement mechanism). If the courts must strike down this new “legal command,” why should the remainder of the law fall with it? After all, Congress obviously thought the ACA could function without a mandate that raises revenue. To square this circle, the DOJ repeatedly cites the dissent in NFIB, which proclaimed that the mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the law. The Justice Department seems to think that the view of four dissenting justices (in a 2012 case) can override the view of Congress (in 2017 legislation). It appears to have forgotten that a dissent is not law.

The zaniest portion of Wednesday’s brief, however, has to be its effort to salvage the few provisions of the ACA that the current administration likes. It does so by selectively raising the problem of standing. Now, in reality, the individual plaintiffs in this case—two consultants who don’t want to buy health insurance—shouldn’t have standing to sue at all. That requires an injury, and these plaintiffs have none, because they pay no penalty for forgoing insurance. The DOJ casts this problem aside by asserting that they are injured by the “legal command” to insure themselves. And its brief argues that the plaintiffs have standing “to challenge the numerous provisions of the ACA that work together to cause” this injury.

But in a puzzling paragraph, the DOJ adds that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge several provisions of the ACA that criminalize health care fraud. Why? The real answer is that the Justice Department is already prosecuting people under these provisions, and those prosecutions would be thwarted if the full law were struck down. But the DOJ avows that while the plaintiffs have standing to challenge almost the entire ACA, they can’t challenge these provisions because they do not “actually injure the individual plaintiffs.” Oh, really? So the rule that insurers not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and the tax credits for lower-income Americans, and the expansion of Medicaid in states other than Texas—all these provisions “actually injure” the plaintiffs? But prohibitions on fraud somehow do not? The DOJ makes no effort to defend this evanescent distinction, because it is indefensible.

Barr reportedly opposed adopting this preposterous position but caved to President Donald Trump’s demands. He deserves no credit for his feeble resistance. Barr owns this brief, and it will live on as a testament to his craven lawlessness long after the Supreme Court rejects its casuistry. The Justice Department’s reputation will take years to recover from this nadir, if it ever does. Barr marched his agency to the brink of illegitimacy."
Trump administration proposal would make it easier to deport immigrants who use public benefits,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/doj-weighs-making-it-easier-to-deport-immigrants-on-public-benefits.html,"US President Donald Trump tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico, California, April 5, 2019.

The Trump administration is considering reversing long-standing policy to make it easier to deport U.S. legal permanent residents who have used public benefits, part of an effort to restrict immigration by low-income people.

A Department of Justice draft regulation, seen by Reuters, dramatically expands the category of people who could be subject to deportation on the grounds that they use benefits.

Currently, those legal permanent residents who are declared to be a ""public charge,"" or primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, can be deported — but in practice, this is very rare.

The draft regulation would use a more expansive definition to include some immigrants who have used an array of public benefits, including cash welfare, food stamps, housing aid, or Medicaid.

While the plan is at an early stage, might not become official government policy, and is likely to attract lawsuits, it is one part of efforts by the Trump administration to restrict legal immigration, in addition to its efforts to reduce illegal immigration to the United States.

The full possible impact is not known, but the change in policy could affect permanent residents — also known as ""green card"" holders — who are legally entitled to use public benefits soon after their arrival in the United States, such as refugees.

A Department of Justice spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. law allows for the deportation of immigrants who have become ""public charges"" within five years of admission if their reason for seeking help preceded their entry to the United States — for example, if they had a chronic health condition that was not disclosed.

But due to a 1948 ruling, the deportation of immigrants for using public benefits has been strictly limited to cases in which the government has demanded payment for public services, and the person has failed to pay. Immigration lawyers said they have rarely if ever heard of someone being deported for using public benefits.

The draft rule indicates the government would override that precedent to allow for deportation of some permanent residents who have used certain public benefits within five years of admission.

For the plan to go into effect, it would be subject to public comment, after which it could be revised. Attorney General William Barr would then have to sign off on it.

The public benefits in question include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), given to disabled and older people; the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps; Section 8 housing vouchers; many Medicaid benefits; and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a cash assistance program.

According to federal policy, many permanent residents do not qualify for public benefits unless they have had a green card for five years, making it unlikely they could be targeted for deportation on the basis of ""public charge"" even under the draft rule.

But dozens of states have looser rules — for instance, allowing pregnant women and children who are permanent residents to access Medicaid without a waiting period. And the effort to tighten the rules could affect thousands of immigrant veterans, refugees and asylees, who are eligible to receive many benefits without time restrictions. Active members of the military would not be affected.

Administration officials had earlier indicated that the Justice Department, which oversees U.S. immigration courts, planned to issue a regulation on who can be deported for using public benefits, but its details were not previously known."
Trump’s Justice Department doesn’t understand that four is less than five,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-obamacare-case-texas-fifth-circuit-871aecda0599/,"There is literally no rule more basic to U.S. litigation than the rule of five. The Supreme Court has nine seats. It takes a majority to decide a case. A decision joined by five or more justices is a binding interpretation of the law that controls all other court decisions. An opinion dissenting from such a decision is just someone’s views.

And yet, a pair of briefs filed Wednesday evening by a team of anti-Obamacare lawyers — including one filed by the Trump Justice Department and another filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on behalf of several red states — fails to grasp this rudimentary rule. Both briefs, in a case asking a federal court to repeal the entirety of Obamacare, rely heavily on a dissenting opinion by four of the Supreme Court’s most conservative members. And a dissenting opinion, by definition, is not the law.

The case is Texas v. United States.

Making something of nothing

As originally enacted, the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate” required most Americans to either obtain health insurance or pay higher income taxes. The Supreme Court famously upheld this provision of the original, 2010 law as a valid exercise of Congress’ power to tax.

Seven years later, after Congress spent the better part of the year debating plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety and failed to enact any one of these plans, Congress passed a tax law which contained a single provision changing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance to zero dollars. Thus, Congress chose to leave the entire law intact, with the exception that it effectively repealed the individual mandate.

Although the 2017 version of the mandate does nothing — it requires individuals to either carry insurance or pay zero dollars — the Texas plaintiffs claim that it is now unconstitutional on the theory that the Supreme Court upheld it as a tax, but it no longer functions as a tax because it doesn’t collect any tax revenue. That’s a plausible argument, but it should be a purely academic one. Who cares if a provision of the law that literally does nothing is unconstitutional?

Indeed, the fact that the challenged provision does absolutely nothing should be the end of this case. In order to file a federal lawsuit, a plaintiff must have “standing,” meaning that they must be able to show that the law they are challenging injures them in some way. But a zero dollar tax injures no one, so no one has standing to challenge it.

Nevertheless, the Texas plaintiffs ask the courts to ignore this standing requirement and strike down the neutered mandate. Then they seek much, much more.

4 > 5

When a court declares one provision of a larger federal statute unconstitutional, it often must ask whether other, constitutional provisions of the law must fall with it — an inquiry known as “severability.” Severability, by its very nature, is a speculative inquiry. It asks whether Congress would have enacted the constitutional provisions of a law if it had known that the unconstitutional provisions could not take effect.

When engaging in this speculation, moreover, courts must apply a very strong presumption that Congress did not intend for additional provisions to fall. As the Supreme Court explained most recently in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, “in order for other . . . provisions to fall it must be ‘evident that [Congress] would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of [those] which [are] not’”

So Texas is a very easy case, even if you ignore the fact that these plaintiffs lack standing. And even if you concede that the zeroed-out mandate is unconstitutional, we already know what Congress would have done if it had known that the powerless mandate would be struck down. Again, Congress spent the better part of a year debating whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ultimately decided not to repeal the law, and then passed a law that canceled just one provision of Obamacare — the individual mandate. That’s conclusive proof that Congress intended to eliminate the mandate while leaving the rest of law intact.

To get around this proof, the Texas plaintiffs and the Trump administration rely heavily on a dissenting opinion penned by four conservative justices in NFIB v. Sebelius, the 2012 decision upholding most of the Affordable Care Act.

In that opinion, the dissenting justices claimed that the original version of the individual mandate — the version that actually did something — is unconstitutional. They then argued that the Affordable Care Act is a carefully balanced machine made up of interlocking regulations, subsidies, and taxes. Remove a major cog in this machine, they argued, and the entire apparatus must fall because each moving part depends on the others.

Texas and the Trump administration argue that this logic should also apply to a decision striking down the zeroed-out, 2017 version of the mandate.

There are more problems with this argument than one can count. The most obvious one is, again, that a dissenting opinion is not the law. Texas’ and the Trump administration’s argument rests on the assumption that four justices are more than five.

Moreover, not only is a dissenting opinion not the law, but a majority of the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the dissent’s argument that the Affordable Care Act is collection of interlocking parts that must stand or fall together. While NFIB left most of the law intact, it did strike down a provision that imposed strict financial consequences on states that rejected Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.

But NFIB did not hold that, because this one important cog was removed from Obamacare’s machine, the entire law must fall. “We have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the controlling opinion, “but we do not believe Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply because some may choose not to participate.” The bulk of the law, he noted, “will remain ‘fully operative as a law,’ and will still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress’ basic objectives in enacting the statute.’”

The same logic should apply to Texas. After all, the practical difference between the post-2017 version of the law, which contains a powerless “mandate” that does absolutely nothing, and a different version of the law with the zeroed-out mandate excised, is absolutely nothing. With or without the gelded mandate, the law functions exactly the same. And thus it remains “fully operative as a law” and will “still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress basic objectives'” in enacting the 2017 version of the statute.

And there’s another major problem with Texas and the Trump administration’s reliance on the NFIB dissent. Even if that dissent were the law, it was written in 2012. Murphy was handed down in 2018. Thus, to the extent that the NFIB dissent conflicts with Murphy, it is superseded by Murphy. Courts must uphold the bulk of the Affordable Care Act unless it is “evident” that Congress would not have enacted the bulk of the law without the do-nothing mandate.

The theory behind Texas, in other words, does not have any basis in American law. But the two briefs’ reliance on the NFIB dissent is still revealing. The real premise underlying Texas is that, now that the courts have taken a sharp right turn, dissenting opinions penned by the Supreme Court’s most conservative members should be treated as if they were the law, and the law itself should be ignored.

A least some members of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will hear Texas in July, appear to agree with this premise — as evidenced by a recent abortion case where the Fifth Circuit defied a recent Supreme Court decision handed down before Justice Anthony Kennedy left the bench. Significantly, Chief Justice Roberts voted to stay the Fifth Circuit’s defiance, signaling to lower courts that they cannot simply ignore the Supreme Court’s decisions.

Texas will be a good test of whether the Fifth Circuit got the message."
4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates.

Age is one of the biggest differences in the 2020 presidential race.

More than a generation separates the oldest and youngest candidates on the Democratic side. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are 40 years younger than Sen. Bernie Sanders and 39 years younger than former Vice President Joe Biden.

On the Republican side, President Donald Trump, the oldest first-term president, and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld would also be in their mid-70s on Inauguration Day.

Of course, age has little to do with a president’s success. John F. Kennedy (the youngest president) and Ronald Reagan (the oldest) rank among the top 15 of U.S. presidents, according to Siena College's annual poll.

Reagan, in his early 70s, famously deflected a question about his age during his 1984 re-election campaign against 56-year-old Walter Mondale: ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""

Still, age is a lens that colors our view of the world. Buttigieg and Gabbard were about 7 when the modern internet was born; Biden and Sanders were born during World War II and lived through a handful of other wars and conflicts.

Our timeline gives you a sense of just how wide the gap is between the Democratic and Republican candidates.

Idaho still in running for Western headquarters of Interior Department | Idaho Statesman,https://www.idahostatesman.com,"['Dan Elliott', 'Kyle Green', 'The Associated Press']",,,,https://www.idahostatesman.com/article230039514.html,"Boise is among the potential sites for a new Western headquarters of the Interior Department. A decision is expected by September. kgreen@idahostatesman.com

The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday it plans to choose a Western city as the new headquarters for its vast public lands holdings by the end of September.

The department also said it may move the headquarters of its U.S. Geological Survey — best known for monitoring earthquakes and publishing detailed topographical maps — to the Denver area.

Both agencies currently have their headquarters in the Washington area.

The department wants to move the Bureau of Land Management to the West to be closer to the land it oversees. The bureau manages nearly 388,000 square miles (1 billion square kilometers), and 99% is in 12 Western states.

Officials said previously that Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah are in the running for the new bureau headquarters.

The proposed moves are part of a far-reaching Interior Department reorganization launched by then-Secretary Ryan Zinke. The plan includes consolidating 49 regional boundaries of eight sub-agencies into 12 unified regions.

Zinke — who stepped down in January amid ethics allegations — and current Interior officials have said the reorganization will make the department more efficient and bring policy makers closer to the people most affected by their decisions.

Skeptics, including some Democrats in Congress, say the plan is a waste of money and suggested it was a way to get rid of employees by forcing them to move or quit. Department officials dispute those claims.

Scott Cameron, a deputy assistant secretary at the department, appeared before the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight Investigations Tuesday to defend the plan. In testimony and a written statement, he said the department is still drawing up the details, including what the directors of the newly created regions would do.

Cameron said about 40 Bureau of Land Management positions would be moved West this year. He said the bureau would ask employees to move voluntarily rather than forcing them.

He said the department hopes to decide on the location for the new bureau headquarters by the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.

Cameron said the Geological Survey does not have money in this year’s budget to move many employees. He noted the agency already has a big presence in the Denver area, including the National Earthquake Information Center .

He said the Interior Department would ask Congress for another $27.6 million next year to continue the reorganization. Lawmakers approved $17.5 million for this year."
Jane Castor at odds with Justice Department over her oversight of Miami police,https://www.tampabay.com,"['Joey Flechas', 'Charles Rabin']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/05/04/jane-castor-at-odds-with-justice-department-over-her-oversight-of-miami-police/,"The federal agency charged with overseeing use-of-force and training reforms at the Miami police department struck back at the person who has been monitoring those reforms this week, saying it had no intention of ending oversight anytime soon.

Last week, newly-elected Tampa Mayor Jane Castor — a former police chief and the $150-an-hour monitor appointed to oversee the reform of Miami’s policing — said she believed the department had complied with the terms of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. They were set in place after a string of deadly police shootings of mostly unarmed black men almost a decade ago.

Miami police quickly agreed with Castor, who was sworn into office this week.

But others criticized both Castor and her recommendation that the agreement be terminated about a year before the March 2020 deadline.

On Thursday, during a meeting of the Citizen Advisory Board, which was created as part of the agreement, a city of Miami employee assigned to the board said he had spoken with Justice Department and that it didn’t agree with Castor’s recommendation.

“It is the Department of Justice’s position that the agreement should not be terminated,” Rodney Jacobs, who investigates police misconduct for the city of Miami, said in a statement. “The independent reviewer has not reported substantial compliance with her quarterly reports and analysis. In the event the reviewer does report that level of compliance, per the agreement the police department must maintain that compliance for one year. “

A Justice Department attorney confirmed DOJ’s position, but wouldn’t comment further. DOJ also declined to answer written questions submitted by the Miami Herald.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Miami’s police monitor — new Tampa Mayor Jane Castor — wants to end federal oversight

The rift between Castor and DOJ comes a week after she told Miami leaders she wanted to end the policing agreement a year early because the city had “satisfied all of the requirements of the agreement.” Castor’s comments came two days after she was elected mayor of Tampa.

The agreement between Miami and DOJ was reached three years ago after federal investigators determined that Miami cops had engaged in a pattern of excessive use of deadly force, particularly over a seven-month period almost a decade ago in which police shot and killed seven black men, most of them unarmed. The parties approved the agreement in order to avoid federal courts and costs.

Though members of the advisory board say they are satisfied with the department’s progress on many of the required reforms, they say there is more work to be done. And they said they’re not sure Castor is the right person for the job. During Thursday’s meeting, board members aired frustration with her performance and expressed doubt about her ability to juggle her new mayorship while reviewing police practices and policies in another city.

“How can she continue to do this job?” asked board chairman Justin Pinn.

“I have no confidence in her myself,” added board member Lorena Ramos.

Members lamented about late reports that, in their opinion, lacked depth and didn’t respond to the board’s requests for more analysis. They complained they never received a requested comparison between Miami and other police departments and they said they wanted evidence that the department is pursuing implicit bias training and de-escalation techniques to avoid using force when it’s not necessary.

HISTORIC ELECTION: Jane Castor wins big in Tampa mayor’s race

The board wants the city to negotiate an extension to the agreement so the city has time to hire a new monitor. Members also voted to request that Police Chief Jorge Colina, Mayor Francis Suarez and Castor be present at the next meeting in June to discuss the status of the agreement. If Castor were to exit, both parties would have to agree to a new monitor.

Early on, Castor fell behind schedule in delivering quarterly reports to the Community Advisory Board. On Wednesday, she submitted a report for the last quarter of 2018. The report says there are still two areas related to officer-involved shootings that must be reviewed.

So far, Castor has been paid $154,400.80 for her work, according to the police department.

THE BUZZ: Jane Castor’s historic win captures national spotlight and positions her as Democrats’ ‘rising star’

On Friday, Castor said the agreement stipulates that Miami remain in compliance for a full year before the agreement can be terminated. She said if the Justice Department determines that monitoring should continue and she agreed to do it, she would do so at no cost. She also disagreed that Miami had not yet fully complied with the requirements.

“I felt the Miami police department has reached substantial compliance in all areas of the agreement and they’ve been open and compliant,” the Tampa mayor said Friday.

As for the advisory board asking for an extension and saying that her reports had not been timely or thorough, Castor said she wasn’t sure where that was coming from.

“I’ve been in contact with Justin Pinn. He and I have met just about every time I’ve come down,” Castor said. “It’s the first I’ve heard any concern about the thoroughness of the reports.”

Deputy Miami Police Chief Ron Papier said he continues to believe the city has complied with the DOJ agreement.

“Our position is simple,” Papier said. “We believe the city of Miami police department is in compliance. We’ve done everything that’s been asked of us and will continue to do so.”

Papier said it’s a two-party agreement and that if the Justice Department wishes to keep monitoring the city until the agreement winds down in March of 2020, the department will abide by that agreement. He disagreed with the advisory board’s assessment that the department wasn’t taking the oversight seriously.

“We do take the community advisory board seriously,” said Papier. “Representatives have attended every meeting when asked. I’m not sure what we’re not in compliance with as of now.”

Ginnie Mae considering changes to VA loan rules as refinances continue to soar,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Ben Lane Is The Editor For Housingwire.

He Is A Graduate Of University Of North Texas.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48962-ginnie-mae-considering-changes-to-va-loan-rules-as-refinances-continue-to-soar,"For more than 18 months, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ginnie Mae, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have been investigating whether certain lenders are aggressively targeting service members and military veterans for quick and potentially risky refinances of their mortgages.

The investigation led to some lenders being booted from Ginnie Mae’s primary mortgage securities platforms, and other lenders being restricted for questionable conduct.

Ginnie Mae even went so far as to issue new rules for VA loan refinances, restricting how soon a loan could be refinanced after its original origination date.

And while Ginnie Mae says that those changes have made a positive impact on its mortgage-backed securities, the agency is also now stating that more changes may be necessary to get the pervasiveness of VA loan refinances under control.

Ginnie Mae on Friday announced that it is seeking input on potential changes to its rules for VA loans. Namely, the agency is considering making more changes to its rule to “address abnormal prepayment patterns in some mortgages pooled in Ginnie Mae MBS that negatively affect MBS pricing.”

Ginnie Mae offers federally insured mortgage bonds for FHA and VA mortgage lenders. And according to the agency, the frequency of refinances, specifically cash-out refinances, is having a negative impact on its mortgage bonds.

Specifically, Ginnie Mae said that some of its securities are not trading where they should be compared to securities issued by Fannie Mae. According to Ginnie Mae, it recently identified “certain adverse trends” in the trading of its securities.

“It’s clear from published analysis and investor commentary that GII MIP securities were believed to be susceptible to refinance activity out of proportion to what should be expected from prevailing economic conditions,” Ginnie Mae said in its request for input.

“Ginnie Mae’s concern, then and now, is that investor trepidation about this activity will negatively impact investor confidence in the performance of the securities and the relative price that they receive in the market,” Ginnie Mae added. “Deterioration in market pricing translates directly into a higher cost of homeownership for the homeowners the Ginnie Mae MBS program is intended to serve.”

Put simply, Ginnie Mae appears to be concerned that investors aren’t as attracted to its mortgage bonds because they prepay to often. MBS investors seek stability, not volatility. They want their payouts over time, when they expect them, at the amounts they expect them to be. If the loans are being prepaid too often, investors don’t get their expected payouts.

And when that happens, investors turn to other options (like Fannie Mae bonds apparently) for their expected returns.

Ginnie Mae appears to have a problem with that.

The bottom line, according to Ginnie Mae, is that the previous actions it took towards its bond programs had “moderate success” in decreasing the “refinance spikes” that seem to not make sense given market conditions, but the agency appears to not believe that its controls are “sufficient” enough yet.

“Non-correlated VA refinance activity continues to be evident, and the extent to which it is a focus of analysts and investors is unhealthy for Ginnie Mae’s ability to fulfill its mission,” Ginnie Mae.

One of the main issues, according to Ginnie Mae, is a rise in VA cash-out refinances, as detailed earlier this year by CoreLogic.

According to CoreLogic, last year, of all refinances on government-backed loans offered by the FHA and VA, 76% were cash-outs – the highest share in the 20 years that this data has been collected.

More than 106,000 cash-out refis were backed by the government in 2018, more than twice as may as there were in 2014.

Ginnie Mae previously attributed the overall surge to its toughened standards for VA refis, but those rules don’t apply to cash-outs, a loophole that it was predicted Ginnie Mae would address.

And now, Ginnie Mae is considering making more changes.

“Ginnie Mae is confronting a situation in which the GII MIP, because of the combination of greater volume of VA loans and present-day borrowing/lending practices, is being utilized to support short-term consumer financing for veterans to a greater degree than has previously been the case,” Ginnie Mae said.

Therefore, Ginnie Mae said that it is considering changing its rules to “excluding from (or restricting within) the GII MIP loan type categories that can be expected to prepay at significantly higher rates from the loan types whose performance is better correlated with market trends and the intended purpose of the GII MIP securities.”

More directly, the agency said that it may exclude or restrict VA cash-out refinances in excess of 90% loan-to-value ratio from being include in multi-issuer pools.

Beyond that, Ginnie Mae said it may consider offering single-issue custom securities, basically separating the lenders that appear to be refinancing more often; creating a new mortgage bond offering specifically designed to include “shorter duration loan type categories;” and other changes.

“Protecting the value of our securities and, thereby, the borrowers Ginnie Mae serves, is paramount and, as such, modifications to our pooling parameters are under consideration,” said Ginnie Mae Acting President Maren Kasper. “This RFI enables the agency to take views from a wide variety of stakeholders under consideration as we work to eradicate abnormal prepayment patterns that are negatively impacting the performance of the Ginnie Mae MBS program.”

Mark Meadows sends criminal referral targeting Nellie Ohr to DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-criminal-referral-targeting-nellie-ohr-to-doj,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, is the subject of a criminal referral sent to the Justice Department on Wednesday.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., wrote up the referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election.

The Hill reported Meadows, a member of House Oversight, has filed a referral with the Justice Department in the evening Wednesday. The Washington Examiner has not independently confirmed it has been sent and has reached out to Meadows' office.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows wrote in the referral.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony,"" he added.

Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and President Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS, the same opposition research firm behind the infamous Trump dossier. Meadows pointed to emails made public though a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that show Ohr was in contact with Justice Department officials in 2016.

""For example, in March 2016, DOJ official Lisa Holtyn sent Bruce Ohr an email asking if Nellie would be able to speak with Ivana Nizich and Joe Wheatley to discuss her research as part of an ongoing investigation as she was told 'Nellie might be a great resource.' When Mr. Ohr checked if Nellie would feel comfortable speaking with DOJ, Nellie emailed 'Sure!'"" Meadows said.

""A separate email chain indicates Ms. Ohr shared her research on Russian organized crime in contradiction to her testimony. Specifically, on a separate email chain between Nellie Ohr, Mr. Ohr, Ms. Holtyn, and DOJ officials Joe Wheatley and Ivana Nizich, Ms. Ohr provides the Department of Justice with analysis of Shakro, a Russian mafia boss, and the separatists in the Donbass war,"" he added.

""Taking these communications into account, in addition to other information we have reviewed, Meadows said, ""Ms. Ohr misled the committees when she testified she would not have any knowledge of what was going on in an ongoing DOJ investigation, and that she had not shared her research outside of Fusion GPS, her husband, and Christopher Steele. Truthful witness testimony is crucial to the integrity of investigations conducted by the House of Representatives. Ms. Ohr violated her oath to tell the truth by making demonstrably false statements during her testimony before the Committee. Accordingly, I am referring Nellie Ohr to the Department of Justice for investigation of potential violation(s) of 18 U.S.C.§1001 et seq.""

Ohr testified to the Oversight and Judiciary committees in October. The transcript was made public by Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins in March.

The testimony focused heavily on her time with Fusion GPS and its relationship with the DOJ. Nellie Ohr said she met three times with Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier that contained unverified claims about Russia having compromising information about Trump. The last of those meetings took place on July 30, 2016, a day before the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It is believed that FBI agent Peter Strzok, now-infamous for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with a colleague, signed the order that launched the inquiry.

Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr, acted as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The FBI suspended its relationship with Steele in October 2016 for unauthorized contact with the media. Despite this, the FBI maintained an unofficial back channel with Steele up to at least November 2017 via Ohr

More criminal referrals from Meadows could be in the works. At an event Tuesday, the congressman said he knows of ""two or three individuals"" tied to Fusion GPS who could be the subject of criminal referrals for lying to Congress."

""Clearly, this letter indicates that they are not being represented by Attorney General Barr.""

""This is a two-year effort, a little short of that, [and a] major investment,"" Hoyer added. ""And I think the American people are justified in hearing his view as to what he found and the interpretation he put on it.""

Other Democrats suggested Barr’s testimony cannot be trusted on its own.

The panel has reportedly been engaging directly with Mueller on a date for his testimony; a committee spokesman did not respond to a request for more information on those negotiations.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, told The Hill in an email Friday that he didn’t have ""any information to provide at this time"" with respect to negotiations surrounding Mueller’s potential testimony.

Mueller’s appearance in a public setting on Capitol Hill would be nothing short of historic. Lawmakers and voters would have the opportunity to hear from the man who supervised one of the most politically charged investigations while under constant attack from President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi says she worried Trump would have contested elections if House margin had been thin Anticipation builds for Mueller testimony Venezuela tests Trump-Bolton relationship MORE.

Ultimately, Mueller did not establish that members of Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, and he did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice.

Democrats would undoubtedly question Mueller on his interactions with Barr, particularly during the four-week period between the completion of his 22-month investigation and Barr’s public release of the report on April 18. They’re also likely to ask for his candid thoughts on Barr’s March 24 memo to Congress spelling out the report’s bottom-line conclusions.

Pramila Jayapal Pramila JayapalAnticipation builds for Mueller testimony In healthcare, failure is rewarded Ocasio-Cortez joins calls for Barr to resign MORE (D-Wash.) told reporters on Thursday. ""Clearly, he felt troubled enough by what Attorney General Barr did and said that he wrote not one but two letters to the attorney general.""

Mueller’s team reached out to the Justice Department with concerns on March 25, and two days later the special counsel wrote to Barr saying the memo to Congress ""did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the investigation's conclusions and created “public confusion” about the results.

Barr testified on Wednesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he spoke to Mueller by phone about the March 27 letter. The attorney general later described the correspondence as ""snitty"" and said it was ""probably written by one of [Mueller’s] staff people.""

""I asked him if he was suggesting that the March 24 letter was inaccurate, and he said no but that the press reporting had been inaccurate,"" Barr said.

Mueller’s letter made no mention of press coverage, raising the odds that Democrats are likely to ask the special counsel about Barr’s characterization of that conversation.

Lawmakers would almost certainly press Mueller on why he did not come to a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice, something that perplexed many in Washington, including Barr.

Democrats may also look to Mueller to elicit more information about his investigation and report, roughly 10 percent of which was redacted to conceal information related to ongoing probes, grand jury material, national security information and details that impact third parties.

Nadler has subpoenaed for the full report and underlying evidence. The Justice Department has refused to comply, describing the subpoena as ""not legitimate oversight"" and its requests as ""overbroad and extraordinarily burdensome.""

Barr has instead allowed select members of Congress, including Nadler, to view a less redacted version in a secure room as long as they agree to keep those contents of the report confidential.

Mueller’s potential testimony appears less likely in the Senate, though Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamSchumer: Graham 'has an obligation' to ask Mueller to testify Anticipation builds for Mueller testimony Hirono electrifies left as Trump antagonist MORE (R-S.C.) on Friday wrote to Mueller to offer him the opportunity to testify before the panel about any misrepresentation by Barr of their phone call.

Graham had otherwise shut the door on hearing from Mueller.

""I'm not going to do any more. Enough already. It's over,"" Graham told reporters after Barr’s hours-long testimony on Wednesday.

Trump, when asked Friday whether Mueller should testify, deferred to the attorney general.

""I don’t know,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office. ""That’s up to our attorney general, who I think has done a fantastic job.""

Barr has said that he would not object to Mueller testifying.

""I have no objection to Bob Mueller personally testifying,"" he told reporters at a news conference shortly before releasing the special counsel’s report last month.

Barr reiterated that point during his Senate testimony on Wednesday, adding that the White House was not exerting influence on his decision of whether and when to allow Mueller to testify.

White House deputy press secretary Steven Groves said Friday that he’s not aware of any discussions within the West Wing about potential Mueller testimony and that he hasn’t ""heard anyone speak out in objection to it.""

He suggested the White House counsel would discuss the matter with Trump, who has made clear he has no intention of cooperating with House Democrats' oversight and investigations.

Groves added that it was ""premature"" to debate the issue since no date had been set for a Mueller hearing.

""There are some questions that I would like to ask him,"" Groves said. “I mean, he was given a task to either prosecute or decline prosecute, and instead what the American people got for their $30 million were 200 pages of on the one hand this and on the other hand that.

""The question is, does he want to go before Congress and explain his findings and explain his decisionmaking?” he added.

The Justice Department Suddenly Changed Its Mind About the Constitution to Defend Trump’s Businesses,http://time.com,['Kathleen Clark'],,,,http://time.com/5581308/trump-emoluments-justice-department/,"When Justice Department lawyers introduce themselves in court, they proclaim a specific affiliation: “I represent the United States.” That’s because the Justice Department has the responsibility by statute to represent the interests of the nation. That obligation to act on behalf of the nation has also motivated the Department’s legal advice on a question central to the integrity of our democracy — until now. Recent arguments show that the Department is putting President Trump’s interests before the nation’s.

For more than 150 years, the Department interpreted the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause to protect the government from the corrupting influence of foreign powers through gifts, emoluments and titles. The Department has issued more than 50 legal opinions declaring that the clause prohibits important federal officials from accepting anything of value — even token gifts — from such powers, unless Congress consents.

The prohibitions went further. Engineers and scientists who work for the federal government are prohibited from accepting any benefit (including consulting fees or travel reimbursement) that comes from a foreign government. The Department even prohibited a part-time federal employee who was also a partner in a law firm from accepting any money from the firm’s legal work for foreign governments, even though he had not worked on those cases, because “the partnership would in effect be a conduit” for foreign governments. When it interpreted this constitutional clause, the Department explicitly examined whether the particular payment “would raise the kind of concern [i.e.,] the potential for ‘corruption and foreign influence’… that motivated the Framers in enacting the constitutional prohibition.” At every turn, the Justice Department was on the lookout to ensure that federal officials did not accept direct or indirect foreign government payments.

But starting two years ago, the Department veered away from this long track record. In response to three lawsuits filed by an anti-corruption group, Democratic members of Congress and, jointly, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, the Department chose to defend President Trump’s ability to receive money from foreign governments instead of defending the republic. (On April 30, a U.S. District Judge ruled that the Congressional Democrats’ case can move forward.)

Trump’s personal lawyers have argued that the emoluments clause allows Trump — and all federal officials — to accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments, as long as those payments are in the form of commercial transactions with a business owned by the federal official. Contradicting its entire history, the Department adopted Trump’s lawyers’ argument, contending that the emoluments clause only prohibits compensation in exchange for a “personal service in his capacity as [an] officeholder” — in other words, a bribe.

Under this new interpretation of the emoluments clause, the government’s engineers and scientists would still be prohibited from accepting travel reimbursements from a foreign government, but any federal official who owns a company may accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments through commercial transactions. In effect, the Justice Department now claims that our founders only wanted to prohibit officials from receiving a second salary from a foreign government.

Foreign governments appear to be falling over themselves to spend money at Trump properties. Saudi Arabia’s lobbyists spend lavishly at Trump’s hotels in Washington, D.C., and New York City. Bookings at Trump’s Chicago hotel from Saudi Arabia have more than doubled since 2016, while bookings from Qatar have increased 17 times over the same period. The governments of Kuwait, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and the Philippines host multiple events at Trump properties, with the Philippines ambassador acknowledging that such spending is “a statement that we have a good relationship with this president.”

Trump wants to personally benefit from foreign government payments, and therefore seeks a narrow interpretation of the emoluments clause. He has a right to advocate for that narrow interpretation, but it is his personal attorneys — not the Justice Department — that should make such arguments. While we do not know the exact source of this new logic, Trump’s Justice Department is effectively acting as if it is a private law firm. Government employees are supposed to act in the public interest, not anyone’s personal interest. This is a fundamental principle of government ethics. If Justice Department lawyers are going to say that they “represent the United States,” they better have the interests of the country — not the financial interests of the President — at heart.

State Department OKs nearly $6 billion in weapons sales to Gulf allies,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-arms/state-department-oks-nearly-6-billion-in-weapons-sales-to-gulf-allies-idUSKCN1S924P,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $6 billion worth of weapons sales to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in three separate packages, the Pentagon said on Friday after notifying Congress of the certification.

The United States depends on allies in the region, including Saudi Arabia, to counter Iranian influence. In April, the U.S. moved ahead with part of a THAAD missile defense system sale to the kingdom.

In one of the notifications sent to Congress on Friday, Bahrain could potentially buy various Patriot missile systems and related support and equipment for an estimated cost of $2.48 billion. That potential Bahraini deal included 36 Patriot MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missiles known as GEM-T, an upgrade that can shoot down aircraft and cruise missiles.

In a separate State Department notification sent to Congress, Bahrain was also given the nod for various weapons to support its F-16 Block 70/F-16V aircraft fleet for an estimated cost of $750 million. That package included 32 AIM-9X missiles, 20 AGM-84 Block II Harpoon missiles and 100 GBU-39s which are 250-pound small diameter bombs and other munitions.

In a third State Department notification, the United Arab Emirates was given potential approval for $2.73 billion worth of Patriot missiles and related equipment including 452 Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missiles Segment Enhanced (MSE) and related equipment.

The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale. The notification process alerts Congress that a sale to a foreign country has been approved, but it does not indicate that a contract has been signed or negotiations have concluded.

The principal contractors for the sales were Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Co."
Homeland Security to launch pilot program of DNA testing at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/homeland-security-to-launch-pilot-program-of-dna-testing-at-border,"Migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border with children will be asked to submit to a voluntary DNA test in order to prove they are related, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), officials said Wednesday.

The officials said the pilot program could be set up as soon as next week, but did not specify at which locations the tests would take place so as ""not to change the flow of people"" approaching the southern border.

Individuals who consent to the DNA test will be asked to swab their cheeks and those of the children with them before presenting the evidence to officials from DHS or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The DHS officials said the testing would take an average of two hours to complete, after which the genetic data is to be destroyed and won't be used as evidence in any criminal case.

Information from the tests will be used to investigate individuals suspected of human trafficking, identity theft and other crimes. The officials added that someone claiming to be a child's legal guardian will have to provide supporting documentation.

""This pilot is by no means a silver bullet for these investigations,"" a DHS official said Wednesday. ""Trained professionals will continue to rely on a myriad of data inputs and their experience to determine whether a group presenting as a family unit is a fraud based on law enforcement observations, documentary evidence or other intelligence.""

Last month, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said the Border Patrol had identified more than 3,100 parents and children accused of making ""fraudulent claims"" between April 2018 and March of this year. That number coincides with a surge of border crossings by family units.

The Border Patrol says it made about 66,000 apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally in February, including 36,000 parents and children, a monthly high. ICE officials said that since Dec. 21 it had released 107,000 family members while they await court dates. The agency also says it has identified 101 possible instances of fraudulent families since April 18 and determined one-third were fraudulent

The fiscal year ending Oct. 1, 2018, saw more than 107,000 family units apprehended at the southwestern border, a 42 percent increase from the previous year, when more than 75,000 were apprehended. Since Oct. 1, ICE says it has uncovered more than 1,000 cases of fraudulent families and referred 45 cases for prosecution. The fraud could also include the use of false birth certificates or documents, and adults accused of fraud aren't necessarily prosecuted for it; some are prosecuted for illegal entry or other crimes.

Homeland Security officials have also warned of ""child recycling,"" cases where they say children allowed into the U.S. were smuggled back into Central America to be paired up again with other adults in fake families — something they say is impossible to catch without fingerprints or other biometric data.

But the department hasn't identified anyone arrested in such a scheme or released data on how many such schemes have been uncovered. Advocates say they're worried that in the name of stopping fraud, agents might take personal information from children that could be used against them later.

U.S. may have to stop borrowing later this year: Treasury,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jason Lange', 'Min Read']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-refunding/u-s-may-have-to-stop-borrowing-later-this-year-treasury-idUSKCN1S73U4,"FILE PHOTO - A man walks away from the U.S Treasury Department in Washington, U.S., August 6, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have to stop borrowing money between July and December if Washington doesn’t agree to raise a legal restriction on public debt, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.

Hitting that so-called “debt ceiling” could trigger a U.S. default on its debt and an immediate recession, a risk that has become a regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade.

The current debt limit was set in March. Treasury has been able to continue borrowing from investors by using accounting measures such as limiting government payments to public sector retirement funds.

“Treasury expects that the extraordinary measures will be exhausted sometime in the second half of 2019,” Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement announcing the department’s quarterly debt issuance plans.

Wall Street also sees Treasury exhausting its borrowing authority in the third or fourth quarter, according to the minutes of a meeting of a Treasury advisory committee of financiers.

The debt ceiling is already affecting how the government funds itself. Issuance of Treasury bills - short-term debt - is expected to gradually decline over the second quarter due to debt ceiling constraints, Smith said.

Treasury said it was holding issuance size steady for auctions of debt coupons during the third quarter, and that it anticipates no changes in the following three-month period either."
Athens and Griffin fail to make shortlist for USDA agencies,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/athens-and-griffin-fail-make-shortlist-for-usda-agencies/gdymfyPnfGuqPs5HdEqy7N/,"Georgia failed to make the shortlist in the headquarters search for two research agencies that the U.S. Department of Agriculture wants to move out of Washington.

In a press release Friday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced Indiana (multiple sites), the Greater Kansas City area and the Research Triangle region in North Carolina are the department’s top three candidates for the headquarters of the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

St. Louis and Madison, Wis., are listed as alternates.

The failure of Georgia’s two candidates — Athens and Griffin — to make the cut is a blow to a state some observers believed had an inside track to win the two agencies and more than 600 jobs. Perdue is a former governor of Georgia and a former state lawmaker.

“While we would have loved the opportunity to be on USDA’s shortlist, we look forward to connecting with the department and the site selection consultants to hear what we could have done to stay in the process,” said Bert Brantley, the chief operating officer of the state’s Department of Economic Development. “We always want to use these types of projects to get better for the next one that comes along.”

The department said its priorities included low costs of living and operations, workforce quality and access to an international airport.

“Relocation will help ensure USDA is the most effective, most efficient, and most customer-focused agency in the federal government, allowing us to be closer to our stakeholders and move our resources closer to our customers,” Perdue said in the release. “Our commitment to the public and our employees is to continue to be transparent as we proceed with our analysis.”

Though many of Georgia’s GOP congressional members supported the state’s bid, U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, tried to block money for the move in spending bills. Bishop is the chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee with power over USDA funding.

Bishop said Perdue hadn’t produced cost estimates justifying the move, and the congressman raised concerns about a relocation harming morale and the agencies’ objectivity.

The ERS and NIFA conduct and fund agricultural research. Many scientific groups also have panned Perdue’s plans to relocate the agencies.

On Friday, Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, applauded the inclusion of the Kansas City area on the department’s shortlist.

“There’s no better place for ERS and NIFA to relocate than Kansas City,” Roberts said in a news release.

"Obamacare ‘must be struck down,’ Justice Department tells court",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Tom Howell Jr.']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/1/obamacare-must-be-struck-down-justice-department-t/,"A Texas judge “correctly held” that Obamacare’s individual mandate to hold insurance is inseparable from the rest of the law, the Trump administration told an appeals court Wednesday in arguing the entire program must fall.

The Justice Department’s brief solidified President Trump’s support for a lawsuit that could decimate his predecessor’s signature health program, even though Republicans haven’t reached consensus on a replacement.

It’s also a change of heart.

Administration lawyers once took a limited view of the state-driven challenge, saying a narrow slice of Obamacare should be struck after Congress decided to zero out the penalty for shirking insurance as part of the GOP tax overhaul.

They changed course after the lower court sided with state Republicans who say the tweak made the entire program unconstitutional, including its protections for sicker Americans, subsidies for private coverage and sweeping expansion of Medicaid in dozens of states.

“In the district court, the Department of Justice took the position that the remainder of the ACA was severable, but upon further consideration and review of the district court’s opinion, it is the position of the United States that the balance of the ACA also is inseverable and must be struck down,” Justice attorneys wrote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

If upheld on appeal, the case would force Washington to revisit health reform. Yet any decision that wipes away Obamacare’s sweeping benefits could politically injure the GOP in the middle of the 2020 campaign.

Despite that risk, red states that filed the lawsuit in 2018 urged the appeals court to affirm the Texas ruling from December.

“The district court correctly recognized all this in declaring the ACA unlawful in its entirety,” the states said in their own brief Wednesday. “The Department of Justice now agrees — and so too should this court.”

Blue-state attorneys general and House Democrats are fighting back in the appellate courts. They say the challenge before the Fifth Circuit is misguided, because Congress intentionally left the rest of Obamacare alone when it attacked the individual mandate.

They also stress the potential consequences of striking down the entire law, since millions gained coverage under its most popular provisions.

For his part, Mr. Trump thinks the Supreme Court will strike down Obamacare in the end.

He recently said it would clear the way for the GOP to repeal and replace the law after their embarrassing failure in 2017.

Senate GOP leaders said they have no intention of revisiting the issue, however — for one thing, Democrats control the House. That forced the president back off from his nascent push and punt a repeal vote until after the 2020 elections.

Some Democrats are looking beyond Obamacare and proposing a sweeping, government-run plan known as single-payer health care or “Medicare for All,” citing the nearly 30 million who remain uninsured despite the 2010 law.

The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday released a laundry list of complexities for drafters of a single-payer plan to consider, such as government’s role in administering the plan and funding it, who would be eligible for coverage and whether enrollees must pay a share of costs.

Architects of the system would also have to figure out whether private insurers could exist alongside the government plan, or if they’d be relegated to covering things like cosmetic surgery.

“Establishing a single-payer system would be a major undertaking that would involve substantial changes in the sources and extent of coverage, provider payment rates, and financing methods of health care in the United States,” the CBO wrote.

"Senators question whether Interior watchdog, solicitor nominees can handle mounting scandals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-scandals-trump-bernhardt-koch-e022d03abd43/,"Senators questioned two senior Interior Department nominees Thursday about their ability to fairly and independently do their work while the Interior secretary and several top officials are under investigation for potential ethics violations.

Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch adviser, would oversee legal, ethical, and public records decisions as solicitor. Mark Greenblatt would be responsible for probing these decisions as inspector general, head of the department’s internal watchdog.

These are among “the most important” roles at the Interior Department due to their oversight responsibilities, said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, adding they must both be willing “to speak truth to power.”

The nominees, however, have come under scrutiny regarding concerns about Jorjani’s potential conflicts of interest along with questions about both Jorjani and Greenblatt’s ability to hold officials to account.

As inspector general, Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) — would be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Secretary David Bernhardt, including allegations that he failed to disclose controversial meetings on his public calendar.

There are also six other senior officials who are under investigation for potentially violating their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

In response to a question by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) regarding yet another scandal — the reported suppression of documents related to a Fish and Wildlife Service study on the impact of pesticides on endangered species — Greenblatt said, “I have zero intent of walking in the door and shutting down that investigation or any matter in front of the OIG.”

Testifying alongside Greenblatt on Thursday was Jorjani, a man who will likely be among those investigated by Greenblatt due to his role as acting solicitor since May 2017.

“The grotesque scandals at the Interior Department, in effect, are going to be part of an especially bizarre twist this morning,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said as he began his questioning. “Jorjani believes he deserves an ethics promotion,” yet his work coincided with “a blizzard of ethical lapses by [former Secretary] Mr. Ryan Zinke.”

“Next to him is Greenblatt,” who is nominated to “a job charged with being a key line of defense against corruption,” Wyden continued.

Prior to his time at the Interior Department, Jorjani worked as a former adviser to Charles Koch as well as general counsel at Freedom Partners, a nonprofit funded by Charles and his brother David. The billionaire petrochemical brothers are well-known for funding climate science denial.

But as Hirono noted, the biography submitted by Jorjani to the committee failed to mention his years working for the Kochs. “It’s hard to imagine this did not impact your opinions [issued in favor of oil and gas at Interior],” she argued.

In his current role, Jorjani is facing a number of legal challenges, including his opinion issued in favor of narrowing of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to remove an Obama-era interpretation that allowed federal officials to prosecute energy companies that accidentally kill birds in the course of their business activities.

He also approved the release of mineral leases to a company planning a copper-nickel mine near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

Both of these decisions were seen as victories for extractive industries.

Thursday’s hearing also provided an opportunity to question Jorjani about his work under the scandal-ridden former secretary, Ryan Zinke.

Advertisement

Jorjani boasted about having “successfully protected” Interior political appointees from facing investigations, according to a March 2017 email to colleagues, telling them it was their job to do the same for Zinke. “At the end of the day our job is to protect the Secretary,” he wrote.

In response to multiple questions on Thursday about this email, Jorjani claimed that he was speaking about protecting the secretary from the misuse of taxpayer money “and poor judgement” by another Interior official.

But Wyden countered that, instead, the responsibility should be “protecting the best interest of the American people before those of the secretary or special interests.”

Jorjani came under further scrutiny during the hearing for his role in overseeing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Right before stepping down, Zinke quietly issued a secretarial order giving Jorjani authority to oversee all FOIA requests at the department. A surge in requests, along with increased litigation and subsequent delays, were reasons given for the change. Jorjani would continue overseeing FOIA requests in the new role if confirmed.

Critics, however, have expressed concern that putting a political appointee in charge of public records requests gives the Trump administration greater power to withhold information from the public.

Given all of these issues, Wyden pressed Greenblatt on what specific steps he would take to “maintain your independence” while “someone like Mr. Jorjani is attempting to interfere with your work?”

“I have no problem making referrals over to the Department of Justice… I’ll have DOJ on speed dial if I need to,” Greenblatt replied, asserting he’d “follow the evidence wherever it goes.”

The committee must vote on both nominations before they advance to the Senate floor, where they will likely be confirmed by the Republican-controlled chamber."
ACLU sues Homeland Security to stop feds from moving immigrant detainees far from Orange County,http://www.ocregister.com,"['Roxana Kopetman', 'Roxana Kopetman Is A Staff Writer At The Orange County Register.']",05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.ocregister.com/aclu-hopes-lawsuit-will-prevent-feds-from-sending-immigrant-detainees-out-of-state,"Ubaldo Arroyo, who has lived most of his life in Orange County, is being held as an undocumented detainee at the James A. Musick Detention Facility in Irvine, unsure where he will be sent following the Orange County Sheriff’s announcement that it will no longer house detainees while their deportation cases are pending.

Bashir Abdi Wabare, a Somalian who arrived last December seeking asylum, faces similar uncertainties. He is imprisoned at the Theo Lacy Detention Facility near Orange.

On behalf of Arroyo, Wabare and other immigrants detained in Orange County, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and others seeking to halt the transfer of detainees to far-away locations, where detainees would face hurdles in talking with attorneys and seeing their families.

The ACLU also plans to file a request for a preliminary injunction to stop any transfers pending a trial unless the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency will commit to refrain from transferring detainees outside of Southern California, said Sameer Ahmed, a UCLA senior staff attorney.

ICE officials declined to comment on the pending litigation.

Orange County Sheriff Dan Barnes announced on March 27 that his department would end its contract with ICE to house up to 958 civilian immigrant detainees. Barnes said the move would help the department better focus on the mental health and substance abuse needs of its general inmate population as his agency works to upgrade existing facilities and build a new Musick detention center.

Immigrant-rights advocates immediately expressed concern about the fate of the civilian immigrant detainees – which at the time numbered around 700 – and asked that they be released as they go through the immigration court process.

At the time of the Sheriff’s announcement, ICE issued a statement saying that Orange County’s move “will negatively impact local ICE operations” and detainees will likely be moved to far-off locations, making family and attorney visits much harder.

Since then, the number of immigrant detainees in Orange County has decreased and ICE has not said where they are being transferred. Some have been transferred to Adelanto, immigrant-rights advocates said. As of Thursday, May 2, the number had dropped to 404, according to a Sheriff’s spokeswoman.

According to the lawsuit, an ICE deportation officer told an attorney with the Immigrant Defenders Law Center on April 18 that immigrants at Theo Lacy would be sent to northern California, Florida and other states. The only exceptions would be immigrant detainees who have mental disabilities and fall under a 2013 class-action case; those detainees would be transferred to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Santa Ana. Defendants in the suit include the departments of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as two Orange County Sheriff’s captains at the Theo Lacy and Musick facilities, among others.

“ICE’s decision to transfer immigrants thousands of miles away from their lawyers and families violates the Constitution and ICE’s own policies,” Ahmed said.

It would make it difficult, if not impossible, to build cases if the detainees are cut off from their attorneys and families, according to Ahmed and representatives from two other legal organizations participating in the suit, the Public Law Center in Santa Ana and Public Counsel in Los Angeles. The transfers would, among other things, violate the federal Immigration and Nationality Act and ICE’s own policies, according to the lawsuit.

The ACLU lawsuit reiterates the request made by immigrant-rights advocates since Barnes’ announcement: that ICE release immigrant detainees on parole or bond, and that detainees who cannot be released be transferred to Adelanto.

The plaintiffs are a mix of new arrivals seeking asylum and long-time locals, including: Jorge Poroj, a permanent legal resident from Los Angeles who faces possible deportation following a criminal conviction; David Blea, of Thousand Oaks, whose family includes five U.S.-born children; and Sergio Jonathan Moreno, of El Monte, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has a daughter born here.

Other plaintiffs include asylum seekers from Honduras and the African countries of Eritrea and Cameroon."
Trump’s Labor Department weighed in on gig workers’ rights.,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/1/18525459/gig-economy-labor-department-trump-uber-lyft-doordash-taskrabbit,"Approximately 57 million people in the US do some sort of work in the gig economy. Some of them drive cars for Uber and Lyft, deliver groceries for Instacart and Doordash, walk dogs for Wag and Rover, clean houses through Task Rabbit and Handy, and manage apartment properties on Airbnb.

The market has grown quickly over the past few years, bringing in as much as $864 billion annually, according to some estimates. And with it, there’s been a lot of talk about the rights of these workers. They’ve been fighting for fair treatment for a while now; since they’re considered contractors, they don’t get benefits like insurance, worker’s comp, or paid vacation. Sociologists, labor experts, and economists have all weighed in on the issue, largely agreeing that gig workers deserve the same fair treatment as regular employees.

On April 29, the United States Labor Department offered its own interpretation on the matter. After a lawyer working for an unnamed cleaning company reached out to clarify how gig workers should be classified, the department responded in a letter that’s since been posted online. In the letter, the Labor Department said it classifies gig workers as contractors, not employees:

“Based on the facts you provide in your letter, it appears that the service providers who use your client’s virtual marketplace are independent contractors. Your client provides a referral service. As such, it does not receive services from service providers, but empowers service providers to provide services to end-market consumers.”

The letter could have huge implications for the future of the gig economy. It essentially renders gig workers exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law written in 1938 that guarantees overtime pay and a minimum wage to many who work more than 40 hours.

It’s caused plenty of disagreement. On Monday, the National Employment Law Project tweeted that the letter essentially allows gig economy companies to “underpay and overwork” this class of workers.

DOL opinion letter attempts to allow an unnamed #GigEconomy company to underpay and overwork its workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors. But if workers have all the restrictions of employees, they should get the protections. https://t.co/b6m5NFlFaF — NELP (@NelpNews) April 29, 2019

So what’s the department’s logic? It reasoned that, because the unnamed cleaning company doesn’t pay for professional certification, licensing, or let workers expense products, they should clearly be seen as contractors. It also points out that since workers don’t have set hours or shifts, they should be free to “pursue any and all external opportunities at their leisure,” which means that the company should not be seen as the main party responsible for them.

This type of reasoning is pretty different from how the Labor Department under Barack Obama’s administration viewed the gig economy. In 2015, for example, it issued a new interpretation of the word “employ,” writing that the administration believes “most workers” should be included in the FSLA. Obama’s Labor Department called on Uber and Lyft to reconsider how they classify their workers, pointing out that one crucial detail in the debate of contractor versus employee was whether the workers are “integral,” and that drivers were, indeed, integral to Uber and Lyft.

This opinion, though, has all but been abandoned by the Trump administration, as the New York Times points out. Trump’s Labor Department largely tossed Obama’s favorable interpretations of gig workers in favor of Silicon Valley.

The Labor Department’s letter does not necessarily represent the law; the opinion currently only applies to the unnamed cleaning company that had written to the agency. But as Reuters notes, though, it “can be presented in court to boost claims by plaintiffs or defendants in cases involving similar issues.”

Public opinion can work in favor of these workers’ rights, however. Back in February, for example, grocery delivery app users were outraged to learn about allegations of tipping theft at Instacart and DoorDash, and vowed to stop using these services. This response led Instacart to revamp its tipping policy. Uber and Lyft, too, have responded to public pressure, and agreed in December 2018 to pay drivers in New York City a minimum wage of $17.22 an hour. So even if the current administration isn’t on the side of gig workers, outside pressure could still result in change.

Justice Department offers first arguments to strike down ObamaCare,https://thehill.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/441760-justice-department-offers-first-arguments-to-strike-down-obamacare,"The Justice Department on Wednesday made its first full argument in federal court that the Affordable Care Act in its entirety “should not be allowed to remain in effect,” according to CNN.

In the filing in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt reportedly said the Trump administration has abandoned its earlier position that parts of the law could remain in effect even if its individual mandate were thrown out.

“[P]icking and choosing which provisions to invalidate,"" Hunt wrote, would undermine Congressional authority and the law should instead be struck down entirely, according to CNN.

""Allowing some of the reforms to go into effect without others with which they are inextricably linked would not be giving effect to the statute but rewriting it, which is the prerogative of Congress rather than the courts,"" he added, according to the news outlet.

The government wants the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act’s “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” provisions, which prevent coverage discrimination based on preexisting conditions, as well as provisions unrelated to the individual mandate, such as Medicaid eligibility expansion. The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could choose to opt out of the Medicaid expansion provision.

The 5th Circuit is set to hear the case in July, meaning the case could end up before the Supreme Court in its next term, putting the issue front and center in an election year.

On the first anniversary of taking office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addresses unveils a new departmental ""ethos"" in the lobby of the State Department in April 2019. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Once upon a time, the director of policy planning for the State Department was a pretty prestigious job. George Kennan, he of the “Long Telegram” and “Sources of Soviet Conduct” fame, was the first director. Some of the others — Paul Nitze, Bob Bowie, Walt Rostow, Dennis A. Ross, James Steinberg, Richard Haass, Anne-Marie Slaughter — have been among the more distinguished foreign policy thinkers in this country. A strong director of policy planning can serve as a vital adjunct to the secretary of state and act as a reminder about the nation’s strategic interests. A good policy planning director is adept at avoiding trivia, distinguishing the important from the urgent, and acting as a check against an administration’s worst impulses.

Brian Hook, the director of policy planning under Rex Tillerson, was granted a tremendous amount of authority but stumbled badly. He was a relative neophyte attempting to counsel a complete neophyte on the ins and outs of the job. He did ... poorly.

When Mike Pompeo came on, he hired Kiron Skinner to run policy planning. In contrast to Hook, she has thought about this stuff for a while. She has the academic credentials and publishing record one would expect for that job. She is also an African American woman, a rarity in the upper echelons of the Trump administration (particularly in the diplomatic corps).

Since coming on in September of last year, however, Skinner has made some odd statements. She penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed last December that made it clear she had written Mike Pompeo’s badly received Brussels speech that caricatured multilateralism beyond all recognition. In the op-ed, she claimed that “the Trump administration is acting to preserve a just, transparent, and free world of sovereign states,” which sounds way too close to Vladimir Putin’s notion of “sovereign democracy” for my comfort.

On Monday, she sat down with Slaughter to chat about the Trump administration’s grand strategy at the New America Foundation. The New Yorker’s Masha Gessen attended and found it unnerving:

A large part of Skinner’s job is listening to what the President says and trying to make sense of it. She said as much. “The president provides the hunches and instincts,” she said, “and it’s my job, and that of Secretary Pompeo, to turn those hunches and instincts into hypotheses.” She called the hypotheses the “Trump Doctrine” and the “Pompeo Corollary.” Slaughter, logically, asked what the Trump Doctrine was. “That’s a tough one,” Skinner responded, without a hint of irony. “It is, in a kind of broad way, a set of pillars that address 21st-century realities.” The pillars were: the “return to national sovereignty”; national interest; reciprocity in international relations and trade; “burden sharing,” particularly in defense; and “new regional partnerships” for what she described as “particular crises.”

Skinner’s comments unnerved Gessen for the same reason that her WSJ op-ed unnerved me: “I had heard the isolationism and destruction of Putin’s rule be framed in phrases such as ‘sovereign democracy’ and in a lot of other plausible-sounding policy gobbledygook that served to rob every word of familiar meaning.”

To be fair, however, Skinner did say some things that were a lot of things, but decidedly not gobbledygook. The Washington Examiner’s Joel Gehrke reported on that element of Skinner’s comments, in which she was described as leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations akin to what Kennan did for the Soviet Union:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.... “The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”.... Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department. “It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That’s not really possible with China.”

So there’s a lot going on in just those few paragraphs. Because I was just handed a whole bunch of final papers to grade, I have grading on the brain right now. Here’s how I would grade Skinner if she had made an oral presentation like this one for my Art and Science of Statecraft class:

Kiron,

You observe, correctly, that Donald Trump has forced the foreign policy community to revisit “first principles.” And what you said to Slaughter was certainly consistent with the key components of the Trump’s administration’s National Security Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition as the priority for the United States going forward. Furthermore, although controversial, your implicit use of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” frame does get at one aspect of the Chinese challenge: to Beijing, this is not about a rise to great power status, it is a return to that status, consistent with its civilizational history.

That said, there are some real flaws with your oral defense. For one thing, your claim that China represents the first non-Caucasian great power competitor to the United States is factually incorrect, unless the Germans really did bomb Pearl Harbor. For another thing, why in the name of all that is holy would you make a racial distinction with respect to the great powers?! If you want to say that China is Confucian, or based on a different set of civilizational principles than the United States, sure, give it a try. Why say “not Caucasian”?! Does this mean India or Japan or South Korea should also be approached differently, because they are not white civilizations?! Why use race as your unit of analysis?

Furthermore, if you are going to use a Huntingtonian frame, you should know that he treated Russia as “Orthodox” and therefore distinct from Western civilization. Sure, the Soviet Union incorporated the very Western thought of Karl Marx, but last I checked — hold on a sec — yep, I just checked again and it turns out that China’s ruling party is also totally into Marx! Why is China so different?

Finally, I am very unclear as to why China’s civilization renders it less vulnerable to human rights treaties than the Soviet Union. If you recall, conservatives really disliked the Helsinki Final Act when it was actually negotiated, and it caught many of them by surprise that it helped inspire the Charter 77 movement and other acts of dissidence. It is not like China has no history of dissident appeals to Western liberal values (see here and here). Furthermore, you should be familiar with works by Iain Johnston, or Stacie Goddard, or Rosemary Foot and Andrew Walter, that discuss how China’s participation in Western institutions has had an impact on its self-perception.

There are perfectly valid reasons for the Trump administration to prioritize China as a strategic threat. This is one of the few Trump statements that generates bipartisan support. If you are trying to articulate a “Sources of Chinese Conduct” essay, however, it would be a very good idea to get beyond the fact that China is not a country filled with Caucasians. In fact, maybe just disregard the race angle altogether. It inflames far more than it illuminates.

Kennan could write “Sources of Soviet Conduct” because he was a longstanding expert on Soviet politics. Your comments on China suggest you could use a few old Asia hands to help with some tutoring. You clearly have a lot more work to do to persuade me that American grand strategy isn’t doomed.

Schiff refers Blackwater founder Prince to DOJ over alleged false statements to Congress,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-refers-blackwater-founder-erik-prince-to-doj-over-alleged-false-statements-to-congress,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., formally referred Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation over whether Prince lied to the panel about a 2016 meeting in the Seychelles islands with a Russian banker tied to Vladimir Putin.

In a statement, the committee said it had “identified at least six categories of materially false statements” Prince made about the meeting with Kirill Dmitriev when he appeared before the committee in November 2017.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Schiff said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials “strongly indicates that Erik Prince knowingly and willfully provided materially false testimony,” which Schiff argued “hindered the Committee’s ability to fully understand and examine foreign efforts to undermine our political process and national security, develop appropriate legislative and policy remedies to counter future malign influence operations targeting campaigns and presidential transitions, and inform the American public, as appropriate.”

SCHIFF HEDGES ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT, SAYS INSTEAD, 'VOTE HIS A-- OUT OF OFFICE'

“I do believe that there is very strong evidence that he willingly misled the committee and willingly made false statements to the committee,” Schiff told The Washington Post’s Bob Costa during a panel event earlier Tuesday.

“The evidence is so weighty that the Justice Department needs to consider this. His testimony, which I can discuss because it is public record, was that his meeting in Seychelles with this Russian banker [Dmitriev] was purely by chance. He just happened to go to Seychelles for about a day and have a chance meeting with the Russian banker.”

Prince, the founder of the private military contractor Blackwater, and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, testified in 2017 that the meeting with the Russian banker was a chance encounter. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed that the meeting was set up ahead of time.

“We know from the Mueller report that this was not a chance meeting,” Schiff said Tuesday. “We know there were communications after he returned.”

Schiff added that Prince had “discussions” with former White House adviser Steve Bannon about the meeting before he left, and “communications” after he returned from the meeting, a claim the lawmaker said was contradicted by the Mueller report.

SCHIFF REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON CLAIMS AGAINST TRUMP, SAYS HE HAS NO REGRETS

“Somehow, mysteriously, magically, the communications between Prince and Bannon have apparently fled their devices,” Schiff said. “In very material ways, I think the evidence strongly suggests that he willingly misled our committee and the Justice Department needs to consider whether there’s a prosecutable case.”

Schiff added that when Bannon appeared before his committee, he “refused to answer almost all of our questions.”

“He said he was not answering questions because the White House asked him not to,” Schiff said.

Schiff was also asked whether his panel felt that President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner gave false testimony.

“I don’t want to comment on any others. We have reached the point of ripeness with Prince’s testimony that we feel it appropriate to refer it,” Schiff said. “I don’t want to comment on any others.”

Schiff’s comments come in the midst of a heated battle between Congress and the White House over subpoenas for former and current officials to testify before House committees leading sweeping Trump-focused probes. Schiff’s panel is currently investigating the president’s finances.
