President Donald Trump at an NRCC dinner tonight and sounded off on a number of issues, including the allegations of inappropriate behavior against former Vice President Joe Biden.
“Our former vice president, he’s––I was gonna call him, I don’t know him well. I was going to say, ‘Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?’” Trump said tonight. President Trump alludes to allegations against former VP Biden during remarks at NRCC dinner: ""I was going to call him. I don't know him well.

After Kellyanne Conway swiped at Biden earlier this week, people pointed out the hypocrisy from Team Trump given the allegations against the president himself.

President Donald Trump made it clear Tuesday that he was looking forward to a 2020 showdown that features the Green New Deal.
The president, who was speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee’s Spring Dinner, cheered freshman Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for her role in bringing the Green New Deal to the forefront of the political conversation.
“The Great New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29 years old, wonderful woman,” he began. “Don’t kill it, because we’d like to be able to run against it.” Trump praises @AOC Green New Deal: ""Done by a young bartender, 29 years old, wonderful woman.”

But then Trump revealed why he has so much affection for the widely-panned initiative that would seek to ban private means of transportation, air travel and cow flatulence: he believes he can beat it.
“If they beat me with the Green New Deal , I deserve to lose,” he explained. “The Green New Deal, started by a 29 year old bartender…If they beat me with the Green New Deal, I deserve to lose.” – Trump on @AOC

France: Pickpocketing in Paris Metro Surges in 2019,www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/04/03/pickpocketing-in-paris-metro-surges-in-2019/," Pickpocketing in Paris Metro Surges in 2019 FRANCOIS GUILLOT/AFP/Getty Images CHRIS TOMLINSON 3 Apr 2019 Pickpocketing on the Paris metro has dramatically increased so far this year with police saying they have seen a 33 per cent rise in just three months. Warnings of pickpockets operating on trains are now commonly broadcast on metro lines that serve tourist areas in the city with roving bands of young pickpockets often getting on trains at the Bir-Hakeim station in the 15th arrondissement, Le Parisien reports.
Most of the thieves are young and work in groups of five or ten at a time and are often migrants, some from Eastern Europe.
Many of the pickpockets are identifiable by the large shoulder bags they often carry to store what they have stolen. Their targets are generally tourists as locals have learnt to become more cautious while riding the metro with one metro user remarking, “It’s stupid but we have been forced to become suspicious.”
Sex Attacks up 30 Percent on Paris Public Transport System https://t.co/300CGuyD2B
 March 13, 2019
An employee of the RATP, the company which administers Paris’s public transport system, said that victims often come to them but are reluctant to make formal complaints, preferring to not “waste time.”
“We call the police to intervene, but as the thieves know their rights perfectly, they say they are minors and are released within 15 minutes,” another employee noted and added, “I have already been threatened with death. They come back to insult us.”
The report comes less than a month after Paris police noted that sex attacks in the Ile-de-France region had increased by 30 per cent last year, with 1,159 cases reported.
Laurent Nuñez, secretary of state at the Ministry of the Interior, also suggested the actual number of sex assaults could be even higher saying that only around ten per cent of women subjected to sexual violence actually reported incidents to the police.
Parts of the metro are also becoming dangerous due to the prevalence of drugs in certain areas, with RATP drivers refusing to stop at certain stations due to the potential of violence towards passengers and staff.

"After Mosque Shootings, A Rebranding Debate Over Christchurch's Rugby Crusaders",www.gpb.org,editor,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/after-mosque-shootings-rebranding-debate-over-christchurchs-rugby-crusaders,"After Mosque Shootings, A Rebranding Debate Over Christchurch's Rugby Crusaders By Francesca Paris • 2 hours ago Pictured here in 2018, the Crusader horseman ride around the arena prior to the start of a Super Rugby semifinal match. The Crusaders announced Wednesday that they will be considering a change to their name and branding following the Christchurch attacks on March 15. Mark Baker / AP
The Crusaders rugby team will consider dropping its imagery of sword-bearing knights on horseback and changing its name, following last month's shootings at two mosques in Christchurch that killed 50 people.
The current branding of the Christchurch-based team is ""no longer tenable"" because of associations with religious war, New Zealand Rugby's chief executive, Steve Tew, said in a statement released on Wednesday . He said ""maintaining the status quo"" of the name and imagery was not under consideration.
Tew said it was clear that the Super Rugby franchise's symbolism was ""offensive to some in the community due to its association with the religious Crusades between Christians and Muslims."" The team says it will decide the extent of the rebranding — whether to overturn its brand completely or retire its imaging but keep the name — in consultation with an independent research company.
The team will also halt its traditional pre-match entertainment of knights riding horses, The Associated Press reports .
Calls for Super Rugby's top franchise to consider changing its symbols have come from fans, community members, commentators and lawmakers in the weeks following the March 15 terroristattacks that left dozens wounded and shocked the country.
The team, along with others, opted to cancel a highly-anticipated match that was scheduled for the following day out of respect for the victims. On the heels of the cancellation, Crusaders CEO Colin Mansbridge said the franchise would delay considering any branding changes until ""an appropriate time.""
Several days after the shooting, the team was already undertaking discussions with the Muslim community in Christchurch, according to Grant Robertson, New Zealand's minister for sport and recreation.
""I think that's appropriate, clearly this is a big issue in Canterbury,"" he was quoted as saying by New Zealand newspaper Stuff on March 19. ""The Crusaders is a well-established name and brand, but I think it's a responsible action to undertake those conversations now.""
Some New Zealanders have expressed resistance to the change, in part because of how established the franchise is.
On Wednesday, Mansbridge reiterated the defense of the brand that he had originally put forward just days after the shooting. ""Our challenge is that the name Crusader has come to mean something quite different to many of the team's supporters,"" he said. ""This team is proud of the positive contribution it makes to the community.""
Mansbridge said ""tragic and trying events"" had molded the team into a galvanizing force for the region, making the name ""more reflective of a positive Crusade."" Those sentiments were echoed online and in New Zealand media, with one radio DJ arguing the team played an important role for the Christchurch community following the 2011 earthquake that killed 185 people.
Other people took issue with Tew's statement that an association with the religious Crusades ""has now been drawn.""
""The link has not been 'drawn'...it has been actively promoted for years,"" tweeted Liam Dann, New Zealand Herald Business Editor-at-Large.
The Crusades were a series of religious wars between Christians and Muslims over territorial control of holy sites in the medieval period.
According to the team, the Crusaders brand was modeled off ""a stylised version of medieval England, in a nod to the English heritage of Christchurch,"" when the Super Rugby competition began in 1996. The team's website describes the horsemen logo, recognizable ""Conquest of Paradise"" theme song and center-piece sword as ""pieces of the Crusaders jigsaw have made the Crusaders concept widely recognised and so intimidating for visiting teams.""
The franchise's name and wardrobe will remain the same through the end of the 2019 season. The team has invited the public to offer feedback about the branding. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
"USDA Terminates Deadly Cat Experiments, Plans To Adopt Out Remaining Animals",www.gpb.org,Vanessa Romo,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/usda-terminates-deadly-cat-experiments-plans-adopt-out-remaining-animals,"By Vanessa Romo • 10 hours ago The United States Department of Agriculture announced on Tuesday it will discontinue a research program that involved killing thousands of cats. The agency has been under pressure to put an end to the program. USDA photo obtained through a FOIA request / White Coat Waste Project
The U.S. Agriculture Department announced Tuesday that it's putting an end to a controversial research program that led scientists to kill thousands of cats over decades.
Since 1982 the USDA's Agricultural Research Services division had been conducting experiments that involved infecting cats with toxoplasmosis — a disease usually caused by eating undercooked contaminated meat — in order to study the foodborne illness. Once the cats were infected, and the parasite harvested, the felines were put down.
In a statement announcing the decision, the agency said ""toxoplasmosis research has been redirected and the use of cats as part of any research protocol in any ARS laboratory has been discontinued and will not be reinstated.""
Additionally, the USDA said it is in the process of putting the 14 remaining uninfected cats up for adoption by agency employees.
The experiments came under increasing scrutiny over the last year and public outcry intensified over recent weeks in the wake of a report by the White Coat Waste Project that found the USDA's researchers also forced the lab cats to eat dog and cat meat obtained in overseas markets.
The aim of that seemingly gruesome practice — dubbed ""kitten cannibalism"" by critics — was to understand how widespread the parasitic disease is in animals around the world, Justin Goodman, vice president of the White Coat Waste Project, a group that works to end government animal testing, told NPR.
""We are elated that after a year of campaigning we have relegated the slaughter of kittens to the litter box of history,"" Goodman said.
He said the organization obtained details about the agency's active protocols through a Freedom of Information Act request ""that detailed how the USDA was breeding 100 kittens a year in a Maryland lab.""
""At eight weeks, [scientists] would feed them infected meat, harvest parasitic eggs from their feces to be used in other experiments, then kill them,"" Goodman said.
He estimates more than 3,000 cats have been killed since the founding of the research program at a cost of about $22 million to taxpayers.
""Kittens become immune after two weeks and still the USDA was incinerating them,"" Goodman said.
Kim Kaplan, a USDA spokeswoman, told NPR 239 cats were euthanized between 2013 to 2018, adding that the lab discontinued infecting cats in September.
The nonprofit group's reporting brought widespread attention to the controversial program, and resulted in bipartisan legislation to ban animal testing by the USDA. In May, Reps. Mike Bishop, R-Mich., and Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., introduced a bill called the "" Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now Act of 2018 ,"" also known as the KITTEN Act, to stop the USDA from using cats and kittens in experiments. That was followed in December by a Senate version of the bill , introduced by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.
""The USDA made the right decision today, and I applaud them for their willingness to change course,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""It's a good day for our four-legged friends across America,"" he said, adding that it was past time the ""archaic practice and horrific treatment"" was stopped.
Panetta responded to the announcement saying, ""I commend the USDA for their decision to end this type of testing on kittens. They listened to the people and responded appropriately to our concerns. This is how our institutions, our government, and our democracy should and must work.""
""With all the awful reports coming out, it was clear that Americans opposed USDA's cruel testing on kittens. This is a decisive victory against government animal abuse and wasteful spending,"" Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., another cosponsor of the House bill, said on Wednesday.
Mast also thanked Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue ""for his leadership in ensuring no more kittens are ever used in research and that the last cats remaining at USDA can be adopted.""
According to the USDA its research has helped to cut the prevalence of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite by as much as 50 percent in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 40 million Americans may be infected with the parasite. While the vast majority of those infected have no symptoms, it can be deadly for people with weak immune systems, such as children and HIV patients.
The USDA said it is ""continually assessing our research and priorities and aligning our resources to the problems of highest national priority.""
""Over the course of this research, [the Agricultural Research Service] worked to minimize reliance on cats,"" the USDA said.
As recently as November, an independent panel advising the USDA ruled that the risk to human health was too great to allow infected cats to be placed for adoption.
It is the same panel that recommended that cats that were never infected should be made available for adoption. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
A Chinese woman carrying a thumb drive full of malware was arrested this weekend for lying her way into Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The president was golfing at a nearby property at the time, though he and his family were staying at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. The Miami Herald has the story. Reporter Nicholas Nehamas joins us now. Welcome.
NICHOLAS NEHAMAS: Glad to be here.
SHAPIRO: We don't know much about this woman. What can you tell us about her?
NEHAMAS: Well, we know her name was Yujing Zhang. She came to Mar-a-Lago for an event with a group called the United Nations Friendship Association. And she was carrying Taiwanese passports. Beyond that, we don't really know who she is.
SHAPIRO: She was also carrying a lot of electronics. What did they find on her?
NEHAMAS: Yeah. She had four cellphones, one laptop, one external hard drive and one thumb drive that contained malware according to the U.S. Secret Service. But beyond that, we don't know much about what kind of malware it was, whether her device had been unintentionally infected with it or whether she had loaded that malware onto the thumb drive herself.
SHAPIRO: So the charges that she faces include making false statements to a federal officer and entering restricted property. Can you give us the play-by-play as best we understand it?
NEHAMAS: Yeah, so she came to Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club, and said she wanted to use the pool and kind of implied that she was the relative of a member of Mar-a-Lago with a similar or the same surname and kind of got into the reception area that way. But then it turned out she wasn't on any list, and then her story changed, that she was here for this U.N. event, something which had been advertised by Cindy Yang. And that's when the Secret Service detained her.
SHAPIRO: OK, I want to dig a little deeper into this woman Cindy Yang - her real name is Li Yang - who has been in the news before in connection with a massage parlor that was at the center of a prostitution bust. She's also accused of selling access to the Trump family. How does this woman factor into the story?
NEHAMAS: So Ms. Yang, who, you know, as you said, owned the massage parlor where Robert Kraft was arrested, charged with soliciting prostitution, had a side business where she sold access to the president and his family, to events at Mar-a-Lago to Chinese business executives. And she had advertised an event set to take place at Mar-a-Lago on that day. It had been canceled after a lot of news reporting on her activities. So the woman who showed up to the club on Saturday said she was there for an event that had been canceled.
SHAPIRO: And Democrats have called for a counterintelligence investigation into Yang. That was before this latest story broke about the woman being busted with malware on a thumb drive. So how does that relate to this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, that's right. There are concerns by national security experts that Ms. Yang has ties to groups in the U.S. that are projections of the Chinese Communist Party's goals abroad. And so the Democrats are asking for an examination of how closely tied is she, if at all, to China's government and its efforts abroad.
SHAPIRO: I've heard people say ever since President Trump was elected that Mar-a-Lago presents a security threat. On the other hand, this woman was caught and arrested. So do you think this shows the weakness of Mar-a-Lago or the strength of the security perimeter that's there?
NEHAMAS: Well, you know, I don't think we quite know enough about what the situation was. You know, was it a harmless, confused tourist? Was it something more sinister? But certainly it is true that she was stopped well before she got into the club. And the president was golfing not at Mar-a-Lago but at his nearby golf course. So he was not present when this happened.
SHAPIRO: I know a lot of the details that you're sharing with us come from public court documents. Is there a court appearance scheduled for the woman at the center of this?

"Judge Throws Out Panhandling Law, Says Physical Interaction Is Free Speech",www.gpb.org,Matthew S. Schwartz,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/judge-throws-out-panhandling-law-says-physical-interaction-free-speech,"By Matthew S. Schwartz • 10 hours ago A man panhandles in the median strip on a street in Portland, Maine, in 2017. A federal judge in Arkansas ruled Tuesday that a law forbidding panhandlers to physically interact with people in cars is unconstitutional. Robert F. Bukaty / AP Originally published on April 2, 2019 11:14 pm
When a panhandler approaches a car in the intersection — his hand out, his eyes wide — that physical interaction is protected by the First Amendment, a federal district judge ruled Monday when he threw out an Arkansas city's panhandling ban.
It's the latest such ban to be found unconstitutional since a 2015 Supreme Court decision made it harder for the government to pass laws regarding the content of speech. That case, Reed v. Town of Gilbert, had to do with regulating church signs , but courts around the country have cited the case as they strike down panhandling laws.
To contend with an increase in panhandling at busy intersections, the city of Hot Springs in 2016 passed an ordinance imposing ""an absolute ban"" on solicitation on streets or in medians. After the American Civil Liberties Union sued, the city repealed the ordinance, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette .
In 2017, the city passed a new version of the ordinance. This one eliminated all references to panhandling, and instead made it illegal for pedestrians or the occupant of a motor vehicle to ""interact physically"" while the engine was running on a public roadway.
But that language was still constitutionally problematic, Judge Robert Dawson wrote , because physical interactions can convey love, disgust, sympathy, and myriad other emotions. ""All people everywhere routinely communicate non-verbal messages through physical interaction, often without even noticing it,"" he said. ""It is visceral and instinctive, and it is often the quickest way to communicate.""
So banning physical interaction between pedestrians and the occupants of a vehicle clearly has free speech implications, the judge wrote. ""The Court can think of no reason why a pedestrian would intentionally attempt physical interaction with a motor vehicle or its occupants other than to communicate a message.""
""Putting your hand out expresses you need money,"" attorney Bettina Brownstein, who handled the case for the ACLU, told NPR. ""Unless they're obstructing your traffic, your car, or assaulting you in some way,"" the speech is protected, she said.
People in their cars may be uncomfortable when panhandlers approach but aren't truly being threatened, said Brownstein. And the First Amendment ""takes precedence over everything"" – even the right of people to feel comfort in their cars, she said.
""We respect the Court's decision,"" Hot Springs attorney Brian Albright said via email. ""However, the safety of pedestrians and motorists are still a concern for the City."" Albright said it's too early to say whether the city will appeal the ruling.
The Reed case ""has placed literally every panhandling ordinance in the United States at least under risk,"" said First Amendment scholar Enrique Armijo, associate dean for academic affairs at Elon University School of Law.
Plenty of cities around the country have seen their panhandling laws struck down, Armijo said. Others have changed them to try to fit the new constitutional landscape. Hot Springs ""did a better job than most cities with respect to defining the banned activity in a way that refers more to the conduct than the speech,"" said Armijo, who thinks the judge's ruling could be overturned on appeal.
""It reads the First Amendment a little too broadly, given precedent,"" he said. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

Georgia Bill To Raise Minimum Age for Marriage Heads To Governor's Desk,www.gpb.org,Ross Terrell,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/georgia-bill-raise-minimum-age-marriage-heads-governors-desk,"By Ross Terrell • 10 hours ago Grand Velas Riviera Maya / Flickr
Georgia lawmakers have agreed to raise the minimum age for marriage from 16 to 17 years old. Listen / 0:38
The bill also requires 17-year-olds who want to get married provide proof they've been emancipated from their parents.
And couples must take at least six hours of premarital education before applying for a marriage license.
Additionally, under the new law, there can only be a four year age gap between a 17-year-old and their potential spouse.
The bill lays out instructions for when the court is supposed to deny a marriage license, including if the younger party has been a victim of a sex crime committed by the person who wants to get married.
It now heads to the governor’s desk, where he has 40 days to sign or veto it. Tags:"

"Alyssa Milano, Local Entertainment Workers Protest Georgia Abortion Bill",www.gpb.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/alyssa-milano-local-entertainment-workers-protest-georgia-abortion-bill,"By Stephen Fowler & Ross Terrell • 11 hours ago Alyssa Milano and several local film and television workers protest a Georgia abortion bill Tuesday, April 2, at the Capitol. Stephen Fowler | GPB News
On the final day of the legislative session, actress Alyssa Milano and several local film and television workers held a press conference in opposition to a bill that would effectively end abortion in Georgia around 6 weeks into pregnancy.
Last Friday, the House narrowly sent HB 481 to Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk after it garnered one vote more than needed to pass.
The controversial measure would outlaw most abortions once a doctor detects a heartbeat around six weeks into pregnancy, and establish fetal personhood.
After delivering a letter to Kemp’s office, Milano read the letter to a crowd of onlookers in the state Capitol.
“We've been glad to bring billions of dollars in revenue to support charter schools, parks and communities,” Milano said, listing benefits the entertainment industry brings to the state. “But we cannot, in good conscience continue to recommend our industry remain in Georgia if HB 481 becomes a law.”
Phoebe Brown, a Georgia resident who owns a prop rental house, said if the industry left the state she’d be out of business.
“If there’s no productions to rent to, we can’t survive,” she said. “We have a 15,000 square foot warehouse that we pay rent to a Georgia landlord for, and the overhead alone… we just wouldn’t be able to make it.”
Christy Foreman from Nahunta, Georgia, was at the Capitol as well.
She said that Milano’s stance does not represent all women, especially in the state of Georgia.
""She's coming here to voice her opinion and voice Hollywood's opinion, well that’s OK,” she said. “Go somewhere else, that's fine… we'll keep our morals, you can take Hollywood somewhere else.”
Gov. Kemp is expected to sign the measure after the session ends, but the exact timing is unknown. Tags:"
Fight Over Money For Puerto Rico Brings Disaster Aid Bill To A Standstill,www.gpb.org,Kelsey Snell,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/fight-over-money-puerto-rico-brings-disaster-aid-bill-standstill,"By Kelsey Snell • 11 hours ago Alma Morales Rosario stands between the beams of her home, in the San Lorenzo neighborhood of Morovis, Puerto Rico, which was being rebuilt in September 2018 after being destroyed by Hurricane Maria. Ramon Espinosa / AP Originally published on April 2, 2019 8:00 pm
There are few things Democrats and Republicans in Congress usually agree on, but one of them is rushing federal money to victims of natural disasters.
That sentiment crumbled this week when the Senate failed to advance two separate disaster funding bills. Both included bipartisan funding to help relieve damage across the country from flooding, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes. But a fight over assistance for Puerto Rico has derailed getting a deal on the entire package.
The political fight intensified last week after President Trump told Senate Republicans in a closed-door lunch at the Capitol that he would not support sending any additional money to Puerto Rico, according to several people familiar with the conversation. Democrats, who had already been pushing for additional federal resources for Puerto Rico, responded by insisting that any disaster spending bill must help victims no matter where they reside.
""It is the responsibility of the federal government to stand with all American communities in crisis, and we must do so now,"" said Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. ""The needs are pressing. The people are waiting.""
Democrats say Trump is refusing to release money to help Puerto Rico continue to rebuild more than a year after a pair of hurricanes devastated the island territory. Republicans say they they will support more food assistance for Puerto Rico and are calling on Democrats not to hold the rest of the bill hostage as they push to add money for other programs.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters Tuesday that lawmakers have made virtually no progress on overcoming the impasse. ""Right now, where are we?"" Shelby asked — and then answering his own question said, ""We're stalled.""
Talks effectively ended on Monday night after the Senate failed to advance either of the two bills.
All but one Democrat, Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama, opposed a procedural vote to begin debate on a $13.5 billion spending package for victims of natural disasters. The GOP-backed plan included $600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico but left out additional money Democrats say is necessary to aid hurricane recovery on the island, where some residents are still rebuilding homes and basic services, like Internet connections and electricity, have not yet been fully restored. The GOP plan also included resources to address damage from recent floods in the Midwest.
Republicans then blocked a $14 billion alternative supported by Democrats that passed the House in January.
By Tuesday, Democrats blamed the failure entirely on Trump.
""Everything was moving along and guess who came in and messed it up as usual?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""The president.""
Schumer and other Democrats say they could have worked out an agreement with GOP senators if Trump had not ruled out sending additional funding to Puerto Rico.
Trump has said that Puerto Rico is already receiving sufficient money. He tweeted Tuesday that the island territory has benefited from $91 billion, a figure Democrats dispute. Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019 ....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
Democrats say that number represents the amount of money Puerto Rico should have access to over the lifetime of their recovery — expected to take decades — not money the island already received. They also argue that Trump administration officials have been slow to process requests for money that Congress already approved.
They are particularly frustrated that administration officials haven't issued rules and regulations to allow Puerto Rico to spend $28 billion in rebuilding funds for low-income areas that was approved last year. In 2018, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced plans to allocate nearly $16 billion, including $8.3 billion earmarked for Puerto Rico, but the rules must be issued first, according to a senior Democratic aide.
Democrats say they aren't willing to budge on their demands, and Republicans are unwilling to negotiate. One option Democrats offered was to pair additional money for Puerto Rico with a larger amount for victims of disasters in the Midwest.
But Republicans are not interested.
""The president apparently is not amenable to that at the moment,"" Shelby said.
The fight is already driving fears that spending negotiators will have a difficult time working together on any spending bills in the future.
""Right now there's no cooperation,"" Shelby said. ""I'd like us to work together like we did last year, but right now it seems like there are some impediments."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
Federal Judge Imposes New Probation Terms On PG&E To Reduce Wildfire Risk,www.gpb.org,Richard Gonzales,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/federal-judge-imposes-new-probation-terms-pge-reduce-wildfire-risk,"By Richard Gonzales • 11 hours ago PG&E crews work to restore power lines in Paradise, Calif., after the Camp Fire destroyed much of the Northern California town. Rich Pedroncelli / AP
A federal judge in San Francisco is barring utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric from reissuing dividends in favor of using the funds for reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires in Northern and Central California.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup, in a court hearing Tuesday, also said that he will closely monitor PG&E's compliance with new wildfire prevention rules governing tree-trimming near power lines. Alsup is supervising the utility company's felony probation stemming from its conviction in the case of a massive natural gas pipeline explosion in 2010.
""A lot of money went out in dividends that should have went into tree trimming,"" Alsup said to PG&E acting chief executive John Simon as quoted by the Associated Press. ""PG&E pumped out $4.5 billion in dividends and let the tree budge whither. So a lot of trees should've been take down that were not.""
The judge's order does not include the stringent condition requiring PG&E to inspect its entire power grid as he originally proposed .
Company spokesman James Noonan said in an email that ""we share the court's commitment to safety and understand that we must play a leading role in reducing the risk of wildfire throughout Northern and Central California.""
The court's dividend plan was not a surprise. Last month in a court document , Alsup had signaled his intention to order the company not to issue dividends until it complied with ""all applicable vegetation management requirements.""
PG&E initially had resisted the plan , arguing that it had already suspended dividends in 2017. The dividend payments may not resume without Alsup's permission.
In February, PG&E said that it's "" probable "" that it was responsible for the 2018 Camp Fire that killed at least 85 people and destroyed about 14,000 structures. The company, facing billions of dollars in possible liabilities filed for bankruptcy in January. Alsup is also presiding over that filing in separate proceedings. Copyright 2019 NPR.

The plan? To reduce gridlock while generating revenue for the city's stressed transit system.
State lawmakers approved the deal on Sunday night, and the new tolls are slated to go into effect in 2021. The tolling is expected to generate $15 billion , dedicated to funding the MTA, New York's transit authority.
The plan will be what's known as ""cordon pricing,"" in which motorists pay to enter a zone. In this case, that zone will be Manhattan south of 60th Street.
The precise charges to be levied have not yet been announced. A task force convened by the governor last year suggested different flat fees for cars and trucks.
In New York, automobiles move slowly these days, with drivers and bus riders moving at an average of 9 miles per hour in the last mile of their journeys. Cities including San Francisco and Seattle are also considering congestion pricing to unsnarl their own traffic-clogged streets.
New York's experience ""will be an important precedent for the conversations happening in other U.S. cities,"" Corinne Kisner, executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, told The Wall Street Journal .
The city's plan, unsurprisingly, has elicited a backlash from some corners — such as New Jersey.
""[W]hy should NJ not implement a commuter tax on NYC residents leaving NYC that exempts NJ residents so WE can fund our transit. Reality is any commuter tax should be a regional convo not just NY,"" tweeted Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop.
Sam Schwartz, a traffic engineer and former New York City traffic commissioner known as ""Gridlock Sam,"" told NPR last week that the toll for cars will likely be $10 to $15.
Tolls will be variable, and passenger vehicles will be charged once per day. Drivers entering the zone would be automatically charged via their E-ZPass or billed via their license plate number.
Still to be hammered out by lawmakers is what exemptions may be granted. A wide range of them are being considered, from exemptions for disabled people to exemptions for motorcycles . Exemptions on the table: ppl w/ disabilities, low income ppl living w/i the congestion zone, farmers market trucks, the henry hudson, the tappanzee, the gwb, the rfk, all four tunnels, and motorcycles — which felix ortiz says is ""common sense environmental issue"" b/c they r small https://t.co/Jk6sxS3A1a — David J. Meyer (@dahvnyc) March 29, 2019
Any exemptions could be exploited, as at least one observer noted . And for each exemption that's carved out, less revenue will generated and the impact on congestion will be smaller.
New York's move comes more than 15 years after London implemented fees on vehicles entering its central business district. The fees made an immediate and significant dent in congestion.
""Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h.,"" The New York Times noted .
There was an environmental effect too, ""with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone."" Stockholm and Singapore have also implemented congestion fees .
But London's gains are being threatened by a rise in private hire vehicles — such as those driven for Uber — which are exempt from paying the congestion fee. The number of such vehicles licensed in London jumped from about 50,000 in 2013 to nearly 88,000 last year.
And in the U.S., many states have introduced new toll roads or increased rates on existing turnpikes to raise money for infrastructure projects.
Schwarz, the traffic engineer, notes that New York has been talking about congestion pricing for decades. ""We're in it for the long haul,"" he said last week. ""The city will probably get sued, the state will get sued, but I think this time we will get it through."" Copyright 2019 NPR.

Chinese Woman Carrying 'Malware' Charged With Trying To Access Trump's Mar-a-Lago,www.gpb.org,Ryan Lucas,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/chinese-woman-carrying-malware-charged-trying-access-trumps-mar-lago,"By Ryan Lucas • 12 hours ago A view of Mar-a-Lago on Friday, March 22, 2019, in Palm Beach, Fla. An unauthorized woman has been charged with attempting to gain access to the president's private golf club. Carolyn Kaster / AP
A woman carrying two Republic of China passports has been charged after allegedly lying to Secret Service agents to gain access to President Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club while he was there last weekend.
The woman, Yujing Zhang, has been charged with making false statements and illegally entering a restricted area.
Information about her case appeared in a criminal complaint that became public on Tuesday.
Many details about her weren't immediately clear — for example, whether she is from Taiwan or from mainland China; she told investigators she had come to Florida from Shanghai.
Zhang briefly entered Mar-a-Lago after telling a Secret Service agent guarding the property that she was there to visit the pool, according to the criminal complaint.
Once inside the club, Zhang told a different Secret Service agent that she was there to attend a ""United Nations Chinese American Association"" event later in the evening. No such event was scheduled and the club's managers said she was not on any list authorizing her to be there.
Zhang was detained, and later told agents that a ""Chinese friend"" had told her to travel to Mar-a-Lago and speak with a member of Trump's family about U.S.-Chinese economic relations.
Zhang was carrying the two passports, four cellphones, one laptop computer, an external hard drive and a thumb drive that contained ""malicious malware,"" the criminal complaint said.
Zhang, authorities said, did not have a swimsuit in her possession.
Officials at the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C., had no comment about the case. A federal public defender representing Zhang declined to comment to the Miami Herald .

Baltimore Mayor Takes Indefinite Leave Of Absence Amid Book Scandal,www.gpb.org,Brakkton Booker,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/baltimore-mayor-takes-indefinite-leave-absence-amid-book-scandal,"Originally published on April 2, 2019 7:48 pm Copyright 2019 NPR.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh is taking an indefinite leave of absence. Her office says the mayor has been battling pneumonia for weeks, and she needs to focus on her health. But this announcement comes while she's at the center of a scandal. Pugh sold hundreds of thousands of copies of her self-published children's books to two private companies over which she held enormous power. She never disclosed those deals. Now Maryland's governor is formally calling on state officials to open a criminal investigation.
NPR's Brakkton Booker is covering the story and is here in the studio. Hi, Brakkton.
BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.
SHAPIRO: OK, explain. There are two companies here. First University of Maryland Medical System - what exactly did Pugh, the mayor, allegedly do here with this company?
BOOKER: So Mayor Pugh reportedly had an undisclosed business contract with this private nonprofit. Now, that business oversees more than a dozen hospitals in Maryland and in the Baltimore area. And the thing is Pugh served on the board dating back years, even when she was serving as a state senator. She only stepped down from the board last month after reports from the Baltimore Sun detailed this business contract, and questions began to swirl around it.
SHAPIRO: And the central issue here is the sale of these self-published children's books to the hospitals which she made hundreds of thousands of dollars off of.
BOOKER: Not only that. She also wielded great power as her position of mayor and also as a board member. So she was governing the management of these hospitals but did not disclose the fact that she was - also had the side deal with the books.
SHAPIRO: OK, and there's a second company involved, too. Tell us about that.
BOOKER: The second company is Kaiser Permanente. And in yet another Baltimore Sun report that dropped on Monday, it found that Pugh also entered into a business deal with the health giant. Now, starting in 2015, Kaiser Permanente began paying some $114,000 for these ""Healthy Holly"" books that the mayor self-published. And in 2017, the city's budget board, which Pugh sits on, awarded Kaiser a multi-million-dollar contract to provide health coverage for city employees. And as far as we know, Pugh did not recuse herself from that vote.
SHAPIRO: OK, you mentioned the ""Healthy Holly"" books. Not a lot of big-city mayors self-publish children's books. Tell us about ""Healthy Holly.""
BOOKER: This is this is true. Mayor Pugh self-published ""Healthy Holly,"" which is about a young black girl who promotes healthy eating, exercise and is overall supposed to be a role model particularly for inner-city kids, those that live in Baltimore. Now, Pugh apologized to the residents of Baltimore after the scandal kind of really took off. She held a press conference last Thursday. She says, I'm really sorry for upsetting folks in Baltimore. But that did not stop the governor from asking state prosecutors to look into the book sales as a course of a criminal matter here.
SHAPIRO: And yet when the mayor's office announced that she was taking this indefinite leave of absence, they didn't reference the scandal at all. They said this is just about her health.
BOOKER: They only referenced the fact that she had been battling pneumonia for weeks, nothing about the book scandal, nothing about these contracts, nothing about the hundreds of thousands of dollars she received over the years.
SHAPIRO: So who's filling in as mayor while she's out?
BOOKER: That roll's going to City Council President Jack Young. And he says that, look; I am here to make sure that Baltimore has a steady hand. But he's also said that he is not going to run in 2020 when the job is up. Here's what he told reporters today.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JACK YOUNG: Everybody knows that my dream job at one time was to be mayor. But I found out that the presidency of the council is the best job in the world.
(LAUGHTER)
YOUNG: And I'm just going to do this as a placeholder, and I will be running for president of the City Council of Baltimore.
BOOKER: So, Ari, Baltimore has been through a lot. A lot of folks say, like, oh, here we go again. Baltimore is making negative headlines - four straight years of 300 homicides, the Freddie Gray riots. And just last week, a former police commissioner was sentenced for not paying his federal taxes. So Baltimore has really been going through some things, and the dynamics between the residents and city officials has really been strained. And I think folks in Baltimore, especially folks I talked to today, say this is just yet another instance where politicians are kind of failing the people of Baltimore.
SHAPIRO: NPR's Brakkton Booker, thanks a lot.
BOOKER: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
Marília Mendonça's Live Album Is A Beckon For Women In Brazil,www.gpb.org,editor,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/mar-lia-mendon-live-album-beckon-women-brazil,"Marília Mendonça's Live Album Is A Beckon For Women In Brazil By editor • 13 hours ago Listen / Originally published on April 2, 2019 7:48 pm
Last August, in the central Brazilian city of Goiânia, Marília Mendonça took the stage at a surprise concert. She repeated the surprise show in 10 other cities in the country. Brazilian crowds are known for their passion, but Mendonça's fans sang along with special excitement because the shows were announced on social media just hours in advance — a fitting move for Mendonça's brand and career, both of which have flourished through her social media strategy. Not only is she's the third most viewed female Latin artist in YouTube history, behind only Jennifer Lopez and Shakira , five of this album's videos are currently on Brazil's YouTube Top 40.
These 10 shows were recorded for Mendonça 's latest album, a live album, called Todos Os Cantos or All The Corners .
Mendonça is known as Brazilian music's ""Queen of Suffering."" It's a reputation the singer lives up to in one of her current hits, "" Bem Pior Que Eu. "" where the song's narrator is the other woman in an affair who's tired of being second choice.
Mendonça grew up in Goiânia, the heartland a kind of Brazilian country music called sertanejo. Like American country, sertanejo has found mainstream success and can be nearly indistinguishable from pop. For Mendonça, an accordion is sometimes incorporated to bring in much of the rural character into her songs. One example of that being ""Passa Mal,"" which was recorded in Recife, Brazil. ""In my life, your heart served as a step,"" she sings in her rich voice. ""Seeing you suffer is not good, it's sensational."" YouTube
Some of Brazil's cosmopolitan crowd scorns Mendonça's country power ballads as, ""brega,"" or corny music. Sentimental or not, her songs offer a woman's perspective that hasn't been heard much in sertanejo's machismo culture, and it's made Mendonça the leading voice of a new subgenre called ""feminejo""-- music by and for women.
Mendonça's the first to say her brand of feminism is more of an attitude than a political position. Still, millions of fans find empowerment in her song lyrics that reject bad relationships or refuse to compete with women on the other side of the cheating equation. Fans simply see their own flawed lives represented in her songs, like the relatable scenario in ""Bebi Ligue"" of drinking, calling, hooking up and regretting.
Mendonça's been an advocate for imperfection in other ways, like resisting beauty standards with her full-bodied stature. That's changing a bit now after a few years into her career, with some weight loss and plastic surgery. But like everything else in her life, she's sharing details of this transformation on social media, taking fans along for the ride. Mendonça never apologizes for expressing the truth of her experience as a young woman, and that transparency has helped make her one of the most popular artists in Brazil today. Copyright 2019 NPR.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Federal prosecutors today indicted one of the most powerful politicians in North Carolina. Robin Hayes is head of the state Republican Party and a former five-term congressman. Prosecutors have charged him with public corruption and bribery. The indictment also names the state's top political donor and two of his associates. Joining us with details now is Jeff Tiberii. He is a capitol bureau chief for WUNC in Raleigh. Welcome to the program.
JEFF TIBERII, BYLINE: Hi, Audie.
CORNISH: What are the charges that Hayes and these other people are facing? What more can you tell us?
TIBERII: The charges are wire fraud, aiding and abetting and lying to the FBI. Now, the Department of Justice called this a brazen bribery scheme in a letter that came out today with the indictment. According to them, it involves a wealthy businessman, two of his associates and, as you mentioned, Robin Hayes. He's a former five-term congressman and currently still as of this moment leads the state Republican Party.
The indictment lays out in some very specific detail what amounts to an effort to gain favorable treatment from the state Department of Insurance. And allegedly the businessman, this man named Greg Lindberg, offered millions of dollars to the state insurance commissioner. His name's Mike Causey - the commissioner - who is also an elected Republican. And what they wanted - the business folks - in return were looser regulations and some control over personnel within the state Department of Insurance.
CORNISH: How did the alleged fraud come to light?
TIBERII: Well, according to federal prosecutors, it was the insurance commissioner himself, Causey, who had just been on the job for a few weeks, maybe a month or two who came to them in 2017. He had concerns about what he perceived were illegal campaign contributions, and he agreed to cooperate with them if there was an investigation. And of course there was this investigation. And it's unclear exactly what mechanism was used, but there are direct quotes throughout this indictment - phone conversations, in-person correspondence. So a lot of what is alleged to have happened in this conspiracy appears to in some form or fashion have been recorded.
And what we also know from the indictment - what we learned today and also based on campaign finance reports over the last year or two is that Lindberg, the businessman, donated large sums of money - hundreds of thousands of dollars - to the state Republican Party, and he wanted a lot of that to go to the re-election campaign of this insurance commissioner. However, in this state, in North Carolina, campaign finance law does not allow for the earmarking of money. A donor can give unlimited amounts, but he or she can't say, oh, it's got to go toward this campaign or that re-election campaign.
I think it's also worth noting that the money here is astronomically higher than what an insurance commissioner normally raises. It was donated three years in advance to when Causey would have been running for re-election. He hadn't even announced his re-election bid here. And the maximum that donors can give in this state is $5,400 per person.
CORNISH: Any response from Hayes or the other defendants?
TIBERII: I've left Chairman Hayes a voicemail. I have not heard from him. He has not said anything publicly. We have not heard from any of the other ones, any other folks who have been indicted at this time.
CORNISH: And to pull back for a moment, what about the state Republican Party?
TIBERII: Very fluid - it's interesting that just yesterday, Hayes - he's 73 years old - announced that he would not run for another term as state chair, citing health challenges. It would be surprising, I think, obviously if he remains in his post here. As for the state party, we'll see what more comes in the days ahead.
CORNISH: That's Jeff Tiberii, WUNC's bureau chief, in Raleigh, N.C. Thank you.
TIBERII: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
Disaster Relief Legislation Has Stalled Over A Fight About Money For Puerto Rico,www.gpb.org,Kelsey Snell,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/disaster-relief-legislation-has-stalled-over-fight-about-money-puerto-rico,"Originally published on April 2, 2019 7:48 pm Copyright 2019 NPR.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
There are few things Democrats and Republicans in Congress usually agree on, like rushing federal money to victims of natural disasters. That normal order of things fell apart this week. The Senate failed to advance two separate bills to help people across the country who suffered from flooding, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
This stalemate comes down to just one thing - how much aid to give to Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria. Republicans blame Democrats. And Democrats blame - well, let's just listen to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHUCK SCHUMER: Everything was moving along. And guess who came in and messed it up, as usual - the president.
SHAPIRO: Yes, President Trump. We begin our coverage with NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill.
Hi, Kelsey.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi, there.
SHAPIRO: Explain what's at the heart of this battle over aid to Puerto Rico.
SNELL: Well, I think we should start off by saying that these disaster aid bills are usually pretty bipartisan. And they usually move really quickly, mostly because you never really know when the next disaster will happen or where it will strike. So senators like to vote to support, you know, sending money just in case they might be next.
So Democrats say Trump is specifically denying money for Puerto Rico. And they point to comments from the White House referring to the island territory, which we should say is very much a part of the United States, as a different country. Republicans say Puerto Rico still hasn't spent money that was authorized in the past. And Senator Shelby, who is the chairman of the appropriations committee, he said last week that Puerto Rico has a history of not spending money well when it's given to them.
Democrats say all American citizens should have the same access to disaster assistance no matter where they are.
SHAPIRO: Kelsey, will you fact-check for us a tweet from President Trump where he said today that the island got $91 billion for the hurricanes. Democrats say that is not true. Who's right here?
SNELL: Yeah. There is a lot of dispute over that number on the Hill.
So there is a report out there that says Puerto Rico will have access to that amount of money over years, if not decades. But that isn't what's been sent to the island so far. Democrats say Puerto Rico hasn't received enough money. They're seizing, basically, on Trump's recent comments, and they say that he just doesn't want to send money to Puerto Rico - period. They're basically saying that the administration hasn't released a lot of money that Congress already authorized.
And this is a problem for states like Texas, too, but the political fight is all about Puerto Rico right now. It's really only gotten more intense since Trump singled out Puerto Rico. And this, like I said, is really political. They want to - Democrats want to highlight the president denying money to a largely Hispanic territory.
SHAPIRO: What else do Democrats say the island needs for recovery?
SNELL: Yeah. They say that they need money for basic redevelopment. We're talking about stuff like roads and bridges and basic phone and internet infrastructure. And it's all about this one program known as the Community Development Block Grant. Now, this is a pot of money primarily focused on housing and service for low-income communities. Now, Trump approved money for nutrition assistance - for food stamps - but not the Community Development Block Grant. And that's where Democrats say they really need money.
SHAPIRO: How do they move forward if neither side seems ready to move on this?
SNELL: That is the big question, and nobody seems to have an answer. And the fight is already causing people to have some big worries about how Congress will spend money for the entire rest of the year. Remember; we have to keep the government open again in September. And they can't seem to agree on anything when it comes down to money.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill. Thanks, Kelsey.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
We're joined now by Republican Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia. He cosponsored the Senate bill that failed to pass last night. Welcome back to the program.
JOHNNY ISAKSON: Glad to be with you.
CORNISH: Now, you want this money of course because of the devastation caused to Georgia farmers by Hurricane Michael last year. Tell us what state they're in, why they need this funding so badly.
ISAKSON: Well, first of all, the damage was devastating, particularly in southwest Georgia where the pecans were hit terribly hard near Camilla and in that area. Pecans are a - not an annual crop, but they're a multi-year crop. It takes about 12 years for a tree to mature. About 70 percent of our trees were injured or taken out, and that's a terrible amount. We also had cotton that was destroyed in large amounts. I can't quantify about bales 'cause we hadn't picked it yet.
CORNISH: And of course agriculture is the top industry in Georgia, right? And I understand it's something like a 50 billion loss at this point.
ISAKSON: It's 21 percent of our gross domestic product for our state, which is huge. And I don't know the total amount and quantified in dollars yet, but it's a huge damage to our state and to our agricultural interests.
CORNISH: When you talk about something like a pecan crop and in a long lead time, I mean, what does that mean for the bottom line for these farmers - right? - when there's a delay in funding of aid from Congress?
ISAKSON: In the worst case, it could mean the loss of your farm because you don't have income to sustain the property during the 12 years while you're trying to remake the crop. In cases where you are in pretty good shape financially, it could take away your safety net for the future. Either way, it's not good for agriculture. Agriculture is a critical crop, but is time-sensitive. It's weather-sensitive. It's farmer-sensitive, and it's politically sensitive, as we learned with this disaster aid. So we've got to pull all those together to get our industry back together in our state.
CORNISH: Senate Democrats say they rejected this bill because it doesn't provide enough aid for Puerto Rico. Can you address that issue?
ISAKSON: Yes, ma'am, I can. Puerto Rico has already gotten money which they've already spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 billion. The money that we put in this bill that's before us now that they'd set back last night or defeated last night was $600 million. So it's - and Puerto Rico is getting the money that Puerto Rico is supposed to have. They're not getting some money they want, but needs and wants are two different things. And nobody's getting the need - the want stuff. The need stuff we're doing to make sure our ag industry, the fires which have devastated California, the earthquake which devastated Alaska...
CORNISH: But can I jump in here - because there's 41 billion that has been set aside for recovery for Puerto Rico, and they haven't gotten it. So it's not just that they want it. It's something the government has said we're supposed to deliver to you, and the government hasn't come through on that.
ISAKSON: They haven't yet, but they're going to if we pass this bill. So we're going to have to use some leverage to get it done. Now that they've all of a sudden started creating obstacles for us to move forward, which I think - and I don't know. I'm not blaming anybody. But it seems to me like it's a political operation right now.
CORNISH: By who?
ISAKSON: By the by the Democrats.
CORNISH: To what end, I mean, 'cause to the average listener, to the voter at home, it sounds like lawmakers are pitting two struggling communities - right? - people who have suffered from natural disasters against each other.
ISAKSON: No, that's not the way it is at all. What's happening is one of the two political parties has been pushing to get the disaster aid through. It's money that's out there to be appropriated. But we have to do it by an act of Congress. The people who are trying to make that happen and have slowed all this down are people who have issues with Puerto Rico. They want Puerto Rico to become a state, so they're trying to make a case out of that. They want more votes in the Senate. So if tomorrow Puerto Rico's a state, they get two more votes in the Senate - lots of things like that.
But that's just the petty politics side of it. The truth of the matter is we just got some Georgians and some Americans that have been damaged for which there is money out there to be provided to them, including Puerto Ricans as a territory. We ought to go ahead and do it instead of pick favorites and winners and losers. We're all losers. We don't want to pick tragic losers, and that's what's getting ready to happen.
CORNISH: The Trump administration has yet to issue rules and regulations that would allow Puerto Rico and other states to get access to the funding that is set aside for it. Has the administration said anything about this? Is this something that you think needs to be discussed?
ISAKSON: Anything that would help us get the money released would help us, and everybody should be doing their job. And I'm doing mine, but I'm not about to start opining on the administration or the executive branch or anybody else not doing theirs. I just know that if there's something out there that they should have done, then the president should get it done and get it done as soon as possible.
CORNISH: Well, I ask because the president has been very vocal about what he thinks of leadership in Puerto Rico and that he doesn't believe necessarily that they are handling the funds they get properly. Has this become an obstacle in these negotiations, a political obstacle?
ISAKSON: Well, things like that can become obstacles. I am not saying it is one because I haven't been engaged in that conversation one way or another, and I'm not going to engage myself in this intimate interview on it. All I want to do is one thing. That's my job for the people in my state that are hurting and the states in the other parts the United States that are hurting. As to who to blame or who to call obstructionists or who to call not doing their job, I'm not about to sit there and do that.
CORNISH: Senator Johnny Isakson - he's a Republican from Georgia. Thank you for speaking with ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
A Chinese woman carrying a thumb drive full of malware was arrested this weekend for lying her way into Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The president was golfing at a nearby property at the time, though he and his family were staying at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. The Miami Herald has the story. Reporter Nicholas Nehamas joins us now. Welcome.
NICHOLAS NEHAMAS: Glad to be here.
SHAPIRO: We don't know much about this woman. What can you tell us about her?
NEHAMAS: Well, we know her name was Yujing Zhang. She came to Mar-a-Lago for an event with a group called the United Nations Friendship Association. And she was carrying Taiwanese passports. Beyond that, we don't really know who she is.
SHAPIRO: She was also carrying a lot of electronics. What did they find on her?
NEHAMAS: Yeah. She had four cellphones, one laptop, one external hard drive and one thumb drive that contained malware according to the U.S. Secret Service. But beyond that, we don't know much about what kind of malware it was, whether her device had been unintentionally infected with it or whether she had loaded that malware onto the thumb drive herself.
SHAPIRO: So the charges that she faces include making false statements to a federal officer and entering restricted property. Can you give us the play-by-play as best we understand it?
NEHAMAS: Yeah, so she came to Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club, and said she wanted to use the pool and kind of implied that she was the relative of a member of Mar-a-Lago with a similar or the same surname and kind of got into the reception area that way. But then it turned out she wasn't on any list, and then her story changed, that she was here for this U.N. event, something which had been advertised by Cindy Yang. And that's when the Secret Service detained her.
SHAPIRO: OK, I want to dig a little deeper into this woman Cindy Yang - her real name is Li Yang - who has been in the news before in connection with a massage parlor that was at the center of a prostitution bust. She's also accused of selling access to the Trump family. How does this woman factor into the story?
NEHAMAS: So Ms. Yang, who, you know, as you said, owned the massage parlor where Robert Kraft was arrested, charged with soliciting prostitution, had a side business where she sold access to the president and his family, to events at Mar-a-Lago to Chinese business executives. And she had advertised an event set to take place at Mar-a-Lago on that day. It had been canceled after a lot of news reporting on her activities. So the woman who showed up to the club on Saturday said she was there for an event that had been canceled.
SHAPIRO: And Democrats have called for a counterintelligence investigation into Yang. That was before this latest story broke about the woman being busted with malware on a thumb drive. So how does that relate to this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, that's right. There are concerns by national security experts that Ms. Yang has ties to groups in the U.S. that are projections of the Chinese Communist Party's goals abroad. And so the Democrats are asking for an examination of how closely tied is she, if at all, to China's government and its efforts abroad.
SHAPIRO: I've heard people say ever since President Trump was elected that Mar-a-Lago presents a security threat. On the other hand, this woman was caught and arrested. So do you think this shows the weakness of Mar-a-Lago or the strength of the security perimeter that's there?
NEHAMAS: Well, you know, I don't think we quite know enough about what the situation was. You know, was it a harmless, confused tourist? Was it something more sinister? But certainly it is true that she was stopped well before she got into the club. And the president was golfing not at Mar-a-Lago but at his nearby golf course. So he was not present when this happened.
SHAPIRO: I know a lot of the details that you're sharing with us come from public court documents. Is there a court appearance scheduled for the woman at the center of this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, she has a detention hearing April 8 and an arraignment April 15. So I hope we will know more.
SHAPIRO: Nicholas Nehamas of the Miami Herald, thanks a lot.
NEHAMAS: Thanks for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

"Man Blew up Couple’s Car After McDonald’s Drive-thru Argument, Court Hears",www.newsweek.com,David Brennan,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/ryan-sharp-mcdonalds-drive-thru-argument-car-bomb-explosion-stalking-1384414,"On 4/3/19 at 5:40 AM EDT Share World crime
A man has appeared in court in Australia accused of blowing up a couple’s car after his partner was honked at while in a McDonald’s drive-thru.
Ryan Sharp, 33, appeared at a court in Sydney on Wednesday. He did not apply for bail, though will have another chance to do so on Thursday. If not, he will remain detained until his trial in May, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
Sharp and his 31-year-old partner allegedly launched a six-week campaign of stalking and harassment against a couple, who honked at the partner in a McDonald’s drive-thru on February 22. This culminated in a bomb attack on the couple's car on March 5, using what police described as a “sophisticated” explosive device, The Guardian explained.
According to Newshub, the couple were collecting food at the drive-thru when Sharp’s partner swerved dangerously close to their car. They honked the horn to express their anger, but this only prompted to woman to confront them before they were able to drive away.
The Herald noted that Sharp’s partner initially tried to report the couple to the police, having followed the car and written down its license plate number. But after the complaint had no effect, police say she and Sharp decided to mete out their own justice.
Authorities said the “relatively minor” and “benign” drive-thru dispute was the spark for the protracted campaign of “grievance-fuelled violence,” which included him smashing the couple's car window and sending them death threats online.
“The work done by this male to identify where the victim lived was quite ingenious and indicated a specific intent,” counter-terrorism and special tactics command Detective Superintendent Michael McLean said on Tuesday. “He located the victims’ home, [and] we will allege, placed the device under the car where it ultimately exploded sometime later.”
Though the car was not destroyed, police said the device was powerful enough to seriously injure or even kill anyone who was inside.
Sharp and his partner were both arrested at a gas station on Tuesday evening. Police later found a pipe bomb, drone and baton in their possession. The charges against Sharp include placing an explosive on a vehicle with the intent to cause harm and possession or use of a prohibited weapon without a permit. His partner was charged with being an accessory to damaging property and stalking or intimidating.
Police said the specialist anti-terrorism fixated persons investigations unit was brought in to help investigate the pair given the unusual nature of their crimes.

Democratic presidential candidates have come a long way from “I didn’t inhale.”
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has boasted that his state, one of the first to legalize recreational marijuana use in 2012, has “the best weed in the United States of America.” Sen. Bernie Sanders has been proposing some form of legalization for more than two decades. Sen. Kamala Harris has reminisced about lighting up in college. And Sen. Cory Booker makes overhauling drug laws a linchpin of his stump speeches.Nearly every Democrat in the field has embraced some form of legalization.
The near-universal backing is a stark contrast to recent presidential campaigns, when legalization was a fringe issue that seldom surfaced on the trail or during debates. And while legalizing pot may not rank among the top five issues important to voters, it could prove crucial as Democrats winnow the field.
“In these early stages where at 18 [candidates] and you’re trying to get a little bit of an edge over the rest … maybe this is the differentiator,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist who’s worked on numerous presidential campaigns.
The change is driven by the rapid spread of legal cannabis markets. Ten states and the District of Columbia have full legalization, and another 23 states permit medicinal uses with permission from a doctor, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . Even deep-red states like Arkansas and Utah have recently enacted medical marijuana laws. Sales topped $8 billion last year and could hit $80 billion by 2030, according to Cowen Equity Research .
More than half of the declared field earned an “A” rating from cannabis advocacy group NORML, which promotes recreational use, not just medical use.
“I don’t see a path for how a Democrat running for president could win the presidential primary unless they do have a positive cannabis position,” said Neil Levine, CEO of the Cannabis Trade Federation, an industry-backed advocacy group.
Meanwhile, arguably the biggest weed legalization skeptics — former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (who earlier this year called it “perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done”) and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown (NORML gives him a “C”) — have taken a pass on the 2020 presidential contest. Another outlier, former Vice President Joe Biden, who has a long track record of supporting tough drug laws, hasn’t joined the field.
The issue also is gaining traction in an otherwise largely gridlocked Congress. Last week, the House Financial Services Committee overwhelmingly passed legislation that would let banks provide services to legal marijuana businesses, with 11 Republicans joining all committee Democrats in supporting the bill. Because marijuana remains a controlled substance under federal law, the pot business is now largely cash only.
Congress also used last year’s farm bill to legalize hemp — a non-psychoactive variety of the cannabis plant. And it passed a significant overhaul of criminal justice policies aimed at enhancing opportunities for ex-drug offenders that was strongly backed by the Trump administration.
Marijuana advocates are looking for ways to sustain the momentum, expecting the issue to fade as candidates spend more time on health care, immigration and other high-profile issues.
Don Murphy, the Marijuana Policy Project’s director of federal policies, is having second thoughts about plans to staff a booth at the Iowa State Fair in August while candidates work the crowd, because the field has so enthusiastically embraced legalization.
But Murphy and other advocates are still waiting for candidates to offer fleshed-out platforms, rather than just rhetorical gestures.
“There’s trash talking before the fight — and then there’s the fight,” Murphy said. “I’d be happier with their rhetoric if I saw some real fight in the ring.”
Anti-legalization forces are hoping to use the Democratic candidates’ positions to paint them as out of touch with most of the country and pushing a marginal issue to enable a multi-billion-dollar industry that peddles a product with significant health risks.
“This is a very low priority issue for voters, period,” said Kevin Sabet, CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which opposes legalization. “The average voter — this is not on the radar.”
But public opinion has steadily shifted in favor of legalization. More than 6 in 10 adults now favor legalization, according to the Pew Research Center — double the level of support at the turn of the century.
The cannabis industry remains a minor but burgeoning political player. Industry groups spent $2.7 million on lobbying last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than six-fold increase over just two years earlier.
The collective embrace of cannabis means that the debate in the Democratic primary is shifting beyond whether legal pot sales should be permitted. Several candidates are already calling for past marijuana-related convictions to be expunged. Inslee has vowed to grant pardons to thousands of Washington residents convicted of misdemeanor marijuana offenses prior to the state’s pioneering embrace of legalization.
Some candidates are also bringing a social justice component to the discussion, proposing that communities hit hard by past marijuana possession convictions — particularly among minorities — reap the benefits from newly legalized markets. Recent efforts to pass legalization bills in New York and New Jersey hit obstacles in part over concerns they didn’t do enough to address past harms.
“It’s not enough to just support marijuana reform. That’s a given.” said Queen Adesuyi, policy coordinator for the Drug Policy Action, which advocates for overhauling drug laws. “We’ve gotten past that point. The country is in a different place. Congress is in a different place now.”
Booker has been among the most ardent champions of legalization, sponsoring the Marijuana Justice Act, which would not only eliminate criminal penalties nationwide for possessing or consuming pot but also wipe out past criminal convictions and take steps to redress the disproportionate arrests of minorities during the decades-long War on Drugs.First-time offenders convicted of misdemeanor pot possession can face up to a year in prison and a fine of $1,000.
“We have a lot of injustice in our criminal justice system being borne by the poor, disproportionately minorities,” Booker said during a town hall meeting hosted by CNN last week. “If I am your president, I’m going to fight to have sane drug laws.”
Four of Booker’s Senate colleagues — Sanders, Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand — who are running for president are co-sponsors of the Marijuana Justice Act. The one exception: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has sponsored legislation that would allow states to make their own choices about legalization without fear of federal punishment .
It’s still unclear how much all the positioning will influence voters. Political observers say likely voters are influenced more by bread-and-butter issues like health care and tax policy.
But Trippi pointed out that in a wide-open primary field, even a few percentage points could make the crucial difference in whether a candidate finishes a respectable second or a distant eighth in early voting states. The issue could have particular resonance with young voters: 3 out of 4 millennials support legalization, according to the Pew Research Center.
“Cannabis is a real thing now,” said Carl Olsen, a Democratic activist in Des Moines, Iowa, noting that even President Donald Trump has suggested he’s open to some form of legalization. “The whole thing shifts now into not whether we do it, but how we do it.”

Black leaders blast Dem war on super PACs,seriouslypolitics.com,Maggie Severns,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/03/02/04/26/black-leaders-blast-dem-war-on-super-pacs/,"This post is by Maggie Severns from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

Top black donors and operatives are calling on fellow Democrats to abandon their push against super PACs, arguing that one of Democrats’ most popular 2020 talking points will ultimately cut off much-needed resources for candidates of color.
In a letter obtained by POLITICO, The Collective PAC — which helps elect black candidates to office — asked major liberal groups like Indivisible and Democracy for America to stop calling for Democratic presidential contenders to distance themselves from single-candidatesuper PACs. Such groups play an important role in electing candidates of color, they argued, especially in primaries, when the Democratic establishment has often overlooked black contenders and left it to outside donors to bolster their campaigns.
“Whether intentional or not, the effect of what you are calling for is to shut down the one reliable source of revenue for engaging voters of color and for supporting candidates of color,” wrote Quentin JamesStefanie Brown James, the founder and co-founder of The Collective PAC. “One of the few sources of funding for the work to engage voters of color and support candidates of color has come from Super PACs.”
The Collective PAC’s stance is at odds with much of the Democratic Party: Most candidates for president have said they do not want super PACs supporting their bids, and some, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have taken additional steps to disavow the influence of money in politics as they make their case to voters. The issue was a major talking point in 2016 for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has powered his campaigns via small-dollar online contributors and on Tuesday announced he had raised $18 million in his 2020 campaign.
But new candidates can need help from outside groups and wealthy supporters in order to break into a campaign, prominent black fundraisers argue. Among those pushing the argument is Steve Phillips, a Democratic donor who launched an effort in 2008 that ultimately spent more than $10 million bolstering Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Last December, Phillips announced he would raise money for a super PAC supporting Sen. Cory Booker in 2020.
“The Democratic Party and the progressive ecosystem have a very bad track record in terms of investing in candidates of color,” Phillips said in an interview. “There are not many people in this country who have moved more money to communities of color and have moved more money to candidates of color than I have, and I’m not going to be lectured by people who don’t have a similar track record.”
Booker, like other presidential candidates, has said he does not want a super PAC supporting his presidential bid, in addition to rejecting corporate PAC money — another increasingly common Democratic campaign tactic. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has also drawn support from a super PAC, which has spent more than $1 million running ads boosting his candidacy.
In March a coalition of nine grassroots Democratic organizations — End Citizens United, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Democracy for America, Indivisible, United We Dream, Public Citizen, Credo Action, MoveOn and Working Families Party — signed on to a public letter calling on all Democratic candidates for president to disavow the super PACs.
“ Citizens United opened the door to a flood of special interest spending that is corrupting our democracy,” the letter from Democratic groups to presidential candidates said. “A strong stance in the 2020 Democratic primary against corporate PAC money and against big-money Super PACs will send a larger signal to voters that Democrats stand united as the party of the people and reform.”
James and Brown James of The Collective PAC, which says it has raised and bundled more than $6.5 million in recent years, said they agree that “the current campaign finance system is seriously flawed in many ways.”
But they also said any reforms to the campaign finance system should “address the ecosystem’s persistent problem of under-investing and overlooking communities of color.”
“While the entire progressive movement eventually coalesced behind the historic and inspiring gubernatorial candidacies of Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum, and Ben Jealous last year, the bandwagon was much emptier, and the cupboards much more bare during their primary campaigns,” James and James Brown of The Collective PAC wrote. “Just a handful of organizations, like ours, built support for the campaigns of those African American leaders and much of the support from that work came from Super PACs created by people of color.”
In a statement, End Citizens United spokesperson Patrick Burgwinkle said the group believes “voter engagement, registration, and turnout in communities of color is fundamentally important to a Democrat’s ability to be successful in 2020 and all candidates need to work and dedicate resources to build long-lasting relationships in communities of color.”
Burgwinkle added that ECU and other groups focused their efforts on “single-candidate Super PACs because they allow wealthy donors to circumvent campaign finance laws and give unlimited money to support their candidate of choice, and act as a shadow arm of the campaign.” The other groups that signed onto the letter did not comment for this story.
Akunna Cook, executive director of Black Economic Alliance, a PAC supported by black business and civic leaders that raises money for candidates and isn’t aligned with either party, said the growing movement against money in politics will make it harder for candidates of color to raise money as the expectations for what kinds of money candidates should reject grow increasingly stringent.
“There needs to be more nuance. I get that everybody is disavowing corporate PACs, but then there are candidates who aren’t taking money from any PACs — and if you take that too far then there won’t be PACs to help anyone who needs to the help,” Cook said. “Until we overturn Citizens United, the reality is that running for office is going to be expensive and not everybody is going to have access.”

Coming soon: The death of the filibuster,seriouslypolitics.com,Burgess Everett,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/03/02/03/39/coming-soon-the-death-of-the-filibuster/,"Click here to view on the original site: Original Post
The filibuster is in peril.
With Republicans expected to change the Senate rules to slash debate time on President Donald Trump’s nominees this week, it will mark the third time the “nuclear option” — changing Senate rules by a simple majority — has been triggered in just six years.
Each of those unilateral moves by a Senate majority to weaken the Senate’s age-old precedents centered on nominations, leaving the legislative filibuster and its 60-vote threshold unscathed. But some senators say it’s just a matter of time before even that Senate institution is more or less wiped away by a majority tired of seeing its big ideas blocked.
Though the Senate is up for grabs in 2020, neither party is expected to come away with a supermajority due to the limited number of competitive races. And that likely puts the supermajority requirement itself in jeopardy — particularly if one party controls White House, House and Senate and wants to move its agenda.
And in true Senate fashion, Republicans and Democrats are already bickering over who is more likely to blow up the Senate as soon as 2021.
“It’ll go down the road,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said of the filibuster. “If the Democrats take control of the Senate and we’re in a strong minority then they’ll change it immediately.”
“If eliminating the legislative filibuster will serve Sen. McConnell’s purposes, he’ll eliminate it,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “After what Sen. McConnell has done to this institution, there will be many people who will be putting pressure on us to do the same thing.”
The latest change by Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) to cut debate time from 30 hours to two hours apiece for lower level executive nominees and District Court picks was, somewhat ironically, initially blocked by filibuster-wielding Democrats on Tuesday.
Just one Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, opposed moving to debate the rules change, making a broader argument that the Senate’s rules are intended to balance ""competing interests of majorities, minorities, and individual senators.""
""They facilitate the compromise and accountability that are essential to the governing of a large, diverse nation,"" Lee said. ""I oppose changing the post-cloture time rule. I certainly oppose breaking the rules of the Senate to do so. The current rules can work for the American people; they simply require us to do the same.""
But McConnell will move to use the nuclear option later this week to make the change anyway by a simple majority, overruling Democratic objections and speeding up Trump’s nominations — a top priority of the president, who has long railed against Democratic delays. Last week, Trump handed McConnell a list of nominees at a party meeting and urged the GOP leader to get them confirmed.
The move by the Republican leader potentially sets the table for future, more radical changes, just as former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s (D-Nev.) foray into scrapping the supermajority requirement on certain nominees laid the groundwork for this week’s move by the GOP.
“We’re going to be the House of Representatives by the time my term is done. And that will be McConnell’s legacy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who was just reelected to a six-year term. “We’re headed to a majoritarian institution. And maybe we’re better off. Maybe we’d be able to have actual debates and real amendments. The House has more debate than we do.”
If Democrats win the Senate and the White House next year, there will be enormous pressure for them to gut the filibuster to enact an ambitious progressive agenda — D.C. statehood or climate change legislation or some other proposal that will not find support among enough Republicans to pass the chamber under existing rules.
Meanwhile, Trump has made clear he wants to kill the supermajority requirement, a demand that may gain new momentum if he wins reelection and Republicans take back full control of Congress. Republicans held off Trump from changing the rules for two years of unified power, but he called for McConnell to go nuclear even after the election cost the GOP the House.
“I won’t be one calling for its elimination,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). “That’s what President Trump wanted to do. And we kept telling him, ‘You don’t want that to happen.’ We don’t want that to happen.”
After the Senate GOP killed the 60-vote requirement on Supreme Court nominees in 2017, dozens of rank-and-file senators wrote to McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowing to protect the filibuster. Many senators view the filibuster as a trusty old friend that’s fended off the other parties’ most extreme ideas over the years, and they are vowing to protect it.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is still deciding whether to support the effort to cut debate time, acknowledging there is a “genuine” problem that one senator can delay any nominee for days. She was more emphatic about protecting the historic legislative guardrail.
“I would never support doing away with the legislative filibuster,” she said in an interview, handing a reporter a copy of the letter she and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) spearheaded in 2017.
“That’s the one thing that people will not do,” insisted Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). “I really think that will not happen.”
Yet Democratic activists have helped turn the filibuster into a new litmus in the Democratic presidential primary. They argue that there’s almost no way to enact sweeping changes like “Medicare for All” or a “Green New Deal” if 41 GOP senators can stop everything.
Several Democratic senators running for president, like Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, are open to gutting the legislative filibuster. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Cory Booker of New Jersey have been cooler to the idea. But change can happen quickly.
A decade ago, few would have foreseen the end of the 60-vote threshold on presidential nominations. That was before Republicans began stalling President Barack Obama’s nominees and ultimately blocking several of them in 2013, which precipitated the first stroke of the filibuster’s demise.
For four years, Supreme Court nominees were the only appointments subject to supermajority requirement until McConnell got rid of that, too, in 2017 in the face of a Democratic blockade of Justice Neil Gorsuch. That move came after the GOP denied Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a vote or even a hearing.
Now, McConnell is set to make Senate confirmation swifter for Trump and future presidents amid frustration over Democratic delays of nominees. And he’s setting the stage for more changes the next time the Senate majority becomes fed up with the minority.
“At the end of the day, these changes deepen the divisions and the slope continues to ending the filibuster,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “The ‘nuclear option’ used to be nuclear. No longer.”

"As Trump rages over border, Kushner quietly plans legal immigration boost",seriouslypolitics.com,Anita Kumar,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/03/02/02/29/as-trump-rages-over-border-kushner-quietly-plans-legal-immigration-boost/,"This post is by Anita Kumar from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories
Click here to view on the original site: Original Post
Even as President Donald Trump threatens to shut down the southern border, his administration is quietly working on a plan to expand some forms of legal immigration into the U.S.
Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been working for months on a proposal that could increase the number of low- and high-skilled workers admitted to the country annually, four people involved in the discussions told POLITICO.
The low-profile effort to allow more legal immigrants into the U.S. cuts a stark contrast to Trump’s increasingly dramatic efforts to curb illegal immigration, an issue he speaks about daily and describes as a national crisis. But Trump himself has publicly said he also supports higher levels of legal immigration, a priority generally supported by a business community short on skilled workers.
The effort began in January when Kushner started to convene a series of meetings with dozens of advocacy including business and agriculture organizations. Some, though not all of them, openly support the expansion of legal immigration. It has continued in recent weeks with a smaller four-person White House working group led by Kushner, and could generate a proposal for Congress by summer.
Trump personally tasked Kushner — who successfully forged a December compromise on criminal justice reform but is still struggling to deliver a Middle East peace plan — with the priority of legal immigration. But it is a daunting challenge, requiring legislation in an issue area that has confounded Congress in recent years.
Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser and influential hard-liner on immigration, has not attended most of Kushner’s meetings, according to half dozen attendees. But Miller — whose restrictionist views have slowed past compromise efforts — must sign off on any plan before Trump does, according to some familiar with the situation.
But hawkish immigration activists, who have been frustrated with Trump’s relentless focus on a border wall, are worried that the president will be influenced by Kushner’s more moderate views on immigration and will fail to fulfill his campaign pledge to crack down on immigration. Trump already has spoken about expanding legal immigration at least four times this year.
“The president must remember that he was elected to implement an immigration system that serves national interests, not business interests,” said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, whose president attended a meeting with Kushner. “A plan to increase overall immigration is nothing more than a handout to businesses so they don’t have to compete for American workers and raise wages.”
FAIR released a new online ad FridayurgingTrump to not be influenced by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who support expanding legal immigration. “Tell President Trump to keep his promise to protect the American worker and to keep the Koch Brothers out of the White House,” the ad says.
Business groups have pushed for additional permanent slots for immigrants coming to the United States, saying the demand has increased since the unemployment rate has fallen and companies have struggled to fill jobs.
More than 1 million immigrants are allowed into the United States each year on a permanent basis but only a fraction — 140,000 — are through employment categories. The rest are for relatives, refugees or immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. These numbers don’t include immigrants allowed entry through temporary or seasonal work.
By comparison, federal officials estimate they apprehended 100,000 immigrants crossing the border illegally in March. Many of them end up being released because of overwhelming numbers at processing and holding centers. About 12 million immigrants are estimated to be in the United States illegally now.
Kushner’s plan may not lead to a net increase in legal immigration. He is being urged to offset his increases with reductions in other forms of legal immigration. An expansion in the number of legal immigrants allowed into the U.S. for work could be tied to reductions in the number of immigrants sponsored by family members or immigrants who are awarded green cards through the diversity visa lottery program, according to the four people involved in the discussions.
In his FebruaryState of the Union address , Trump said he wanted “people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”
Later, when he was asked by a reporter if he was changing his policy, he said “I need people coming in because we need people to run the factories and plants and companies that are moving back in. We need people.”
Kushner is considering increases in both the number of low- and high-skilled workers, as well as both permanent and temporary workers, according to the four people familiar with the discussions. In public, Trump and his allies have spoken mostly about high-skilled workers.
One prominent Trump ally who has recently weighed in on the subject is David Bossie, a Trump confidant who served in his 2016 campaign.
“We need to welcome temporary high-skilled immigrants with PhDs, Master’s, and strong educational qualifications to maintain U.S. economic superiority in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics,” Bossie wrote in a March 24 Fox News op-ed .
But some administration officials are urging Kushner to consider increases for low-skilled and seasonal workers as well.
Several administration officials caution that the effort is still in its early stages with Kushner still trying to gauge whether there’s enough room for a bipartisan compromise that could be passed into law. A Kushner aide referred questions to the White House press office, which didn’t respond.
Trump made cracking down on immigration the centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, calling for a border wall and ending an Obama-era program that allows temporary, renewable work permits for so-called Dreamers who were brought into the U.S. illegally as children.
But Trump backed away from his pledge to reduce the number of immigrants when he pushed a plan offering 1.8 million immigrants a chance at citizenship last year, though it would have also increased border security and ended a green card program. It was rejected by a Republican-controlled Congress in February 2018.
The White House has been divided on immigration throughout Trump’s presidency between Miller’s hardline camp, which largely reflects Trump’s views, and others — including Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump — who hold more moderate positions.
“The different factions in the White House represent different factions among Republicans,” said an immigration activist, who has been to two meetings and speaks to the White House regularly. “It sure looks like the folks who want an expansion are winning.”
Jessica Vaughan, who attended one of Kushner’s meetings and serves as director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies , questioned why the administration would be looking at an immigration plan now even as it declares an emergency at the southern border.
“They should be 100 percent on fixing the border crisis and not on other parts of the immigration system,” she said.
In recent weeks, Kushner and his working group of Brooke Rollins, who works in the Office of American Innovation, and Theodore Wold and Ja’Ron Smith, both special assistants to the president for domestic policy, have held smaller more informal meetings, focused solely on whether to expand employment based programs.
But some informed observers are skeptical: “Everyone continues to look at Jared as the great dealmaker,” said a former Trump adviser who remains close to the White House. “I think people give him too much credit.”
Holding his cards close to the vest, Kushner has not explicitly supported a particular plan in the meetings, according to attendees. Instead, he has encouraged others to express their opinions as a way to try to find a deal.
“The main thing we hope for is an actual proposal to get support…momentum,” said Jorge Lima, senior vice president of policy for Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by the Koch brothers and opposes cuts to legal immigration. AFP attended two meetings with Kushner.
Draft proposals are being circulated among various agencies, according to one of the people involved in the discussions. Multiple administration officials have told outside groups that a proposal could be released, perhaps by early summer, according to the four people involved in the discussions.
The outside Trump adviser said he is skeptical any proposal will pass because Democrats will ask for a larger immigration deal than just addressing this piece of legal immigration.
“They have to try to figure out what they can get through a Democratic House,” the person said.

"In Opioid-Afflicted West Virginia, Medicaid Expansion Improved Access to Treatment",www.governing.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/In-Opioid-Afflicted-West-Virginia-Medicaid-Expansion-Improved-Access-to-Treatment.html,"In Opioid-Afflicted West Virginia, Medicaid Expansion Improved Access to Treatment April 2, 2019 AT 7:08 AM
By Katelyn Newman
Expanding the eligibility criteria of West Virginians for Medicaid coverage in 2014 correlated with a growing number of enrollees being diagnosed and treated for opioid use disorder in one of the states most heavily impacted by the nationwide opioid crisis, a new study finds.
The study, published in the journal Health Affairs on Monday, analyzed Medicaid-reimbursed inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy claims for all people enrolled in the West Virginia Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act between January 2014 and December 2016 to determine whether there were changes over time in opioid use disorder diagnosis and treatment.
The researchers found an increase in the number of people accessing treatment for opioid use disorder in the first three years of West Virginia's Medicaid expansion, especially among those using buprenorphine for treatment, where the ratio between the monthly percentage of people treated with buprenorphine to the monthly prevalence of those with an opioid use disorder diagnosis increased from ""less than one-third in January 2014 to more than 75 percent in December 2016."" Meanwhile, the annual diagnosed opioid use disorder prevalence in the sample was about 5.5 percent of all enrollees per year, according to the results.
""This is dramatically higher than previously reported rates for Medicaid enrollees with 2013 claims data, where the national average was 0.9 percent and the West Virginia average was about 1.7 percent,"" the study says.
But the diagnosis and uptake of treatment varied substantially by race, ethnicity, rural status and diagnosed comorbid health conditions like depression or hypertension. It also did not include the addition of methadone as a treatment option and broadened reimbursable services covered under West Virginia's Medicaid program in 2017, as that expansion was outside of the study's time frame.

New accusations strain Biden defense,seriouslypolitics.com,Alex Thompson,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/02/19/43/55/new-accusations-strain-biden-defense/,"This post is by Alex Thompson from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

The controversy surrounding Joe Biden’s past physical behavior with women seemed to have stopped metastasizing after a team of Democratic defenders fanned out in his defense, seeking to knock down the notion that his tendency to be touchy with women was anything more than innocent affection.
But then came two more names late Tuesday alleging that the former vice president’s overly familiar touching made them uncomfortable, further muddying Biden’s predicament as he considers a third presidential run in 2020.
The new accusations, first reported by the New York Times, came just as Biden’s backers felt a measure of relief after four days of debate surrounding the propriety of Biden’s style of interacting with women.
Prominent female voices including former Biden staffers, former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, actress-turned-activist Alyssa Milano and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly voiced their support during the day, providing a degree of encouragement to Biden supporters and possible staff hires who have watched with dread as his team struggled with the accusations of the first two women who said he made them feel uncomfortable in unrelated instances.
The defense of Biden spanned the party, leveraging years of goodwill accumulated by the vice president.
“Joe took both of my hands in his and looked me in the eye for a long while before he spoke. He said simply, ‘I know, I know.’ For a brief moment we were two souls joined by a loss that changed our lives. After that, Joe would often pause to ask how I was getting along,” former Missouri Sen. Jean Carnahan wrote on Tuesday , relating how Biden comforted her after the loss of her husband and son in a 2000 plane crash.
“He reaches out through the human touch to connect and express those feelings,” she continued before quoting Mother Teresa: “People have forgotten what the human touch is, what it is to smile, for somebody to recognize them, somebody to wish them well.”
Still, even the support came with warnings to learn from the experience. Pelosi gave a bit of advice to avoid being too touchy-feely.
“Join the straight-arm club,” Pelosi said at a POLITICO Playbook breakfast event Tuesday, adding that he needs to keep his distance. “Just pretend you have a cold and I have a cold.”
Biden’s team began its aggressive pushback Monday, calling attempts to cast him as “creepy” part of a “cottage industry of lies.”
As part of that effort — more organic than organized due to his skeleton staff — the Biden camp exploited its long and deep ties to influential media figures and political players in Washington.
“They are putting out the bat signal and trying to solicit as many personal testimonials as possible … trying to encourage people to share their own stories,” said a Democrat with knowledge of the team’s strategy.
That approach was a recognition of the need to stanch the bleeding, but also of a belief that rival campaigns were behind the first salvo fired at Biden on Friday by Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman and 2014 lieutenant governor candidate who described Biden’s unwanted advances. Flores said Democrats needed to have a discussion about his behavior, especially in light of the #MeToo era of politics.
Flores’ account surfaced just as Biden’s consultants began making concrete job offers to potential staffers in early states, according to a Democratic operative who discussed working for Biden.
“They think this is part of a concerted effort to spook him out,” the operative said.
While the former vice president’s team was aware his physical style would become an issue as he geared up for a likely presidential bid later this month — Biden himself seemed to preemptively address the issue recently by referring to himself as a “tactile politician” — few expected the issue to take off because the contact wasn’t sexual in nature.
As recently as Tuesday afternoon, Biden’s allies were insisting the rough scrutiny was not a dealbreaker in his decision-making and that the former vice president remained on track to announce a 2020 decision this month.
“I don’t think this has thrown him off course,” said a person close to the Biden camp. “I think he is dealing with the hits his team thought would come.”
Yet even as they express confidence Biden can weather this storm, some allies worry that the fallout is exposing other potential weaknesses in his prospective candidacy.
“They just didn’t seem prepared and they knew this was coming,” saidthe Democratic operative. “But maybe that’s what happens when your whole team is a bunch of white guys with the exception of a lone white woman.”
By Tuesday evening, the controversy made President Donald Trump’s radar — he seized on Biden’s troubles, appearing to allude to speculation that Sanders supporters were responsible for the recent stories.
""He’s being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him,"" Trump said in his remarks to the National Republican Congressional Committee annual spring dinner. ""Our former vice president…I was going to say welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe?""

Lori Lightfoot elected as Chicago’s first black female mayor,seriouslypolitics.com,Steven Shepard,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/02/18/23/49/lori-lightfoot-elected-as-chicagos-first-black-female-mayor/,"Click here to view on the original site: Original Post
CHICAGO — Lori Lightfoot has made history on several fronts after winning Chicago’s mayoral runoff on Tuesday.
She will become the city’s first black woman and its first openly gay person to hold the office when sworn in next month. The nation’s three largest cities have never elected a black woman as mayor — the other two, New York and Los Angeles, have never even had a female mayor — and none of the three cities has ever elected an openly gay person to the job.
But Lightfoot’s election also marks a major break for Chicago, after two terms of Rahm Emanuel in the fifth floor in City Hall, and six terms of Richard M. Daley before him. She ran an outsider campaign that appeared to capitalize on Chicagoans’ frustration with corruption and self-dealing among the city’s political class.
Lightfoot is a first-time candidate, a former federal prosecutor who was president of the Chicago Police Board, a civilian watchdog for the city’s cops. She easily defeated a longtime politician in the city, Toni Preckwinkle, who currently serves as president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Preckwinkle, like Lightfoot, is an African-American woman.
Lightfoot led Preckwinkle, 74 percent to 26 percent, when The Associated Press called the race with 66 percent of precincts reporting.
The two women — both are Democrats in the officially nonpartisan election — were facing off just five weeks after the initial election, in which no candidate earned a majority of the vote. Lightfoot led the 14-candidate field with 17.5 percent of the vote, with Preckwinkle at 16.1 percent. Daley’s brother, Bill Daley, a former White House chief of staff and Clinton-era Cabinet secretary, finished third.
Preckwinkle had outraised Lightfoot by three to one, and Lightfoot had just $731,000 on hand at the start of the runoff, compared with Preckwinkle’s $3.9 million.
But the first runoff polls showed Lightfoot ahead by large margins — and with that momentum behind her, Lightfoot soon gathered top-tier endorsements and donations. Preckwinkle’s financial support has been primarily from big unions — the SEIU and the Chicago Teachers Union.
Since winning the first round, Lightfoot has raised $3.8 million to Preckwinkle’s $1.7 million.
In the last weeks of the race, Preckwinkle stopped airing television ads as her campaign struggled to raise money. The SEIU eventually came up with $100,000 that allowed her to go back on TV for the final week of the race.
Lightfoot painted Preckwinkle as an insider — a former alderman, president of the Cook County Board and head of the once-powerful county Democratic Party.
Preckwinkle embraced her “boss” status and even used it in ads. But she was also tainted by a scandal that rocked this city’s politics over the past few months: the federal criminal complaint against city Alderman Ed Burke, a legendary political figure here.
The Burke scandal haunted Preckwinkle throughout the runoff campaign. Her relationship with Burke was hard to shake when it was learned she had also given a six-figure salary job to Burke’s son.
“She had the right message at the right time,” said Jason McGrath, a pollster and senior adviser to Lightfoot’s campaign. “We knew for months we had something special and just needed the right circumstance to evolve for us to get to a point where people were ready to listen to the message. At the end of the day, from every neighborhood from Beverly Park to Uptown, people wanted something different.”
Emanuel, who will leave office next month, announced in September that he would not run for reelection. His two terms have been marked by growth in the city, but also by a high murder rate and instances of police misconduct. Emanuel appointed Lightfoot to head a task force after the murder of Laquan McDonald, who was shot and killed by Jason Van Dyke, a white Chicago police officer.
Lightfoot will become Chicago’s second woman mayor: Jane Byrne served one term, from 1979 to 1983. The city has also had two black mayors: Harold Washington, who was elected to succeed Byrne in 1983, and Eugene Sawyer, who became acting mayor when Washington died in 1987.

Former Bernie Staffer to Fox & Friends: 'Lucy Flores is a Fraud' and 'Racist',www.mediaite.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.mediaite.com/politics/former-bernie-staffer-to-fox-friends-lucy-flores-is-a-fraud-and-racist/,"Former Bernie Staffer to Fox & Friends : ‘Lucy Flores is a Fraud’ and ‘Racist’ by Colby Hall | Apr 3rd, 2019, 6:54 am
Former Bernie Sanders campaign staffer Tezlyn Figaro appeared on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning and made some news when she plainly called Lucy Flores a“fraud.” Flores is the former Nevada State Assemblywoman who wrote an essay that appeared last week in The Cut that alleged that Joe Biden made her feel uncomfortable with his public display of affection, a story which launched numerous other reports of Biden’s touchy-feely-ness with several women.
“You know, vice president Joe Biden, if you are listening, you should know that Lucy Flores is a fraud,” Figaro claimed before sharing that she worked alongside Flores at Sanders’ political group Our Revolution where Flores sat on the board. Figaro parted ways with One Revolution last year after the Sanders campaign took issue with some immigration comments she made on Fox & Friends .
She then noted that she filed EOC complaint describing Flores as “someone who was racist, who also implemented retaliation. She told me that if I didn’t do what she told me to do that I would suffer the consequences,” adding that she had “legal documentation” behind this claim. Flores “has a long list, a long history of her picking the perfect timing quote, unquote on speaking on these issues,” Figaro added, noting that she “spoke up immediately and took legal action” and Flores “waited for five years.”
With the 2020 presidential primary election just getting started, many have openly wondered if these allegations against Joe Biden might be part of an opposition campaign by a fellow Democratic candidate. Biden has not officially entered the race, but recent polls suggest he and Sanders are front-runners in the race for the nomination.

It Is Outrageous that Supporting Trump Is Dangerous,www.americanthinker.com,FeralCat,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/04/it_is_outrageous_that_supporting_trump_is_dangerous.html#post-8,"The United States Constitutional Republic is now operating as a FAILED STATE, and like the Roman Empire, it will collapse and we will have multiple nations with new governments. The tautological statement ""If something can no go on for ever, it will stop"" (Herb Stein) is common sense. The Roman Empire could not go on as an Empire debauching its currency and providing ""Bread and Circus."" They were overrun by barbarians and collapsed internally as factions devoured the Empire from the time Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon.
Suetonius wrote his ""Twelve Caesars"" where we have had our Nero (Clinton with incestuousness and elevating his horse to Senator) and Tiberius (with his minnows and the big fish S. Mullet). We had a last chance with Donald Trump who tried to turn the ship of state but all factions demand increasing the $22T Debt that will send us crashing into the rocks.
Central governments degenerate while they elude themselves that they are in a process of ""progress."" After the Roman Empire collapsed in Rome, it was mobbed by Muslims in Constantinople. It was followed by the Spanish and French Empire collapsing in their imperialistic fervor to the collapse of the British Empire with its Mercantilism. We are watching Germany and much of the EU collapsing in just the same way if one has eyes to see.
Socialism like all other ""isms"" is also like alcoholism. One tells themselves one will be fine if he only has a few beers. Then the ole liver gives out. Even if Americans give up their sauce (welfare system), the Constitution is as damaged as the constitution of a body with sclerosis. Often patients refuse to accept the sclerosis and continue down the errant path. But once it sets in, the best hope one can have long-term is that your children and grandchildren carry on the family and traditions. It appears as if DC (Death Cult) is drinking whiskey straight from the bottle? We are drunk and diseased."
