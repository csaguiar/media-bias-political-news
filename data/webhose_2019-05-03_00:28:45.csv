"We Talked to Mayor Pete About Beating Trump, Coming Out, and Whether Female Candidates Get a Fair Shake – Mother Jones",www.motherjones.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/04/we-talked-to-mayor-pete-about-beating-trump-coming-out-and-whether-female-candidates-get-a-fair-shake/,"
Can an openly gay war-veteran millennial become president in 2020?
This week’s guest on the Mother Jones Podcast is presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, vying for a shot in a crowded Democratic field.
In front of a sold-out crowd at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco last week, Mayor Pete, as he’s known to his constituents, had a candid conversation with Mother Jones Editor-in-Chief Clara Jeffery, in which he shared his plans to bring the rigor of running a small Rust Belt town to the White House.
But first, he needs to beat President Donald Trump—and Mayor Pete says he knows how.
Listen to the full interview:
Now hitting the campaign trail hard, Mayor Pete popped into third place in a recent poll in Iowa behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. And on Twitter Monday morning, Pete announced that his team has raised more than $7 million in the first quarter of 2019—a significant amount for a candidate who, until a few months ago, wasn’t well known outside of South Bend. This also means that he meets the criteria to get onstage for the first two Democratic Party presidential debates, so we might be hearing a lot more from Mayor Pete.
Fortunately, he’s got a sense of humor. Pete offered this advice to Democratic voters: “What you want to do is, you want to nominate a really kind of forward-thinking, inclusive, new-generation, young, good-looking mayor.”

Federal Judge Imposes New Probation Terms On PG&E To Reduce Wildfire Risk,wcqs.org,Richard Gonzales,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/federal-judge-imposes-new-probation-terms-pge-reduce-wildfire-risk,"By Richard Gonzales • 9 hours ago PG&E crews work to restore power lines in Paradise, Calif., after the Camp Fire destroyed much of the Northern California town. Rich Pedroncelli / AP
A federal judge in San Francisco is barring utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric from reissuing dividends in favor of using the funds for reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires in Northern and Central California.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup, in a court hearing Tuesday, also said that he will closely monitor PG&E's compliance with new wildfire prevention rules governing tree-trimming near power lines. Alsup is supervising the utility company's felony probation stemming from its conviction in the case of a massive natural gas pipeline explosion in 2010.
""A lot of money went out in dividends that should have went into tree trimming,"" Alsup said to PG&E acting chief executive John Simon as quoted by the Associated Press. ""PG&E pumped out $4.5 billion in dividends and let the tree budge whither. So a lot of trees should've been take down that were not.""
The judge's order does not include the stringent condition requiring PG&E to inspect its entire power grid as he originally proposed .
Company spokesman James Noonan said in an email that ""we share the court's commitment to safety and understand that we must play a leading role in reducing the risk of wildfire throughout Northern and Central California.""
The court's dividend plan was not a surprise. Last month in a court document , Alsup had signaled his intention to order the company not to issue dividends until it complied with ""all applicable vegetation management requirements.""
PG&E initially had resisted the plan , arguing that it had already suspended dividends in 2017. The dividend payments may not resume without Alsup's permission.
In February, PG&E said that it's "" probable "" that it was responsible for the 2018 Camp Fire that killed at least 85 people and destroyed about 14,000 structures. The company, facing billions of dollars in possible liabilities filed for bankruptcy in January. Alsup is also presiding over that filing in separate proceedings. Copyright 2019 NPR.

New York Is Set To Be First U.S. City To Impose Congestion Pricing,wcqs.org,Laurel Wamsley,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/new-york-set-be-first-us-city-impose-congestion-pricing,"By Laurel Wamsley • 10 hours ago After gaining approval from state lawmakers, New York will become the first U.S. city to levy fees on motorists who drive on some of its most congested streets. Here, traffic fills 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan in January 2018. Drew Angerer / Getty Images Originally published on April 2, 2019 9:21 pm
New York will likely become the first major city in the U.S. to implement a charge for motorists entering its most traffic-clogged streets.
The plan? To reduce gridlock while generating revenue for the city's stressed transit system.
State lawmakers approved the deal on Sunday night, and the new tolls are slated to go into effect in 2021. The tolling is expected to generate $15 billion , dedicated to funding the MTA, New York's transit authority.
The plan will be what's known as ""cordon pricing,"" in which motorists pay to enter a zone. In this case, that zone will be Manhattan south of 60th Street.
The precise charges to be levied have not yet been announced. A task force convened by the governor last year suggested different flat fees for cars and trucks.
In New York, automobiles move slowly these days, with drivers and bus riders moving at an average of 9 miles per hour in the last mile of their journeys. Cities including San Francisco and Seattle are also considering congestion pricing to unsnarl their own traffic-clogged streets.
New York's experience ""will be an important precedent for the conversations happening in other U.S. cities,"" Corinne Kisner, executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, told The Wall Street Journal .
The city's plan, unsurprisingly, has elicited a backlash from some corners — such as New Jersey.
""[W]hy should NJ not implement a commuter tax on NYC residents leaving NYC that exempts NJ residents so WE can fund our transit. Reality is any commuter tax should be a regional convo not just NY,"" tweeted Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop.
Sam Schwartz, a traffic engineer and former New York City traffic commissioner known as ""Gridlock Sam,"" told NPR last week that the toll for cars will likely be $10 to $15.
Tolls will be variable, and passenger vehicles will be charged once per day. Drivers entering the zone would be automatically charged via their E-ZPass or billed via their license plate number.
Still to be hammered out by lawmakers is what exemptions may be granted. A wide range of them are being considered, from exemptions for disabled people to exemptions for motorcycles . Exemptions on the table: ppl w/ disabilities, low income ppl living w/i the congestion zone, farmers market trucks, the henry hudson, the tappanzee, the gwb, the rfk, all four tunnels, and motorcycles — which felix ortiz says is ""common sense environmental issue"" b/c they r small https://t.co/Jk6sxS3A1a — David J. Meyer (@dahvnyc) March 29, 2019
Any exemptions could be exploited, as at least one observer noted . And for each exemption that's carved out, less revenue will generated and the impact on congestion will be smaller.
New York's move comes more than 15 years after London implemented fees on vehicles entering its central business district. The fees made an immediate and significant dent in congestion.
""Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h.,"" The New York Times noted .
There was an environmental effect too, ""with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone."" Stockholm and Singapore have also implemented congestion fees .
But London's gains are being threatened by a rise in private hire vehicles — such as those driven for Uber — which are exempt from paying the congestion fee. The number of such vehicles licensed in London jumped from about 50,000 in 2013 to nearly 88,000 last year.
And in the U.S., many states have introduced new toll roads or increased rates on existing turnpikes to raise money for infrastructure projects.
Schwarz, the traffic engineer, notes that New York has been talking about congestion pricing for decades. ""We're in it for the long haul,"" he said last week. ""The city will probably get sued, the state will get sued, but I think this time we will get it through."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"

Ecuador president Lenin Moreno on Tuesday charged that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has “repeatedly violated” the terms of his asylum in the South American country’s London embassy. “We should ensure Mr. Assange’s life is not at risk but he’s violated the agreement we have with him so many times,” Moreno said in an interview with the Ecuadorian Radio Broadcasters’ Association, according to The Guardian UK .
Moreno, hinting that Assange had committed wrongdoing, reportedly told the association that the WikiLeaks founder does not have the right to “hack private accounts or phones,” nor is he allowed to interfere in other countries’ politics, particularly those who Ecuador has strong relationships with. The 47-year-old Australian hacker has resided at Ecuador’s embassy for nearly seven years.
Moreno’s remarks come after years-old photos of him and his family were posted on social media, and while the Ecuadorian president did not specifically name Assange as the culprit behind the hack, government officials have accused WikiLeaks of leaking the photos of the Moreno’s time living in Europe.
“Mr. Assange has violated the agreement we reached with him and his legal counsel too many times,” he said . “It is not that he cannot speak and express himself freely, but he cannot lie, nor much less hack private accounts or phones.”
In a tweet Tuesday, WikiLeaks said Moreno revealed he would soon make a decision on how to address Assange’s situation.
“Ecuador”s President Lenin Moreno stated today that Assange has “violated the ‘conditions’ of his asylum” and that he will “take a decision” “in the short term” after @ WikiLeaks reported on the existence of the # INAPapers offshore corruption scandal wracking his government,” WikiLeaks wrote.

The scandal referenced by WikiLeaks — known as the Ina Papers in Ecuador — alleges Moreno profited off an offshore account in Panama, one of the most well-established tax havens in the Caribbean. Moreno has said the accusations are baseless.
In a statement to The Guardian UK , Ecuador’s foreign minister José Valencia said Assange’s living conditions comply with international law and any violation of them would break the WikiLeaks founder’s asylum agreement.
Moreno did not comment on potential next steps to evict Assange from the embassy.

A woman carrying two Republic of China passports has been charged after allegedly lying to Secret Service agents to gain access to President Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club while he was there last weekend.
The woman, Yujing Zhang, has been charged with making false statements and illegally entering a restricted area.
Information about her case appeared in a criminal complaint that became public on Tuesday.
Many details about her weren't immediately clear — for example, whether she is from Taiwan or from mainland China; she told investigators she had come to Florida from Shanghai.
Zhang briefly entered Mar-a-Lago after telling a Secret Service agent guarding the property that she was there to visit the pool, according to the criminal complaint.
Once inside the club, Zhang told a different Secret Service agent that she was there to attend a ""United Nations Chinese American Association"" event later in the evening. No such event was scheduled and the club's managers said she was not on any list authorizing her to be there.
Zhang was detained, and later told agents that a ""Chinese friend"" had told her to travel to Mar-a-Lago and speak with a member of Trump's family about U.S.-Chinese economic relations.
Zhang was carrying the two passports, four cellphones, one laptop computer, an external hard drive and a thumb drive that contained ""malicious malware,"" the criminal complaint said.
Zhang, authorities said, did not have a swimsuit in her possession.
Officials at the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C., had no comment about the case. A federal public defender representing Zhang declined to comment to the Miami Herald .

A Chinese woman carrying a thumb drive full of malware was arrested this weekend for lying her way into Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The president was golfing at a nearby property at the time, though he and his family were staying at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. The Miami Herald has the story. Reporter Nicholas Nehamas joins us now. Welcome.
NICHOLAS NEHAMAS: Glad to be here.
SHAPIRO: We don't know much about this woman. What can you tell us about her?
NEHAMAS: Well, we know her name was Yujing Zhang. She came to Mar-a-Lago for an event with a group called the United Nations Friendship Association. And she was carrying Taiwanese passports. Beyond that, we don't really know who she is.
SHAPIRO: She was also carrying a lot of electronics. What did they find on her?
NEHAMAS: Yeah. She had four cellphones, one laptop, one external hard drive and one thumb drive that contained malware according to the U.S. Secret Service. But beyond that, we don't know much about what kind of malware it was, whether her device had been unintentionally infected with it or whether she had loaded that malware onto the thumb drive herself.
SHAPIRO: So the charges that she faces include making false statements to a federal officer and entering restricted property. Can you give us the play-by-play as best we understand it?
NEHAMAS: Yeah, so she came to Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club, and said she wanted to use the pool and kind of implied that she was the relative of a member of Mar-a-Lago with a similar or the same surname and kind of got into the reception area that way. But then it turned out she wasn't on any list, and then her story changed, that she was here for this U.N. event, something which had been advertised by Cindy Yang. And that's when the Secret Service detained her.
SHAPIRO: OK, I want to dig a little deeper into this woman Cindy Yang - her real name is Li Yang - who has been in the news before in connection with a massage parlor that was at the center of a prostitution bust. She's also accused of selling access to the Trump family. How does this woman factor into the story?
NEHAMAS: So Ms. Yang, who, you know, as you said, owned the massage parlor where Robert Kraft was arrested, charged with soliciting prostitution, had a side business where she sold access to the president and his family, to events at Mar-a-Lago to Chinese business executives. And she had advertised an event set to take place at Mar-a-Lago on that day. It had been canceled after a lot of news reporting on her activities. So the woman who showed up to the club on Saturday said she was there for an event that had been canceled.
SHAPIRO: And Democrats have called for a counterintelligence investigation into Yang. That was before this latest story broke about the woman being busted with malware on a thumb drive. So how does that relate to this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, that's right. There are concerns by national security experts that Ms. Yang has ties to groups in the U.S. that are projections of the Chinese Communist Party's goals abroad. And so the Democrats are asking for an examination of how closely tied is she, if at all, to China's government and its efforts abroad.
SHAPIRO: I've heard people say ever since President Trump was elected that Mar-a-Lago presents a security threat. On the other hand, this woman was caught and arrested. So do you think this shows the weakness of Mar-a-Lago or the strength of the security perimeter that's there?
NEHAMAS: Well, you know, I don't think we quite know enough about what the situation was. You know, was it a harmless, confused tourist? Was it something more sinister? But certainly it is true that she was stopped well before she got into the club. And the president was golfing not at Mar-a-Lago but at his nearby golf course. So he was not present when this happened.
SHAPIRO: I know a lot of the details that you're sharing with us come from public court documents. Is there a court appearance scheduled for the woman at the center of this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, she has a detention hearing April 8 and an arraignment April 15. So I hope we will know more.

SHAPIRO: And Democrats have called for a counterintelligence investigation into Yang. That was before this latest story broke about the woman being busted with malware on a thumb drive. So how does that relate to this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, that's right. There are concerns by national security experts that Ms. Yang has ties to groups in the U.S. that are projections of the Chinese Communist Party's goals abroad. And so the Democrats are asking for an examination of how closely tied is she, if at all, to China's government and its efforts abroad.
SHAPIRO: I've heard people say ever since President Trump was elected that Mar-a-Lago presents a security threat. On the other hand, this woman was caught and arrested. So do you think this shows the weakness of Mar-a-Lago or the strength of the security perimeter that's there?
NEHAMAS: Well, you know, I don't think we quite know enough about what the situation was. You know, was it a harmless, confused tourist? Was it something more sinister? But certainly it is true that she was stopped well before she got into the club. And the president was golfing not at Mar-a-Lago but at his nearby golf course. So he was not present when this happened.
SHAPIRO: I know a lot of the details that you're sharing with us come from public court documents. Is there a court appearance scheduled for the woman at the center of this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, she has a detention hearing April 8 and an arraignment April 15. So I hope we will know more.
SHAPIRO: Nicholas Nehamas of the Miami Herald, thanks a lot.

Congressional Panel: Consumers Shouldn't Have To Solve Surprise Medical Bill Problem,wcqs.org,Rachel Bluth,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/congressional-panel-consumers-shouldnt-have-solve-surprise-medical-bill-problem,"Congressional Panel: Consumers Shouldn't Have To Solve Surprise Medical Bill Problem By Rachel Bluth • 11 hours ago Surprise bills happen when patients go to a hospital they think is in their insurance network but are seen by doctors or specialists who aren't. PeopleImages / Getty Images Originally published on April 2, 2019 6:07 pm
One point drew clear agreement Tuesday during a House subcommittee hearing: When it comes to the problem of surprise medical bills, the solution must protect patients — not demand that they be great negotiators.
""It is the providers and insurers, not patients, who should bear the burden of settling on a fair payment,"" said Frederick Isasi , the executive director of Families USA. He was one of the witnesses who testified before the House Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee of the Education & Labor Committee.
Surprise, or "" balance ,"" bills happen when patients go to a hospital they think is in their insurance network, but are then seen by a doctor or specialist who isn't. The patient is then on the hook for an often very high bill — sometimes exceeding thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.
Stories in the Bill of the Month series by NPR and Kaiser Health News have drawn attention to the problem.
Surprise billing is one of the rare public policy problems that are both bipartisan and in need of a federal solution. Around 60 percent of people are covered by employer-sponsored insurance, which is regulated by the federal government, and aren't protected by the nearly two dozen state laws governing balance billing.
""We have people on this committee that have done yeoman efforts to come up with solutions in their own states,"" said Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., the panel's ranking member. ""I think we have a head start in understanding some of the pitfalls to stay away from and some of the benefits we can go directly toward.""
Several policy solutions have been introduced in Congress and discussed at the White House , but the witnesses testifying before the panel were firm that any answer needed to be worked out between key stakeholders — providers and insurers — instead of forcing consumers to file complaints and go through arbitration processes.
The problem, according to testimony, needs to be solved at the root. Instead of allowing a situation in which patients must negotiate a payment plan after receiving a surprise bill, hospitals and insurers need to remove the incentives for doctors to remain out of network.
Right now, if doctors opt out of an insurance network, they can charge prices that are ""largely made up,"" said Christen Linke Young , a fellow at USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.
""We need to limit how much they can be paid in out-of-network scenarios to make it less attractive,"" Young said.
Experts offered a few solutions, like capping how much providers can be paid if they are out of network. Ilyse Schuman, senior vice president of health policy at the American Benefits Council, suggested capping reimbursement for out-of-network emergency services at 125 percent of what the physician would get from Medicare.
Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., an obstetrician, expressed concerns that tying payments to Medicare would disadvantage rural communities like his, where Medicare reimburses doctors less.
""We pay our providers less and can keep less than 10 percent of nurses we train in the area because we can't pay them,"" Roe said.
Rep. Susan Wild, a Pennsylvania Democrat, acknowledged that surprise billing is one problem that both parties are motivated to solve, but she was skeptical that a path forward was on the horizon. ""The solutions I'm hearing don't sound workable in the context of our present medical system,"" Wild said.
""Isn't the real problem the fact that we've turned over our medical system to private market forces?"" she asked.
While price transparency is often touted as the antidote to high medical bills, panelists were adamant that more information alone is not enough to stop balance bills.
Patients usually can't shop around for an anesthesiologist, for instance, no matter how much information they have.
""Notice isn't enough here; even if the consumer has perfect information, they can't do anything with that information,"" Young testified. ""They can't go across town to get their anesthesia and go back to the hospital.""

Discolored Water Could Remain In Parts Of Asheville For Rest Of The Week,wcqs.org,Matt Bush,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/discolored-water-could-remain-parts-asheville-rest-week,"By Matt Bush • 11 hours ago Asheville city manager Debra Campbell speaks at a Tuesday press conference. Behind her are mayor Esther Manheimer (left) and assistant city manager Cathy Ball (right) Matt Bush / Blue Ridge Public Radio Listen / 1:36
Two areas of Asheville remained under a boil water advisory Tuesday afternoon due to a water line break in the River Arts District the day before. Other parts of the city are still seeing brown and discolored water, something that could last for the rest of this week. Meanwhile city leaders are apologizing for a lack of clear communication about which neighborhoods were under boil water advisories and for how long.
Residents who live on Lyman Street from 304 Lyman to Riverside Drive and those who live on Warren Wilson Road from US 70 to College View Drive should boil their water for at least one minute before consuming it says assistant city manager Cathy Ball, who at a Tuesday afternoon press conference stated all other boil water advisories in the city had been lifted. There’s also been brown or discolored water pouring out of many a faucet in Asheville since last Friday, and that’s due to repairs to a water line that allowed sediment to seep in according to Ball. “Based on the calls we’re receiving, it appears that about five-percent of our customers are still receiving discolored water,"" Ball said Tuesday afternoon. ""We anticipate that all of our systems should be back to normal by Friday.”
Residents are urged to flush their lines if they see brown or discolored water by running water for five to ten minutes before using it. Tests according to the city have shown the discolored water remains safe to drink, as no bacteria has been detected according to water resources director David Melton. “With the bacteriological tests and disinfection monitoring that came back, we can clearly say the water is free from bacteria,"" Melton said at Tuesday afternoon's press conference. ""But the clearness of it is not what people expect, and is maybe not desirable to them.” He added the city will try to adjust bills for customers who see higher bills due to the flushing.
City leaders also admitted their communication the past few days to the public about the water issues was not up to par, as there was confusion over which parts of the city were under a boil water advisory and for how long. ""We are acknowledging that there were numerous things that happened simultaneously (that) we should have done a better job of communicating,"" said city manager Debra Campbell. ""We are going to do a better job communicating."" Tags:"
Marília Mendonça's Live Album Is A Beckon For Women In Brazil,wcqs.org,editor,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/mar-lia-mendon-live-album-beckon-women-brazil,"Marília Mendonça's Live Album Is A Beckon For Women In Brazil By editor • 11 hours ago Related Programs: / Originally published on April 2, 2019 7:48 pm
Last August, in the central Brazilian city of Goiânia, Marília Mendonça took the stage at a surprise concert. She repeated the surprise show in 10 other cities in the country. Brazilian crowds are known for their passion, but Mendonça's fans sang along with special excitement because the shows were announced on social media just hours in advance — a fitting move for Mendonça's brand and career, both of which have flourished through her social media strategy. Not only is she's the third most viewed female Latin artist in YouTube history, behind only Jennifer Lopez and Shakira , five of this album's videos are currently on Brazil's YouTube Top 40.
These 10 shows were recorded for Mendonça 's latest album, a live album, called Todos Os Cantos or All The Corners .
Mendonça is known as Brazilian music's ""Queen of Suffering."" It's a reputation the singer lives up to in one of her current hits, "" Bem Pior Que Eu. "" where the song's narrator is the other woman in an affair who's tired of being second choice.
Mendonça grew up in Goiânia, the heartland a kind of Brazilian country music called sertanejo. Like American country, sertanejo has found mainstream success and can be nearly indistinguishable from pop. For Mendonça, an accordion is sometimes incorporated to bring in much of the rural character into her songs. One example of that being ""Passa Mal,"" which was recorded in Recife, Brazil. ""In my life, your heart served as a step,"" she sings in her rich voice. ""Seeing you suffer is not good, it's sensational."" YouTube
Some of Brazil's cosmopolitan crowd scorns Mendonça's country power ballads as, ""brega,"" or corny music. Sentimental or not, her songs offer a woman's perspective that hasn't been heard much in sertanejo's machismo culture, and it's made Mendonça the leading voice of a new subgenre called ""feminejo""-- music by and for women.
Mendonça's the first to say her brand of feminism is more of an attitude than a political position. Still, millions of fans find empowerment in her song lyrics that reject bad relationships or refuse to compete with women on the other side of the cheating equation. Fans simply see their own flawed lives represented in her songs, like the relatable scenario in ""Bebi Ligue"" of drinking, calling, hooking up and regretting.
Mendonça's been an advocate for imperfection in other ways, like resisting beauty standards with her full-bodied stature. That's changing a bit now after a few years into her career, with some weight loss and plastic surgery. But like everything else in her life, she's sharing details of this transformation on social media, taking fans along for the ride. Mendonça never apologizes for expressing the truth of her experience as a young woman, and that transparency has helped make her one of the most popular artists in Brazil today. Copyright 2019 NPR.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
A Chinese woman carrying a thumb drive full of malware was arrested this weekend for lying her way into Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The president was golfing at a nearby property at the time, though he and his family were staying at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. The Miami Herald has the story. Reporter Nicholas Nehamas joins us now. Welcome.
NICHOLAS NEHAMAS: Glad to be here.
SHAPIRO: We don't know much about this woman. What can you tell us about her?
NEHAMAS: Well, we know her name was Yujing Zhang. She came to Mar-a-Lago for an event with a group called the United Nations Friendship Association. And she was carrying Taiwanese passports. Beyond that, we don't really know who she is.
SHAPIRO: She was also carrying a lot of electronics. What did they find on her?
NEHAMAS: Yeah. She had four cellphones, one laptop, one external hard drive and one thumb drive that contained malware according to the U.S. Secret Service. But beyond that, we don't know much about what kind of malware it was, whether her device had been unintentionally infected with it or whether she had loaded that malware onto the thumb drive herself.
SHAPIRO: So the charges that she faces include making false statements to a federal officer and entering restricted property. Can you give us the play-by-play as best we understand it?
NEHAMAS: Yeah, so she came to Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club, and said she wanted to use the pool and kind of implied that she was the relative of a member of Mar-a-Lago with a similar or the same surname and kind of got into the reception area that way. But then it turned out she wasn't on any list, and then her story changed, that she was here for this U.N. event, something which had been advertised by Cindy Yang. And that's when the Secret Service detained her.
SHAPIRO: OK, I want to dig a little deeper into this woman Cindy Yang - her real name is Li Yang - who has been in the news before in connection with a massage parlor that was at the center of a prostitution bust. She's also accused of selling access to the Trump family. How does this woman factor into the story?
NEHAMAS: So Ms. Yang, who, you know, as you said, owned the massage parlor where Robert Kraft was arrested, charged with soliciting prostitution, had a side business where she sold access to the president and his family, to events at Mar-a-Lago to Chinese business executives. And she had advertised an event set to take place at Mar-a-Lago on that day. It had been canceled after a lot of news reporting on her activities. So the woman who showed up to the club on Saturday said she was there for an event that had been canceled.
SHAPIRO: And Democrats have called for a counterintelligence investigation into Yang. That was before this latest story broke about the woman being busted with malware on a thumb drive. So how does that relate to this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, that's right. There are concerns by national security experts that Ms. Yang has ties to groups in the U.S. that are projections of the Chinese Communist Party's goals abroad. And so the Democrats are asking for an examination of how closely tied is she, if at all, to China's government and its efforts abroad.
SHAPIRO: I've heard people say ever since President Trump was elected that Mar-a-Lago presents a security threat. On the other hand, this woman was caught and arrested. So do you think this shows the weakness of Mar-a-Lago or the strength of the security perimeter that's there?

Nikwasi Mound Vote Delayed Until May,wcqs.org,Lilly Knoepp,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/nikwasi-mound-vote-delayed-until-may,"/ 2:28 Reporter Lilly Knoepp attended the Franklin Town Council Meeting to speak to residents for and against the transfer of the Nikwasi Mound deed to a nonprofit. The Council delayed their vote until May.
The Franklin Town Council delayed its decision until next month on transferring the deed of the Nikwasi Mound to nonprofit The Nikwasi Initiative .
It was standing room only for the public session on the transfer of the Nikwasi Mound, as 19 different people spoke before town council for and against the deal.
Opponents held neon signs saying “Honor the original deed.” Gloria Raby Owenby has been one of the main residents against the transfer. Owenby says that she bears no ill will toward the Cherokee but she questions the Nikwasi Initiative’s plan for a Cultural Corridor .
“People come here for the pastoral beauty and I want to keep it looking pastoral. And I’m not sure that 60 mile corridor is what we really want,” says Owenby, who is one of the five plaintiffs who filed a complaint against the town. She says that if the town transfers the deed the group will take them to court.
Four members of the board of the Nikwasi Initiative, the non-profit that would take ownership of the mound, also spoke at the meeting. Board member Bob McCollum brought cheers from his side of the room as he spoke about the Cherokee connection to the mound.
“To us, it’s a relic at the bottom of the hill that we grew up with here in the community. To them it is a real time here today part of their culture, their spirituality, their storytelling, their dance, their language – it’s completely different to them,” says McCollum, who is also a board member at Cowee School Arts and Heritage Center.
All of the people who spoke agreed that the ancient mound built by the ancestral Cherokee should be preserved. They don’t agree if making the mound more prominent in Franklin would be a good – or a bad thing. Ronald Carpenter is a native Maconian.
“I am all for leaving our Mound the way that it is and I don’t think that it needs to be commercialized – and I think that is exactly what they are trying to do with it,” says Carpenter.
Macon County Heritage Association and The Community Foundation of Western North Carolina both presented letters in support of the transfer.
Questions about the legal ability of the town to transfer the deed and the legality of Vice Mayor Barbara McRae to be on both the town council and the Nikwasi Initiative board were hot topics as well.
Franklin Town Attorney John Henning Jr. says that both questions have no legal bearing.
“That was really unfair she does not have a legal conflict of interest and as I also told the town council she has a legal obligation by state law to vote on the matter,” says Henning referring to McRae.
“The idea that the deed is set in stone and that the town has to own the mound forever and ever, amen is not a fair reading of that original deed.”
Henning presented a draft deed for both town officials and the public to look over – which they’ll have time to do as council moved its vote on the deed to their May meeting. Tags:"
Trump Backs Off Obamacare Replacement After Top GOP Leader Nixes The Idea,wcqs.org,Brian Naylor,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/trump-backs-obamacare-replacement-after-top-gop-leader-nixes-idea,"By Brian Naylor • 12 hours ago President Trump says Republicans will pass ""a great health care package"" after the 2020 election. Evan Vucci / AP Originally published on April 2, 2019 5:27 pm
President Trump, bowing to political reality, says he is putting off his thoughts of finding a replacement for the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election.
In remarks to reporters Tuesday, Trump said, ""I wanted to put it after the election because we don't have the House."" But it became clear that he didn't have support for a replacement to Obamacare in the GOP-led Senate, either.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he ""made it clear to [Trump] that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate."" Asked whether there were differences between him and Trump on the issue, McConnell replied succinctly, ""Not any longer.""
McConnell recounted that he had a ""good conversation"" with the president on Monday and pointed out ""the Senate Republicans' view"" that working on comprehensive health care legislation with a Democratic House was not something his party planned to do.
Trump surprised Republicans last week when he said he was going to make the GOP ""the party of health care"" and would revisit the issue that has frustrated Republicans and helped deliver the House to Democrats in the 2018 midterm election.
Even with GOP control of both chambers of Congress prior to that, Republicans were unable to agree on a plan to replace the ACA — something McConnell noted on Tuesday.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump's reversal means he will ""hold Americans hostage through 2020"" on an issue that affects millions of people. Schumer said Trump ""insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re-elect him.""
The administration continues to push for a court ruling that would invalidate the entire ACA , and it's unclear what would happen if the courts were to rule in the president's favor. Democrats have introduced a nonbinding resolution in the House that would tell the administration to drop its challenge to the law. Copyright 2019 NPR.

This Is For 'The Undefeated': A New Picture Book Celebrates Black Brilliance,wcqs.org,Ari Shapiro,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/undefeated-new-picture-book-celebrates-black-brilliance,"By Ari Shapiro • 12 hours ago Artist Kadir Nelson illustrates Kwame Alexander's poem ""The Undefeated"" in a new picture book. Kadir Nelson / Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Listen / Originally published on April 2, 2019 7:48 pm
In The Undefeated, artist Kadir Nelson illustrates generations of black American heroes ""emerging from the shadows.""
""It begins with Jesse Owens literally jumping out of the darkness into the light ..."" Nelson says. ""By the time we get to toward the middle and end of the book those shadows have disappeared and the brilliance and excellence of the subjects have completely emerged into the bright light.""
The text of the book is a poem Kwame Alexander wrote in 2008. Alexander's second daughter, Samayah had just been born, and Barack Obama had recently won election as the first African-American president of the United States. ""This poem was my tribute to both,"" Alexander writes.
The poem inspired Nelson. ""I thought it was very powerful ..."" he says. ""A beautiful poem that spoke to excellence, and perseverance, and triumph amidst adversity. It was an ode to the sung and unsung heroes in history."" Interview Highlights
On illustrating Alexander's poem
I don't necessarily have to illustrate other people's works ... I'll take on a book or project written by someone else when the words really speak to me ... [when] I can add something to it that is unique to the work that I do. This is one of those texts that really spoke to me; it was beautifully written and I felt it was a really great pairing of words and pictures of an author and an artist. Kadir Nelson / Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
On how he came up with the illustration for ""The ones who survived America by any means necessary""
I just really think about people in my family, people that I know, who are the unsung heroes. The people throughout history who we don't necessarily know — who we may never know — but all their contributions to the story of America are just as important.

It's a moment of silence. It's a moment of pause to provoke thought about all of those who didn't make it ... and all of those voices who have been silenced, all those voices who we have not known, have not seen, have not heard. This is a spread that is really speaking to them.
On the way he depicted the transatlantic slave trade
The subject matter is very difficult. It's not pretty. So even though I'm an artist and I try to create images that are visually pleasing, it was important that this subject be portrayed in the way that I think it should be. It's striking, it's unsettling, and it also gives you pause. This really happened. Kadir Nelson / Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
On finding a visual style that feels true to his subjects
Whether it's a book, whether it's a stamp, or an album cover, my approach is always the same: I want to be able to connect with the subject matter. I have to step in the shoes of whoever I'm portraying and create artwork that is reverent toward toward the subject.
On dedicating the book to his grandmother, and whether she's portrayed in it
We don't see her face, but at the same time, you know, I look at that family on the second spread [""the ones who survived America by any means necessary""] and I'm reminded of my grandmother. ...
My grandmother, she is from the Deep South and she married my grandfather who was a white American and they moved to the north and created a whole life for themselves. ... I come from a family of ancestors who were sharecroppers. ... I look at what she was able to do to push her family forward and create a life for the whole family ...
I see her face in all these faces — I see her face in that family, I see her face in Harriet Tubman or in Zora Neale Hurston. All of these heroes who have drawn upon something greater than themselves and created beauty out of something that was not beautiful.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The artist Kadir Nelson explores what it's like to be black in America today and throughout history. He's created postage stamps, magazine covers, paintings that hang in museums and illustrations for books, including a new children's book called ""The Undefeated."" The text is by poet Kwame Alexander.
KWAME ALEXANDER: (Reading) This is for the unforgettable, the swift and sweet ones who hurdled history and opened a world of possible, the ones who survived America by any means necessary and the ones who didn't.
SHAPIRO: That was Alexander, and we are joined now by the illustrator Kadir Nelson. Welcome.
KADIR NELSON: Thanks for having me.
SHAPIRO: When you first read the entire poem, what sprung to mind for you?
NELSON: I thought it was very powerful. I thought it was poignant, a beautiful poem that spoke to excellence and perseverance and triumph amidst adversity. It was an ode to the sung and unsung heroes in history.
SHAPIRO: So first, you have this line about the swift and sweet ones who hurdled history, who opened a world of possible. And you took that word hurdled very literally in your illustration.
NELSON: Right. Well, you know, I think one of the - I think the visual mantra that I used for this book was all of the figures emerging from the shadows. So you'll see - it begins with Jesse Owens literally jumping out of the darkness into the light.
SHAPIRO: Yeah, the lower half of his body is in dark shadow, and the upper half of his body looks like the sun is shining on it while his...
NELSON: Right.
SHAPIRO: ...Muscled body gleams.
NELSON: So by the time we get toward the middle and end of the book, those shadows have disappeared, and the brilliance and excellence of the subjects have completely emerged into the bright light.
SHAPIRO: And then the next page, we have the line, the ones who survived America by any means necessary. So this is a family of five, formally dressed in old-fashioned clothing, staring straight out of the page at the reader. How did you decide what to put on this page?
NELSON: I just really think about people in my family, people that I know who are, you know, the unsung heroes, the people throughout history who don't necessarily know - who we may never know. But all their contributions to the story of America are just as important.
SHAPIRO: So the page after the ones who survived America by any means necessary is the page that has a line, and the ones who didn't - the ones who didn't survive. This is a blank page. It's the only page in the book with no image at all. Tell us about the decision you made here.
NELSON: It - for me, it was a very logical choice. It's a moment of silence. It's a moment of pause to provoke thought about all of those who didn't make it. Part of this - the inspiration for the poem was one, the election of President Barack Obama and also carries through to the Black Lives Matter movement and all of those voices who have been silenced, all those voices who we have not known, have not seen, have not heard. This is a spread that is really speaking to them.
SHAPIRO: The images in this book all have a similar style, except for one page. There is a line - this is for the unspeakable - that repeats three times. And the first time, it appears on a page with an image of countless slaves stacked in a boat so tightly that at first glance, this looks less like human figures and more like a black and white textile pattern, almost. How did you come up with this image?
NELSON: The subject matter is very difficult. It's not pretty. So even though I'm an artist and I try to create images that are, you know, visually pleasing, it's - it was important that this subject be portrayed in the way that it - I think it should be. It's striking. It's unsettling. But - and it also gives you pause. Like, this was - this really happened.
SHAPIRO: OK. This question is a shot in the dark, but I'm going to ask it anyway. You dedicated this book to your grandmother...
NELSON: Yes.
SHAPIRO: ...Verlee Gunter-Moore. Are any of the women in these pages who we might not recognize as a famous person - do we see her face anywhere in here?
NELSON: No. We don't see her face. But I mean, at the same time, you know, I look at that family on the second spread, and I'm reminded of my grandmother, you know? I come from a family of ancestors who were sharecroppers. And, you know, when I look at what she was able to do to push her family forward and create a life for the whole family, I - you know, I see her face in all of these faces. I see her face in Harriet Tubman or in Zora Neale Hurston - you know, all of these heroes who have drawn upon something greater than themselves and created beauty out of something that was not beautiful.
SHAPIRO: Kadir Nelson, thank you so much for talking with us.
NELSON: Thank you for having me.
SHAPIRO: He's the artist who worked with the poet Kwame Alexander on the new children's book ""The Undefeated."" Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 BPR"

"Electric Cars Hit Record In Norway, Making Up Nearly 60% Of Sales In March",wcqs.org,Bill Chappell,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/electric-cars-hit-record-norway-making-nearly-60-sales-march,"By Bill Chappell • 10 hours ago Demand for Tesla Model 3 sedans is driving sales of electric vehicles to new heights in Norway. Here, a Tesla delivery site is seen in Lillestro, Norway. Lefteris Karagiannopoulos / Reuters Originally published on April 2, 2019 4:09 pm
Electric vehicles are now the norm in Norway when it comes to new car sales, accounting for 58% of all car sales in March. Tesla's mass market Model 3 was especially popular, accounting for nearly 30% of new passenger vehicle sales, the Norwegian Information Council for Road Traffic, or OFV, says.
The figures reflect Norway's desire to move away from fossil-fuel vehicles — with help from lucrative government incentives for owners of electric vehicles.
Overall, 18,375 new passenger cars were registered in Norway last month, the OFV says . Of those vehicles, 10,732 were rated with zero emissions — a gain of around 100% from the previous March. And nearly all of those vehicles are electric (four are hydrogen-powered).
Norwegian car buyers registered more than 5,300 Tesla Model 3 sedans in March — a record for a single car model in one month, the OFV says. In that same period, no other carmaker had more than 10 percent of sales.
In addition to the all-electric vehicles, 3,469 new hybrid cars were sold, reflecting a 10 percent drop from March 2018.
As Reuters reports , ""In 2018, Norway's fully electric car sales rose to a record 31.2 percent market share from 20.8 percent in 2017, far ahead of any other nation, and buyers had to wait as producers struggled to keep up with demand.""
Norway is well-positioned to reduce carbon emissions by a transition to electric vehicles. For one thing, it draws nearly all of its electricity from a network of hydroelectric power plants, according to its government . Hydroelectric power is cleaner than electricity powered by coal or natural gas.
On average, Norwegians are among the richest people in the world, meaning many of the country's citizens can afford a new electric car. In the 25-year period from 1992 to 2017, Norway's Gross National Income per capita more than tripled to nearly $64,000, according to the World Bank.
And then there are the incentives . For years, Norwegians who opted for a zero-emissions car enjoyed a wealth of benefits, including an exemption from sales, import and road taxes.
Until recently, emissions-free vehicles could also be parked for free and were immune to all toll and ferry charges. Those policies have changed, but owners of electric and other zero-emissions cars still face only up to 50 percent of the going rate for tolls and parking.
There is a paradox in Norway's rush to become a green power pioneer. It is a significant producer and supplier of fossil fuels to the global market, and the country's wealth has been boosted by its rich energy reserves : Norway is one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas.
The U.S. hasn't embraced electric vehicles with the same enthusiasm as Norway. But sales are picking up. The industry site InsideEVs reports that they hit a new high in 2018, with 361,307 vehicles sold — a sharp rise from 2017's tally of 199,826 vehicles.
But with persistently low gas prices, many Americans see no financial reason to make the switch to an electric vehicle. And U.S. consumers also have concerns about going electric, such as the availability of charging stations.
Looking at the broader picture, Wards Automotive notes , ""of the 17.215 million light vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2018, 16.042 million of them had just a traditional gasoline-powered internal-combustion engine. Another 496,000 had diesel engines in 2018, leaving 677,000 alternative-powertrain models sold.""
But the U.S. electric vehicle market does have at least one thing in common with Norway: nearly all of the recent U.S. gains can be attributed to Tesla and its new Model 3.
In 2018, Norway was an important market for U.S. exports of new cars and light trucks, with more than $821 million in sales — representing the 10th-largest market by dollar amount, according to the U.S. International Trade Administration .

"After Madrid Embassy Raid, North Korean Defector Group Vows More Action",wcqs.org,Anthony Kuhn,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/after-madrid-embassy-raid-north-korean-defector-group-vows-more-action,"By Anthony Kuhn • 12 hours ago The North Korean flag is flown at Madrid's North Korean embassy, which was was raided in February. Pablo Blazquez Dominguez / Getty Images Listen Listening... /
They are not widely known. And their chances at achieving their stated aim — overthrowing the North Korean government — are believed to be slim at best.
Yet the defector group that calls itself Free Joseon (Free North Korea) could be the first organization to have successfully infiltrated a North Korean diplomatic mission.
Last week, Free Joseon claimed responsibility for a Feb. 22 raid on Pyongyang's embassy in Madrid. Ten intruders armed with knives and replica pistols entered the embassy, according to Spanish authorities.
They say the Free Joseon operatives tied up North Korean diplomats and made off with computers, cellphones and other equipment — and flew to the U.S., where the group's leader shared information with the FBI. The U.S. has denied involvement in the raid.
Pyongyang's first public acknowledgment of the incident came on Sunday, when it complained North Korea had been the victim of a ""grave terrorist attack"" in which its diplomats were beaten and tortured, calling it a ""flagrant violation of international law."" It called on Spanish authorities to thoroughly investigate the incident and bring the perpetrators to justice.
Normally, says Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korean studies expert at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, North Korea would be loath to mention anything at all that might puncture ""the myth of invincible, unassailable, infallible, omnipotent leadership."" But these days, too much information is flowing into North Korea for its government to keep the Madrid embassy incident a secret.
Free Joseon's significance lies in ""the symbolism of hope, perhaps even justice, created in standing up to, in defying the powerful, oppressive state,"" says Lee.
Two years ago, under a different name, the group was apparently successful in spiriting away to safety a potential heir — or possible threat — to the Kim dynasty. Last month, rebranded as Free Joseon, it made a declaration of revolution and announced the establishment of a ""provisional government"" to take power in Pyongyang.
The group has raised the flag of rebellion at a particularly sensitive time, when the U.S. and South Korean governments are committed to a policy of negotiating and engaging with Pyongyang. The embassy incident took place just days before President Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam.
The group first came to light in 2017, following the assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia, which some South Koreans suspect was ordered by Kim Jong Un. Under the alternate name Cheollima Civil Defense (Cheollima is the Korean equivalent of Pegasus, the winged horse in Greek mythology), it claimed it had taken Kim Jong Nam's son Kim Han Sol under its protection. Kim Han Sol has not been seen in public since appearing in a 2017 Cheollima Civil Defense video.
Last month, on the 100th anniversary of Korea's independence movement against Japanese colonial rule , Cheollima Civil Defense resurfaced as the rebranded Free Joseon. On March 1, it posted a YouTube video in which a woman, whose face is obscured, reads the group's declaration of revolution and the establishment of a government in exile.
""We the people of North Korea,"" she says, ""indict this immoral and illegitimate regime for the starvation of millions, despite the ability to feed them, for government-sponsored murder, torture and imprisonment.""
Lee says there are no signs of imminent regime collapse, and defector groups are no match for North Korea's mighty security apparatus. But throughout history, he notes, revolutionaries who fail have often inspired others who eventually succeed.
Even if the Pyongyang regime eventually falls, ""The entire government system will not be eradicated,"" says Kim Jung-bong, a former official with South Korea's National Intelligence Service. ""I think a new government will emerge from within North Korea.""
Nevertheless, the raid on the Madrid embassy has fired up North Korean defector groups in South Korea, none of whom have yet dared to call for armed resistance against Pyongyang.
Park Sang Hak, director of a Seoul-based umbrella group called the Association of North Korea Human Rights, expresses envy of his fellow defectors in the Free Joseon group, which he believes has ""the help of the U.S. government."" (A State Department spokesman last week said the U.S. ""had nothing to do with"" the Madrid raid). ""But we are being oppressed by the current [South Korean] administration,"" Park says. ""I sometimes wonder if I'm in Seoul or in Pyongyang.""
Some defectors have complained that, in its eagerness to engage with Pyongyang, the administration of South Korean President Moon Jae-in has tried to silence them or cut funding for their group's activities. The South Korean government rejects these allegations.
Park says he has previously worked with Adrian Hong Chang — the Mexican citizen named by Spanish authorities as the leader of the raid on the Madrid embassy — distributing propaganda leaflets into North Korea.
""He's less like the leader of a civic group, and more like a soldier on a battlefield, bold and combative,"" he says. ""He's a very charismatic leader.""
Free Joseon says on its website that it is suspending operations for now, due to negative media coverage. But it urges patience, and says it is planning big things for the future. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
An 'Almost Unimaginable' Crisis In Venezuela,wcqs.org,Dave Davies,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/journalist-describes-almost-unimaginable-crisis-venezuela,"/ Originally published on April 2, 2019 5:56 pm
Venezuelans have been suffering one calamity after the next, but in recent weeks, much of Venezuela has had to go long stretches without electricity.
New York Times journalist Nicholas Casey was in Maracaibo , Venezuela, in March when the country was hit by a six-day blackout, considered at the time the worst in Venezuela's history. He says people initially assumed that the outage had been planned and that power would be restored after a few hours. But as hours stretched into days, the country fell into chaos.
""By the fourth day of the power outage, that was when you started to hear shots getting fired in the street,"" Casey says. ""People were beginning to loot, and the store owners were coming out to defend their stores.""
As Andes bureau chief for the Times, Casey has been covering the deepening economic and political chaos in Venezuela . He says the current crisis in the country is ""almost unimaginable.""
""This is an oil-producing country. This was one of the most wealthy countries in Latin America,"" he says. ""And now this is a place where there are shortages of food, shortages of medicine. People's daily lives are spent trying to figure out how they're going to get basic things like eggs or coffee.""
Casey notes that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of Hugo Chávez , has become increasingly authoritarian, imprisoning political rivals and cracking down on protesters. Maduro has also cut off access for journalists, including Casey.
""The government doesn't allow me to live in Venezuela anymore. I lived there in 2016, and by the end of the year, my visa was revoked,"" Casey says. ""Their reaction to the stories that I've had — it's been terrible sometimes. Anything that they see that doesn't line up with their view of what's happening in the country they consider to be a lie."" Interview highlights
On Venezuelans leaving their country because of the chaos
The U.N. estimates that it's upwards of 3 million people who have left. Now remember, this is a country of 30 million people. So we're talking about 10 percent of the population that has gone. And you see this when you walk around the streets of Caracas, which I have, or Maracaibo, which I did just a few weeks ago. There are areas which are completely empty. You walk down streets and you see that there's two or three people in one house, and then another house is gone, or another house has got a family of what looked like squatters, because they've just moved into the place.
On what the journey to leave Venezuela is like
So when you decide to leave, you usually say goodbye to your family, but there's no way of getting a flight, because you can't afford that. So for the most part, people take a bus using the bolívar, the currency that they have. Now the bolívars are worth money in Venezuela, but once you cross the border, they are almost worth nothing. So you're essentially bankrupt the moment that you cross into Colombia. ...
And at that point you have to figure out how you're going to get somewhere. And that usually means you're going to walk, and often Venezuelans will spend a few days on the border, but then they keep moving, because there are so many Venezuelans in these border towns. There's no jobs for them there, so people set off on foot. They have usually a suitcase, backpacks, but they're trying to travel very light, because they know that they're going to have to carry everything on their backs that they're bringing, and hitching rides occasionally. Sometimes they can save a little bit of money to take a bus ride a short distance, but basically they are trying to put as many footsteps between them and Venezuela as they can. And it can be an extremely long process to try to travel these countries; these are very mountainous countries on foot.
On how neighboring countries are responding to the millions of migrants
On one end, these countries are trying to pressure [President] Maduro now to step down, because they know that this migrant crisis is going to get even worse the more politically unstable the country gets. Countries like Colombia understand that Venezuela used to be a country that took their immigrants, especially during the darkest days of the paramilitaries and the guerrilla fighting, but at the same time, they understand they can't take every Venezuelan that comes.
And not only that, because of this crisis that's getting worse and worse, because of lack of medicine mainly, people are coming into these countries with diseases that should be controlled in Venezuela — diseases like diphtheria, malaria, tuberculosis have made a huge comeback in Venezuela. So if you're a neighboring country like Brazil or Colombia or a country like Ecuador or Peru, who are farther away but are also taking immigrants, this is a very scary situation that's right on your doorstep.
On how President Maduro forced visiting Cuban doctors to use access to medicine as a way to gain votes for Maduro right before an election
They would start by going house to house to people. ... The way that it was being described to me was that essentially you would start by handing people medications that they needed, especially seeing if they had chronic illnesses that they really needed medication for on a regular basis. And then after you start to get their trust, you would start to bring up Maduro. You'd start to bring up politics. You'd ask them, ""Are you registered to vote?"" And then actually start to make a much harder pitch, like ""You need to vote for Maduro. This is where this medicine is coming from,"" and ultimately at the end of this there would be a threat, which is that ""If you don't vote for Maduro, there is a possibility that you will lose your medication. You will lose your free health care."" And this is what all of the doctors that I talked to said. ... The further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes. - Nicholas Casey, Andes bureau chief, New York Times
The further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes. In one election in 2015, there was a doctor who said that when it appeared that the opposition was ahead in a legislative vote, that they actually not only saw the doctors out that afternoon to try to get people to go vote, [but] they also dressed other people up, who were not doctors, as doctors and gave them medicine to go get people to vote, to try to get them to trust these doctors to go and vote.
In the last elections that were taking place in 2017 and 2018, there was a doctor who was explaining to me about how he was in a small town and wasn't able to give medication to certain patients that were from the opposition and also was told to withhold things like oxygen tanks and not put them out early in the year because they wanted to bring out all the medicine and the oxygen tanks, which were largely in shortage, just before the election, just before people were going to vote, essentially to give the impression that Maduro had solved this medical crisis before people had to go vote for him again.
One reason to be optimistic that Venezuela will recover
I think there's a way out, and Venezuela, we have to remember, has lots of oil. So no matter how bad the economic crisis is, if there is a way out of the political crisis, there is a way for the country to be able to produce the money that it needs to be able to get back on its feet again. Unlike many other countries in the world, it's extremely blessed to have this natural resource there. But the way out is to have an election. People need to be able to choose who their leader is, because until that can happen, whoever is in charge — whether it's Juan Guaidó saying that he is the president or Nicolás Maduro saying that he is the president — isn't going to have the legitimacy to do anything about it.
Venezuelans ultimately need to be able to choose who's going to be their leader, and they might choose someone again from the left. After all these years, I'm not sure that that's what they're going to do, but they need to be able to have a choice between a number of parties from the opposition and whoever Maduro would put as his candidate, and whoever wins can then take the next steps.
Now, it's not going to be a fast process. This is something that's going to take years, to rebuild this country. But it's not necessarily the level I think always of devastation that makes people feel the worst. It's the fact that things are getting worse every day. Even if things were at a low point in Venezuela, if people could see that there was a reason for hope that things were starting to get better, I think you would start to see people coming back to Venezuela.

DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's taping an interview this evening with Philadelphia Orchestra conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin. We'll hear that interview Thursday.
One of the largest movements of refugees in the world today comes from Venezuela, where acute shortages of food, medicine and electric power have compelled millions to flee a country that once had a large, prosperous middle class. Our guest today is Nicholas Casey, the Andes bureau chief for The New York Times who's been covering the deepening economic and political crisis in the country.
Nicolas Maduro, who took over as president of Venezuela after the 2013 death of Hugo Chavez, has become increasingly authoritarian - imprisoning political rivals and cracking down on protesters. And the opposition now has a leader in Juan Guaido, the president of the National Assembly who declared himself interim president and has been recognized as the country's true leader by more than 50 countries, including the United States. Casey writes that the crisis in Venezuela has created an untenable standoff - one country with two presidents.
Nicholas Casey wrote about Mexican drug cartels and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for The Wall Street Journal. He joined The New York Times in 2016 and now covers most of the countries in South America. I spoke to him about the crisis in Venezuela yesterday.
Nick Casey, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Let's begin by talking about conditions in Venezuela today. What is daily life like for those who were there and trying to stick it out?
NICHOLAS CASEY: It's almost unimaginable from the kind of life that you would have had 10, 15 years ago. This is an oil-producing country. This was one of the most wealthy countries in Latin America. And now this is a place where there are shortages of food, shortages of medicine. People's daily lives are spent trying to figure out how they're going to get basic things like eggs or coffee; coffee can be a luxury. And for people that need medicine or are sick, this is an even more urgent challenge.
Suddenly, you find yourself trying to figure out how you're going to get penicillin, how you're going to get medicine for chronic diseases and also whether you should stay, like, whether you should try to find a way out of the country. I mean, this is how people are organizing their lives these days, around just the most basic questions.
DAVIES: There's a lack of power in the country, a lack of electrical power. And you described, in one piece, travelling to the city of Maracaibo on the Caribbean coast, which had a multiday blackout in March. What did you find?
CASEY: This was a place that didn't have electricity for six days. And again, one of these ironic parts about Maracaibo is that the city is - used to be the center of a major oil industry because this is where PDVSA, which is the state oil company, had centered most of its production for years. This was one of the first cities that had electricity in Venezuela. But today, it sits on the edge of the power grid because it's in the northwest of the country, and when this massive power outage hit Venezuela in March, this was one of the first places that lost its electricity.
And what you saw was, in the beginning - and Maracaibo's this hot city in the Caribbean coast. They use a lot of electricity, a lot of air conditioning. The joke used to be it was the coldest city in all of Venezuela because the air conditioning was always on. But then, suddenly, it went out. And when it did, people actually assumed that this was just another one of the many power blackouts that went on, rolling power outages that the country has had to do to keep everybody with some amount of electricity.
DAVIES: That last for a few hours, typically, right?
CASEY: That last for a few hours. At - yeah. And they were expecting the electricity to come back by the end of the evening, and when it didn't, people started to talk to each other, and people started to realize that this was not just Maracaibo that had lost its electricity; it was the entire country. You know, almost 30 million people now were in the dark. And this level of power outage hadn't happened before. So, you know, during the first days, people were just trying to make do. They realized that their food was going to rot in the refrigerator so they cooked it up. People pulled out generators in some of the neighborhoods I went and visited to, and they were plugging in their cellphones so they can stay in contact with people.
But they were also very nervous because the government wasn't saying exactly what had happened, and the only reason, the only explanation that Maduro came out was that there had been some sort of terrorist attack, some sort of sabotage against the electricity system - the system which people knew for years had been slowly coming undone. By the fourth day of the power outage, that was when you started to hear shots getting fired in the street. People were beginning to loot, and the store owners were coming out to defend their stores.
So suddenly, you had massive groups of people, unruly crowds, going into the streets, trying to take anything they could. It started with food, but then, suddenly, it went on to getting electrical appliances, taking anything out of these stores that they possibly could - medicine, you know, refrigerators, sofas. People were just beginning to take everything that they could see at that point, and it was getting extremely violent. Meanwhile, some of the looters themselves were coming in with injuries because they were getting into fights with the people who own these stores, often gun battles themselves. They were going into hospitals, and the hospitals themselves didn't have any light, so how were they going to treat anybody? One of the hospitals who I interviewed doctors from told me that, in the evening, there was an armed group that came into the hospital and started robbing the patients.
So one of the things that you saw from this power outage was that there was a lot more than just a blackout that was happening. You saw the state beginning to crumble in many ways and law and order completely disappearing. And it basically brought up the question, is - can you have a state in a place where there's no power? This is the one basic thing that the government should be able to provide, and the Venezuelan government hasn't been able to provide it yet. There are still huge parts of Venezuela that don't have power now, a month later.
DAVIES: So what was the government's explanation for the blackout, and what do you think might really have been the cause?
CASEY: Well, there were a couple of explanations. One of the explanations came from the union of the electricians workers themselves, which said that there was a brush fire that had taken place and had burned some of the infrastructure, and then after that, the grid went out. There was Maduro's explanation which came out, which was completely different; he said this was an act of sabotage that had been organized by the United States. He called it a cybernetic electromagnetic attack, and he said it had been sent from Chicago and Houston. After that, the head of the electricians union disappeared, and he was wanted by the government.
This is a cycle that you're seeing more and more, which is that the government has one explanation that often completely defies reality, in terms of what you're seeing. When I used to live in Venezuela, there were blackouts from this same dam, the Guri Dam, because everybody in Venezuela knew, if there was no maintenance done to this dam, it was going to fail in a spectacular way. And finally, it did. So when this blackout happened, this was something that had been foretold for years at this point. How are you going to be able to maintain a massive hydroelectric dam in the middle of this kind of crisis? You can't. And eventually, what you have is a massive blackout, like the one that we're still having in Venezuela.
DAVIES: So conditions are beyond difficult, and a lot of people have left. Do we know how many people have decided to leave the country?
CASEY: The U.N. estimates that it's upwards of 3 million people who have left. Now, remember this is a country of 30 million people, so we're talking about, like, 10 percent of the population that has gone. And you see this when you walk around the streets of Caracas, which I have, or Maracaibo, which I did just a few weeks ago. There are areas which are completely empty. You walk down streets, and you see that, you know, there's two or three people in one house, and then another house is gone, or another house has got a family of what look like squatters because they've just moved into the place.
You also talk to people who say that now they've got relatives who are outside of Venezuela, and the way that they are surviving is from their remittances that they're sending. Remittances was hardly a word you ever heard in Venezuela because Venezuela used to be the country everybody was moving to. This was a place where you had immigrants coming from Europe after World War II, you had Colombians coming into Venezuela during the armed conflict there that went on for decades and still is happening - because of the oil industry. If you were young, talented, educated, if you had aspirations, if you wanted to get ahead, Venezuela was a place that could be open to you. And now this is the place which is sending thousands of people across the border every single day.
DAVIES: Now, leaving can't be easy if you live in a country where your currency has become essentially worthless and transportation systems have broken down. How do people leave? What did your reporting show you about that?
CASEY: So I've talked to a lot of people that have gone; I see them everywhere. I mean, I was in Ecuador the end of last year, and just across the road, we were in the middle of a forest at one point, and we saw a group of people pulling suitcases, and they were Venezuelans. So I asked them how they left - how did you get here? You're in Ecuador. You're now many countries away from where you started.
So when you decide to leave, you usually say goodbye to your family, but there's no way of getting a flight because you can't afford that. So for the most part, people take a bus, using the bolivars, the currency that they have. Now, the bolivars are worth money in Venezuela, but once you cross the border, they are almost worth nothing. So you're essentially bankrupt the moment that you cross into Colombia, cross over a land border, usually in this town called Cucuta. There's another town called Maicao on the other side of Venezuela that people come through as well. And at that point, you have to figure out how you're going to get somewhere. And that usually means you're going to walk. And, you know, often Venezuelans will spend a few days on the border, but then they keep moving 'cause there's so many Venezuelans in these border towns, and there's no jobs for them there.
So people, you know, set off on foot. They have usually a suitcase, backpacks, but they're trying to travel very light because they know that they're going to have to carry everything on their backs that they're bringing - and hitching rides occasionally. Sometimes they can save a little bit of money to take a bus ride a short distance but basically trying to put as many footsteps between them and Venezuela as they can. And it can be an extremely long process to try to travel these countries, these very mountainous countries on foot.
DAVIES: Now, you talked to people who'd traveled through trails that were like - what? - 10,000 feet above sea level.
CASEY: Higher. Twelve thousand feet is - so you cross into Columbia, and the first stretch that you have to cross is going to be the worst actually. It's this 12,000-foot mountain pass in the Andes Mountains between Cucuta and another city called Bucaramanga. It's 125 miles through this area called the paramo, which is like this kind of windswept, treeless steppe where you can see out - these snowcapped mountains in the distance. And this is basically your welcome to Colombia, essentially - is to be able to make this this massive hike.
And at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, I talked to a number of people who were making this journey, and it's terrifying for many of them. Many of them told me they hadn't been that cold in their lives. They had no idea that they were going to have to go straight up. Some of the people that I had talked to had tried to make the journey and had turned around and had gone back to Cucuta because they just didn't think they were going to make it to the other side. Others were lucky, and someone gave them a ride, and they were able to get through some of it.
But this is one of the huge hurdles that Venezuelans face when they come and start this new life. And it's just the first of huge hurdles, from being able to cross these mountains, from being able to find work, from being able to get papers, not being caught by the authorities and sent back to Venezuela, which happens to a lot of people in Colombia. This is the start of what's going to be a very, very difficult life once you leave.
DAVIES: And how are the neighboring countries reacting to the immigration?
CASEY: It's with a lot of apprehension, I'd say, a lot of apprehension and understanding. On one hand, these countries are trying to pressure Maduro now to step down because they know that this migrant crisis is going to get even worse the more politically unstable the country gets. Countries like Colombia understand that Venezuela used to be a country that took their immigrants, especially during, like, the darkest days of the paramilitaries and the guerrilla fighting. But at the same time, they understand they can't take every Venezuelan that comes.
And not only that - because of this crisis that's, you know, getting worse and worse because of this lack of medicine mainly, people are coming into these countries with diseases that should be controlled in Venezuela, diseases like diphtheria, malaria. Tuberculosis has made a huge comeback in Venezuela. So if you're a neighboring country like Brazil or Colombia or a country like Ecuador or Peru, who are a little farther away but also taking immigrants, this is a very scary situation that's right on your doorstep.
DAVIES: Nicholas Casey is the Andes bureau chief for The New York Times. He's been reporting on events in Venezuela. We will talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF AVISHAI COHEN'S ""GBEDE TEMIN"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Nick Casey. He's the Andes bureau chief for The New York Times. He's been reporting on the crisis in Venezuela.
You've been reporting on Venezuela for a few years, but I understand you are no longer living there. Explain what kind of reaction you've had from the Maduro government how that's affected your ability to report.
CASEY: It's hard. And, you know, it's not just against me but against - it's against journalism, really. The government doesn't allow me to live in Venezuela anymore. I lived there in 2016. And by the end of the year, my visa was revoked one night that I was trying to come back to my home where I had an apartment. And I was told I wasn't going to be allowed in the country. I was detained that night in the airport, and then I was put on the first plane out of the country. And then for two years, I wasn't able to step foot again in Venezuela until I was eventually given another very short-term visa to cover the country. I came for a presidential election that they were having from Maduro.
I since have been able to get another visa but never anything that would allow me to live there because it's very clear the government is not interested in foreign journalists being there on a permanent basis if they can find any way to keep them out. And their reaction to the stories that I've had has been terrible sometimes. Anything that they see that doesn't line up with their view of what's happening in the country they consider to be a lie.
One of the last stories that I had published in the Times was about how Maduro's government had been using Cuban doctors who were supposedly in the country on humanitarian missions to treat poor people - how they were using these doctors not just to distribute medicine but to also push propaganda for the Maduro government, to get people to vote for Maduro, essentially, using medicine. After this story came out, many people from the government came out to attack it, including Maduro himself, who went on national television. And he called the story repulsive. The president of Cuba went on Twitter, and he called the article a crime, and he named me as a reporter. He said, you know, Casey and The New York Times, this is a crime.
When you see this from heads of state, this is extremely aggressive, this makes you very nervous as a journalist to do your work. And I think what made me even more nervous was the fact that these leaders felt that they could call this article a lie. But at the same time, they provided no evidence at all that what we had published wasn't true. I talked to 16 doctors that told me very similar stories. And here you have the leaders of these countries not being able to produce one shred of evidence that what we had published had any problems in it but focused on calling the article - attacking the article and attacking us.
DAVIES: You mentioned these Cuban doctors were using medical care, essentially, as a political weapon, you know, at the coercion of the Maduro government. How exactly did that work? What would they do?
CASEY: So they would start by going house to house to people. This was something that, when I started talking to the doctors about, they had mentioned was something that really bothered them. They wanted to be in their consultorios. They wanted to be in their offices, their doctors' offices, treating people. But they were being told every weekend, after the times they had finished, you know, some of their appointments, they needed to go and knock on people's doors and offer medicine.
And the way that it was being described to me was that, you know, essentially, you would start by handing people medications that they needed, especially seeing if they had chronic illnesses that they really needed medication for on a regular basis. And then after you start to gain their trust, you would start to bring up Maduro. You would start to bring up politics. You'd ask them, you know, are you registered to vote? And then actually start to make a much harder pitch of like, you need to vote for Maduro. This is where this medicine is coming from.
And ultimately, at the end of this, there would be a threat, which is that if you don't vote for Maduro, there's a possibility that you will lose your medication. You will lose your free health care. And this is what all of the doctors that I talked to said. A lot of these doctors had been in Venezuela at different years, some just after Maduro had taken charge and others, you know, closer to the last election. The further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes.
In one election in 2015, there was a doctor who said that when it appeared that the opposition was ahead in a legislative vote, that they actually not only sent the doctors out that afternoon to try to get people to go vote, they also dressed other people up who were not doctors as doctors and gave them medicine to go get people to vote to try to get them to trust these doctors to go and vote.
In the last elections that were taking place in 2017 and 2018, there was a doctor who was explaining to me about how he was in a small town and wasn't able to give medication to certain patients that were from the opposition and also was told to withhold things like oxygen tanks and not put them out early in the year because they wanted to bring out all of the medicine and the oxygen tanks, which were largely in shortage, just before the election, just before people were going to vote, essentially to give the impression that Maduro had solved this medical crisis before people had to go vote for him again. And this was something that had just left this doctor seething that he had to do that.
DAVIES: Nick Casey is the Andes bureau chief for The New York Times. After a break, he'll talk about the roots of the crisis in Venezuela and an effort to get trucks of humanitarian aid into the country that began with a pop concert and ended in violence. Also, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead reviews a 1992 live recording of Betty Carter that he says captures her at her best. I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF MIKEY DREAD'S ""RASTA IRIE OKI"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with The New York Times Andes bureau chief Nicholas Casey, who's been reporting on the escalating crisis in Venezuela. Shortages of food, water and medicine have compelled a tenth of the country's population to leave, while its president is hanging onto power in the face of widespread opposition and international condemnation.
There's kind of a political standoff in the country. You have two presidents - Nicolas Maduro, who is the president, and Juan Guaido, who is from the National Assembly who declared himself the interim president and has been recognized by a lot of other countries. Why don't you give us a little refresher on how we got here? Maduro took over when the previous socialist leader, Hugo Chavez, died in 2013. Tell us how we got here.
CASEY: There was a massive economic crisis we all know about in Venezuela. And then there was an election that took place last year. Maduro put himself up for re-election. From the start, Maduro was doing everything he could to make sure that he was going to be the winner of this election.
It came from putting in hurdles against opposition parties to be able to participate, which, actually, prevented many of them from taking part, outright banning one of his chief rivals, Henrique Capriles, from even running an election and having another rival be one of the top political prisoners in the country. That was Leopoldo Lopez, who couldn't participate in the election because he was serving a jail sentence at that point.
So that was how the groundwork for the election was laid. They held the election. And not surprisingly, given those conditions, Maduro won. Now, for - I was there when this happened. And I really hadn't seen Venezuela at a lower point in its history. People were just saying, we're going to go because this isn't going to change. Maduro is going to be around for years - more now. The opposition was rapidly disintegrating. And in all of this, people were continually asking, OK, well, where's the opposition right now? Why are there not any protests that were going on? Why is no one pushing back on this? And for a while, it kind of looked like maybe the opposition was just going to kind of vanish and give up to Maduro and give up to the system that was going to stay in place for many years to come.
What ended up happening was that the opposition waited until Maduro swore himself in as president at the beginning of this year. And that's when they kind of leaped into action. They used a little-known article in the constitution, which allowed them to be able to say, if someone had taken charge illegally that they would be able to, through the National Assembly, essentially take the reins of the country, essentially allowing Maduro to step into this trap of inaugurating himself as president again after having held a sham election, which most countries say was a sham, and then saying, you know, as the National Assembly, we're taking charge.
And this is where Juan Guaido, who you mentioned earlier, became the figurehead of this. He declared himself president under these rules and - also, in front of a large crowd of people, they called for a massive rally the day that this happened. And there was, you know, more than a million people who showed up to this, getting to see the massive frustration against Maduro and support that the opposition had - and essentially set up a parallel government, one that was recognized widely, not just by the U.S., which recognized Guaido that day, but also, you know, eventually by many countries of the European Union, by almost all of Venezuela's neighbors, by all of the places that essentially mattered to Venezuela - that is, except Russia and China - and started this campaign to say that he is actually the president. And when you see these headlines of two men are - you know, call themselves president of Venezuela, that's where we're at.
DAVIES: The political crisis, of course, was driven by a terrible economic crisis. Why did the Venezuelan economy collapse so completely?
CASEY: It collapsed because of years and years of economic mismanagement that started back to the time of Hugo Chavez. Now, Venezuela's economy was always run off of oil. And Chavez, when he became president in 1999, began a real transformation of Venezuela that was meaningful to many, many Venezuelans. I knew many families who were able to get out of poverty, were able to get law degrees, were able to get education, were able to set their children up for a completely different future under the changes that took place under Chavez's government, without a doubt.
But the secret to what Chavez was able to do was largely based on the government being extremely rich. Oil prices were above $100 a barrel, which meant that the government had basically infinite amount of money to do what it would. And for a large part, it decided to make massive investments in Venezuela's barrios. This started to change when the price of oil started to change. And the price of oil began to, you know, make these massive declines, starting 2014, 2015. And suddenly, the government wasn't as rich as it used to be.
Now, in ordinary circumstances, in a petrostate like Venezuela, you would have all kinds of money in the bank because you use much of it to fund your government, other parts of it to fund your state oil company and then a large part of it probably to fund social programs that would make your government very popular and help people. But in this case, Chavez - and then afterwards, Maduro - only used the money on the social programs. So it had no money that had saved in the bank for bad times, and it had no money that had really put into the state oil companies. Suddenly, the oil company wasn't even producing as much oil as it needed to. And then beyond that, it didn't have the money to invest in the poor anymore. So suddenly, you have all of these neighborhoods that were dependent on programs from the government that were suddenly cut off from them. So we had these three crises taking place at the same time, and that was the groundwork for what happened - what eventually became this time bomb in Venezuela that you see that's exploding right now.
DAVIES: So earlier this year when Juan Guaido declares himself the president - is recognized by the United States, many other countries, seems to have a lot of popular support and Maduro hangs in there and doesn't waver - there is a confrontation in late February on the borders of Venezuela and several other countries, particularly Colombia, where there was an effort to bring trucks of humanitarian aid. This wasn't just a relief effort, was it? I mean, what were the hopes of Guido and the opposition as this event approached?
CASEY: It wasn't ever just about the food. The idea was, by staging large amounts of food in front of a hungry country - and essentially, also in front of a hungry military - that in marching the food over the border against the will of Maduro, that somehow these soldiers who were being sent to block the food from coming in by Maduro would suddenly see the light, according the opposition, to suddenly - would decide that they weren't going to support Maduro and that they were going to take the food, allow the food to come into the country, turn sides, go to the opposition and then eventually topple Maduro. That was kind of the pie in the sky hope. This is what they were largely selling to the people of Venezuela as what was going to happen. They were assuring people that this food was going to get over the border and that this was going to happen. This essentially was an attempt at regime change by aid convoy. It was one of the weirdest things, I think, as a journalist I've ever covered in Latin America.
DAVIES: Right. And Juan...
CASEY: But that was the hope.
DAVIES: Juan Guaido was actually hanging from a truck at one point. And there was a rock concert to kick the whole thing off, right? Tell us about that.
CASEY: This added to the even more surreal aspects to this in that, you know, Richard Branson, the British billionaire from Virgin, decided that he wanted to get involved in this, too, and that the day before this attempt to push all of the aid across the border, they were going to have a concert. The concert was actually going to take place at the border bridge where the food was being staged - and that they would fill this area with people near the bridge, essentially showing them where they were going to go to the next day and that they would come back and then company the food across the border after having heard this concert where all of these Latin pop stars came out. And many of them spoke out against Maduro that day, and it really kind of, like, rallied the forces against Maduro.
Now, on the other side of the bridge, Maduro was having his own concerts and rallies for his supporters. So what you saw was this strange, like, aligning of forces on either side of the border. It was almost like looking at some sort of medieval battle that was going to take place where each side was setting up their tents the day before. And then the main event of it was not actually going to be an armed conflict but actually just a bunch of trucks filled with food that were going to enter the country and be allowed or not be allowed in.
DAVIES: Right. So you have Maduro, who doesn't want this, says, we don't need it and has stacked ship containers and trucks on the bridges with soldiers to stop them. The trucks approach. What happens?
CASEY: At that point, it fell apart very quickly. The idea was that this was going to be a nonviolent, peaceful protest that was going to take place. People were kind of comparing it to crossing the Selma bridge, that this would be people holding roses, chanting, accompanying this food. Instead, what happened was that the security forces on Maduro's side started to lob teargas canisters towards the marchers, and the marchers quickly came back at them with rocks and Molotov cocktails.
And it went from being what could have been a very peaceful march across the border into sort of running battles on this bridge between people on the opposition side who had their faces covered and were throwing rocks and homemade bombs and the security forces from Maduro, who themselves were throwing tear gas canisters and rubber bullets, shooting them at the people who were coming at them with food. And this ended up in one of the trucks being burned themselves.
DAVIES: This food and other humanitarian aid that had been assembled to move into Venezuela that couldn't get there - I'm wondering why that isn't distributed to the emigres who've left Venezuela and that are in border areas of Colombia and other countries.
CASEY: It's something that I asked a lot myself, and the reason it seems for this is because the purpose of this aid was not just to feed Venezuelans but also to make a political statement that the opposition was able to get that aid in. And to have just distributed it to people, even needy people on the Colombian side of the border, wasn't seen as accomplishing that goal, which made this aid shipment very controversial to start.
DAVIES: And so the relief doesn't get through. Juan Guaido is not seen as the liberating hero bringing food to a desperate people, and the stalemate continues.
CASEY: Yeah, it does. There has been some good news, though, which was that just this weekend, the Red Cross announced that it had reached an agreement with the opposition and with the government to be able to start bringing in humanitarian aid into the country. This is what should have happened to begin with. This kind of aid should be brought in by a third party like the Red Cross. It shouldn't be being brought in by a political party and distributed as patronage by either side. So for the time being, there seems to have been at least a small resolution to this larger issue of there not being food in Venezuela. The Red Cross will be able to bring in food into the country.
DAVIES: Nicholas Casey is the Andes bureau chief for The New York Times. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF PAQUITO D'RIVERA'S ""CONTRADANZA"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Nicholas Casey. He is the Andes bureau chief for The New York Times and has been covering the crisis in Venezuela.
The Trump administration has taken a very forceful stand on this. You want to describe what they've done?
CASEY: Yeah. Starting this year, there were some very big changes in terms of how Donald Trump started to talk about Venezuela. He'd always mentioned at times a military option. He'd mentioned how upset he was that Maduro was still in charge. It started to get a lot more pronounced at the start of the year, especially when Guaido started to say that he was the president, and all of Donald Trump's team began to support Guaido. Then you started to hear much more clear pronouncements that they wanted regime change.
Mike Pence came out and said to a crowd in Florida that the time for negotiation was over; change needed to happen. Repeatedly you'll see through Bolton, through Trump, through Pompeo that Maduro needs to immediately leave. It's been very few cases that you've seen - since Iraq itself where you've had the leaders of the United States saying that leader X must go and must go immediately. And this is where we are now with Trump and Venezuela. It's not clear that he's got a plan to be able to get rid of Maduro, but the kind of rhetoric that Trump has put out towards Maduro is unlike any that I've ever seen for a Latin American president.
DAVIES: Well, didn't he say or tweet that the Venezuelan military needed to act against Maduro or they would, quote, ""lose everything""?
CASEY: Oh, absolutely, yeah. This is something that they speak of all the time. There is open courting by the U.S. government of the Venezuelan military to topple Maduro, to change sides, essentially, it sounds like, to lead some sort of military coup that would then result in having an election afterward that would be free and fair - yes, that the military is the subject of many calls by the Trump administration publicly in terms of this public diplomacy that they've been doing.
DAVIES: And of course Maduro wants to blame the United States for all the country's problems. Is there a risk that Juan Guaido will be seen as a puppet of the United States?
CASEY: This is something that Maduro's people have been using to their advantage for some time, and this is something which I think any outside observer looks at and sees with the opposition and Guaido and begins to wonder, like, how close can you get to the United States without looking like you're their person, that they're trying to install you?
What does it mean when, you know, almost every week or every couple of weeks, you see another tweet by the president or someone in his cabinet saying, you, Guaido, are the person that should be the president of the country? Does that look like the U.S. is trying to make the decision for Venezuelans as to who should be their leader? And yeah, it's certainly something that Maduro's government has been using. They've been having these statements by Trump, Pence, Pompeo and others on repeat because they say that this is evidence that the U.S. is behind a plot to try to overthrow them, and they can play Trump's own words, saying that they want regime change in the country.
DAVIES: You know, I just want to wrap up by asking you. Since you've, you know, been immersed in this unfolding crisis for many years and conditions seem so horrific at the moment, can you find grounds for optimism? Can you see a way out?
CASEY: Yeah, I do. I think there's a way out. And Venezuela, we have to remember, has lots of oil. So no matter how bad the economic crisis is, if there is a way out of the political crisis, there is a way for the country to be able to produce the money that it needs to be able to get back on its feet again. Unlike many other countries in the world, it's extremely blessed to have this natural resource there.
But the way out is to have an election. People need to be able to choose who their leader is because until that can happen, whoever is in charge - whether it's Juan Guaido saying that he is the president or Nicolas Maduro saying that he is the president - isn't going to have the legitimacy to do anything about it. Venezuelans ultimately need to be able to choose who's going to be their leader. And they might choose someone again from the left. After all these years, I'm not sure that that's what they're going to do, but they need to be able to have a choice between a number of parties from the opposition and whoever Maduro would put as his candidate. And whoever wins can then take the next steps.
Now, it's not going to be a fast process. This is something that's going to take years to rebuild this country. But it's not necessarily the level, I think, always of devastation that makes people feel the worst. It's the fact that things are getting worse every day. Even if things were at a low point in Venezuela, if people could see that there was a reason for hope and that things were starting to get better, I think you would start to see people coming back to Venezuela.
Almost everybody who leaves that country - there's something very special about the country that people are very tied to unlike other places. And almost everybody that I've met wants to come back and is looking for a reason to do that. And if there could just be a reason to do that, which might just be being able to go vote, I think you would start to see a trickle of people starting to go the other direction back into the country.
DAVIES: Nick Casey, thank you for your reporting. And thanks for speaking with us.

Globalist Summit Jorge Ramos: Trump Threat to Close Border ‘Just Simply a Presidential Tantrum’ JEFF POOR 2 Apr 2019 Tuesday on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360,” Univision’s Jorge Ramos questioned the wisdom of President Donald Trump’s threats to shut down ports of entry on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Ramos called such overtures a “presidential tantrum,” and he accused the Trump administration of causing the problem because he wasn’t allowing immigrants to enter the country legally given they are seeking “political asylum.”
“It doesn’t make sense for me — simply a presidential tantrum because if he wants to close the border, and that means basically closing the ports of entry, then these thousands of immigrants that are waiting on the Mexican side are going to go through the desert or through the Rio Grande or through the mountains,” Ramos said. “And then the problem is simply going to increase. It really doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. He has to do many different things. At this point, his government is preventing thousands of immigrants from entering the United States legally because he’s only processing a few hundred process applications for political asylum at ports of entry. So it doesn’t make any sense whatsoever to close the border right now.”

What will help, a lot, is making a deal with the Democrats to change US law so that an asylum claim must be made at a port of entry.

Matthews reminded voters of the 1972 presidential election between incumbent President Richard Nixon and then-Democratic presidential nominee Sen. George McGovern (D-SD). Nixon won in a landslide, taking 49 states and 60% of the popular vote.
He suggested such a scenario could be possible in 2020 if Democrats nominated a far-left candidate to go up against President Donald Trump in 2020.
“I have been thinking about who is going to take back the White House, who’s going to win the Democratic nomination next spring then go on to defeat Donald Trump in November 2020,” he said. “What if the Democrats nominated a candidate who supports the key progressive issues of today, getting rid of the Electoral College, increasing the size of the U.S. Supreme Court, creating a government-run, national health system, paying a significant chunk of college tuition, liberalizing abortion laws, especially late in term and presenting immigration policies that would allow interpretation as open borders, including socialists, by the way, in the Democratic coalition? Suppose the candidate, she or he, carrying all those positions is the one picked to go up against Donald Trump. How will this choice strike the voters in such electoral swing states as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, even Virginia and North Carolina?”
“What’s hard is to identify a leading candidate that is resisting the move to the left,” Matthews continued. “Very hard because all seem determined to hold their own among those young, strongly progressive, often minority voters expected to make up the voting base in the early states. I have a strong memory of how this pattern of Democratic Party behavior worked out the last time the party went hard to the left. It was 1972. George McGovern was the chosen nominee. Everyone enjoyed themselves. The convention was giddy with excitement even if not that well organized. I was there watching the Massachusetts delegation actually dancing in a circle. They were so happy. The Democrats lost 49 states that year to Richard Nixon who not only carried the Electoral College, losing only Massachusetts and D.C. but 60 percent of the popular vote.”
“It could all be different, of course, on election night in 2020,” he added. “Trump could get licked no matter who the Democrats put up. But these are facts to consider. One, almost half the Democratic Party electorate is either moderate or conservative. In other words, to the right of the Progressives. Two, independent voters are also to the right of the Democratic progressives. Three, so are the straight Republican voters a Democratic nominee might need. Bottom line: Going into the Democratic primaries is not the same as going to the country.”

Van de Putte has her eye on Castro’s seat,offthekuff.com,Charles Kuffner,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=90201,"With seemingly-informed speculation that Rep. Joaquin Castro will run for Senate in 2020, someone else will need to run for the Congressional seat he’d be abandoning. That speculation has now begun , with some familiar names in the conversation. Leticia Van de Putte
Former state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte is seriously considering a run for the congressional seat likely to be vacated by Joaquin Castro.
Van de Putte, 64, a San Antonio Democrat who served for 24 years in the Legislature, is discussing the ramifications of a possible congressional campaign with her family, according to multiple sources.
[…]
Almost certainly, however, she would enter the race with the highest name recognition and the most campaign experience. She probably would also command the strongest fundraising base.
During her bid for lieutenant governor, Van de Putte raised more than $8.2 million.
Insiders suggest that a successful District 20 primary campaign will require more than $1 million in funds.
While most prospective District 20 candidates are still in a watching-and-waiting phase, some prominent names are in the mix, including state lawmakers Ina Minjarez, Diego Bernal and Trey Martinez Fischer and City Councilwoman Shirley Gonzales.
There also are two highly accomplished Latinas working in the private sector, contemplating their first campaigns as candidates:
Dr. Erika Gonzalez, a physician who served as the chief of allergy, immunology and rheumatology at the Children’s Hospital of San Antonio, spent 10 years in the Air Force and is the 2020 chair-elect of the San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; and Melanie Aranda Tawil, a tech business owner, Democratic activist (New Mexico youth vote field organizer for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign) and community leader whose credits include serving on the city’s 2017-22 Parks & Recreation bond committee.
See here and here for the background. After her 2014 Lt. Gov. campaign, Van de Putte jumped into the 2015 San Antonio Mayor’s race, which did former Rep. Mike Villarreal no favors, and wound up losing in a runoff to now-former Mayor Ivy Taylor, who was defeated in 2017 by Mayor Ron Nirenberg. She then co-founded a lobbying firm with former Secretary of State Hope Andrade, and seemed to be done running for office. You never know when a tantalizing opportunity will arrive. She’d definitely have competition, and it’s fair to say that primary voters have concerns on their minds now that they didn’t have the last time she ran in a primary. I could easily see such a campaign taking unexpected turns. All this is theoretical, of course – nobody’s running to succeed Joaquin Castro until Joaquin Castro confirms he’s running for Senate, which for all we know may not happen. Speculation is never out of style, however. The dominoes are lining up, it’s just going to need someone to topple them over. Related Posts:"

1.) I agree with more of this article than the previous one.
2.) Paleo-Progressivism was very different from the current version which is spearheaded by Jews and identity politics. These people supported eugenic sterilization laws, regulation of industry, wildlife conservation, public education and large scale development projects like the TVA. See Oliver Wendell Holmes in the Buck v. Bell decision or Theodore Roosevelt and the National Parks.
3.) Woodrow Wilson was a proud Southerner and a white supremacist progressive globalist. It sounds strange to modern ears, but such was politics back in those days.
4.) The Jim Crow South was dirt poor and free-market capitalism which was introduced here after the war was economically ruinous.
5.) The Southern economy was only revived by federal spending. It took the income tax, the New Deal and above all else World War 1, World War 2 and Cold War military spending to do it.
6.) In hindsight, it would have been much better to have simply GIVEN the South the money through direct investment rather than making our ancestors EARN it through fighting in a series of dumb wars for Washington from the Great War through Vietnam. Millennials also EARNED their federal dollars courtesy of Conservatism, Inc. in Iraq.
7.) Yang’s idea of just giving people the money is a much better idea for both us and humanity at large because we don’t need another Iraq or Afghanistan or the most catastrophic result of all which would be a world war with Russia and China over something stupid like a clash over Syria or Venezeula.
8.) Homogeneous nations in East Asia are struggling with how to deal with the same problem of an automated economy which will require millions of less workers in the future. These people freaking out about Yang telling them this truth while being Asian are exactly like the person who won’t listen when they are about to be hit by a truck because the person telling them this is non-White.
9.) Conservatism, Inc. will never allow a redistribution of wealth, investment in national infrastructure or equivalent to the GI bill for student loan debt analogous to the New Deal and World War 2 era.
10.) Yang alone has the potential to become a new FDR and rebuild a modern populist-progressive coalition that was split apart over identity politics and political correctness. It’s a long shot, but still an interesting possibility. Share this:"
Three reasons our State Senate still sucks,offthekuff.com,Charles Kuffner,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=90222,"One :
The Texas Senate approved in a preliminary vote Monday its first major anti-abortion bill of the session — a measure that would prohibit state and local governments from partnering with agencies that perform abortions, even if they contract for services not related to the procedure.
“I think taxpayers’ dollars should not be used for abortion facilities or their affiliates,” said state Sen. Donna Campbell, who authored the legislation.
Senate Bill 22 passed in the initial vote 20 to 11 with Democratic state Sen. Eddie Lucio of Brownsville bucking his party to support the bill. Lucio is the author of another anti-abortion bill, which would ensure abortion providers physically hand a controversial pamphlet detailing alternatives to abortion to women seeking the procedure. (In a final vote Tuesday, the Senate passed the bill 20 to 11, with Lucio again supporting the measure.)
Anti-abortion advocates support the measure in part because it would terminate “sweetheart rent deals,” which is just one of the ways local governments partner with abortion providers. Campbell, a New Braunfels Republican, has singled out one key target during the bill’s hearing: Planned Parenthood’s $1-per-year rental agreement with the city of Austin.
[…]
Meanwhile, abortion rights advocates rail against the bill as an attack on local control. The bill would “tie the hands of cities and counties,” according to Yvonne Gutierrez, executive director for Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. She also worried that the language of SB 22, which would limit “transactions” between the government and abortion providers, is too broad and would target more than just the downtown Austin rental deal.
Seems to me the taxpayers of Austin are perfectly capable of handling this for themselves, but by now we are well aware of the contempt in which legislative Republicans hold cities.
Two :
After emotional testimony, a forceful show of opposition from leaders in the state’s business community and more than an hour of floor debate, the Texas Senate on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a sweeping religious refusals bill, a priority proposal for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick that LGTBQ advocates have called a “license to discriminate.”
The measure, Lubbock Republican Charles Perry’s Senate Bill 17, would allow occupational license holders like social workers or lawyers to cite “sincerely held religious beliefs” when their licenses are at risk due to professional behavior or speech. It would also prevent licensing boards from enacting regulations that burden “an applicant’s or license holder’s free exercise of religion.” The bill does not protect police officers, first responders or doctors who refuse to provide life-saving care.
After a heated debate, the measure passed on a 19–12 initial vote, with one Democrat, Sen. Eddie Lucio, voting for it, and one Republican, Sen. Kel Seliger, voting against. It requires one more vote in the Senate before it can be sent to the Texas House for debate.
Perry said the bill provides a defense for licensed professionals who find themselves before credentialing boards based on conduct or speech motivated by their “sincerely held religious beliefs” — a pre-emptive protection for religious employees at a time when, he claimed, religion is under attack.
But LGBTQ advocates and Democrats have criticized the bill as an attempt to give cover to those who would deny critical services to members of the LGBTQ community. Last week, leaders from major businesses like Amazon, Facebook and Google, as well as tourism officials from some of the state’s biggest cities, came out in force against the bill. Discriminating against LGBTQ communities is bad for business, they said.
See here for some background. Of course this targets the LGBT community – that’s one of the modern Republican Party’s reasons for being. Well, them and the getting-rarer-but-not-extinct-yet travesty like Eddie Lucio. Good Lord, that man needs to go. More from the Observer .
And three , not a story but a resolution: “Declaring the crisis at the Texas -Mexico International Border an emergency and requesting congress to adopt a budget that fully funds all means necessary to fully secure the Texas-Mexico international border.” Well, guys, be careful what you wish for .
UPDATE : Here’s the Trib story about the “border crisis” resolution. It was exactly as big a waste of time as it sounds. Related Posts:"
CNN Tells First Honest News Story of 2019 – Islamic Brunei Will Stone Gays to Death,www.occidentaldissent.com,Jaye Ryan,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2019/04/02/cnn-tells-first-honest-news-story-of-2019-islamic-brunei-will-stone-gays-to-death/,"April 2, 2019 Jaye Ryan Islam , PC 4 Justice Department blocks South Carolina Voter ID law
Things are getting predictably weird and hostile in my former City of Chicago. Yesterday I was twenty feat away from the (not) so Reverend Jessie Jack As* Jackson and arguably the worst anti White, Black Liberation Theology, CINO (Catholic in Name Only) Father Pfleger/Father faker. they held a press conference to defend the actions of BlackLiesMatter Cook County Chicago District Attorney Kim Foxx in her handling of the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax (all charges against Jussie were dropped). Chicago Fraternal order of Police and outraged citizens were holding a street rally demanding that DA Kim Foxx needs to go, Feds need to indict her.
Here’s Jessie and Father Faker hating on White people, hating on the Chicago police and blaming the CPD for Black and Latino Gang members shooting 3,000 plus people with just under 600 murders last year.

I kept a somewhat low profile, mixed with the pro Police protesters and led some chants “Get a Job Jessie, Get a Job”– just noting the fact that Jet Stream Jessie Jackas* Jackson has never held an honest job his entire life!
In other weird news. CNN actually produced an honest news story! CNN honestly reported that the Islamic nation of Brunei has implemented laws stoning Gay people to death!
Link
In the F#*$&@, mixed up world of American/Western PC Liberal Leftism – Gay People, LGBT and all Muslims are on the same side, resisting the oppressions of evil White racist MAGA trump supporters who supposedly lie in wait on Chicago streets when the temperature is – 15 F looking to bleach Black people White then lynch them for being Black, Gay, Muslim or disabled.
‘Why do White Racist MAGA trump supporters do these terrible crimes!
Because they’re EVIL, RACISTS, HATERS and the Social Justice Warriors, SPLC, BlackLiesMatter, Antifa, CAIR, NAACP, ADL, social media $ billionaires must be fully empowered to end all hate crimes, hate speech, thought crimes etc”
But in the real world, in places like the Islamic kingdom of Brunei and in parallel Muslim communities in England, Sweden and Michigan – the Muslims take a rather different view of homosexuality…
They look to impose Islamic Sharia law which includes stoning Gay people to death, making women cover up in black tent burkas, banning women from driving or getting involved in politics (might have some merit there)!
I don’t support stoning Gay people to death. That seems a bit much. Still, I would prefer if the worst homosexual/LGBT perverts would keep their perversions to themselves and not force these “alternative lifestyles” on the public, including our children 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year!
Here are some excerpts from the CNN report on Brunei and the Gays – you might want to save it because it might be another full year before Jeff Zucker’s CNN tells another true story.
“A new law which comes into effect from next week will punish homosexual sex and adultery with death in the small southeast Asian kingdom of Brunei.
Beginning on April 3, any individuals found guilty of the offenses will be stoned to death, according to a new penal code. The punishment will be “witnessed by a group of Muslims. The country’s strict new laws were announced in 2014, and have been rolled out gradually. The latest phase of implementation, including the brutal new provisions, was quietly announced on the Brunei attorney general’s website on December 29, 2018.
Human rights groups were quick to express horror at the penal code, which will also order amputation as a punishment for theft.”

An April Fools’ Day resignation prank? One Texas civil court judge wishes it were so.
A newly elected judge in Houston accidentally resigned on Monday, according to local media and a county official, after he shared plans online to run for the state supreme court, apparently unaware that the Texas constitution considers such an announcement an automatic resignation.
The Harris County Civil Court judge, Bill McLeod, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Local TV station KHOU 11 News on Monday reported that McLeod declined to comment on the move.
Article 16, Section 65, of the state’s constitution says that a judge’s announcement of candidacy for another office “shall constitute an automatic resignation of the office then held.”
The county attorney’s office will present the matter to county commissioners next Tuesday, First Assistant County Attorney Robert Soard said in a phone interview on Tuesday. County commissioners, who can appoint replacements, may decide to keep McLeod in office until there is a special election, KHOU 11 reported.
The judge’s supporters have organized on social media using the hashtag #IStandWithMcLeod. They plan to attend the commissioners’ Tuesday meeting and express their wish that the judge retain his office despite his blunder.
Here’s Judge McLeod’s Facebook page , where I assume this accidental resignation happened. I tried looking for that post, but there were too many posts in support of him to scroll past, so I gave up. Judge McLeod was one of the more energetic campaigners, both in real life and on social media, in 2018 and I’m not at all surprised that people are rallying to his defense. Commissioners Court has the discretion of allowing him to stay in place until the next election, essentially serving as his own appointed interim successor. If he’s lucky, he’ll just have to run again in 2020 – he should have no trouble winning if that happens – and then can run for re-election as usual in 2022. This KHOU story doesn’t mention the April Fool angle, so I’m not really sure if this was a joke that didn’t land or just a foolishly early announcement with unexpected consequences. Either way, it wasn’t the best idea anyone ever had.
(Just so we’re all clear, the Constitutional provision cited in the story applies to the following offices: District Clerks; County Clerks; County Judges; Judges of the County Courts at Law, County Criminal Courts, County Probate Courts and County Domestic Relations Courts; County Treasurers; Criminal District Attorneys; County Surveyors; County Commissioners; Justices of the Peace; Sheriffs; Assessors and Collectors of Taxes; District Attorneys; County Attorneys; Public Weighers; and Constables. That means that among other things, it does not apply to District Court judges or appeals court judges, which is why the Democratic candidates for Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2018, all of whom were sitting District Court judges in Harris County, did not have to resign. Remember how long there was speculation about Adrian Garcia running for Mayor in 2015 before he ever said anything? That was because he had to resign as soon as he did say it. Let’s all be aware of these things going forward, OK? Thanks.)
UPDATE : Here’s a legal defense of Judge McLeod’s actions. It’s more complicated than it first appears. Related Posts:"

Confederate History Month 2019: George Fitzhugh on The False Philosophy Of Our Age,www.occidentaldissent.com,Hunter Wallace,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2019/04/02/confederate-history-month-2019-george-fitzhugh-on-the-false-philosophy-of-our-age/,"American Racial History Timeline, 1960-2008 Confederate History Month 2019: George Fitzhugh on The False Philosophy Of Our Age
The following excerpt comes from George Fitzhugh’s Cannibals All! Or, Slaves Without Masters which is one of the most interesting, neglected, original and ferocious attacks on free-market capitalism and liberal democracy that I have ever come across:
“ FALSE PHILOSOPHY OF THE AGE.
The moral philosophy of our age, (which term we use generically to include Politics, Ethics, and Economy, domestic and national,) is deduced from the existing relations of men to each other in free society, and attempts to explain, to justify, to generalize and regulate those relations. If that system of society be wrong, and its relations false, the philosophy resulting from it must partake of its error and falsity. On the other hand, if our current philosophy be true, slavery must be wrong, because that philosophy is at war with slavery. No successful defence of slavery can be made, till we succeed in refuting or invalidating the principles on which free society rests for support or defence.
The world, however, is sick of its philosophy; and the Socialists have left it not a leg to stand on. In fact, it is, in all its ramifications, a mere expansion and application of Political Economy, – and Political Economy may be summed up in the phrase, “Laissez-faire,” or “Let alone.” A system of unmitigated selfishness pervades and distinguishes all departments of ethical, political, and economic science. The philosophy is partially true, because selfishness, as a rule of action and guide of conduct, is necessary to the existence of man, and of all other animals. But it should not be, with man especially, the only rule and guide; for he is, by nature, eminently social and gregarious. His wants, his weakness, his appetites, his affections, compel him to look without, and beyond self, in order to sustain self.
The eagle and the owl, the lion and the tiger, are not gregarious, but solitary and self-supporting. They practice political economy, because ’tis adapted to their natures. But men and beavers, herds, bees, and ants, require a different philosophy, another guide of conduct. The Bible, (independent of its authority,) is far man’s best guide, even in this world. Next to it, we would place Aristotle. But all books written four hundred or more years ago, are apt to yield useful instruction, whilst those written since that time will generally mislead. We mean, of course, books on moral science. We should not be far out in saying, that no book on physics, written more than four hundred years ago, is worth reading, and none on morals written within that time. The Reformation, which effected much of practical good, gave birth to a false philosophy, which has beer increasing and ramifying until our day, and now threatens the overthrow of all social institutions The right of Private Judgment led to the doctrine of Human Individuality, and a Social Contract to restrict that individuality.
Hence, also, arose the doctrines of Laissez-faire, free competition, human equality, freedom of religion, of speech and of the press, and universal liberty. The right of Private Judgment, naturally enough, leads to the right to act on that judgment, to the supreme sovereignty of the individual, and the abnegation of all government. No doubt the Reformation resulted from the relaxation of feudalism and the increased liberties of mind and body which men had begun to relish and enjoy. We have no quarrel with the Reformation, as such, for reform was needed; nor with all of the philosophy that has been deduced from it; but it is the excess of reform, and the excessive applications of that philosophy, to which we object.
Man is selfish, as well as social; he is born a part and member of society, born and lives a slave of society; but he has also natural individual rights and liberties. What are his obligations to society, what his individual rights, what position he is entitled to, what duties he should fulfill, depend upon a thousand ever-changing circumstances, in the wants and capacities of the individual, and in the necessities and well-being of the society to which he belongs. Modern philosophy treats of men only as separate monads or individuals; it is, therefore, always partly false and partly true; because, whilst man is always a limb or member of the Being, Society, he is also a Being himself, and does not bear to society the mere relation which the hand or the foot does to the human body.
We shall propose no new philosophy, no universal and unerring principles or guide, in place of those which we assail. A Moral Pathology, which feels its way in life, and adapts itself to circumstances, as they present themselves, is the nearest approach to philosophy, which it is either safe or wise to attempt. All the rest must be left to Religion, to Faith, and to Providence. This inadequacy of philosophy has, in all ages and nations, driven men to lean on religious faith for support. Though assailing all common theories, we are but giving bold and candid expression to the commonest of thoughts. The universal admiration of the passages we are about to cite, proves the truth of our theory, whilst it debars us of all claim to originality:
SOLOMON, melancholy, gloomy, dissatisfied, and tossed upon a sea of endless doubt and speculation, exclaims, “Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.” But, at length, he finds rest from the stormy ocean of philosophy, in the calm haven of faith. How beautiful and consoling, and how natural, too, his parting words:
“Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.”
“For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”
In his Tenth, or Golden Satire, JUVENAL comes to a like conclusion, after having indulged in like speculations:
Nil ergò optabunt homines? Si consilium vis, Permittes ipsis expendere numinibus, quid Conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris. Nam pro jucundis aptissama quæque dabunt diis Carior est illis homo, quàm sibi.
The Epicurean HORACE, in his first Satire, sees the same difficulty, but gives a less satisfactory solution:
Est modus in rebus; sunt certi denique fines, Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.
BURKE’S beautiful words, “What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue!” convey the same thought, without attempting a solution.
SHAKESPEARE employs the profoundest philosophy, to assail all philosophy:
“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”
The infidel, VOLTAIRE, admits that “philosophy had ascertained few truths, done little good;” and when he sums up that little, satisfies the reader that it has done nothing – unless it be to perplex and mislead.
He, Voltaire, also, in another connection, exclaims, mournfully:
“I now repeat this confession, still more emphatically, since the more I read, the more I meditate, and the more I acquire, the more I am enabled to affirm, that I know nothing.” NEWTON, admitting his own ignorance, is a standing monument of the inadequacy and futility of moral researches and speculations.
PINDAR –
Man, the frail being of a day, Uncertain shadow of a dream, Illumined by the heavenly beam, Flutters his airy life away.
AESCHYLUS –
Vain thy ardor, vain thy grace, They, nor force, nor aid repay; Like a dream, man’s feeble race, Short-lived reptiles of a day.
SOPHOCLES –
‘Tis sad to think, but me the farce of life persuades, That men are only spectral forms, or hollow shades.
ARISTOPHANES –
Come now, ye host of fading lives, like the race of withering leaves, Who live a day, creatures of clay, tribes that flit like shadows away; Ephemeral, wingless insects, dreamy shapes, that death expects Soon to bind in phantom sheaves.
We will conclude our citations, which we might continue to the crack of doom, (for all who have written well and much, have indulged similar reflections,) with Doctor Johnson’s Rasselas, which is intended to expand and apply what others had concisely and tersely stated. The Doctor’s is an elaborate failure.
Philosophy can neither account for the past, comprehend the present, nor foresee and provide for the future. “I’ll none of it.”
Lots of food for thought here.

I’ve always disliked groupthink.
In that spirit, I heartily accept Tony Martel’s criticisms of Yang Gang as essentially being a delusion that White people are going to enslave the robots and live off sci-fi welfare . I just have this nagging feeling at the back of my mind though that Tony is being too dismissive of the possibility that the world is becoming a wealthier place and life could actually get better.
Pellagra Man has a lot to do with it :
“Very quickly, a new character entered the picture: the furnishing merchant. Landowners discovered that they could reduce their own indebtedness and diminish personal risk by allowing merchants in the towns and rural communities to furnish their tenants directly. Furnishing merchants protected their investments by taking a second crop-lien on a farmer’s crop. It has been estimated that as late as the early 1940s, the average sharecropper family’s income was less than 65 cents a day. Out of this meager income, farmers had to pay off advance indebtedness. If the crop did not bring enough to pay the entire debt, the remainder was added to the next year’s lien, a situation that one historian referred to as “debt peonage.” Generally, the interest rate for advanced goods was 10 percent. Added to that, the merchant often raised the price of goods sold on credit over and above that of items purchased with cash. Considering the higher mark-up and interest together, tenant farmers paid an interest rate that sometimes exceeded 50 percent annually.
The way of life of most tenant farmers was inferior to that of many people in medieval Europe. Housing consisted of primitive log cabins or clapboard shotgun houses. Few homes had glass windows or screens; most featured wooden shutters that could be closed at night and in inclement weather. Indoor plumbing was nonexistent; water was provided from open wells or nearby springs and creeks, and bathrooms were outdoor privies located a few yards behind the house, creating serious sanitation problems.
Another problem facing tenant farmers was poor transportation. Until the 1950s, virtually all tenant farms were located on unimproved dirt roads. In 1930, of Alabama’s 257,395 farms, only 4,516 had access to hard-surface roads. Rain left unimproved roads impassable, and during dry weather, they were dusty, with deep ruts. As a result, tenants were generally isolated socially, and they faced economic ruin if the roads were unusable at harvest time.
The tenant family’s diet consisted mainly of cornbread, corn mush, fatback pork, and molasses. Some tenants were able to supplement their diet with vegetables if the landowner permitted use of a portion of their plot for a garden. Many landlords, however, wanted as much land in cotton as possible, so only a few farmers had gardens. Poor diet, lack of sanitation, and substandard housing led to widespread health concerns, such as hookworms, pellagra, and rickets. …”
I can’t shake the haunting memory that a century ago there were millions of people like Pellagra Man and his family in the South and that 100,000 people died here of malnutrition. I think of a landscape that was covered in cotton which was being overproduced by poor sharecroppers who lived in primitive shacks and were enslaved by debt to furnishing merchants. They had no electricity, education, running water, sanitation or shoes. They sat there in the shacks in absolute destitute poverty and ate a diet of pure cornpone and fatback. Their children were suffering from retardation due to hookworms. It was a luxury to own a vegetable garden. The wild turkey and whitetail deer had been hunted to extinction.
I just want to go up to Pellagra Man and tell him … hey, you can come with Yang Gang to Whole Foods and we can grab some dinner and drink a few beers. We can get you some health care and put your children through college and have them start their lives on a sound financial foundation. In the 21st century, we have a lot of problems too like low wages and debt slavery to banks, but we were finally able to start fixing them after dumping “conservatism” for the second and last time.

Democrats' first 100 days: A focus on the 2020 election,thehill.com,Juliegrace Brufke and Scott Wong,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/437068-democrats-first-100-days-a-focus-on-the-2020-election,"By Juliegrace Brufke and Scott Wong - 04/03/19 06:00 AM EDT
The campaign never really stopped for Democrats after they won back the House majority in the 2018 midterms.
Now approaching their 100th day of power in the House, Democrats are almost solely focused on capturing the next big prizes: control of the Senate and the White House in 2020.
Bipartisan deal-making has been pushed to the back burner — at least for now.
Instead, in the opening months of the new Congress, Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi Two more women accuse Biden of inappropriate touching GOP, Dems balk at latest Trump foreign aid cuts Progressive House Dems meet with Pelosi staffer to push for tough drug pricing bill MORE (D-Calif.) has been pushing through messaging bills — to stop corruption, tighten gun laws, promote pay equality and shore up ObamaCare — that are going nowhere in the GOP-led Senate.
The package of bills fulfills campaign promises that Democrats made to their voters in 2018. But they also represent a preview of what Democrats say they can accomplish if voters hand them a unified government next year.
“I don’t think there’s any question about it, because we are talking about health care and making democracy work and infrastructure — three things that everyone is interested in. It bodes well,” House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth John Allen Yarmuth Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief expects Turkey to drop purchase of Russian missile system | Dems counter Trump's proposed cuts with B spending boost | Lawmakers press Perry on nuke work with Saudis On The Money: Trump shifts on border shutdown threat | Lawmakers fear 'catastrophic economic impact' from closure | Waters warns bankers she will take 'a hard look' to catch misconduct | Uncertainty over Dem spending proposal Dem spending proposal faces uncertain vote MORE (D-Ky.), a member of Pelosi’s leadership team, told The Hill.
“We’ve got a chance to take back the Senate and win the presidency” with this agenda, Yarmuth said.
Aside from the meaty bills on health care, Democrats have also adopted a number of nonbinding proposals in their short time in the majority, including a resolution condemning hate and another denouncing the administration’s efforts to scrap ObamaCare, which the House passed on Tuesday.
Steny Hamilton Hoyer Bipartisan IRS reform bill heads to House floor New Mexico Dems brace for crowded race to succeed Udall Pelosi, Dems look for upside to Mueller report MORE (D-Md.) defended that strategy on Tuesday, saying the aim is simple: “[We’re] telling the American people what we believe and what we think ought to be done,” he said during a press briefing in the Capitol.
The last time Pelosi and the Democrats flipped the chamber, in 2007, party leaders charged into the new Congress with a laser focus on their campaign priorities, moving quickly to pass every piece of their “Six-for-06” agenda within the first 100 hours of seizing the gavel.
That legislative wish list included efforts to overhaul congressional ethics rules, raise the minimum wage, make college more affordable, boost green energy technologies and lower prescription drug costs by empowering Medicare to negotiate prices.
Despite having GOP President George W. Bush in the White House, all but the drug proposal ultimately became law.
The first Democratic House majority working with President Trump Donald John Trump Colbert mocks Trump for 'oranges' gaffe Dem wins Trump district in swing-state Pennsylvania Trump says health care plan will be first vote after 2020 election MORE did not begin with the warm and fuzzy bipartisan feelings.
Democrats immediately faced a crisis: Trump, fresh off a midterms thumping, partially shut down the government over demands for his border wall, sparking recriminations on all sides.
House Democrats stood firm in the standoff and prevailed; Trump caved and reopened the government with no wall funding. But the bitter fight poisoned the bipartisan well — and delayed the Democrats’ ambitious agenda for weeks.
“Unfortunately, when we took over the House of Representatives … the government was shut down, and that was for the first month,” Hoyer told The Hill. “What we were consumed with was getting the government back to work, with no help from the Republicans and no help from the president, who wanted to shut [it] down and wanted to keep it shut down.”
Pelosi is leading the most diverse caucus Democrats have ever seen — more minorities, more women and a mix of centrists and fire-breathing liberals hell-bent on changing Washington.
But at times, it has created deep fractures in the 235-member caucus, particularly as progressives pushed plans like the Green New Deal and “Medicare for all” that are anathema to moderates with tough elections next year.

2020 Dems audition for Al Sharpton's support,thehill.com,Niall Stanage,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/437058-2020-dems-audition-for-al-sharpton,"2020 Dems audition for Al Sharpton's support By Niall Stanage - 04/03/19 06:00 AM EDT
The leading Democratic candidates for president will be auditioning before Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network this week — a testament to both the importance of the black vote and Sharpton’s increasingly mainstream image.
The four-day convention, which begins in New York on Wednesday, includes Sens. Bernie Sanders ADVERTISEMENT
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Joseph (Joe) Robinette Biden Two more women accuse Biden of inappropriate touching Trump taunts Biden amid misconduct allegations: 'You having a good time, Joe?' Biden controversy splits Dems on generational, political lines MORE , who is not scheduled to appear at the convention, spoke at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event in Washington organized by Sharpton.
Biden, who has not yet declared his 2020 candidacy, used that occasion to express regret for his support of a 1990s crime bill that remains deeply controversial in minority communities.
Sharpton ran for president himself in 2004, and though he was never a serious contender for the nomination, he placed third in the South Carolina primary, the first major contest with a significant number of black voters.
The 2004 primary campaign was also a pivot point for Sharpton, marking a transition from his earlier career as a sometimes inflammatory and polarizing activist to more recent years, when he was welcomed to the White House under former President Obama and became an MSNBC anchor.
Asked what he wanted to hear from the candidates at the convention, Sharpton told The Hill, “I want to hear substance. I don’t want to hear sound bites. Like, yes, we need to alter the criminal justice system. How? What would you do about the mandatory sentencing laws? What would you do about police reform? Would you reinstitute consent decrees?”
Addressing persistent economic inequality is also important, he said.
“I want to hear in terms of the economy, how do you close the race gap in employment? Yes, black unemployment is lower than it’s ever been, but it’s still double that of whites. How do you close the race gap in terms of health care? I want to hear specifics. Where’s the meat? Not just giving us the dessert,” Sharpton said.
Harris and Booker are the two leading black candidates in the race, and either could plausibly become the nominee — though Harris is considered by most observers to have the stronger shot.
The mere fact that there are two strong contenders for the nomination who are black is a sign of how much the political ground has shifted in recent years.
Obama was the first black candidate to have had a serious chance of winning the presidency, whereas previous bids by figures such as Sharpton, Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, and then-Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) in 1972 were important more for their symbolic power. ADVERTISEMENT
More recently, the Black Lives Matter movement, racial injustice in policing and the related “take a knee” NFL protests have become central political issues.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ocasio-Cortez mocks Tucker Carlson's warning about feminism: 'Get spooked' Trump mocks Green New Deal as done by 'young bartender' Ocasio-Cortez Ocasio-Cortez calls for release of Chelsea Manning: 'Solitary confinement is torture' MORE (D-N.Y.), flatly accusing him of being racist.
The issue of reparations — once a fringe concern — is bubbling up in this year’s Democratic race. Harris and Warren have suggested they have some sympathy for the demand for reparations, though the specifics are not clear.
Sanders has been warier of reparations per se, though he supports a long-held plan by Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) to direct federal funds to some of the nation’s most impoverished congressional districts, many of which have significant black populations.
Sharpton himself calls for further study.
Sheila Jackson Lee The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump attacks on McCain rattle GOP senators Harris to make hard Texas push, recruits key O'Rourke aide: report Trio of NFL players intern on Capitol Hill as part of league program MORE ’s [D-Texas] legislation that there needs to be a commission to study it,” he told The Hill. “Clearly, we have got to define what we are talking about when we talk about reparations. Clearly, something should be done, in my judgement. But done how and what vehicle?”
More broadly, the civil rights activist noted that the strong turnout of 2020 contenders at his event was evidence of how issues that had once been marginalized have become more central to the national political debate.
“A lot of the issues that we have been at the forefront of — in terms of criminal justice reform, in terms of voting rights, in terms of racial disparities, in terms of the economy — have become mainstream issues,” he said.
He noted that his organization’s first similar event occurred almost 20 years ago, in 2000, when then-Vice President Al Gore Albert (Al) Arnold Gore Long-shot goal of nixing Electoral College picks up steam Dem senator introduces bill to abolish Electoral College Our two-vote system for electing a president must be defended MORE (D) and his Democratic primary challenger, Bill Bradley, debated at Harlem’s storied Apollo Theater.
“Every cycle we’ve done them since, more and more [of] our issues have become mainstream,” Sharpton said. “You cannot now run without dealing with these issues.”
News clippings from around the time of the Apollo Theater event underline the distance Sharpton himself has traveled.
In a March 2000 Washington Post story, the writer noted that “the mainstreaming of Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr. is underway, sparking a war of words over the acceptability of associating with this racially controversial figure.”
That debate is long over, at least among Democrats and liberals. The presence of the leading presidential candidates — as well as other leading lights of the party, including Ocasio-Cortez and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams — this week is testament to that.
Sharpton’s support is clearly worth having.
He says he is not about to endorse a candidate anytime soon — but he doesn’t rule it out.
“I may. National Action Network will not, but I may — late in the campaign,” he said. “I endorsed Obama in late ’07. I did not make an endorsement in ’16. But I think that it’s important that we deal with this whole presidency of Trump, so I may do something late this year.
""But again,” he repeated, referring to the candidates appearing at this week’s conference, “I want to hear something.”"
Opposition to PACs puts 2020 Democrats in a bind,thehill.com,Alex Gangitano,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/437063-opposition-to-pacs-puts-2020-democrats-in-a-bind,"Opposition to PACs puts 2020 Democrats in a bind By Alex Gangitano - 04/03/19 06:00 AM EDT
Democratic presidential candidates refusing to take PAC money may be forced to pinch pennies to survive in a crowded primary race where top-tier contenders like Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) Sanders CNN announces string of 2020 town halls Andrew Yang says his campaign raised .7 million in two months Biden controversy splits Dems on generational, political lines MORE (I-Vt.) and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) have the ability to raise tens of millions in small donations.
The pressure to swear off all PAC money is more intense in this Democratic campaign season than ever before, but it will leave more than a dozen candidates scrambling to keep their campaigns afloat.
First-quarter fundraising totals will be released on April 15, and the top-tier campaigns are competing with one another to put out impressive numbers — which tend to attract more money for those who show they can raise it while potentially turning off the spigot for those who can’t. ADVERTISEMENT
Veteran fundraisers say loopholes can be found to bring in more money, but that risks criticism for being too close to interest groups.
“Any Democrat who’s going to say, ‘I’m not going to take PAC money,’ but turns around and takes a check from a CEO that runs a PAC is probably running the risk that somebody’s going to put two and two together. Since all this stuff is a matter of public record, eventually people are going to figure that out,” Ken Kies, managing director of the Federal Policy Group, told The Hill.
The Federal Election Commission quarterly reporting deadline was Sunday. The names of all contributors, including corporate CEOs and other executives, will be made public in mid-April.
Andrew Yang CNN announces string of 2020 town halls Andrew Yang says his campaign raised .7 million in two months 2020 Dems sprint toward critical FEC deadline MORE all have declared they will not accept any PAC money.
“It’s always struck me as a little bit strange that Democrats think PACs are bad when, in many respects, it’s a bunch of small donors getting together to have a little bit more of an impact on what they do,” said Kies, who raised $100,000 for George W. Bush in 2004.
Many White House contenders are distancing themselves from the PAC culture in hopes of displaying their liberal bona fides, and critics of PACs argue that small-dollar donations are a better sign of a candidate’s popularity and longevity.
Many point to 2016, when small-dollar donations skyrocketed for Sanders and President Trump
More recently, Sanders raised an impressive $18.2 million during the first quarter of 2019. ADVERTISEMENT
His campaign said that amount included about 900,000 individual donations with an average contribution size of $20 and that 525,000 individuals donated money to the campaign.
Due to that success, PAC money doesn’t carry the same influence it once did, according to some advocacy groups.
“The whole value of D.C. fundraising has been diminished considerably, both in the era of super PACs and online fundraising,” Stewart Verdery, CEO and founder of Monument Advocacy, told The Hill. “PAC money isn’t nearly as important as it used to be.”
Former President Obama made running against K Street and rejecting corporate money a centerpiece of his 2008 campaign. Four years later he persuaded the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to restrict donations from lobbyists.
But the DNC rolled back those restrictions in 2016, allowing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton Trump: 'Make America Great Again' slogan 'was made up by me' Overnight Health Care: Dem senators offer 'Medicare X' bill | McConnell tells Trump Senate won't take up ObamaCare repeal | Insulin makers to testify | Scalise moves to force vote on abortion bill Long-shot goal of nixing Electoral College picks up steam MORE to raise $1.2 billion from super PACs alone in her failed White House bid.
Corporate PACs are funded by employees of a company and the business’s lobbyists, a PAC designee or a PAC board that decides which candidates receive the money.
When corporate PACs are shunned by White House hopefuls, it’s not uncommon for a candidate to still seek money from the company’s executives. As a workaround, the candidate often asks the business’s in-house lobbyists to get a personal check from executives at the firm.
Candidates can also pick and choose which companies they want to accept checks from, as opposed to swearing off all companies. The National Rifle Association and tobacco companies have long been disavowed by Democrats, and this year oil companies are likely to be relegated to the sidelines as more candidates focus on environmental issues.
“You’re not forced to take a particular corporate PAC check. You can be selective based on factors such as employees in districts or investments in community,” said Bert Gómez, senior corporate and government relations director at Becker who launched a corporate PAC in 2007. “There are members that do not take checks from certain industries. Just because you take from one corporation doesn’t mean you have to take from all.”
Catherine McDaniel, president of the National Association of Business Political Action Committees, calls employee-funded PACs the “most transparent money in politics” and one that lets “many working Americans engage in the political process.”
“Employee-funded PACs tend to be largely nonpartisan and encourage participation in the political process,” McDaniel told The Hill. “They educate their members about legislation that affects their industry.”
She said disavowing that kind of PAC money sends a negative message to workers.
“When candidates say they won’t accept employee-funded PAC money, many who contribute to employee-funded PACs hear, ‘Your voice is invalid because of where you work,’ ” she said.
Candidates who reject PAC money also run the risk of alienating groups looking to advance progressive policies.
Michael McBride, a pastor in Oakland, Calif., who started the Black Church PAC in 2017, said his group donates to candidates who focus on urban gun violence prevention, environmental issues, ending mass incarceration and addressing voter suppression.
He views the PAC as a means of engagement for his community.
“I think it would be a mistake to walk away from these newly structured containers unless you have a better option or better vision of how to get these resources to the ground,” McBride told The Hill.
“There has to be this conversation among progressives and the Democratic Party. What does it mean to actively invest in the leadership of black women, black folks, black religious institutions that can help the party actually meet this kind of challenge of enthusiasm and turnout? And unless we have containers that specialize in that, then we’re just leaving it up to a lot of folks to do the work who have historically failed,” he added.
Lobbyists predict that some candidates may change their tune on PACs as the election progresses and as competition intensifies for campaign contributions.
“By the summer, people are going to be looking at these campaigns and deciding, ‘Do they have the ability to finance a vigorous, long primary campaign with the organization in the early states that matter?’ ” said Kevin Kelly, co-leader of Clark Hill’s government and public affairs practice.
Fundraising numbers in the coming months will be pivotal, he said, and that’s when some candidates might revise their initial positions on PACs.
“For the candidates who don’t have broad-based grass-roots appeal where they can raise millions of dollars online in small-dollar amounts in relatively quick periods of time, like Sen. Sanders has obviously demonstrated, I think these candidates will have to ask themselves, ‘Will the small-dollar donors come back?’ ” Kelly said. “They will then need to reevaluate whether they want to tap political action contributions.”

Liberals infuriated by pro-incumbent House Dem policy,thehill.com,Reid Wilson,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/437048-liberals-infuriated-by-pro-incumbent-house-dem-policy,"Liberals infuriated by pro-incumbent House Dem policy By Reid Wilson - 04/03/19 06:00 AM EDT
House Democratic leaders are defending a new policy that will exclude consultants who work for upstart challengers to Democratic incumbents from also receiving lucrative contracts from the party’s campaign arm, a move liberals are criticizing as an effort to rein in the rising energy of the progressive left.
The policy, laid out last week, requires consultants and strategists to pledge not to work for any candidate challenging a sitting Democratic member of Congress in order to be added to a list of approved vendors eligible to work for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). ADVERTISEMENT
Liberal groups and members of Congress — including several who beat sitting incumbents to win their seats — have objected to what they deem a “blacklist.”
Cheryl (Cheri) Lea Bustos Progressives hammer DCCC over blacklist targeting primary challenges New Mexico Dems brace for crowded race to succeed Udall Washington Republicans are still attacking your health care MORE and her people have made an effort the last few months to reach out to progressives, and this was an unforced error that had the net effect of likely losing the DCCC a lot of money, and potentially sidelining talent that could help flip red seats blue,” said Adam Green, who heads the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee.
Within hours of the new policy’s announcement, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Hakeem Sekou Jeffries Carole King lobbies lawmakers in support of bill to protect the Rockies John Legend, Jerome Powell to speak at House Dems' retreat Democrats face balancing act with Mueller report demands MORE (D-N.Y.) defended the change on Tuesday, saying the party was still seeking to embrace different perspectives.
“But at the end of the day, the reality is the DCCC has a singular mission, which is to protect and preserve the majority,” said Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
Veterans of the DCCC say the policy is not really new. Instead, according to half a dozen former senior officials, it just puts into writing what was once an unwritten rule, that political professionals avoid intramural battles when scant resources are better spent fighting Republicans.
“Keeping the House requires the DCCC to focus on shoring up incumbents and challenging Republicans in red and purple districts, not battling in blue districts,” said one former top DCCC official, who asked for anonymity in order to describe internal debates. “It’s extremely difficult to keep that focus if the committee is constantly being pulled into Dem-on-Dem battles.”
In practice, most consultants who do significant business with the DCCC have been loath to get involved in a race against a sitting member of Congress. Any challenger faces long odds, and taking on an incumbent can be bad for business.
In 2018, only one major Democratic consultant, the polling firm Lake Research Partners, worked for Ocasio-Cortez, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Only two vendors who worked for Pressley — Alabama-based pollster Anzalone Liszt Grove Research and The Campaign Group, a Pennsylvania firm — also worked for the DCCC.
But the policy is having an impact on the thinking of some candidates who are considering their own insurgent bids.
Marie Newman, a Democratic activist who came within 2,100 votes of knocking off Rep. Daniel Lipinski Daniel William Lipinski Dems seek to stifle primary challenges to incumbents Manchin says he won't support LGBTQ protection bill as written 5 House Dems likely to attract primary challengers MORE (D-Ill.) in 2018, said the DCCC’s stand was influencing her as she considers whether to take another run at the Chicago Democrat.
“We are weighing that right now. It’s a consideration, I’m not going to lie. If the [DCCC] is going to move in this direction, I’m not going to lie, it’s concerning to me. So that’s one of the final decision points,” Newman told The Hill. “When you’re going to those lengths to ensure that incumbents, no matter who they are, stay in office, that feels like overreach. The policy feels like overreach to me, because it doesn’t feel like it’s entirely democratic, small d.”
Green said the new policy would cost House Democrats money from energized small-dollar donors who respond to solicitations from Ocasio-Cortez and other freshman members. Ocasio-Cortez asked her supporters to “pause” their donations to the DCCC and give instead to endangered Democrats — a solicitation that earned several members a combined $90,000 in the space of just a few hours.
Green had been in discussions with the DCCC about setting up a new fund into which Ocasio-Cortez and others could raise money for like-minded candidates. Those discussions are now on hold.
“The attempt to have a synergy of efforts just got a lot harder,” he said.
Katherine Marlea Clark Bipartisan group introduces legislation to protect federal workers' health benefits during shutdowns Dem lawmaker calls for DeVos to resign, cites use of 'racist research' Chances of passing Dem budget are '50-50,' says chairman MORE (D-Mass.), the vice chair of the caucus, said Democrats’ ambitious legislative agenda — including efforts to bolster voting protections — hinges on their success maintaining the gavel.
“I’ve heard concerns, and we take those seriously, and I know there are ongoing meetings with concerned parties and DCCC,” Clark said. “But the focus of this caucus is not on political consultants. It is on our ability to protect the vote.”
Clark pointed to the recent passage of H.R. 1, the Democrats’ sweeping government reform bill, as an example of what’s at stake.
“[It] starts with protecting the vote and getting Congress to be working, not for special interests, not to be beholden to dark money and influence in our campaigns, but to have the American voter wield the power at the ballot box,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT

In addition, Leiter pointed to elements of the preferred vendor application that would promote minority- and women-owned businesses. The DCCC policy says the committee will only work with vendors that are either partly owned by underrepresented groups or that have demonstrated “a sustained commitment to promoting diversity.”
“Our voters are diverse, we are actively recruiting candidates to ensure their elected officials better reflect them, and we have a responsibility to do our best to ensure the political professionals we work with do so as well,” DCCC Executive Director Allison Jaslow said in an email.

GOP to go 'nuclear' with rules change for Trump nominations,thehill.com,Jordain Carney,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/437053-gop-to-go-nuclear-with-rules-change-for-trump-nominations,"GOP to go 'nuclear' with rules change for Trump nominations By Jordain Carney - 04/03/19 06:00 AM EDT
Senate Republicans are planning to go “nuclear” on Wednesday with a rules change for hundreds of nominations, escalating a war with Democrats over President Trump ADVERTISEMENT
“If we don’t stop this behavior now, it will become the norm,” he told reporters.
Nominations currently face up to an additional 30 hours of debate after they’ve overcome an initial hurdle showing they have the support to get confirmed. Under the GOP resolution, spearheaded by Sens. James Lankford Roy Dean Blunt GOP to go 'nuclear' with rules change for Trump nominations Bottom line This week: Senate GOP prepares to change rules on Trump nominees MORE (R-Mo.), that would be reduced to two hours for most executive nominees and lower-level district judge nominations.
Supreme Court justices, appeals court judges, Cabinet picks and roughly a dozen boards and commissions would be exempt from the proposed rules change.
The rules change will mark the second time in as many years that Republicans have gone “nuclear” to make it easier to confirm the president’s nominees. GOP senators in April 2017 nixed the 60-vote filibuster for Supreme Court picks, mirroring an action taken by Democrats in 2013 on lower-level judicial picks and executive nominees.
Republicans say they are now at a breaking point with Democrats, whom they’ve accused of slow-walking the president’s nominees.
“Over the past two years, some in this body have decided that they will oppose any nominee suggested by President Trump,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley

“I oppose changing the post-cloture time rule. I certainly oppose breaking the rules of the Senate to do so. The current rules can work for the American people; they simply require us to do the same,” he added in a statement.
Susan Margaret Collins Steve King defends Biden: He's 'just an affectionate guy' GOP triggers 'nuclear option' to speed up Trump picks Graham defends Biden amid allegations: He means nothing bad MORE (R-Maine) voted for the resolution on Tuesday but said she had not yet made a decision about whether she would support using the nuclear option to change the rules.
“I’m very sympathetic to the frustration over the continued obstruction by the Democrats on even noncontroversial nominees. I just don’t understand the rationale for that,” she said.
GOP leaders believe they have the 51 votes needed to force the rules change through over Democratic objections on Wednesday. Republicans held a conference meeting late Tuesday afternoon to discuss the procedural tactics for how they would bring up the change on the floor, and emerged from the closed-door meeting ready to move forward.
Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership team and chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, said ahead of the meeting that Republicans have the votes needed to change the rules.
“It’s a matter of tactics, exactly how you do it,” he said. “But we’re good. We will get most of this done.”
McConnell has teed up two nominations for a procedural vote as soon as Wednesday — one on a district judge, the other a lower-level executive nominee — which would set the stage for Republicans to bring the nuclear option to the floor.
Republicans have made public appeals to the several Democratic presidential candidates, warning that GOP retribution could make it impossible for them to staff a future Democratic administration.
“Just imagine if Democrats’ behavior over the past two years becomes the norm. Presidents could be waiting years to adequately staff their administrations and the Senate would be perpetually tied up on unnecessary cloture votes, leaving less and less time to actually do the business of governing,” said Sen. John Thune John Randolph Thune Hillicon Valley — Presented by CTIA and America's wireless industry — House panel approves bill restoring net neutrality | FTC asks for more help to police tech | Senate panel advances bill targeting illegal robocalls Cruz: 'Devastating' if Trump closes U.S.-Mexico border Senate panel advances bill penalizing illegal robocalls MORE (S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican.
GOP sponsors of the resolution reached out to Democratic senators to see if they could strike a deal, but those talks failed to gain significant momentum.
McConnell added that while there had been some interest among rank-and-file Democratic senators, he and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis Schumer Schumer responds to Biden allegation: 'Voters will weigh the pros and cons' 'Dog-with-a-bone' mentality won't help Democrats in 2020 Senate Dems press White House for update on Puerto Rico recovery response MORE (D-N.Y.) talked last week and couldn’t reach an agreement.
Sources familiar with the negotiations told The Hill last week that Democrats have tried to negotiate a deal with McConnell, with suggested changes such as postponing the rules change until 2021, applying it only to executive nominees or restoring the “blue slip” for circuit court picks.
Democrats argue that Republicans cannot simultaneously complain about the pace of confirmations while setting a record for the number of appeals court judges confirmed during a president’s first two years.
“Why change the rules for lifetime appointments and give only two hours of debate? This change is not just unnecessary, it would allow fundamentally unqualified candidates from judges to administration officials and ambassadors to be confirmed,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar"
Voting rights battle shifts to swing state Arizona,thehill.com,Reid Wilson,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/437040-voting-rights-battle-shifts-to-swing-state-arizona,"Voting rights battle shifts to swing state Arizona By Reid Wilson - 04/03/19 06:00 AM EDT
PHOENIX — A poorly handled presidential primary election and a hotly contested U.S. Senate race have kicked off a bitter battle over voting rights in an increasingly competitive state.
Republicans who control the state legislature have introduced a handful of measures to tighten election rules they say are routinely exploited, with the goal of streamlining procedures across Arizona’s 15 counties.
Democrats counter that the new rules amount to an assault on voting access, especially for minorities and the poor — voters who tend to back Democratic candidates. ADVERTISEMENT
Among the most contentious measures is a bill that would outlaw paying someone based on the number of voters they register. Those who register voters could still be paid, but only on an hourly or salaried basis. That measure passed the state House in March on a party-line vote.
The state Senate is considering another controversial measure that would require anyone who receives a ballot by mail to return it through the Postal Service, rather than dropping it off at voting centers.
The ability to drop off mail ballots can lead to ballot-harvesting, said the bill’s lead sponsor, state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita (R).
Ugenti-Rita has also sponsored legislation to remove voters from the permanent vote by mail list if those voters do not cast a ballot for four straight years. Those voters would still be registered, but they would not receive their ballots in the mail.
Another of her bills would limit early voting at so-called emergency centers three days before an election.
A third bill, signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey (R), will require voters to show the same forms of identification at early voting sites as they would at the polling place on Election Day.
Ugenti-Rita, serving her first term in the Senate after four terms in the state House, said the measures are meant to boost confidence in Arizona’s election system. ADVERTISEMENT
“We want to make sure we have an environment that breeds confidence and transparence,” Ugenti-Rita told The Hill. “If your foundation is weak and riddled with cracks and holes then what you build on top of it is going to be at risk.”
Democrats say the measures amount to a last-minute attempt by Republicans to keep the state in the GOP column ahead of the 2020 elections after four Democrats won statewide offices in the 2018 midterms.
“Our mission here this year is to make sure we protect democracy,” said state Rep. Raquel Teran (D), a member of the House Elections Committee. “This is not the first time we’ve seen these roadblocks.”
Voters in both parties were irate when Maricopa County, one of the nation’s largest and fastest-growing metropolitan areas, cut the number of polling places in the 2016 presidential primary from 200 to about 60, causing long lines. The county’s chief elections official, Helen Purcell, lost her reelection bid later that year.
Two years later, more than 60 precincts in Maricopa County did not open on time because equipment meant to check voters in had not been properly set up. Purcell’s successor, Adrian Fontes, blamed an IT contractor.
In November, it took days to count ballots in the tight race for a U.S. Senate seat between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSally Giffords looms large in Arizona's Senate showdown Gallego won't seek Ariz. Senate seat, clearing Dem path for Kelly Arpaio's wife recovering after rattlesnake bite in Arizona MORE . McSally led on Election Day, but Sinema closed the gap and won by a substantial margin.
The difficulties in handling so many new voters has bred distrust in the integrity of elections at exactly the moment Arizona is becoming a battleground state. President Trump William (Bill) Jefferson Clinton Deceptions may sink plans to drill for oil in the Arctic Refuge Trump's noble moment: Waiving executive privilege on Mueller's report Democratic candidates: 'It's Trump, stupid!' MORE carried Arizona by 2 points in 1996.
“The goal with my bills is to increase confidence for all voters, as both sides have diminished trust in the system,” said state Rep. Kelly Townsend (R), the author of several voting bills in the House. “It has been a good year, so far, advancing the integrity of the voting process and hopefully increasing the confidence of our voters.”
Democrats see the growing influence of Hispanic voters, along with younger voters moving into the state in search of technology jobs, as a critical building block on their path to winning the state. It is those voters, they say, who are being targeted by the GOP bills.
“There’s always a backlash when underrepresented constituencies flex their muscle at the ballot box,” said state Rep. Athena Salman (D), the House minority whip. “Let’s just say there’s a reason why Arizona was included in the original version of the Voting Rights Act.”
Arizona was one of 16 states that no longer has to comply with restrictions under the Voting Rights Act, a section of which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down.
It is also one of 10 states with a so-called strict voter identification law. Voters must show either a state- or tribal-issued identification card, federal identification or items like a recent utility bill or bank statement to prove their identity. If they do not have identification, they must prove their identity after voting by provisional ballot. States with less strict voter identification laws allow some voters to cast ballots after signing an affidavit attesting to their identity."

My stepdaughter visits her mother for a week or a weekend from time to time, and I understand that these visits are important to her, but I struggle with how to talk to her about them. When she talks to me about going to see her mother, she will say things like “My mom lets me eat candy for dinner” or “Sometimes I stay up all night at my mommy’s house—she lets me.” For the most part she is not saying this to try to manipulate me; I think by now she realizes that rules are different in different houses. I guess she is just expressing excitement about going to see her mother. I suppose the best strategy overall is to talk to her about why certain choices are better than others, but in the moment, I struggle with what to say. I don’t want to quash the excitement that she has about seeing her mother, and I don’t want to say negative things about her mother, but I also don’t want to imply that I agree with these choices. Mostly, so far, I have tried to sound as noncommittal as possible, letting her know that I heard her but not agreeing. What is the best thing to say in these moments? —Not an Evil Stepmother Dear NaES, I can see how this is a tricky situation for you, and it may help to draw a distinction here. You know that it’s not good to communicate your judgment about her mother’s choices, but I would also point out that your judgments about her mother’s choices actually don’t matter at all . A general rule with all two-house co-parenting situations is: Unless it’s abuse or neglect you’re worried about, what the other household does is none of your business. I realize that may sound counterintuitive, but this is hard-earned wisdom for most divorced families. This works because these are boundaries, and boundaries are key to the health of a child caught in the middle. There is no need to say anything negative here. There is no need to even feel anything negative. Of course, I don’t advocate feeding your kid candy until the break of dawn, but I also don’t think that it’s abuse or neglect if that’s happening once in a while. I might also point out that you say your kid is not sharing this to manipulate you, but I’m not sure how it is that you know that. Kids are wonderfully complicated people with all kinds of plans and schemes and experiments happening in their curious and rapidly developing minds. “Candy for dinner” might mean a candy bar at 6 p.m. after a 4 p.m. taco lunch, which may feel wildly decadent to your kid. “Up all night” may mean a movie and a pajama dance party that ends at midnight, which might as well be Burning Man to her. I mean. She’s 8. She may even be exaggerating these things in an attempt to get you to loosen up the reins a bit. It could even be that this is all happening exactly as you imagine it and it’s because her mother just wants to make her happy. None of this requires your intervention, nor your opinion. You say you want your kid to know that you don’t approve of this stuff, but she already does because you don’t do this stuff at your house. That’s really all you need to say about it. Remember that this is a long-term situation and there will be plenty of time for your kid to figure out everything there is to know about how different parents can love her deeply and in totally different ways. There is no need to say anything negative here. There is no need to even feel anything negative. Your child is connecting with her mother and is happy about it. That’s all you need to care about.

I’ll even grit my teeth and present it as objectively as possible. On the rare occasions that we hire a babysitter, we sometimes end up coming home early. I think we should pay her for the time that I hired her for, and my husband thinks we should pay her for the time she worked. In the most recent case, we were supposed to have a class from 6 to 9, but got home at 8:30, so he wanted to give her $50 and I wanted to give her $60. What say you? And is there a way to compromise upfront? —Counting the Hours"

Let’s be clear about what “whataboutism” means,conservatibbs.com,Scott Tibbs,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://conservatibbs.com/2019/04/03/lets-be-clear-about-what-whataboutism-means/,"Let’s be clear about what “whataboutism” means
Since I was accused of “whataboutism” in the comments for my letter to the editor, it is useful to examine what “whataboutism” actually is. My letter was not whataboutism.
Whataboutism is an attempt to justify an action by someone you support by pointing to a political opponent who did the same thing. The point is to sidetrack the discussion by charging hypocrisy instead of addressing the argument. I was not defending Donald Trump’s national emergency. I was opposed to it and argued in favor of Congress voting to nullify it. Therefore, I could not have been engaged in whataboutism.
What I was doing is anticipating an argument that conservatives were likely to use against my letter: In terms of the policy itself, it does not matter that the Democrats did not stand up to executive overreach by Barack Obama. What Trump did is either right or wrong on its own merits, and if it is wrong then it should be stopped. We have to start limiting executive overreach somewhere.
And yes, even though I agree with the Democrats on this particular policy, it does matter that they are driven by partisanship instead of principle. We need political leaders who we can trust to act on principle and not only on political expediency. No one should be fooled: The Democrats will not oppose executive overreach by the next Democratic president. Unfortunately, it appears that many of the Republicans who railed against executive overreach from 2009 to 2016 were also motivated by partisanship over principle.
Both parties need to do better. Share this:"

But limited output and we are planning to control 10 numbers of stepper motor. Not related to half bridge driver and it's function. What is ""10k -100khz""? Is it the pulse frequency that determines the motor RPM? (Dynamic 1:10 only?). Or is it the PWM frequency to control the motor current? I need just a stepper driver ic that generate motor switching sequence with at list 1/32 microstepping and control switching speed with single pulse input pin. Direction control also need. 1/32 microstepping is useful information. But what microstepping scheme? Triangle, trapezoid, sine? Voltage (PWM) controlled or current controlled? I ask myself why you choose a halfbridge driver only... If you want control a stepper motor, why don't you choose a dedicated stepper driver that includes the microstepping feature? Like TB6600 or DRV8825. Just do a search, there are many others. Klaus Please don´t contact me via PM, because there is no time to respond to them. No friend requests. Thank you."
Chicago Elects First Gay Black Woman Mayor | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/chicago-elects-first-gay-black-woman-mayor,"0 SHARES
Former federal prosecutor and political neophyte Lori Lightfoot made Chicago history Tuesday night when she won a runoff nonpartisan election to become Chicago's first black woman, and first openly-gay candidate, ever elected mayor. Winning with a staggering 74% of the vote after parlaying her leadership of a task force on police killings, Lightfoot's outsider status gave her a huge edge over her opponent, Toni Preckwinkle, the head of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and a former boss of the city's Democratic Party, who was also a black woman.
After Mayor Rahm Emmanuel declared he would not seek reelection in September as the city's precarious finances and the appearance of a coverup of police misconduct tainted his image, 14 candidates vied for the position during a non-partisan election, which led to Tuesday's runoff after none of the candidates managed to secure a majority in the first round. Both Preckwinkle and Lightfoot beat out Bill Daley, the brother of Emmanuel's predecessor, Richard Daley, and a member of a Chicago political dynasty, a sign that voters were fed up with the city's political class and its reputation for self-dealing.
Lori Lightfoot
Lightfoot triumphed despite being outraised by Preckwinkle, who touted her status as a political ""boss"" during her campaign, with Lightfoot starting the runoff with just $731,000 on hand, compared with Preckwinkle's $3.9 million. In addition to securing the support of the city's powerful unions, Preckwinkle also won the endorsement of Chance the Rapper, one of the city's most prominent figures in the entertainment industry, according to Politico.
But in addition to her ""insider"" status, Preckwinkle also suffered from her association with longtime city Alderman Ed Burke , who was recently arrested on corruption charges.
When she is sworn in next month, Lightfoot will become Chicago’s second female mayor after Jane Byrne, who served one term from 1979 to 1983, and its third black mayor after Harold Washington, who was elected to succeed Byrne in 1983, and Eugene Sawyer, who became acting mayor when Washington died in 1987.
""She had the right message at the right time,"" said Jason McGrath, a pollster and senior adviser to Lightfoot’s campaign. ""We knew for months we had something special and just needed the right circumstance to evolve for us to get to a point where people were ready to listen to the message. At the end of the day, from every neighborhood from Beverly Park to Uptown, people wanted something different.""
Lightfoot, age 56, was an assistant US attorney before entering private practice. Despite her lack of political experience, she was endorsed by the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune newspapers, as well as Congressmen Jesus “Chuy” Garcia and Robin Kelly, as her ""reformer"" campaign picked up traction. She ran on a promise to drive out corruption from city hall, and to invest more resources in the western and southern ends of the city, NBC News reported.
Unsurprisingly in a city where the Republican Party has essentially ceased to exist, all 14 of the candidates who ran alongside Lightfoot in the runoff were associated with the Democratic Party to varying degrees.
During her victory speech, Lightfoot extended an olive branch to her defeated rival.
""In this election Toni and I were competitors, but our differences are nothing compared to what we can achieve together,"" Lightfoot said. ""Now that it’s over, I know we will work together for the city that we both love.""
""Today, you did more than make history,"" Lightfoot said. ""You created a movement for change.""
She also spoke of a ""city reborn"" and said her victory showed a city where ""it doesn’t matter what color you are, where it sure doesn’t matter how tall you are, and where it doesn’t matter who you love.""
