Movie review: ‘Shazam!’ is a lightning blast of fun,www.providencejournal.com,Dana Barbuto More Content Now,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainment/20190402/movie-review-shazam-is-lightning-blast-of-fun,"Movie review: ‘Shazam!’ is a lightning blast of fun Dana Barbuto More Content Now Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 4:27 PM Apr 2, 2019 at 4:27 PM
“Shazam!” - about a teenager who transforms into a superhero - is equal parts “Big” and “Goonies” wrapped in a whole lot of fun. It’s truly a riot, which is a shocker considering the movie is from the DC Extended Universe, the outfit behind superhero duds “Suicide Squad,”“Batman v. Superman,”“Man of Steel,”“Aquaman,” etc. For once, the brooding and stiff acting - DC’s kryptonite - are placed on leave.For this is the tale of Billy Batson (Asher Angel), a 14-year-old orphan who joyously discovers that simply saying “Shazam!” immediately transforms his lilt body into a hulking superhero in the form of Zachary Levi. In a snap, Billy converts a giant chip on his shoulders into a spandex-clad caped crusader blessed with super strength, hyper speed, flight and the ability to shoot lightning bolts from his fingers. Levi plays him like the overgrown kid his character is. Like Tom Hanks in “Big,” Levy convincingly projects childlike energy and awe that imbues the movie with irresistible charm. In one sequence, there’s even a nod to Penny Marshall’s classic, with Levi deftly using his feet to bounce across the keyboard of a floor piano, pounding out a melodic tune in a toy store. Sound familiar?Going by the aliases The Red Cyclone and Captain Sparkle Fingers, among others, Billy’s true identity is his friendship with Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), a physically impaired, fast-talking foster kid with a comic-book obsession and an even more serious problem with school bullies. They are “brothers” in the home they share with their foster parents, Rosa and Victor Vasquez (Marta Milans, Cooper Andrews), and four other orphans (Mary Bromfield, Faithe Herman, Ian Chen and Jovan Armand). But it’s Grazer’s Freddy who flat steals the movie with his charm and sincerity.His scenes opposite Levi are a riot, especially the various Superpower Test challenges they create. The boys also use Billy’s newfound zapping abilities to grab a wad of cash from an ATM and empty the contents of a Dr. Pepper machine. Levi is fish-out-of-water funny getting to know his muscles, taking selfies with fans, and figuring out what he can get away with, like skipping school or accidentally ducking into a gentlemen’s club. Together, Grazer (“It”) and Levi (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) are comedy gold, especially in a scene when they visit a real estate agent while in search of a proper lair.Sometimes the movie strains credulity and defies the laws of physics, but a supporting cast of young actors who look and act like real kids helps elevate the material. Director David F. Sandberg (“Annabelle: Creation”), working from a script by Henry Gayden (“Earth to Echo”), turns tropes upside down to deliver a message of self-empowerment and what it means to have a family.The movie stumbles a bit with its set up and exposition. In the prologue, we meet an ancient wizard (Djimon Hounsou) holed up in an alternate cave world. He’s seeking a True Champion who is of “pure heart” and “strong spirit” to protect the realms from the seven deadly sins. He’s been unable to find one, until decades later when Billy unwittingly shows he is different by defending Freddie against a pair of schoolyard bullies. Hounsou spews a lot of dialogue about sins, realms, wrath, and duty. Stone sculptures suddenly come to life as hideous creatures. But when the wizard commands Billy to “put your hands on my staff,” Billy counters with “Gross!,” a reply that is typical of the movie’s humor.To be successful, superhero movies need a good villain, and while Strong’s Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, is no Thanos from the “Avengers,” he’s still formidable and bent on destroying the world. The British actor, with his deep, velvety voice, is no stranger to being the baddie (“Kick-Ass,”“Stardust,”“Green Lantern” and Robert Downey Jr.’s “Sherlock Holmes”), and he and Levi take to the sky for a climatic battle at a winter carnival, where our hero has to quickly master his power. That’s the easy part, it’s this “adulting” thing that’s the challenge.

Army Rolls Out Missile Defense Framework To Counter Hypersonic Missile Attacks,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-03-28/army-rolls-out-missile-defense-framework-counter-hypersonic-missile-attacks,"In response to Russian and Chinese war threats, the U.S. Army debuted its new Air and Missile Defense framework, or AMD, on March 27 that will pursue multimission units and counter hypersonic missile or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks, the Army’s Space and Missile Defense Commander told Defense News in an interview during the Association of the U.S. Army’s Global Force Symposium.
Lt. Gen. James Dickinson said AMD would provide synchronized efforts to execute multi-domain operations, defend the country for emerging threats and succeed in future operational environments.
Top objectives of the new strategy include ensuring AMD forces can protect ground forces and defend critical assets on the modern battlefield and in the homeland. AMD forces are designed to help “create windows of superiority” in the air, so those infantry units have the ability to commandeer enemy territory successfully, Defense News said.
AMD forces align with the Army’s 2028 goal of modernized forces executing multidomain operations.
“Our vision is that the AMD force of 2028 will provide the combatant commanders with a flexible, agile, and integrated AMD force capable of executing multi-domain operations and defending the homeland, regional joint and coalition forces, and critical assets in support of unified land operations,” said Lt. Gen. Dickinson. “To do this, we will execute four lines of effort. We will modernize and develop AMD capabilities; build AMD capacity for multi-domain operations; provide trained and ready AMD forces; and maintain forward presence and build allied and partner capacity.”
AMD also erects the next generation Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense, or LTAMD, sensor as the replacement for the MIM-104 Patriot missile system.
The Army will continue developing Indirect Fire Protection Capability, or IFPC, that provides short-range defense against rockets, artillery, and mortars as well as hypersonic missiles and drones.
The service is also developing Short Range Air Defense, or M-SHORAD, that addresses an important capability gap in the European theater.
AMD is expected to link all of the service's defense and missile systems into an integrated command system.
The strategy is expected to add directed-energy weapon systems to aircraft and ground vehicles to protect ground forces against rocket, artillery, mortar and drone threats.
The Army's last AMD strategy was in 2012, according to Lt. Gen. Dickinson.
In the last five years, the threat of hypersonic missiles and drone attacks have sent American war planners back to the drawing boards.

"Ohio Dentist Says She Will Torture 'Zionist Patients' With 'Pleasure,' Expresses Support for Hamas",tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/ohio-dentist-says-she-will-torture-zionist-patients-with-pleasure-expresses-support-for-hamas/ ,"A Cincinnati, Ohio dentist was recently exposed for suggesting that she would torture “Zionist patients” and repeatedly expressed support for Hamas, a terrorist organization.
According to her LinkedIn page , Nessreen Zayed is a dentist in the Cincinnati area, though it’s unclear where she’s currently employed.
@AnarchoZionist @onetripp I loved the video I will enjoy doing this to Zionists patients with my pleasure 😂😂😂
— Dr Nessreen 𐤍𐤎𐤓𐤉𐤍 (@nzayed07) September 25, 2015
Canary Mission unearthed dozens of controversial statements made on Zayed’s Twitter page, including one in which she said she “will enjoy doing this to Zionist patients” with “pleasure.” The comment was made in a response to a scene from the movie “A Little Shop of Horrors.” In the scene, Steve Martin joyfully sings and dances while torturing his patients in the dentist’s chair.
In several other tweets, Zayed openly praised Hamas and said she “loves” the terrorist organization.
“Sorry we still love Hamas,” she wrote in one tweet. “I love Hamas u [sic] can ask Hamas,” she said in another.

“I know resistance has started before Hamas but right now Hamas is the only one defense the Palestinian that’s a fact we can’t,” she said in yet another tweet with numerous typos and grammatical errors.
She also referred to the “funeral of the 17 martyrs killed by Israel last month” as a “heartbreaking” display. Zayed was referencing a funeral for Hamas terrorists who were killed while committing terrorist attacks. In fact, in one tweet she said it was her “dream” for Hamas to “stab all Zionists,” saying she couldn’t “care less.”
Zayed rejoiced when Khader Adnan, a high-ranking member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organization, was “finally free” after serving time in an Israeli prison.

She also praised neo-Nazi Patrick Little, who was a candidate for the U.S. Senate but was expelled from the California GOP convention for his anti-Semitic views.

“Patrick Little expelled from GOP 2018 convention for refusing to serve Israel,” Zayed wrote in a tweet, and linked to a video of Little standing on an Israeli flag and saying he will “not serve a foreign government.”
According to Canary Mission , Little allegedly called for a “country free of Jews,” promised legislation that would impose the “death penalty for any politician introducing a bill that would lead to foreign aid to Israel,” praised Hitler’s autobiography, and denied the Holocaust.
In other tweets, Zayed has said that a “world without Zionists” is a “better world,” and claimed that the world would “live in peace” if “we get rid of your Israel.”
@AnarchoZionist @onetripp u know what I feel I'm sick in the stomach I want to throw up sure the world without Zionists is better world 😊
— Dr Nessreen 𐤍𐤎𐤓𐤉𐤍 (@nzayed07) September 25, 2015
On her Twitter bio , Zayed describes herself as a “Palestinian dentist,” “proud Muslim,” and “temporarily in the exile [sic]” in the United States.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center called on the Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Educational Center to remove the Holocaust victim’s name from its organization after it invited an alleged anti-Jewish conspiracy theorist who loathes Israel to speak at its conference on antisemitism.The latest antisemitism scandal at the center is roiling Frankfurt’s city government. Frankfurt’s deputy mayor and city treasurer, Uwe Becker, told The Jerusalem Post the center should disinvite the alleged antisemite Daniel Bax.Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Wiesenthal Center, directed his criticism on Monday to the management of the Anne Frank Educational Center.“How dare you!” Cooper said in a statement to the Post. “Anne Frank is not a brand to be marketed. She was a Jewish girl [from Frankfurt] who was murdered by Nazi Germany for the crime of being a Jew, and because no country, including the US, would admit the Frank family and millions of other European Jews.“Yes, people have the right to speak their minds, but debasing Anne’s memory to abet efforts to delegitimize and eliminate the Jewish state, in Germany no less, is beyond the pale. Remove Anne’s name from this Center and have the guts to openly promote your animus towards the democratic State of Israel,” Cooper said, adding, ”Don’t degrade her memory to push the big lie that Israelis are today’s Nazis. This isn’t only about a disinvite but the loss of a moral compass by a German institution that carries her name. There are estimates that 150 million Europeans equate Israel’s treatment of Palestinians with how Nazi Germany treated the Jews. Any institution using her holy name must fight this big lie, not promote it.”Cooper told the Post that the center’s controversial director Dr. Meron Mendel should “disinvite” Bax. The Anne Frank Center faced international criticism last month for comparing German Jews who were stripped of their citizenship during the Holocaust with German Islamic State terrorists who face the loss of their citizenship.The Anne Frank Center wrote in a tweet to a Post press query at the time: “No, we did not compare or equate Jewish Holocaust victims to ISIS terrorists. And we made that very clear after some misinterpreted our tweet in that way. In no way did we defend jihadists. This is simply not true.”Becker, the deputy mayor, who takes the job of combating modern antisemitism extremely seriously, told the Post: “Unfortunately, when choosing a referee, Daniel Bax did not prove a lucky hand. Therefore, I would like the Anne Frank Educational Center to disinvite Mr. Bax.” Becker said Bax is not a neutral speaker.Eva Berendsen, a spokeswoman for the center, wrote the Post: “We have not invited Mr. Bax despite, but exactly because of his anything but neutral attitude. There are three other panelists who will be critical of his positions on Israel. We are not aware of any statements or actions by Mr. Bax that would support the allegation of antisemitism.”She said the panel where Bax is slated to speak on April 11 is titled: “On the subject of antisemitism, Israel and the Middle East conflict as disputes of the German Left.”Journalists and antisemitism experts in Germany have compared Bax to a far-right extremist from the Alternative for Germany party, the neo-Nazi Udo Voigt and antisemites from Iran’s mullah regime.Bax, a former journalist for the left-wing paper Die Tageszeitung, commonly referred to as taz, frequently attacked American and German Jews – and the State of Israel – in his commentaries. He wrote in 2017 that the American Jewish Committee “acts entirely in line with Israel’s government.” He also wrote that “Germany’s Central Council of Jews has made itself into a one-sided mouthpiece for the interests of Israel’s government.”The head of the Berlin office of the American Jewish Committee, Deidre Berger, told the Post in 2017 Bax’s “singling out AJC as an alleged puppet master of Berlin politics reproduces anti-American prejudices. The assertion by Daniel Bax that AJC and other Jewish interest groups [the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Central Council of Jews] are an instrument of the Israeli government reflects the stereotype of the ‘wandering Jew’ with dual loyalties. Given previous articles attributing widely exaggerated powers to AJC and other Jewish organizations, it is long overdue that Daniel Bax and the editors of the taz newspaper take responsibility for publishing such age-old antisemitic canards.”Bax has written articles sympathetic to the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign targeting Israel. Journalist Björn Stritzel, who has written extensively on German antisemitism for the top-selling German paper Bild, tweeted in March: “With an event on antisemitism from the right one would also not get Udo Voigt on the podium.” Voigt is member of the European parliament for the German neo-Nazi party National Democratic Party. Voigt praised US and EU-classified terrorist entity Hezbollah in Beirut.Volker Beck, a German Green Party politician and lecturer at the Center for Studies in Religious Sciences at the Ruhr University in Bochum, defended the center’s invitation of Bax.Beck, however, compared Bax, in a tweet, to the Iranian Ayatollahs and the far-right German politician Alexander Gauland from the Alternative for Germany party.Gauland termed the Nazi era a “speck of bird poop” in German history and praised the German Wehrmacht soldiers for their role in WWII.When pressed by the Post, if he would appear at a podium discussion with the neo-Nazi Udo Voigt, Beck declined to comment. Dr. Matthias Küntzel, widely considered one of the world’s leading experts on German antisemitism, told the Post in 2017, “Bax uses the antisemitic prejudice concerning the Jewish string puller who is in the position to impose his will on leading politicians. Bax’s call to no longer cave in to Jews strengthens the desire to ‘emancipate’ oneself from the shadows of the Nazi past and fits the campaign slogan ‘Take heart, Germany’ of the AfD, the first historically revisionist party [expected] to enter the Bundestag.”Sacha Stawski, a Frankfurt-based German Jew who is the chairman of the NGO I like Israel, told the Post that Mendel and the Anne Frank Center are “enemies” of the pro-Israel community. Stawski’s media watchdog website Honestly Concerned, which combats antisemitism in the press, issued a scathing commentary on the work of the Anne Frank Center in March. “And anyone who still has not understood why Bax is a prime example of an anti-Zionist and antisemitic BDS advocate can also google a large number of his texts, especially this plea in favor of BDS,” stated the editorial.The Honestly Concerned article linked to articles about Bax’s alleged antisemitism. The stinging rebuke by Stawski of the Anne Frank Center’s work reveals long-terms observers of antisemitism are tired of the lack of change at an organization embroiled in two wide-ranging scandals within weeks.The Honestly Concerned editorial concluded with a call for personnel changes at the Anne Frank Center: “In remembrance of Anne Frank, it is more than overdue that one puts an end to the activities of the current leadership of the educational establishment. The events of recent times, which unfortunately are not isolated cases, require action by the sponsors and cooperation partners.” Post queries to Mendel asking if he plans to resign as director of the Anne Frank Center were not answered.

While autonomous vehicles slowly edge toward becoming a reality on our roads, autonomous solutions for parking our vehicles are already making great strides in our congested, overcrowded cities.American motorists spend an average of 17 hours per year searching for a place to park their vehicles, costing $345 per driver in wasted time, fuel and emissions, according to a study published by Inrix in June 2017. Since then, the situation has only been getting worse. Tel Aviv-based U-tron, however, is accelerating parking solutions into an increasingly autonomous, cost- and space-efficient, and user-friendly future for residential, commercial and municipal locations.Born out of Unitronics, known for designing automated services for industry warehouses and distribution centers, U-tron’s automated parking solutions enable drivers to simply leave their car in a dedicated parking bay, before a robotic shuttle system retrieves the vehicle and stores it in a suitable place.“The main incentive for a customer to choose an automated solution is because we solve the painful process involved in parking,” U-tron CEO Haim Shani told The Jerusalem Post.“Parking is not considered the most intelligent part of the building, and it consumes a lot of expensive space. If it’s below-grade parking, then it requires a very costly excavation process. If it’s above-grade, it occupies the most expensive, prime location that can be used for retail, for example.”Using automated parking solutions, Shani says, offers developers several benefits. First, a major benefit is that they require approximately one-third of the space of regular car parks, as machines replace space-consuming parking infrastructure. Second, running costs are low due to far fewer operational costs, as, in addition to occupying less land, there is no need for personnel, ventilation or lighting.Finally, the experience is significantly more user-friendly, as drivers can wait for their cars to be retrieved in a welcoming reception room rather than poorly lit and often dangerous car parks.“Most of our sales are in the North American market, and we are a growing company. We started in the Northeastern United States, in New York and New Jersey, and we now have activities in South Carolina, Florida, Boston and Houston,” said Shani.“Each one of these metropolitan areas requires different adaptations for different weather and mentalities. It’s one country, but it’s a large nation.”U-tron has enjoyed an encouraging start to the year, signing four new agreements for the construction of autonomous parking lots in New York worth NIS 67.5 million ($18.6m.). Last year, the company saw its revenues rise to NIS 66.7m., an 8.6% increase compared to 2017.Since March 14, both Unitronics and U-tron have been listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, after a strategic move saw the latter spin off into a subsidiary company.“Right now, we are undergoing a process of adaptation to new technologies coming into the car industries. The last few systems that we sold are already equipped with charging for electric vehicles. After a driver leaves the car in the entry bay, we park it but also charge it,” said Shani.“The second trend that we are developing is to create the interface between the car parks and the new generation of cars. The first phase is to interact with connected cars, and the second phase is autonomous cars.”U-tron is also cooperating with Rolzur, a Petah Tikva-based underground tunnel-building company, to construct an ambitious underground automated parking solution for locations where building upward is unfeasible, such as airports and increasingly high-density cities.Currently working to secure deals with the first customers, Rolzur plans to build vertical tunnels up to 100 meters in depth, enabling automated parking of 50 levels of vehicles.“The solution links to the airport’s schedule. We ask the driver which flight he’ll return on and, for example, bring the car from level-45 to the upper levels before the flight arrives,” said Shani.“We will utilize the ideal time, at nights or between peak flights, to bring the cars which are going to be retrieved in the coming hours up to the levels that are closer to the exits.”

SINGAPORE/ADDIS ABABA - The pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX jet that crashed last month had initially followed Boeing Co's emergency procedures but they still failed to regain control of the plane, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.The crash killed all 157 people on board and led to a global grounding of 737 MAX jets. Boeing had issued guidelines to pilots about shutting off an automated anti-stall system in the wake of a deadly crash in Indonesia less than five months earlier.The Wall Street Journal report, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter, said the pilots had initially shut off the anti-stall system called MCAS that was pushing the airplane's nose down shortly after it took off from Addis Ababa.The pilots then cranked a manual wheel in an attempt to stabilize the plane, the report said, but they eventually decided to restore power to the usual electric trim on their control yokes, likely because the manual attempt didn't achieve the desired results.Returning the electric power reactivated MCAS and allowed it to continue its strong downward commands, the newspaper said.A preliminary report into the crash has not yet been released by Ethiopian investigators.Ethiopia's Ministry of Transport spokesman Musie Yehyies said there were no plans to publish the report on Wednesday. The report is expected within 30 days of the March 10 disaster under international rules governing crash investigations.Boeing did not respond to a request for comment outside regular US working hours.The planemaker said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package to MCAS in the ""coming weeks,"" having previously said it would deliver the fix for US approval by last week.

No simple solution for Gaza,www.jpost.com,MICAH HALPERN,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/No-simple-solution-for-Gaza-585561,"No simple solution for Gaza Re-invading Gaza? Re-occupying Gaza? Not going to happen. Not even in the realm of possibilities. No way. GAZAN PROTESTERS at the border fence on Saturday. (Reuters). (photo credit: REUTERS)
It uncomfortable to say and it is not what most people want to hear. But here it is: There is no simple, easy solution for dealing with Gaza. There is no simple short term solution and right now, in April of 2019, there is no long term solution at all.Carpet bomb Gaza – or the variation on that theme – turn Gaza into a parking lot. These are the two most often repeated, highly unrealistic, mantras of the pro-Israel masses. I think people give voice to these phrases as a coping mechanism rather than as a real suggestion. Anyone who knows anything about Israel knows that neither of these are viable suggestions. They know, certainly by this point, that Israel will not indiscriminately bomb Gaza. What Israel will do – what Israel has been doing – is attacking military sites and targeting military leaders, only those locations and only those people. And the result of that humanitarian decision, a decision that does not involve the irresponsible massive killing of innocents, maintains the status quo. Sometimes the status quo is maintained for a shorter period of time, other times for a longer period, but always and inevitably a new crisis erupts and the routine is played out once again.Re-invading Gaza? Re-occupying Gaza? Not going to happen. Not even in the realm of possibilities. No way.We all know the pattern. Either Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad launches rockets into Israel that breaks the threshold of Israel’s tolerance. Israel counters with a series of attacks targeting arms depots and command and control centers. If the situation becomes more intense, Israel attempts to target Hamas leadership. Targeting, of course, is a military euphemism for assassinating.IDF LEADERSHIP has further plans. Those plans include targeting and kidnapping Hamas’ senior leadership. They also include targeting, kidnapping and arresting mid-level Hamas leadership. The senior leadership of Hamas is in hiding. So it is easier to attack mid-level leaders who are not scared enough to go into hiding, but who are informed and involved enough to provide Israel with vital intel and send shock waves through the ranks. The plans also include heavier bombing as another way of sending a strong message to Hamas.When Israel strikes Hamas targets, the targets are usually obvious and almost always deserted. All Hamas personnel have long-since evacuated and burrowed themselves deep into underground bunkers. In hopes of not injuring innocents, Israel often alerts Gazans to where the IDF is going to strike, affording them the time to find safer places to be.This being a political season, politicians are decrying Israel’s actions calling them minimal and self-defeating. But the reality is that if those same people were prime minister right now, they would be doing exactly as Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing, exactly what they – as politicians and prime minister wannabes – are so vociferously criticizing.Reserved restraint and surgical force is what is needed. Israel is not taking the easy way out, they are taking the smart way in. Israel is knocking out Hamas’ ability to send messages and to launch rockets. Israeli strikes aimed at weapons factories, depots, launch areas, vehicles and motor pools cripples Hamas and throws them off course. It might not be a banner headline response, but Israel is seriously putting a dent and causing chaos in the infrastructure of Hamas.For those who hope to be prime minister, the timing of this latest conflict with Hamas couldn’t be better. And they’re seizing the moment and taking advantage of the situation. It even makes for good campaigning. In an election video, Naftali Bennett from the New Right Party talks to Ismail Haniyeh – the head of Hamas in Gaza – calls the leaders name and, in Arabic, says: “Listen, Haniyeh, I’m not Liberman; I’m new, New Right.” The same video would have worked for any of the potential candidates but that’s the only place it works – on video, not in real life, real time, or in the military or defense arena.Israel’s response to the rockets from Gaza has been very disciplined. Iran and Hamas did not expect a disciplined response. They miscalculated. Iran and Hamas were hoping that rockets shot into central Israel would have stimulated an aggressive Israeli response. They were hoping, actually hoping, that Israel’s response would cause the deaths of many innocent Palestinians.In the warped world in which they exist, the deaths of innocent Palestinians would have been a huge success for Hamas and Iran. It would have woken up the world, via Western media, to what was happening. But rather than seeing rockets launched from Gaza flying into Israel, the media would have told the story of Israel killing innocents. Israel did not let that happen.Instead, Israel acted maturely and with restraint. Kudos to Israel.

One solution to the seemingly endless conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip would be for the Jewish State to recapture the blockaded coastal enclave which it unilaterally pulled out of in 2005.Such a move would entangle Israel in the Gaza morass, with all its heavy costs on the human, political, military and economic levels. In such a grim situation, many Israelis would then likely call for a Gazaexit i.e. quiting the Gaza Strip yet again. Thus, it could be argued, what would be the benefit of another war to seize Gaza if the IDF were only to be pulled back at some future point. Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1956 for a few months. In 1967, Israel again conquered the Gaza Strip governing it under military rule until 1994, when most of the territory was turned over to the newly-created PA. In 2005, Israel left the rest of the Gaza Strip. Israel therefore has already captured and ruled the Gaza Strip twice. The third time is not likely to be a charm.Israel should stay out of the Gaza Strip because another occupation would be too costly, and indeed counterproductive. Yet at the same time Israel has to convince Hamas that it is still considering the military option in order to encourage Hamas to accept a long-term ceasefire. This contradictory strategy may be the best way to prevent a fourth war with Hamas – and all the negative outcomes that would entail. The vast majority of the two million Gazans are struggling to meet their basic needs. Hamas’s corruption, incompetence and poor management have brought the Gaza Strip to the brink of economic collapse and a humanitarian crisis. Yet Hamas seems determined to continue to provoke Israel in violent ways, forcing the latter to continue its air, naval and land siege.One could argue Hamas wants Israel to seize the Gaza Strip. It could then blame Israel for the economic chaos there. Israel should avoid this trap. As Colin Powell cautioned: “You break it, you own it.” The Gaza Strip is broken, and Israel should avoid assuming the responsibility for fixing the enormous mess there.Since March 2018, Hamas has been running a campaign of terrorism, firing rockets and launching incendiary balloons to burn fields and forests inside Israel. Hamas also initiated the so-called Great March of Return. These popular protests alongside the border with Israel are well organized and violent demonstrations in which thousands of Palestinians confront the IDF.The casualties between the two sides in these border clashes are asymmetric. If Israel were to seize the Gaza Strip, its casualties would likely be much higher. Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups are well armed, and have constructed a skein of tunnels for offensive and defensive purposes. A military confrontation with them would likely involve a tough guerrilla war set in a hostile urban environment ill-suited to a mobile, hi-tech army anxious to avoid spilling blood.Hamas’s border skirmishes may lead Israel to reduce its siege on the Gaza Strip. Yet Israel knows that were its blockade to be lifted, Hamas would likely be emboldened to expand its arsenal of long-range rockets. But using those weapons could trigger a war in which Israel retakes the Gaza Strip, topples the Hamas regime, and assassinates its leaders. Ironically Israel’s siege is protecting Hamas from itself.In a “lion shall dwell with the lamb” scenario, Israel might consider lifting its siege if Hamas were to surrender its arsenal. But until the Messiah comes, this will likely not happen. Rockets have been manufactured in and fired from the Gaza Strip since 2001, four years before Israel left it. Even if Israel were to occupy the Gaza Strip, and even if destroyed the rocket stockpiles, new rocket production facilities would likely be built in underground bunkers, just as workshops to manufacture Carlo Gustav submachine guns keep popping up in the West Bank.Israel does not seek to run the Gaza Strip. Nor does it want some other international body there either. The PA will find it difficult to take back the Gaza Strip. Similarly Egypt, the only Arab state that has a border with Gaza, does not want to return to Gaza, which it ruled from 1948 to 1967.Therefore Israel is stuck with Hamas ruling Gaza, for lack of a better choice. Finally, while Israel is busy with its southern front, defense planners recognize that a campaign in Gaza could spill over into a broader war on the northern border too. Israel’s covert battle to prevent Iran from building bases in Syria and upgrading the precision of Hezbollah’s rockets in Lebanon could result in a multi-front war in which the IDF is simultaneously fighting in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Israel wishes to avoid such a scenario.The general elections taking place on Tuesday also mitigate against war breaking out in the immediate future. Israel prefers that a new coalition government be formed before embarking on an ambitious military adventure.Bottom line, notwithstanding the serious security challenge Hamas poses, Israel is unlikely to launch a campaign to retake the Gaza Strip anytime soon.

The San Diego Jewish Academy broke a record and did a mitzvah. The school set a Guinness World Record for the most sandwiches made in under three minutes. The sandwiches went to feed homeless people in its Southern California city.Students, faculty and parents made 868 sandwiches in those 180 seconds, a giant leap from the previous record of 490 and well above the goal of 600. And these weren’t just two pieces of bread with a slice of cheese slapped inside — the sandwiches also included a slice of tomato and a lettuce leaf.The results of Monday’s record-breaking attempt by more than 550 sandwich makers must still be certified by Guinness, which could take up to 12 weeks. But the school is still a winner — the food went to residents of a temporary shelter in San Diego and to others living on the street, according to the Alpha Project, a city organization dedicated to helping the homeless.Representatives from the Alpha Project attended the event and provided education for the participants on the challenges of homelessness in their community.The sandwich-making project was part of the school’s programming on tikkun olam, or repair of the world.

NEW YORK — Polish nationalists protested in New York City against a bill designed to help Holocaust survivors and their descendants reclaim lost property in Poland. Hundreds of people participated in the protest on Sunday in Foley Square and some employed antisemitic rhetoric. One protester held a sign calling to the “stop Holocaust industry,” while others questioned how many Polish Jews were killed during World War II, according to author Molly Crabapple, who posted photos from the event on Twitter. There was a Polish nationalist demostration in Foley Square today that denied any Polish complicity with the Holocaust. One demonstrator waved a dollar bill to taunt Jewish counterprotesters — Molly Crabapple (@mollycrabapple) March 31, 2019 One protestor told Crabapple that the Jews of Warsaw were “mostly killed by other Jews.”They were protesting a law, which President Donald Trump signed last year , called the Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today Act.The measure requires the State Department to report on how certain European countries have progressed in returning wrongfully confiscated or transferred Holocaust-era assets. It does not mention Poland specifically, but Poland is the only European country that has not passed laws to compensate those who lost their property and other assets during World War II.

Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO, Jerusalem Post Group Yaakov Katz, Editor-in-Chief UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later ALGIERS - Algeria's ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday, succumbing to six weeks of largely peaceful mass protests driven by youth and pressure from the powerful army against his 20-year rule. Hundreds took to the streets of the capital after state media announced the 82-year-old's departure, capping a wave of protests demanding the removal of an aging elite seen by many as out of touch with ordinary people and presiding over an economy riven by cronyism. Bouteflika's supporters had sought to stop the dissent by telling Algerians not to return to the dark days in the 90s when some 200,000 were killed in civil war, warning even of a scenario like in Syria, embroiled in an eight-year-long conflict. The protests stand in stark contrast to Algeria's neighbor Libya, where Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in a NATO-backed uprising that took much of 2011 and sent the country into chaos. Only one person was confirmed to have died during the protests, a man around 60 years old who suffered a heart attack, with most rallies peaceful and with protesters cleaning up the streets before going home. Bouteflika announced he was standing down in a one-sentence statement carried by state news agency APS, followed by a letter - his primary means of communication since suffering a stroke in 2013 and disappearing from public view. ""I have taken this step because I am keen to put an end to the current bickering,"" Bouteflika said in the letter. ""I have taken the suitable measures needed for the continuity of the nation's institutions during the interim period."" His departure came after the army chief of staff had dramatically ratcheted up the pressure, demanding immediate action to declare him unfit for office under the constitution. The military had stayed in their barracks during the protests but step by step increased pressure on Bouteflika's camp, first only indirectly in an army magazine saying the military shared the same vision as the people. Then chief of staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah proposed last week to invoke a constitutional clause to remove him. Bouteflika on Monday had said he would quit before the end of his term on April 28 without giving a date. He had also vowed to undertake unspecified measures for the sake of stability, triggering new protests by students demanding a new political system. Salah eventually said it was time to go for the only leader many Algerians have known, some 70 percent of whom are under 30 years old. ""There is no more room to waste time ... We decided clearly ... to stand with the people so all their demands get fulfilled,"" Salah said after a meeting with senior officers, APS said. Hundreds took to the streets in the evening, waving Algerian flags or driving in convoys through the city center, where on Feb. 22 mass protests broke out. ""The army and the people are one"" and ""Game over,"" banners read. Pressure had been building during the day with opposition groups demanding Bouteflika go immediately, while hundreds of students marched through the capital Algiers to demand the replacement of a political system widely seen as incapable of significant reform. ""Bouteflika's decision (to resign by the end of his term) will change nothing,"" Mustapha Bouchachi, a lawyer and protest leader, told Reuters earlier on Tuesday. Bouteflika's resignation will put Abdelkader Bensalah, chairman of the upper house of parliament, in charge as caretaker president for 90 days until elections are held. Bouchachi had suggested Bouteflika's nomination of a caretaker government was a move to perpetuate the current political system. ""What is important to us is that we do not accept the (new caretaker) government. Peaceful protests will continue."" A veteran of Algeria's war for independence, Bouteflika was first elected president in 1999 and established himself by ending a civil war with Islamist militants that killed an estimated 200,000 people. But the country remains mired in corruption and, in a sign that the end for Bouteflika's rule had been approaching, several oligarchs close to his camp were banned from traveling abroad in the past few days, part of a crackdown against his allies. ""The gang has made big money illegally taking advantage of its closeness with decision-makers,"" Salah said, according to APS. The protests have been driven by the country's youth and lawyers demanding the removal of a ruling elite seen by many as out of touch with ordinary Algerians.

Gas Prices Spike as Ohio Legislature Approves Gas Tax Hike,tennesseestar.com,Andrew Shirley,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/gas-prices-spike-as-ohio-legislature-considers-gas-tax-hike/ ,"The American Automobile Association (AAA) announced Monday that only three months into 2019, the nation’s average gas price has spiked by almost 45 cents. Ohio prices increased as well, but by slightly less than the national average. While Ohioans may be relieved, experts are predicting that these price increases are expected to continue indefinitely.
According to AAA, the current average gas price is $2.69 for regular unleaded gas. Though this is far from the historical high of $4.16 in May of 2011, it’s still more expensive than gas has been in the previous three years. At the state level:
The nation’s top 10 largest weekly increases are: Florida (+13 cents), California (+12 cents), Indiana (+11 cents), Georgia (+11 cents), Idaho (+9 cents), Kentucky (+9 cents), Washington (+9 cents), Oregon (+8 cents), Nevada (+8 cents) and Ohio (+8 cents).
“Three months ago motorists could find gas for less than $2.50 at 78 percent of gas stations. Today, you can only find gas for that price at one-third of stations, which is likely giving sticker shock to motorists across the country,” AAA spokesperson Jeanette Casselano said. “Gasoline stocks have been steadily decreasing since early February causing spikes at the pump that are likely to continue for the coming weeks.”
Experts warned that the issues causing these spikes aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.
The rise in oil prices is attributed to several compounding factors that make the future of oil uncertain. In early December 2018, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC) and their allies made the decision to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels a day. This was done despite the vehement protests of President Donald Trump and other western powers. The recent U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran have further tightened the supply of oil.
The price of oil spiked to $70 dollars per barrel on Tuesday.
As Ohioans face the challenge of increasing long-term oil prices, the prospect of a gas-tax hike becomes all the less popular. As previously reported:
House Bill 62 ( HB 62 ), the 2020-21 Ohio Transportation Budget, the first major bill proposed of newly-elected Ohio Republican Governor Mike DeWine’s tenure, called for an 18 cent gas tax increase. It would go into effect immediately and carry no tax offsets.
The Ohio House of Representative’s proposed a 10.7 cent tax increase, phased in over three years while the Senate called for a six-cent tax increase. After extensive discussions, DeWine and the House agreed to an 11 cent tax increase.
While no compromise could be reached with the Senate before the March 31 deadline, the House and Senate agreed to a 10.5 cent increase late Tuesday night.

Russia Has More People Behind Bars Than Any European Country Both Absolutely And Relative To Population – OpEd,www.eurasiareview.com,Paul Goble,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/03042019-russia-has-more-people-behind-bars-than-any-european-country-both-absolutely-and-relative-to-population-oped/,"By Paul Goble
Even though Moscow has reduced Russia’s prison population by almost a third over the last decade, the country still has more prisoners both absolutely and relative to population than its neighbors or than any European country, according to a new University of Lausanne study prepared for the Council of Europe.
At present, the study says, Russia has 602,176 people behind bars or in camps, a figure equal to 418.3 per 100,000. No other country in the survey has as many or as many per capita: the Russian figure is nearly twice that of Azerbaijan and four times that of European countries ( vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2019/04/02/798027-rossii-dolshe-deshevle ).
And while Russia spends more on its prison system than any other country in the survey – 3.9 billion euros (4.8 billion US dollars), it spends less to feed its inmates, only 2.5 euros (3 US dollars) a day, compared to an all-European average of 66.5 euros (80 US dollars). Even Azerbaijan, Moldova and Georgia spend more than Russia does
In European countries, the average time in prison “does not exceed 8.2 months,” and only 1.2 percent of prisoners are serving life sentences. In Russia, however, the majority of prisoners will be behind bars five to ten years, although those sentenced to life imprisonment currently number less than one percent.
Finally, the study finds, those behind bars in Russia are two times more likely to die there, with 51 deaths among 10,000 prisoners every year. Of these, five are suicides.

Forthcoming Book On CIA Meat For Global Criminal Court – OpEd,www.eurasiareview.com,IDN,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/03042019-forthcoming-book-on-cia-meat-for-global-criminal-court-oped/,"By IDN
By Jonathan Power
The International Criminal Court (ICC) which prosecutes crimes against humanity is under attack again by the Trump Administration for pursuing Americans. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama supported it. George W. Bush tried to close it down but then decided to cooperate with it. Donald Trump is against it and encouraged John Bolton, his National Security Advisor, to publicly savage it.
To be published in May is a revealing book on the CIA, about its paramilitary armies, operators and assassins. The book is still under wraps so I can’t break the embargo by telling you its title and author. All I can say is that it’s meat for the ICC.
The CIA crosses the moral lines all the time. Surprise your target, torture or kill your enemy, vanish without a trace. Then deny it. That was and is its intent. The whole book should be read by prosecutors everywhere, not least those on the ICC. It should propel them into more regular prosecutions of Americans. The book tells the awful story in accessible detail.
This kind of systematically organized secret activity was begun by the British during World War 2, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which evolved into James Bond’s MI6. It crossed the Atlantic to become the OSS and later the CIA, although President Harry Truman thought, “soldiers of democracy do not fight guerrilla wars. Gentlemen do not slit throats”, as Annie Jacobsen puts it. He closed down the OSS.
The same reservations were held by many British generals. When SOE hatched a plan to assassinate Hitler they opposed it, worrying that it could open the way to a war crimes trial. The plan was scrapped. But over in Washington a young Bill Casey, head of the OSS’s operations in Europe, hatched his own plan. Casey was later to become under President Ronald Reagan director of the CIA, and a ruthless one. General Dwight Eisenhower overruled the Hitler operation – he had deployed the army close to Hitler’s mountain residence and it was planning to capture him.
In 1947 Truman had changed his mind, worried that Stalin was intent of expanding the borders of the Soviet Union (which we now know from an overwhelming majority of historians knowledgeable about this period was a false fear). Congress passed the National Security Act and the CIA was formed.
Its first test was not in Eastern Europe, it was when North Korea with Chinese military help invaded the South. Truman decided to fight. The CIA concentrated on behind-the-lines paramilitary actions. But there were dozens of disastrous operations. Thousands of anti-communist foreign fighters and their American handlers were parachuted into North Korea, never to return.
The next big effort was in Guatemala. The CIA easily deposed a left-leaning president, said to be a “communist”, set on reforming the distribution of land in a country where 2% of the people owned 70% of the land. A right wing dictator was installed. Over the next half century the majority Indian population was cruelly suppressed by a government and army, supported by a majority of the white colonial population.
Guatemala was where Che Guevara studied to be a doctor. He wanted to work with the resistance but the militia movement assigned him to hospital work. Much later, after the Cuban revolution when he worked side by side with Fidel Castro, he was assassinated in Bolivia by CIA-trained local troops as he tried to organize a revolution.
Those who like wearing Che T-shirts should know he was an advocate of nuclear war against the U.S. So extreme was he that Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev asked Castro to shut him up.
When it came to nuclear weapons it was the U.S. which was far more dangerous. In the early 1960s operatives trained in the waters off the coast of Okinawa in Japan. Launched from a submarine they set off to emplace a tactical nuclear weapons into the target area. They carried a real atomic weapon.
In the Congo in the 1960s, the CIA helped the successful effort to assassinate the anti-Western prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. Next was the effort to kill Castro, a plot initiated by President Eisenhower – the Bay of Pigs. It failed miserably.
Vietnam was the next big CIA operation. Interestingly, CIA director Allen Dulles told President Eisenhower in 1954 that a majority of the Vietnamese supported the communist-led Viet Minh. His advice was ignored. The CIA was active during the war. Once, it aided the military by performing a landscape analysis to see where it would be best to use a nuclear bomb.
Jumping to 2000 the CIA’s great achievement was to track down Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. President Barack Obama ordered a commando raid on his house and he was killed. Obama shut down the CIA’s “torture program” but he had few reservations about using CIA drones to assassinate Taliban and ISIS soldiers and supporters.
Trump wants to re-establish the torture program but hasn’t yet. The CIA dare not ask for it.
Meanwhile, the ICC gets ready to prosecute American soldiers and CIA operatives. There is more to come, and so there should be. The ICC should not be deterred by Trump and Bolton.

June Speakman,www.brownpoliticalreview.org,Namsai Sethpornpong,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2019/04/june-speakman/,"June Speakman is a professor of political science at Roger Williams University and has focused her research on the role of gender in politics. She is the current Democratic candidate for State Representative, District 68, Bristol & Warren. Professor Speakman was previously on the Barrington Town Council for 14 years.
You’ve worked at Roger Williams since 1995. What are some of the most profound lessons you’ve learned from your students over these past 24 years? I’ve learned how quickly our language changes. Freshmen teach me new things every year and help me keep up with cultural changes. They also teach me tolerance and open-mindedness. I am deeply impressed by how open-minded this generation of students is. They’re very accepting of people who would have been rejected in the past. This generation is very accepting of the great variety of ways to be human.
You were on the Barrington Town Council for 14 years. What made you decide to run? I got into politics the same way many women do: through my children. I was active in the Parent Teacher Organization, which is a very normal, expected role as a mom. Then I was approached by the local democratic office. It never occurred to me once in my life that I would run for office.
You’re currently the democratic candidate for the 68th district. Across the country, women are underrepresented in elected office. How have you managed this adversity during your run for state office? My gender never came up in a campaign. It isn’t too bad for women in politics in Rhode Island. Things are changing and there are far fewer obstacles now than when I was younger. You really just have to move forward when things happen. It’s important to find women who support you — other women in the general assembly have been very supportive of me in this campaign.
What advice would you give to individuals hoping to run for office in the future? I would say that you should get involved in the community in some way or the other. Careers in public service aren’t the highest paying jobs in the world, but they are extremely gratifying. You need thick skin and you need to be willing to compromise. We love idealism but we need people who can write legislation that can be enacted now. I also think being an educator is the best career. I have the ability to interact with young folks and bounce around controversial ideas. My advice for any job is to find something that makes your heart sing. Money is important but you need to be happy."
Cathy Doyle,www.brownpoliticalreview.org,Namsai Sethpornpong,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2019/04/cathy-doyle/,"Cathy Doyle is the Executive Director of Year Up, Rhode Island, a non-profit aimed at closing the opportunity divide by providing students with the skills and support necessary to reach their potential through careers and higher education.
How does Year Up see the labor market in Providence and what companies does it target?
We look primarily at the distribution of companies in the market. 90% of the labor market is small businesses and 10% is larger companies, like Lifespan, which employs 15,000 people. Big businesses are most apt to host Year Up interns, but we look across all sectors as entities who might hire our graduates. Employers will always want talented, motivated, pre-trained, entry-level talent. Despite dropping unemployment, we know there will always be a place for Year Up. We have a valuable resource in the 30 employers we partner with and are constantly incorporating their feedback in terms of how to make our young adults more hirable.
How has Year Up as an organization worked to convince companies that a four-year degree is not always necessary for success in the workplace?
We approach the conversation by showing them how many young adults they are leaving out of their pipeline. Employers are looking for diverse motivated talent, and if they only consider applicants with a bachelor’s degrees, they’re cutting out about 82% of that market. We have the tools to train young adults to succeed in those jobs. We make believers out of companies by putting proof in front of them.
What Rhode Island-specific policies does Year Up support and advocate for?
We want recognition that as a workforce development organization, we belong as a table for public funding. In Rhode Island, public funding is not always allocated based on measurable outcomes. 1,000 young adults have graduated from Year Up, Rhode Island and those 1,000 alumni are now contributing over $125 million in wages to Rhode Island’s economy. They are taxpayers, home-buyers, members of their communities, and are moving the needle forward in our state. Our results are proven and public funding would give us the ability to increase our impact.
How does Year Up’s partnership with the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) advance its mission?
There are 10,600 young adults in our state that do not have access to professional careers. Our work and the work of CCRI are both a part of addressing that need. Year Up knows that a young person can get their first two jobs without a degree, but we want to set our graduates up for long term success. Every credit a Year Up student receives is college credit recommended and is accepted at CCRI. We want our graduates to be life-long learners and CCRI is crucial to facilitating that continued education.
The number of opportunity youth in Rhode Island has decreased by 29% since 2010, what piece do you see Year Up playing in that?
Our work has a ripple effect. We have 1,000 graduates that have entered the workforce and they serve as proof of our model. We are training employers to think differently about hiring and have made advocates and champions out of many of the people that interact with our opportunity youth. By changing perceptions, our impact is greater than that 1,000 figure."
How Government Caused 'the Boy Crisis’ -,reason.com,Maxim Lott,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/reasontv/2018/07/10/how-government-caused-the-boy-crisis,"Warren Farrell, author of The Boy Crisis , was once associated with the feminist movement. Then he changed his views. ""I don't agree with the part of feminism that says, 'Men are the oppressors and women are the oppressed,'"" Farrell tells Maxim Lott, a senior producer of Stossel on Reason.
For example, men die five years earlier than women, have more dangerous jobs, and are often passed over for custody. Boys are two times more likely than girls to commit suicide . Boys are 29 percent less likely to get a college degree than girls.
So why do men earn more and have more influence in government and business? A big reason, Farrell argues, is that men are filling social expectations to become the family breadwinner.
""Our dads and our grandpas, they made sacrifices...to make more money, and then the feminist movement turned all of that sacrifice on the part of men against men,"" Farrell says.
Both sexes struggle, but Farrell thinks the feminist movement's single-sided focus on women's inequalities has led to an atmosphere that harms boys. A dramatic increase in fatherless households —which Farrell believes is largely responsible for boys' problems—goes ignored.
Study after study finds that having both a mother and father is best, at least for straight families. (Gay families may do just as well; Farrell notes that the overall evidence is inconclusive.) ""Even when we control for the amount of money a father and mother earn, children with dads still do much better,"" Farrell notes.
The rate of fatherless households has increased partly because of welfare programs that ""tear the family apart by giving the money to mothers when fathers are absent,"" Farrell argues, ""and not giving money to mothers when fathers are present.""
Why would fatherless households hurt boys more than girls? ""Boys tend to not have as many skills at developing friendships, at developing emotional connections,"" Farrell says. ""So when the family connection breaks apart, it affects them more profoundly than it does their sisters.""
Farrell says fathers are critical for several non-intuitive reasons. One is roughhousing, which teaches kids boundaries. Fathers roughhouse more than mothers, and when they do, ""the father is creating a bond with the child, so the children don't mind discipline....The discipline is the price they pay for more fun with dad.""
Many people think that mothers tend to be better parents because women are, on average, more empathetic and pay more attention to a child's needs. But Farrell says this by itself is not enough, because ""an empathetic parent does not create an empathetic child. An empathetic parent is someone who's always thinking of the children's needs, which teaches the children to always have his or her needs thought of.""
Requiring a child to think of others' needs is what actually build empathy, Farrell says.
Finally, Farrell says that mothers are more likely to express their love for a child by doing things like homework for the kid. They're more likely to engage in ""helicopter parenting,"" which leads to overly dependent kids.
What's the solution to ""the Boy Crisis""? Farrell says that society should offer more respect to men who focus on fathering rather than career success. He wishes there were more men in classrooms, and that schools would bring back things like recess.

Social Justice Is at Odds with American Ideas of Justice,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/commentary-social-justice-is-at-odds-with-american-ideas-of-justice/ ,"by Christopher Roach
What is justice? This complicated question is the subject of much study by philosophers, lawyers, clergy, and laymen. It is often easier to determine the metes and bounds of justice from what it is not than to define what it is in the abstract. Unfair procedures, treating the rich differently from the poor, racial discrimination, or the infusion of bribery and perjury into criminal procedures strike almost everyone as forms of injustice. Likewise, light punishments for serious crimes or excessive punishments for minor ones all have the stench of injustice. In criminal matters, justice chiefly requires that the guilty are punished and the innocent go free.
Individualized Justice
This understanding stems from the traditions of western justice, particularly the Anglo-American variety, which places a premium on the rights of the individual and the importance of fair procedures. This is why our Constitution allows one the right to remain silent and prohibits the use of illegally-obtained evidence, while permitting the accused a defense counsel and a trial by jury. These procedures were the products of centuries of experimentation. They reflect the concern not only with justice but also the fear of the “run-amuck” majority, i.e., the mob.
Anglo-American justice fundamentally is an individual affair. The question it normally confronts is whether a particular person committed a particular offense. One’s station in life, his relative wealth, background, race, and the background of his relatives are supposed to be irrelevant. This is the origin of the expression, “ Justice is blind .” Justice deliberately averts its gaze from one’s other social merits and demerits. It presupposes that otherwise good people can do very bad things and that otherwise bad people may not have done the bad thing they may be accused of having done.
This is also what distinguishes criminal justice from other matters of politics and policy. Matters such as war, immigration, or social programs aimed at elevating the estate of the poor exist apart from criminal justice and take into account social concerns that may be judged collectively and involve the relations of groups. They require a separate kind of logic.
The Left’s “Justice”
The Left has a particular interest in what it misleadingly calls “social justice.” This demands that historical injustices committed against members of particular victim groups require not only government assistance, but also the differential application of criminal justice. This is the root of the Left’s recent talk of “ mass incarceration .” The racially different outcomes in criminal sentencing are deemed a massive injustice without regard to differences in the per capita rate of crimes . According to this way of thinking, the fairness of the procedures that were involved in any particular person’s incarceration may be ignored; the mere fact of inequality of outcome by itself cries out for justice in the eyes of the Left.
Leftist social justice is diametrically opposed to the Anglo-American tradition of individualized justice. It demands, like Marx, that class factors take center stage. Indeed, Marx himself dismissed the individualized justice of the West as a tool for the bourgeois class to oppress the proletariat in his infamous Manifesto . He did not grant that there was any truth or reality to any particular philosophical system, including the West’s classical liberalism. Rather, he dismissed all of these claims to justice as the expression of an ideology crafted by the dominant group to seduce the oppressed.
While Marx used the term “class justice,” as he was focused chiefly on the conflicts between economic classes, the Left’s more recent innovation is the inclusion of “intersectionality” to the mix. This classifies ethnic minorities, women, gays, and other groups as categories oppressed by whites, heterosexuals and the like, and thus also in need of ideological social justice.
Social Justice in Practice
The recent Jussie Smollett episode is illustrative. He is an obvious sociopath and liar, and in a healthy society, he would have neither wealth nor fame. But, we live in clown world.
Concerned about his paltry compensation of $1 million per year as an actor on the show “Empire,” Smollett ginned up a story of being assaulted and nearly lynched by two MAGA-hat wearing rednecks who somehow found their way to the city of Chicago, were walking around in sub-zero temperatures, and happened to recognize him at 2:00 a.m. In response, the entire media went into overdrive condemning this instance of a vile hate crime. The police put a large team on the case. Expressions of sympathy, solidarity, and outrage came from every corner of the leftist culture-making apparatus, even though his tale barely passed the smell test.
The police were less versed on the hierarchy of intersectionality and concluded his story was a hoax . A cursory review of surveillance cameras, his phone records, and the confession of his co-conspirators made this plain. He was arrested by the police, but the post-arrest rhetoric by the authorities did not miss a beat , continuing to view the events through the lens of Marxist class justice. His real sin was in hurting the very groups to which he belonged and on behalf of whom he is said to be seeking justice. Rarely was it mentioned that he uttered a hateful blood libel against all conservatives—indeed, against all white Americans—to further his own personal interests, which also served to reinforce the left’s existing prejudices about a “hate crime epidemic.”
Smollett’s combination of old school privilege (wealth, fame, connections) along with his new intersectional credentials (gay, black, Jewish, leftist) led this week to his exoneration with a mere $10,000 fine. The massive expense he imposed on the police and his contribution to the myth of evil racist MAGA-hat-wearing Trump supporters counted for little. His lawyer, the Soros-funded prosecutor , and Michele Obama’s chief of staff conspired to make it go away. This event, no doubt, will be memory-holed because it hurts the broader narrative and thus undermines the social justice struggle.
Smollett’s case is merely one among many showing how the new justice works. College campuses are shut down for right-wing flyers , right-wing demonstrators are prosecuted by the full weight of the federal government, Democratic presidential candidates are talking about prosecuting mere thought crimes , even when real crimes like Smollett’s are forgiven. Smollett is among the privileged “victims” for whom the Left’s justice is not blind, but rather colored by the intersectional trinity of race, class, and sex. We have seen similar expressions of solidarity among the putative victim classes regarding such varied injustices as O.J. Simpson’s acquittal , Jeffrey Epstein’s slap on the wrist , Michael Jackson’s long-term abuse of minors , and the various police shooting cases that set off race riots during Obama’s long hot summer of 2014.
While not every case implicates social justice, it should be no surprise that those who conceive of life this way also employ power in this manner when they are in charge. Was it a mere detail that Hillary Clinton was exonerated for her manifest crimes, while the hero Michael Flynn was convicted, even when the FBI agents who interviewed him did not believe he committed a crime? Was it a fluke that the gun-toting Antifa of Charlottesville were never prosecuted or barely punished for their assaults, while the book was thrown at those on the other side?
This is not to say one side is always innocent and the other always guilty, but with ideologues at every level of the justice system, “woke” justice has within it the seeds of every form of injustice. It rejects from the outset that the essence of justice is to punish individuals individually guilty of particular offenses. Instead, the new justice aims to right historical wrongs—real and imagined—while advancing the narrative and history in a particular direction. In the process, this ideology corrupts otherwise-justified prosecutions by clouding these decisions with these extra-judicial considerations of race, class, sex, and the like.
Back in the USSR
There is a historical parallel to current trends in American justice: the “class justice” of the Soviet Union, as documented by such ideologically varied writers as Orlando Figes and Robert Conquest . Entire groups of enemies were invented—the Kulaks and the “saboteurs”—and then deported, convicted, or “liquidated” in the name of historical progress. Moreover, the children of the guilty were further burdened their entire lives because of their “ spoilt biographies .” Individualized justice meant little, as advancing the new Soviet system and the destruction of “class enemies” was paramount. As Stalin himself put the matter, “if just 5 percent of the people who had been arrested turned out to be actual enemies, ‘that would be a good result’.” The victims numbered in the millions.
There has been some trouble among the otherwise-unified Leftover Smollett’s treatment, particularly between Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Smollet’s protectors. This too should be cautionary, as it also has a historical antecedent. As the Soviet system evolved, class justice gave way to bloodletting among the authorities, as escalating denunciations and counter-denunciations showed that nothing could keep one safe from the logic of class justice, including perfect individual fidelity to the new system and its code. Any individual could be offered up on the altar to expiate the sins of his disfavored social background.
Americans committed to the original understanding of American justice must not fall into the trap of accepting class justice, including such recent additions to our legal system as hate crimes. Hate crime laws—and their cousin, the notion of hate speech—requires an investigation of mere thoughts, typically with an eye toward advancing the interests of privileged classes by rooting out evil thoughts. This is impossible, invasive of our historical liberties, and infuses nakedly political considerations into what should be technical questions of guilt and innocence. Simply accomplishing the hoary pursuit of individualized justice is difficult enough.
In the end, we can have individual justice or we can have social justice, but we can’t have both, as they are opposites.

Two Northam budget amendments could cause legislative battle,www.watchdog.org,Tyler Arnold &#124; Watchdog.org,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.watchdog.org/virginia/two-northam-budget-amendments-could-cause-legislative-battle/article_68f7281e-54d8-11e9-8521-73c111292c5d.html,"Two Northam budget amendments could cause legislative battle By Tyler Arnold | Watchdog.org Save
The Virginia General Assembly reconvenes Wednesday to address Gov. Ralph Northam’s vetoes and amendments. Lawmakers will consider action on a range of vetoes from immigration enforcement to healthcare regulations and criminal justice reform.
Although it’s hard to tell which measures will see a fight, Republicans could potentially push back on tax reform legislation that would extend more than $17 million worth of tax refunds to those who already receive a tax credit, according to Steve Haner, a senior fellow for state and local tax policy at the Virginia-based, free-market Thomas Jefferson Institute.
This one-time payment would give money to more than 150,000 Virginians – $110 to individuals and $220 to couples – but Haner said that providing funds to citizens who aren’t even paying an income tax does not amount to real tax reform. The plan would be paid for by a taxpayer relief fund set up when the General Assembly passed its tax conformity legislation in February.
Although House leadership spoke positively of the plan, Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, signaled that he will oppose it if it resembles redistribution of wealth.
“I have not heard or seen the details,” Norment said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch . “So no opinion other then I have no interest in a redistribution or back door to his absurd earned income tax credit refund.”
Haner suggested that the legislature support a more comprehensive tax reform plan with this fund, such as a larger increase in the standard deduction or a cut in the state corporate tax. Haner also suggested tying the tax rate to inflation.
It’s also possible there will be a fight over environmental regulations, Haner said. Republicans lawmakers successfully passed a bill that would have required legislative approval for the state to opt into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is designed to reduce carbon emissions through government regulation. Although it likely isn't possible to override this veto, Haner said that Republicans included this language in the budget proposal, as well, which could potentially see a fight.
Despite a possible fight over taxes and environmental regulations, Haner said that most of the legislative action will be predictable because very little of what Northam added was new. Most of the vetoes are unlikely to be overridden because they passed at least one chamber on a party-line vote and most of the amendments had already been considered – and failed – in the General Assembly.
“We should call it the reconsideration session,” Haner said.
Although Republicans hold the majority in the House of Delegates and the state Senate, they have only a two-seat advantage in both chambers. A two-thirds majority vote is required in both chambers to override Northam’s vetoes.
“The Speaker and Leadership are still reviewing all of the Governor's vetoes and amendments,” Parker Slaybaugh, a spokesperson for Virginia House Republicans, said in an email.
Jeff Ryer, a spokesperson for Senate Republicans, said in a phone interview that the senator who filed the legislation will determine whether to fight a veto. Without having a large enough majority to override a veto, Ryer said that the actions of the senators will be hard to tell.
Some of Northam’s vetoes include legislation that would have targeted localities that protected illegal immigrants from federal prosecution, legislation that would put occupational licensing restrictions on some former felons becoming a notary public, and legislation that would have deregulated healthcare.
Northam also pushed for amendments that would prohibit holding a cellphone while driving in Virginia and legislation that would end license suspension over court fees and fines. House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, has questioned the validity of the cellphone legislation, citing that it is not germane enough to the initial legislation, which prohibited holding a cellphone in a work zone.
The session will begin at noon on Wednesday. More from this section"
"The Russiagate Hoax Has Made the World a More Dangerous Place by Undermining President Trump's Ability to Defuse North Korea, China and Russia",tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/commentary-the-russiagate-hoax-has-made-the-world-a-more-dangerous-place-by-undermining-president-trumps-ability-to-defuse-north-korea-china-and-russia/ ,"by Robert Romano
Thanks to the Russiagate hoax that sought to falsely frame President Donald Trump as being a Russian agent when he wasn’t, the world has undeniably become a more dangerous place, as America’s partners overseas have had to contend with the real possibility that Trump would be removed from office.
As it turns out, President Trump is not going anywhere, with Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluding the Justice Department’s three-year investigation, Quote: d in Attorney General William Barr’s letter to Congress: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
But what deals overseas were lost because of the specter of the investigation?
A recent example came last month when President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s summit in Hanoi, Vietnam abruptly ended without a deal on denuclearization. Democrats on Capitol Hill had cynically arranged for former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to testify before the House Oversight Committee against his former boss the same day, which dominated news headlines while the summit was ongoing.
It didn’t matter that Cohen ultimately offered testimony that was exculpatory for Trump — he had never been to Prague in 2016 to meet Russian agents as had been alleged and Trump never directed him to change his testimony to Congress on a potential real estate deal in Russia — the damage may have already been done.
On March 3, Trump took to Twitter to blast the outcome , stating, “For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the ‘walk.’ Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!”
Elsewhere, the ongoing investigation into Trump — which turns out was a dead-end with the no-collusion finding — may have been hampering U.S.-China trade talks, too. After the Mueller report was released, financial analysts brightened their outlook on a potential U.S.-China trade deal, CNBC reported in a March 25 story, “ Mueller report fuels hopes for a US-China trade deal .”
“The Mueller report isn’t a game changer, but it should encourage China to keep up recent momentum in trying to finalize a deal with Trump… [T]he fact that an impeachment looks less likely will be meaningful for Beijing’s calculus,” Eurasia Group Asia director Michael Hirson told CNBC.
Similarly, The Economist Intelligence Unit Asia regional director Duncan Innes- Ker told CNBC, “The fact there wasn’t any smoking gun, indictment of Trump or Trump family members, puts the administration in a better position to fight for the 2020 election — and that has implications for the trade talks.”
The opposite line there is that while there was still the possibility of Trump being prosecuted or impeached, China felt it should just wait Trump out. Why make any concessions to a president who was about to be removed?
Now world leaders have to contend with the likelihood that Trump will be reelected in 2020.
While the trade talks directly impact China’s economic relationship with the U.S., they also impact how the two superpowers are going to interact going forward. This leads to the question, that if U.S. and Chinese differences on trade cannot be resolved diplomatically now, how will they be resolved later?
The same can be said of U.S.-Russian relations in the aftermath of the 2016 election campaign, where Russia was simultaneously accused of interfering with the election on behalf of Trump by hacking the DNC and John Podesta emails and putting them on Wikileaks and cultivating him as a Russian agent to serve in the White House.
Both sets of allegations led to intelligence agency and Justice Department investigations and were eventually under Mueller’s umbrella. During that time, tensions have absolutely mounted between the U.S. and Russia on nuclear weapons and hotspots like Syria and Ukraine and made the possibility of armed conflict more likely.
One year ago, U.S.-led forces in Syria were attacked by Russian soldiers, where more than 100 Russians were killed in the battle. Fortunately, both sides agreed publicly that the incident was not officially sanctioned by Russia, in what Bloomberg View’s Eli Lake calling it akin to Plato’s “noble lie,” an effort to prevent a wider escalation of tensions between the two superpowers.
The 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty has been abandoned by Washington, D.C. and Moscow, as both the U.S. and Russia have contended each side was in violation of the treaty with the development of ground-based missile systems banned by the treaty. The INF Treaty was the first ever nuclear arms reduction treaty in the nuclear age. It laid the groundwork for the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Both of those in turn built off of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties of the 1970s and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (1970). New START, signed in 2011 and expiring in 2021, could be the next to fall in the wake of the Russia hysteria.
We’re in a new nuclear arms race.
More recently, Russia has just put troops in Venezuela to assist the beleaguered Maduro government and to create a deterrent against potential U.S. intervention there.
All the while, the overwhelming perception has remained that Russia intervened in the 2016 elections.
Disputes over Russia’s annexation of Crimea also remain at the forefront as Ukraine remains a potential hotspot that could draw the U.S. into conflict.
Last summer’s Helsinki summit between Trump and Putin might have been an opportunity to deescalate these tensions and shore up the nuclear security agreements. But that didn’t happen and it is hard not to point to the Russiagate allegations against Trump as having hampered those efforts.
In short, the red phone line has been cut.
Even today, despite the Mueller report’s findings of no collusion, doing a deal would not be easy for Trump, even if coming to an agreement might salvage or strengthen nuclear arms control agreements and benefit humanity by curbing an existential threat.
The problem is in 2016, Trump ran on trying to deescalate the relationship with Russia, and the U.S. national security apparatus launched the Russiagate investigation on him in response, kneecapping the entire presidency in the process.
Now, with Democrats unable to acknowledge the no-collusion finding, any potential agreement remains under a cloud of warrantless suspicion.
U.S. presidents all the way back to Franklin Roosevelt have always been able to talk directly with Moscow without the specter of such an investigation. Yet despite everything that has happened, it is still up to President Trump to attempt to repair the relationship, defuse these hotspots and salvage what remains of nuclear arms control agreements. We need to get back on the same page — for everyone’s sake.

Theresa May's 'hostile environment' lives on,www.socialist.net,"Olivia Bridge, Immigration Advice Service and Manchester Labour",04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.socialist.net/theresa-may-s-hostile-environment-lives-on.htm,"May crushed and humiliated: chaos reigns Adam Booth 16 January 2019 Whilst Parliament is paralysed over Brexit, the Tories are continuing to push through their latest racist immigration policies, which attempt to profit off of the misery and misfortune of migrants.
Whilst Parliament is paralysed over Brexit, the Tories are continuing to push through their latest racist immigration policies, which attempt to profit off of the misery and misfortune of migrants.
Brexit has become a never-ending farce for the British public and a topic that is banned from most dinner tables. For the remaining EU member states, the UK has become a laughing stock. Yet with 10 days until Article 50 meets its latest deadline, there is still little clarity on how the UK intends on leaving the bloc. “Skills-based” plan or salary-orientated priority?
Whether the UK leaves with a deal or not, the skills-based immigration plan is pencilled to come into effect by early 2021 (for the time being, at least). In the interim, EU entrants can either seek Settled Status if the UK leaves with an agreement, or European Temporary Leave to Remain in the event of a no deal. The latter would result in possible removal from the country after 36 months if the applicant cannot meet visa requirements.
Afterwards, all future EU nationals will be subjected to stringent immigration rules. Yet the largest problem that this presents derives from the £30,000 income requirement of the most commonly accessed route: The Tier 2 Work Visa.
The majority of Britons would fall short from meeting this salary requirement if they faced the same rules. Yet, after Brexit, this prerequisite will massively disqualify workers and ultimately dilute EU migration as a whole.
However, how can the government prioritise skill and expertise when the highest hurdle for migrants seeking employment in the UK is their salary?
This is only compounded by the existence of ‘golden visas’. These are fast-track passes for millionaires and investors that, comparatively, have fewer skills – unless accumulated wealth is classed as a skill.
Investor routes have been a hotbed for money launderers and organised crime. And while the Home Office suspended the route last year, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, swiftly U-turned on the matter only days later.
Unlike working migrants, after investing £10 million those on an Investor Visa can gain settlement in the UK after a mere two years. Everyone else must continuously stay in the UK for either five years (as a partner) or ten years in order to qualify. Only in exceptional circumstances such as being a victim of domestic violence can settlement routes be relaxed below the threshold.
Evidently, Theresa May’s ‘hostile environment’ policy is still alive and kicking. There is clearly one rule for the rich and another for the rest. Home office profits from migrants’ misfortune
What’s worse is that the Home Office profits massively from migrants paying for a visa or status. Fees have continued to rise beyond that of inflation ever since the 2010 Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition.
The Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) was introduced in 2015 to force migrants to pay for healthcare costs upfront. However, the fee that doubled this January is now unreasonably high: migrants on a five-year placement are required to pay £2,000, despite the fact that they contribute more in tax than an average British citizen and use fewer public services than UK-born residents, as the Migration Observatory found.
In addition, a Tier 2 visa application costs £1,220. Crucially, this doesn’t include the compulsory English language test, the cost to register their biometric information, any priority or urgent services, or lawyer fees.
Workers must also prove they have at least £945 in personal savings. Applicants hoping to bring their children and a partner must also cough up the same fees for each, which quickly becomes extortionately priced for an average family of four.
British citizenship and nationality fees have risen so high that families are choosing between destitution or having their UK-born children fall through the cracks later in life. The government scrapped discounts for secondary and additional children in 2014, rendering registration simply unaffordable for families. This means that young adults who have lived in the UK their whole lives are becoming excluded from working, studying and travelling, while younger children are unable to claim free school meals or attend school trips, because their parents cannot afford to register them for British citizenship.
Mothers have reportedly turned to prostitution while others risk overstaying in the UK illegally to raise the fees, prompting the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration to launch an inquiry into the charges last year.
Scandalously, the Home Office are profiting from every application made. British Citizenship costs over £1,000 per every adult and child, yet costs only £372 to process. Indefinite Leave to Remain – which has risen by 127% in the past five years alone, to the fee of £2,389 – costs £243 to process. Taking an adult dependent family member such as an elderly relative or care-dependent child over the age of 18 incurs a cost of £3,250 and is one of the highest fees. However, it only costs the Home Office £423.
The Home Office are literally profiting off of migrants’ misfortune. These fees and charges are mostly non-refundable, too. Exploitative labour
While the immigration blueprint promises to reduce reliance on EU workers, it does not extend such a commitment to seasonal and agricultural staff. A new pilot that has just been launched allows international migrants to work on UK farms – but only for six months at a time during seasonal peaks. After which, they must leave the country, inflicting further job insecurity for these individuals.
The 12-Month Temporary Visa proposal is similarly restrictive. In a bid to alleviate workforce shortages in “sectors like construction and social care”, the white paper offers this temporary scheme until 2025 during which time “low-skilled” migrants can work in the UK for a year. They are not permitted to bring any family members with them, switch routes or seek permanent settlement in the UK during this time. After filling a vacancy in the UK, they must then leave and not return for a further 12 months to “prevent people effectively working in the UK permanently”, the paper states.
The Brexit vote was a sign that workers need better paid jobs and the rebuilding of areas destroyed by deindustrialisation. But the Tory government has ignored this and taken it as an opportunity to oppress and victimise already vulnerable migrants even more. This will only make conditions for the working class as a whole - migrant or native - even more exploitative.
Migrants don’t come to the UK to “take our jobs” and scrounge off the welfare system. The reality is, working migrants have to jump through hoops, meet impossible requirements, and pay through the nose just to be considered. And then they are treated as a second-class citizen when they get to the UK.
Once in the country, migrants are scrutinised, monitored by landlords and employers, and could be threatened with deportation once their ‘use’ has run out. All the while, the Home Office rakes in their life savings.
Migrants bring a wealth of skills from varying backgrounds. Every migrant has a skill to offer. But the Tory government’s blinkered big business mentality favours salaries over workers. The growing fees – which only went up again on 7 March – will only deter the most determined migrants from moving to the UK.
Even former Conservative MP and Leave voter, George Eustice, urged voters to consider waitresses, cleaners, care workers and farmers – professions that are the backbone to this country, yet which crucially fall short of the Home Office’s desired income. Eustice added, “we have no shortage of underemployed graduates”.
Although reduced migration will be welcomed as a victory for prominent Tory Brexiteers, the loss, truly, will be that of all workers - migrant or otherwise.

And most aren't laborers.
That's just caught.
What do you think the ratio on caught:undetected is?
I'd guess at least 1:1, if not 1:2 or 1:3.
And of those that are caught, 90+% stay in the country.
So we're looking at a minimum of 1 million illegal immigrants, with an upper bounds of 3-5 million just this year - on top of the million/year legal immigrants.
That's an unsustainable rate for many reasons, not the least of which is assimilation.
Instead, we have an increase in ethnic enclaves and further fracturing of society.
What does it mean to be an American?
Does it matter?
I have nothing against immigrants, even illegals, in general. I've known, worked with, and befriended many. But we have to have some pride and self-respect.
It is a privilege to be American. Most of us were born into it, and we should be grateful to our ancestors for that. I welcome people who want to become American, but it is important that people we allow to come here do want to become American... which is too often not the case anymore."

Manchester Council moves to criminalise homelessness,www.socialist.net,"Nick Hallsworth, Manchester Gorton CLP (personal capacity)",04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.socialist.net/manchester-council-moves-to-criminalise-homelessness.htm,"May crushed and humiliated: chaos reigns Adam Booth 16 January 2019 Draconian measures to punish rough sleepers will only sweep the problem of homelessness under the carpet. Labour councils should instead be fighting for a socialist programme of mass social housing construction.
Draconian measures to punish rough sleepers will only sweep the problem of homelessness under the carpet. Labour councils should instead be fighting for a socialist programme of mass social housing construction.
Manchester city council has proposed a series of measures to crack down on homelessness in the city centre, around which they are currently holding a public consultation.
The plan is to introduce a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) that would apply penalties to many behaviours associated with rough sleepers and street drug users. This includes:
“Occupying a tent or other temporary structure in a manner which is likely to create a health and safety risk for other people; continuing to obstruct a building entrance/exit, stairwell or highway after being asked to move; urinating or defecating in a public space (except a toilet); aggressive or intimidating begging.”
Also included are public drinking, discarding needles, and failing to dispose of litter when asked to by police. Anyone found guilty could face a £100 fixed penalty, or £1,000 if prosecuted in court. Out of sight
These plans do nothing other than criminalise any activity rough sleepers might be expected to take in their situation. Police would be given the power to further harass and victimise an already highly vulnerable group of people, on terms open to very subjective implementation.
This is a cruel - not to mention ineffective and arbitrary - attack on the very people who have been let down the most by our unjust housing system, through punitive measures which attempt to move people along and shift the problem out of sight.
If you cannot sleep in a tent, or a shop doorway, are you expected to freeze on the ground? If all the public toilets have been shut down, and local establishments refuse you access, where can you go to the toilet? What counts as 'intimidating’ begging? Where are rough sleepers supposed to go? And how can they be expected to pay a fine?
The council is hoping that enough hassle from police will cause rough sleepers to move away from the city centre to please irritated wealthy residents and local businesses, and go instead to working class areas which are ignored. Symptoms
These measures attack the symptom not the disease. Manchester has seen a 34% rise in homelessness from 2017 to 2018 alone. Shockingly, more homeless people died in Manchester in 2017 than any other local authority.
The root of the problem lies in the capitalist system. At one pole, landlords and investors accumulate billions worth of estate capital, with thousands of properties being used as speculative assets and lying empty. At the other, thousands sleep in the street due to lack of access to affordable housing.
The endemic crisis of the capitalist system has given way to savage austerity. This affects working-class, Labour-voting areas like Manchester particularly harshly.
Social housing stock has been sold off en masse , providing an enormous cash-in to the private sector. Shelters have closed down. Addiction and mental health issues (themselves rooted in capitalist alienation) strongly impact homelessness, yet social services that tackle these problems have been decimated. Finally, the introduction of Universal Credit has been shown to drastically compound the problem and push many into homelessness. Uncaring
This PSPO proposal is further evidence of the uncaring approach Manchester’s Labour council has unfortunately chosen to take in tackling anti-social behaviour and street-dwellers.
An expensive private security firm was employed to patrol Chinatown around Chinese New Year to ward off ‘nuisance’ behaviour. Council leader Richard Lees recently described Christmas as “peak-begging season”, while council Twitter accounts condemned street kitchens for attracting undesirables. Mayor Andy Burnham’s flagship new homeless shelter was recently closed down after just two weeks due to electrical problems.
The council has taken some steps to alleviate the housing crisis, led by a handful of new left-wing councillors. This year, the first new council homes to be built in Manchester in a decade were finished in Moston.
However, these measures do not go nearly far enough. The council still looks towards attracting private development as the main aim, no matter who is left behind. Socialist response
Council stats show there are 8546 empty homes in Manchester. There is no lack of housing. It is just in the wrong hands: the hands of capitalists who only put stock to use when a profit can be made.
Labour councils need to embark on a massive programme to build social housing, and restore social services. Of course, while councils are beholden to Tory austerity, this won’t happen.
A national programme of coordinated resistance to local cuts should be led by Labour councils and trade unions. The aim should be to bring a national Labour government to power, replenish social housing, and provide a home for everyone. This would require the nationalisation of the construction companies and the expropriation of housing assets from profiteering landlords.
This kind of vision is a world away from the cruel and diversionary tactics being planned against rough sleepers through the PSPO consultation, another of many consultations which have simply been used to justify pre-existing plans.
You can take part in the consultation and tell the council what you think. However, we need to agitate locally in our communities, Labour parties, trade unions, and tenants’ associations for a socialist response to the housing crisis. Video news"
A Case for Continued American Economic Growth,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/commentary-a-case-for-continued-american-economic-growth/ ,"by Rick Manning
The office discussions at Americans for Limited Government are lively with voices often raised over various interpretations of what the news of the day means. While none of us are economists and we don’t even belong to the Holiday Inn Rewards Program, we still have extended and sometimes loud discussions on the meaning of different economic events.
Last week, a future recession signal was hit when the interest rate paid by a three-month Treasury bond went higher than the interest rate paid for a 10-year Treasury bond.
Wait, don’t go away, this is really easy. It is logical that the interest rate investors would seek for a short term debt would be low, while investors would seek a higher return for parking their money in a ten-year investment. After all, the three-month bond goes away rapidly so if interest rates rise higher than what you are earning on your investment, you are not stuck with a loser for long (in this case a maximum of 3 months.) But if you buy a 10-year bond which only pays 2.4 percent interest as was the case on March 29, when the three-month bond is paying 2.4 percent, it typically says that you expect interest rates to drop long-term due to actions by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates.
And that is why many in the economic forecasting community are predicting economic slowing or a recession in the next eighteen months. CBS reported , “Simply, the yield curve tends to invert before economic downturns. Economist Will Denyer of Gavekal Research notes that the yield curve has flattened, and eventually inverted, before every U.S. recession since the mid-1950s.”
Robert Romano , Americans for Limited Government’s Vice President of Public Policy is a pure chartist and shares this view, with the caveat that the 10-year, 2-year has not inverted just yet which could mean the recession predictions are premature. He wrote, “Assuming such an inversion happened soon, that might mean a recession might be just beginning in Oct. 2020. But if it doesn’t happen soon, it’s worth noting that there hasn’t been a recession in modern history without such an inversion.” If it does invert soon, he stated that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes could not have been timed any more effectively to potentially force a recession prior to the 2020 election.
I, however, do not believe a recession is inevitable.
First, the charts themselves tell us something about the way the three-month and 10-year yield curves have worked. As short term rates rose, the Fed ratcheted up interest rates, but the longer term 10-year interest rates fluctuated up a little but by and large it was stable.
Remember, one of the primary reasons to hold short-term debt is as a parking place for capital, not as an actual investment. Anyone who owns Certificates of Deposits from their bank knows that if you want to be able to access your money in the near term, you get a 3 month CD, and if you are investing in the long-term you buy one for a year or longer.
A second reason for caution in the increase in the three- month bond is that the Federal Reserve has been divesting itself of debt that it purchased during Quantitative Easing, when it bought U.S. Treasuries on the open market to artificially keep interest rates low during the Great Recession. Now, the Fed is dumping debt that it holds onto the open market creating more debt than there is demand for at the near-zero interest rates that short-term Treasuries were yielding — so to sell them on the market the price (interest rate) must go up so people, banks and other foreign governments will buy them. So, the yield curve inversion is not a product of normal bond markets, but instead is completely artificial.
While the history since the 1950s dictate that when the short term interest rates get higher than the long term ones, a recession is in the offing in the next two years, the unprecedented Federal Reserve bond market interventions since the banking collapse of 2008, create an added variable which is different than any previous bond market.
There are five other major factors that I believe are important, two are positive and one is negative toward recession avoidance.
Congress cut taxes in 2018, and the positive impact of those cuts are having an impact on the economy now and should have a continued carryover effect for the next few years. When American consumers have more money in their pockets, they spend at least a portion of it which stimulates the economy. And this stimulus is happening at the exact time it is needed to offset any economic contraction pressure.
Also, there are some aspects of the corporate tax cut that will have long-term positive impacts on the U.S. economy. Multi-national businesses have five years to “repatriate” profits to the United States at a low tax rate with as much $4 trillion overseas at the time of the bill’s passage. This is money that is being brought back home for investment. To date about $650 billion have been repatriated. As this moving of foreign-held capital continues to move here, it is reasonable to expect it to create a recession offsetting economic burst. Remember that last year our nation’s Gross Domestic Product grew by a record $1 trillion and the amount of dollars reinvested in the U.S. was about 65 percent of this amount.
The corporate tax cut also allowed 100 percent of capital investment to be deducted in the year of the expenditure. This incentivizes those multi-national companies to invest in factories and equipment here in America using that cash from overseas and be able to deduct the costs of those investments from their taxes immediately.
The corporate tax cut lowered the tax rates from amongst the highest in the developed world to somewhere in the middle. This change made it make more sense from a profit and loss perspective to make things in America rather than importing them from elsewhere.
When these factors are combined with the President’s trade agenda, including increased steel tariffs and the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement which is pending before Congress, the incentive for manufacturing domestically rather than importing goods from abroad is being expanded and these four factors should result in increased economic activity offsetting the presumed economic dip.
What’s more, the President has stated on multiple occasions that Japanese President Abe expects seven new U.S. auto factories to be built by Japanese automakers in the near future. The President’s trade agenda is forcing companies to rethink their build it overseas with cheap labor and ship it here for sale strategy.
The proof that the manufacturing sector is recovering rapidly under the Trump policies lies in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that 450,000 more Americans are employed in the manufacturing sector now than when the President took office two years ago after those jobs being left for dead by the previous president.
Finally, and most importantly, our nation did not get a real recovery from the Great Recession due to the previous administration’s strangling regulatory policies designed to export U.S. wealth overseas. The Trump administration has eliminated 22 regulations for every single one it has put into effect freeing up the energy and other sectors to produce. As a result, the U.S. is now the top oil producer in the world and while there has been a short-term spike in oil costs due to the Venezuela disaster, both oil and natural gas prices are incredibly low meaning the energy costs for producing things in the U.S. is low, providing another encouragement for manufacturing to locate domestically.
The one potential fly in the ointment is the massive federal debt which is sucking up capital from around the world including in the U.S.
To put the debt into perspective, the entire world economy has a GDP of approximately $87.5 trillion. The U.S. debt is now at a staggering $22 trillion, or one-quarter of the entire wealth generated in the world last year.
A study titled, Growth in a Time of Debt by Professors Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff finds, “When external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual growth declines by about two percent; for higher levels, growth rates are roughly cut in half.”
To put this into perspective, the United States total debt to GDP is 105 percent. The debt drag on our economy is the one thing that is holding back the rocket ship that President Trump could be delivering and may be the determining element in limiting the positives that should be accelerating growth during the end of the second decade of the 21st century.
While the chartists say that a recession is in the offing, I believe there are enough positives in the economy to sustain moderate growth rates over the next couple of years and that is not even mentioning the real wage growth being experienced by blue collar workers as America makes things again.
At a time when the media professionals will focus on negatives in an attempt to talk down the economy and people’s hopes for the future, there is a case to be made that this economy is just beginning to really recover from the devastation of 2008, and if we can get our national spending addiction under control, the future would be even brighter — bond yield charts notwithstanding.

"Democrat-Controlled Minnesota House Passes Bill to Allow Child Sex Offenders, Murderers to Work in DHS Programs",tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/democratic-controlled-minnesota-house-passes-bill-to-allow-child-sex-offenders-murderers-to-work-in-dhs-programs/ ,"The Minnesota House passed a bill Monday in a vote along party lines that would allow residents convicted of a number of felonies to work in programs overseen by the Department of Human Services.
The bill, House File 2265 , was authored by Rep. Dave Pinto (DFL-St. Paul) and passed out of the House in a 73-54 vote .
Pinto’s bill would require the DHS to consider granting a “set aside or variance” for “an individual who was disqualified for a crime or conduct listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1” and if more than 20 years have passed since the individual was either sentenced or committed the crime.
The bill would apply to positions that require a DHS background check, such as Personal Care Attendants (PCAs), services for Minnesotans with disabilities, and Non-Emergency Medical Transportation drivers.
Crimes listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1 , include:
Felony-level stalking Drive-by shooting Malicious punishment of a child Solicitation of children to engage in sexual conduct Murder of an unborn child in the first degree Kidnapping Domestic assault by strangulation Child abuse or neglect Spousal abuse Domestic assault Murder in the first, second, and third degree In a press release , Deputy Minority Leader Anne Neu (R-North Branch) noted that these crimes “would fall under the crimes that must be considered for a set-aside or variance.”
“This bill opens the door to allowing literal murderers and child sex offenders to work alongside Minnesota’s most vulnerable citizens with no guarantees or safeguards that they have been rehabilitated and ready to rejoin the workforce,” she said, though she does point out that there are some crimes that are “exempted in the bill,” such as criminal sexual conduct.
“Too often this session, Democrats have been focused on restorative justice by any means necessary, even if it puts Minnesotans at risk,” Neu added.
The bill will now head to the Senate for consideration, where it is sponsored by State Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St. Paul).

Democrat Pundit Says Klobuchar's Line 'I Can See Iowa from My Front Porch' Playing Well in Hawkeye State,tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/iowa-insider-discusses-klobuchars-appeal-with-michael-patrick-leahy-and-steve-gill/ ,"Michael Patrick Leahy and Steve Gill, hosts of The Tennessee Star Report , recently spoke with attorney and Iowa insider Jim Larew to get his take on the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
Larew said Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s (D-MN) catchphrase that she can “see Iowa from her front porch” seems to be playing well among Democrats in the state.
“That’s a good line. That’s a good line, Jim,” Leahy said.
“It is. And she does well with that group. She comes across as being, you know, the young woman next door. And it’s a friendlier chord that she has,” Larew said of Klobuchar.
The latest poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers, however, had Klobuchar sitting at just three percent, while former Vice President Joe Biden led the poll at 27 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at 25 percent. She led six other candidates who were all tied at just one percent.
Klobuchar campaigned across Iowa in mid-March, making stops in Dubuque, Waterloo, and Independence.
“I followed the Mississippi River down from our snowy announcement and ended up in Dubuque! Great conversations with Iowans who are looking forward to 2020,” Klobuchar said of her visit , attempting to use her status as one of the few candidates from the Midwest to appeal to Iowa voters.

A giant billboard was hung across from The New York Times building in New York City, saying the paper “inflames with biased coverage” of Israel, according to JNS.The billboard read “While Hamas firebombs Israel… The New York Times inflames with biased coverage” and featured a large photo of a Molotov cocktail, including a burning Times article headlined “Israel Bulldozes Democracy.” The Molotov cocktail is said to evoke one of Hamas rioters’“favorite weapons,” according to JNS.JNS cited CAMERA’s executive director, Andrea Levin, as saying the billboard was put up to show Hamas’s violence both toward Gazans and Israel.CAMERA, the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, sponsored the billboard “for at least six months,” according to JNS, and has put up similar billboards in the past to highlight the Times ’s Israel coverage.Levin also said the billboard was meant to highlight how Hamas’s rule in Gaza undermined peace.According to JNS, nearly 100,000 people are expected to see the mid-town Manhattan billboard daily.

Younger voters have been taken in by Chris Bowen’s franking credits grab
Robert Gottliebsen
In the final half-hour of the budget lock up I discovered how hard it is for the older generation to convince their children that the ALP’s retirement and pensioner tax on cash franking credits is grossly unfair.
On Budget night, once their copy is written, many journalists must wait for the Treasurer to begin speaking before they can leave the lockup, so they often swap conclusions over a coffee.
My conclusion that younger Australians would be pitched against their parents in the looming election caught the attention several millennial-generation journalists (not from The Australian). All of them believed that Chris Bowen’s tax was right and one even complained that my articles were making his father more and more angry. There was nodding from the group.
Chris Bowen has sold the younger generation the proposition that stopping cash franking credits is fair. So they are not listening to their parents or anyone else.
One journalist quoted the Bowen analogy in which a nurse earns money and pays tax whereas big company profits become tax free when they are paid out in dividends to self-funded retirees in pension mode.
On behalf of the older generation I decided to engage them in debate and whereas they ignore their parents’ protests, they were at least prepared to discuss the matter with me.
They probably thought I was a victim of the ALP tax but because I have continued working until well into my 70s I have been able to accumulate sufficient savings to be not affected by the tax. But I watch my less well-off friends being savaged so I do get a little emotional.
But I also realise that many in the younger generation, including many journalists, are struggling. They have no sympathy for the retired generation whom they think have had it too easy. That includes their parents, although many are very grateful for the free childcare provided by grandparents.
My response was that as a community, and via the parliament, we have decided that if you have accumulated savings in superannuation and you reach a certain age, you can declare up to $1.6 million of your superannuation to be “in pension mode” and the returns from those funds are tax-free.
Part of those tax-free returns are in franking credits received in cash as part of the dividends people receive on their shares. The shares have been purchased at prices that incorporate that franking credit return. But then suddenly part of the returns are to be removed.
Many younger people do not understand franking credits and their real issue is that they believe that, compared to them, the older generation is being treated too generously including being able to save large sums in super. That’s why they don’t listen to their parents’ protests.
Accordingly, the real issue that should be debated is whether the superannuation pension mode structure is too high and whether we are too generous to pensioners with savings.
Alternatively, is the overall franking credit structure too generous to those who save?
Tackling these issues via a half-baked retirement and pensioner tax is wrong. I don’t think I convinced them but they kept listening.
But I did strike a chord when I pointed out that since federation we had always taxed people of the same age, with the same assets and income in the same way. Chris Bowen’s retirement and pensioner tax breaks that mould. They could not believe Chris Bowen would do that let alone include pensioners in his net. They hadn’t read my material.
And so I related what my readers have read so often: people who save via industry and some retail superannuation funds receive their cash franking credits and those who save elsewhere, including some retail funds and self-managed funds do not receive their cash franking credits entitlements.
For the first time in our history we are taxing people on the basis of who manages their money and not on the basis of their assets and income.
And some pensioners get punished if they saved via a self-managed fund and are entitled to a part pension. Under Labor’s original announcement, they are to be taxed if they did not register for the pension by the end of March last year. ALP politicians tell “fibs” when they say pensioners are immune unless it is planned to change the rules.
All that resonated and some of the journalists could see the tax was clearly unfair. But it’s equally unfair that they can’t afford a house and or gain adequate wage rises. We are simply spreading the unfairness around.
I was surprised I was not asked how Chris Bowen has engineered “protection” from his tax in industry and big retail funds. We all know the answer. The superannuation income of the journalists, nurses and other workers attract tax in a big fund. And that tax is pooled with the retired people, so there is a net tax payable by the fund and thus the franking credit entitlement is retained. It’s an artificial device because each person in a fund has an individual entitlement.
Most media people, including talk back radio people, don’t understand franking credits and so are reluctant to debate the shadow treasurer, who looks like becoming the treasurer.
But 1 million-plus Australians are being treated very badly. One day someone other than veteran journalists like me and a few others will stand up for them. And to the parents of journalists, even though your children will not listen, keep diving them mad, especially if you are minding their children free of charge. Stimpson J. Cat #2979162, posted on April 4, 2019 at 11:11 am
I wonder if, as more information surfaced, Trump changed his mind?
The real question is, if more information surfaces, can YOU change your mind on any given topic, at any given time? What other people think is irrelevant. dover_beach

Wisconsin Journalist to Female Republican Staffer: 'Hope You Don’t Get Raped at a MAGA Rally' - Tennessee Star,tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/wisconsin-journalist-to-female-republican-staffer-hope-you-dont-get-raped-at-a-maga-rally/ ,"An editor for a Wisconsin-based publication was outed Tuesday for allegedly telling a female communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee that she hopes she doesn’t “get raped at a MAGA rally.”
In a press release, Carly Atchison advocated for the Born Alive Survivors’ Protection Act, which would protect babies who survive botched abortions, and asked where Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI-03) stands on the legislation.
“Hey, Carly—hope you don’t get raped at a MAGA rally and have to carry that child to term. DON’T EVER CONTACT ME AGAIN,” replied Moira Crowley, who is listed as an assistant editor for Cheese Reporter , a Wisconsin publication that reports on “the world’s cheese, butter and milk processing industries.”

— Carly Atchison (@CarlyAtch) April 2, 2019
After Atchison shared the email to Twitter, Cheese Reporter released a statement claiming that Crowley’s email had been “hacked.”
“Recently, one of our employee’s email was hacked and deplorable messages were transmitted. Cheese Reporter and the employee ask for your understanding during this difficult time and in no way does Cheese Reporter or the employee condone or endorse any of these hacked messages,” the outlet wrote in a tweet.
“For those who recently began following us for the hacked comments, please unfollow our Twitter account as we do not want to be a messenger for your beliefs,” Cheese Reporter said in another tweet.
Atchison later pointed out that she was blocked by Cheese Reporter on Twitter.
“Weird … why would a group who said they were hacked block me? Did their twitter account get hacked too?” she said.
The Washington Examiner reached out to Crowley for comment, and she replied to their request using the same email address that outlet said was hacked.
“Our email has been compromised and the message is fake,” she said.
Atchison provided The Examiner with her response to Crowley in which she calls her comments “personally hurtful and disgusting.”
“There is an unsubscribe button at the bottom of the email. I hope you learn to conduct yourself in a more professional manner and pray that the hatred you hold in your heart heals,” Atchison wrote.
“Oh, I unsubscribed Carly. And I just donated $50 to Planned Parenthood in your name,” Crowley allegedly replied.
UPDATE: The Cheese Reporter has since deleted its tweets claiming that it was “hacked.” This is a developing story.

"After the Moon in 2024, NASA Wants to Reach Mars by 2033",tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/after-the-moon-in-2024-nasa-wants-to-reach-mars-by-2033/ ,"NASA has made it clear they want astronauts back on the Moon in 2024, and now, they are zeroing in on the Red Planet – the US space agency confirmed that it wants humans to reach Mars by 2033.
Jim Bridenstine, NASA’s administrator, said Tuesday that in order to achieve that goal, other parts of the program – including a lunar landing – need to move forward more quickly.
“We want to achieve a Mars landing in 2033,” Bridenstine told lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill.
“We can move up the Mars landing by moving up the Moon landing. The Moon is the proving ground,” added the former Republican congressman, who was appointed by President Donald Trump.
NASA is racing to enact the plans of Trump, who dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to announce that the timetable for once again putting man on the Moon had been cut by four years to 2024.
The new date is politically significant: it would be the final year in Trump’s eventual second term at the White House.
Many experts and lawmakers are concerned that NASA cannot make the deadline, especially given the major delays in the development of its new heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System, which is being built by aerospace giant Boeing.
Any mission to Mars would take at least two years, given the distance to be traveled. Getting there alone would take six months, as opposed to the three days needed to reach the Moon.
A round trip to Mars can only take place when the Red Planet is positioned on the same side of the Sun as Earth — that occurs about every 26 months, so the dates are 2031, 2033, and so on.
In 2017, a NASA budget bill set 2033 as the target date for the first manned mission to Mars, but NASA itself has talked about the “2030s” in its roadmap.
NASA wants to learn how to extract and use the tons of ice at the Moon’s south pole.
“Water ice represents air to breathe, it represents water to drink, it represents fuel,” Bridenstine said.
“The intent, of course, is to not just get humans to the surface of the Moon but prove that we can live and work on another world.”
Democratic lawmaker Eddie Bernice Johnson, the chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, asked Bridenstine to put a price tag on the new schedule.
The NASA chief said he would make his updated budget request by April 15.

Trump Compares Democrats to Central American Countries,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/trump-compares-democrats-to-central-american-countries/ ,"by Jason Hopkins
President Donald Trump compared Mexican and Central American governments to Democrats working in Washington, D.C., in a tweet Tuesday morning.
“After many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress!” the president tweeted.
After many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
The statements come as a massive number of illegal migrants are arriving on the U.S.-Mexico border. A record amount of apprehensions took place in March, with Customs and Border Protection catching or stopping 3,974 illegal migrants on March 19, the highest number since Trump entered office. Nearly 100,000 apprehensions are estimated to have taken place in March, which would be the highest in over a decade.
Most of these illegal migrants hail from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, making the situation more difficult for law enforcement officials. These immigrants cannot be quickly deported because they are from noncontiguous countries — countries other than Mexico or Canada. The situation has left overwhelmed detainment centers stretched thin and forced to release illegal migrants by the thousands.
The Trump administration has pushed numerous measures in an effort to alleviate the situation. Beyond asking for billions more in funding for wall construction, the Trump administration is attempting to punish these Central American countries by withholding millions in financial aid and asking Congress to pass legislative fixes to immigration laws.
All of these measures have been met with pushback from Democrats, earning ire from the Oval Office. Trump, later on Tuesday, Quote: d the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, who has been extremely critical of the Democratic Party.
“I haven’t seen any Democrats down here at the Border working with us or asking to speak to any of us. They have an open invitation. We are getting overrun, our facilities are overcapacity. We are at an emergency crisis.” Art Del Cueto, National Border Patrol Council.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
The president has also put heavy pressure on Mexico, calling out its government for allowing Central American migrants to traverse through the country. Trump has repeatedly threatened to shut the entire border down unless the Mexican government rectifies the situation.

The Trump Administration Is Expanding a Program That Boots Asylum Seekers Back to Mexico,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/the-trump-administration-is-expanding-a-program-that-boots-asylum-seekers-back-to-mexico/ ,"by Jason Hopkins
The Trump administration will be increasing the number of Central American asylum seekers who are sent back to Mexico to await their court case.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced Monday she will be expanding the “Migrant Protection Protocols” program, more popularly known as “Remain in Mexico.” Nielsen, in a memo sent to the federal border chief, ordered Customs and Border Protection agents deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border to begin reviewing hundreds of migrant cases a day to determine if they should be booted back to Mexico.
“[The Department of Homeland Security] will require more migrants to wait in Mexico, with appropriate humanitarian protections, during their immigration proceedings to prevent fraud & ensure they don’t escape the law and disappear into the country,” Nielsen tweeted Monday.
That is why @DHSgov will require more migrants to wait in Mexico, with appropriate humanitarian protections, during their immigration proceedings to prevent fraud & ensure they don’t escape the law and disappear into the country.
— Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) April 2, 2019
The “Remain in Mexico” program, which started in late 2018, bars non-Mexican immigrants from immediately entering the U.S. interior after claiming asylum at the U.S. southern border. Instead, the policy mandates they wait in Mexico as their cases make their way through the immigration court system.
The directive is aimed at the vast number of Central American migrants who have reached the U.S.-Mexico border and lodged asylum claims. President Donald Trump has maintained many of the asylum claims are bogus and used simply as a means to enter the U.S.
“Remain in Mexico” has currently been confined to only several ports of entry in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego. However, the homeland security secretary is now directing officers across the southern border to implement the more stringent program.
Nielsen asked lawmakers in a letter sent Thursday to Congress to make it easier for her department to swiftly deport unaccompanied alien children from Central America. The rise in families and unaccompanied minors attempting to cross the southern border has, according to Nielsen, overwhelmed existing resources.
“We are grappling with a humanitarian and security catastrophe that is worsening by the day, and the Department has run out of capacity, despite extraordinary intra-Departmental and interagency efforts,” her letter to Congress read. “Accordingly, DHS requests immediate Congressional assistance to stabilize the situation.”

Senate Republicans Set to Use Nuclear Option to Confirm Trump Nominees,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/senate-republicans-set-to-use-nuclear-option-to-confirm-trump-nominees/ ,"by Henry Rodgers
The Senate failed to pass a procedural cloture vote Tuesday that would cut Democrats’ time obstructing President Donald Trump’s nominees on the floor, making it likely Republicans will use the nuclear option to change the Senate rules.
The vote was set up by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday, with expectations that it would fail so that the nuclear option can be used. The motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed was shut down 51-48. However, since the cloture needs 60 “no” votes to fail, McConnell entered a motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote, which will likely be voted on later in the week.
The nuclear option would cut Democrats’ debate time from thirty hours to two hours, making the confirmation process for Trump’s nominees faster. Republicans would only need 51 votes to confirm a Trump nominee after the rules change.
McConnell called the Democrat’s actions “systematic obstruction” on the Senate floor Tuesday, saying it is “not targeted, thoughtful opposition to a few marquee nominations or rare circumstances. But a grinding, across-the-board effort to delay and obstruct the people this president puts up. Even if they have unquestionable qualifications. Even if the job is relatively low-profile.”
Other Republicans like Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said Democrats will oppose any nominee Trump puts forward, regardless of who it is.
“Over the past two years, some in this body have decided that they will oppose any nominee suggested by President Trump. There isn’t a senator in this room who serves their state’s interest when qualified, noncontroversial nominees are prevented from being confirmed,” Grassley said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “However, some members continue to do just that by slow-walking the president’s nominees for partisan purposes.”
“It is not fair to the American people. The American people deserve the government they elected,” McConnell said on the floor Thursday. “From an institutional perspective, as well all acknowledge, this is completely unsustainable.”
Senate Democrats, such as Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, have pushed back against the rules change, saying it is “an erosion of the Senate’s responsibility, in fact, our sworn constitutional duty to advise and consent,” on the Senate floor Tuesday.
Trump has previously called out Democrats for “slow walking” his executive nominees, saying “Democrats in the Senate are still slow-walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government,” in a February tweet . “Never been such an abuse in our country’s history.”
Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our country’s history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW!

Republicans gathered on Capitol Hill late Tuesday morning to announce their discharge petition to force a full House vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that has been repeatedly nixed by Democrats in Congress.
Physicians, abortion survivors and members of Students For Life joined House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Republican Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the news conference Tuesday to call for the protection of newborns who survive abortion.

— Claire Culwell (@claireculwell) April 2, 2019
Republicans will sign the discharge petition, H. Res. 102, — requiring 218 signatures — Tuesday afternoon in order to bypass Democrats’ continual refusal to consent to a vote on the bill. The move comes after dozens of rejected requests for a vote by Democrats. Scalise and Wagner first introduced the petition in February .
The petition will permit the House to vote with only an absolute majority.
The Born Alive Survivors Protection Act aims to ensure babies who survive abortion will be cared for after they are born by codifying that health care professionals must provide care to newborns who survive abortion. Physicians who violate the provision would face fines and prison time under the measure.

“Only about half of states have laws on the books that mandate physicians provide medical care in cases of an infant born alive after at attempted abortion, and protections that do exist for these babies are at risk, as we have seen in New York, Rhode Island and other states,” March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a Tuesday statement, according to a press release.
“Current federal law does not adequately protect a born child who survives an abortion and does not currently ensure that child will receive the same degree of professional skill and care to protect the newborn as would be offered to any other child born alive at the same developmental age,” Americans United For Life President Catherine Glenn Foster also said in a Tuesday statement.
House Democrats rejected the 20th request from Republicans less than a week ago for unanimous consent to vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio explained why certain sections of the Mueller report must be redacted and said Congress has a duty to protect classified material.
“You’ve got the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, saying ‘Go ahead and make public classified information,’ and then you have the chairman of the Judiciary Committee saying ‘Go ahead and make public grand jury material.’ Now that’s scary,” Jordan said on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday.
“This is where they’re at because the Mueller report was not the bombshell that they had hoped it would be. But when you have the head of the Intelligence Committee, the head of the Judiciary Committee saying, ‘Make public material that’s not supposed to get public,’ that’s not consistent with the law — that’s just wrong, just plain wrong.”
Jordan said keeping certain information classified will protect innocent people who’ve been caught up in the investigation , and it should be considered common practice.
“You don’t make that information public. That’s just consistent with who we are as a country. Total standard operating [procedure]. So Bill Barr said he will err on the side of transparency. He wants to release as much as possible. But he’s going to do it consistent with the law,” he said.
“So again, understand that this report was not what they had hoped. First, the Cohen hearing they had was a flop. Then the Mueller report comes out and it’s not the bombshell they hoped. Remember what Bill Barr said? Special counsel Mueller found new indictments, no sealed indictments, no collusion, no obstruction. As definitive as can you can get. Now what they’re saying is ‘We want to find something. We have to find something because we’re so committed to getting at this president and not focused on, frankly, doing what’s best for the country.’”

Trump Reveals Timeline for Up-in-the-Air GOP Health Care Plan,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/03/trump-reveals-timeline-for-up-in-the-air-gop-health-care-plan/ ,"by Evie Fordham
President Donald Trump put a timeline on his call for Republicans to develop a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Twitter Monday night.
“Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn’t work. Premiums [and] deductibles are far too high — Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance,” he wrote, adding , “[Republicans] are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) [and] deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words, it will be far less expensive [and] much more usable than ObamaCare.”
“Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate [and] win [back the House],” Trump wrote .
Leading Republicans have been echoing Trump’s ACA criticism but have not pointed to any tangible steps to reset American health care on a large scale. Trump’s declaration that “a really great HealthCare Plan” can wait until after elections in November 2020 grants them time and the possibility of a GOP-controlled Congress.
Trump has been focused on health care since his administration made news on that front March 25. That’s when the Department of Justice announced it sided with a December 2018 district court ruling that found the ACA violated the Constitution. Trump declared the GOP “will become ‘The Party of Healthcare!’” on Twitter March 26.
The Republican Party will become “The Party of Healthcare!”
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2019
Actions may be limited in a divided House. Trump has named three Republican senators, Rick Scott of Florida, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Barrasso of Wyoming, to spearhead health care efforts.
Cassidy is a familiar name in health care policy. He co-authored the 2017 Graham-Cassidy bill , an ACA repeal bill that would have restored power to individual states, with South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham.
Cassidy is also a major critic of the Medicare for all proposal backed by roughly 100 House Democrats. Trump claimed Monday night that the House’s Medicare for all bill would “cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance,” while Cassidy has said the bill would affect “150 million people … who are currently satisfied with their employer-sponsored insurance.”
Trump’s tweets show that he supports Republicans waiting until they control the House to pursue an ACA repeal. However, Republicans controlled both chambers in 2017 when they tried to fulfill campaign promises of repeal and replace — and failed. Some lawmakers including Republican Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman point to the importance of finding common ground between the parties in the meantime.
“Both political parties agree that the U.S. health care system is broken, so President Trump’s focus on health care is absolutely necessary as we in Congress craft legislation that will cover the most Americans at the lowest possible cost. … I’ve proposed a bipartisan solution — the Fair Care Act — that would cover preexisting conditions, lower premiums, and provide more consumer choices. I’ve already begun discussing these ideas with senators and I look forward to moving the bill through the legislative process, thanks to Trump’s renewed push for sustainable health care,” Westerman told The Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement Monday.

Why President Trump’s Executive Order on EMP Preparedness Is Huge,inhomelandsecurity.com,In Homeland Security Staff,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://inhomelandsecurity.com/executive-order-emp-preparedness/,"Get started on your Homeland Security degree at American Military University.
By Glynn Cosker Managing Editor, In Homeland Security
An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is one of the biggest threats to our national security, with worst-case scenarios showing a doomsday scene right out of an apocalyptic movie. However, President Donald Trump’s important March 26 executive order is a huge step toward making America prepared for an EMP.
EMPs are not a new concern. The Congressional EMP Commission has warned for nearly 20 years that an EMP is capable of destroying civilization and killing millions of people, but the Commission’s findings have largely gone unnoticed. President Trump’s executive order should make the nation take notice. President Trump’s EMP Executive Order
The Executive Order on Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Threats mandates that the White House take charge of national EMP preparedness. This order circumnavigates the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Energy (DOE).
Putting the White House in charge of EMP preparedness is a bold, but vital, component of the president’s executive order. Traditionally, cabinet departments – including DOE and DHS – have a long history of playing down the seriousness of the EMP threat . X
The new executive order states that the president’s National Security Advisor, coordinating with the National Security Council and the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, “shall coordinate the development and implementation of executive branch actions to assess, prioritize, and manage the risks of EMPs.”
President Trump’s executive order also directs DHS to liaise with DOE and other agencies, along with the private sector, to “develop a plan to mitigate the effects of EMPs on the vulnerable priority-critical infrastructures.” Rare Bipartisan Progress on EMP Preparedness
Getting an EMP preparedness executive order is one of those extraordinarily rare bipartisan successes on Capitol Hill. Republican and Democratic factions in Congress have emphasized for years how important EMP preparedness is, but past administrations were mostly indifferent.
Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and former Senator Jim Webb (D-Va.) have all led calls for EMP preparedness legislation. U.S. Representatives Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Doug Lamborn (D-Colo.) also played a big part, as did many other current and former lawmakers at the state and federal level.
“It is way past time to stop admiring this problem,” Sen. Johnson told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Operations Committee on Feb. 26, “and actually begin to do something concrete to protect our vulnerable electrical grid, control systems, and the ever- increasing array of electronic devices our society has become dependent upon.” EMPs Explained
So, why all of the concern and the need for national preparedness? An EMP is an intense surge of energy that interrupts, damages, or destroys all electronic devices on and above our planet. There are natural and manmade EMPs, but each type poses a huge threat to America’s national security and way of life. There is a real possibility of deaths on a scale rarely observed in human history.
The bottom line is this: The United States is prepared to deal with hurricanes, earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters; it is prepared to deal with foreign invasions, terror attacks and cyber-attacks. However, it is not ready to handle an EMP event.
The natural type of EMP, solar superstorms, happen quite regularly. In fact, there is a 10 percent chance of one occurring during any given decade .
During a solar superstorm, the sun emits a solar coronal mass ejection (CME), which causes a geomagnetic storm when it hits the Earth’s magnetosphere. These storms are usually weak and harmless, but stronger ones are a major concern. Strongest EMP On Record
The strongest geomagnetic storm ever recorded occurred in 1859 . Known as the Carrington Event (after one of the astronomers who first observed it), it took out primitive telegraph systems all over Europe and North America. Of course, there was zero reliance on electricity for anything in the mid-1800s.
If the same magnitude geomagnetic storm happened today, however, all electrically operated items would instantly stop working, and global positioning satellites and cell phone towers would fail. The internet would be down indefinitely, and the national electrical power grid would be gone for months. There is also a risk that without power to regulate essential functions, the nation’s nuclear power stations might suffer meltdowns.
No one can predict when the next strong geomagnetic storm will occur, but manmade EMPs are definitely avoidable and involve the possibility of a terror attack hundreds of miles above the United States. As recently as September, North Korea threatened such an attack . North Korea Producing Super-EMP Weapon
“An EMP attack might be made by a North Korean satellite, right now. A Super-EMP weapon could be relatively small and lightweight, and could fit inside North Korea’s Kwangmyongsong-3 (KMS-3) and Kwangmyongsong-4 (KMS-4) satellites,” Congressional EMP Commission Chairman, Dr. William Graham, warned last year . “These two satellites presently orbit over the United States . . . The south polar trajectory of KMS-3 and KMS-4 evades U.S. Ballistic Missile Early Warning Radars and National Missile Defenses, resembling a Russian secret weapon developed during the Cold War, called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) that would have used a nuclear-armed satellite to make a surprise EMP attack on the United States.”
Another terror EMP attack scenario involves the detonation of a nuclear warhead above the U.S. at a very high altitude . A terror EMP attack of this kind is extremely unlikely. The United States ready for any nuclear threat and would retaliate in kind, destroying any entity who even tried. An EMP and the Breakdown of Society
An EMP itself is not harmful to people, but its aftermath would cause devastating, long-lasting effects that could ultimately kill 90 percent of the U.S. population . Most deaths would be due to the shutting down of our entire essential infrastructure, including financial, medical, communication, transportation, food, water and sewer systems.
At first, the population would react as they do during any blackout. Soon, though, when it became apparent that the electricity would be out for ‘months,’ all hell would break loose. Oil refineries would shut down, gas stations would be gone, ATMs and bank cards would no longer work, phone communications would be out, the internet would be dead, water reservoirs would be contaminated, and the food and drugs supply chain would stop.
Emergency services, hospitals and law enforcement officials would become overwhelmed, and mob rule would ensue. The breakdown of society as we know it today would cause wide-scale death and destruction of biblical proportions.
Imagine a riot in a downtown city neighborhood, and then imagine that same riot taking over your entire city and state. It would look like ‘The Walking Dead’ without the zombies.
All of that is something that the United States should urgently take steps to avoid. President Trump’s executive EMP order is a good first action in preparing for one of today’s biggest threats to civilization."

Alinsky tactics are for destroying things, which is much, much easier than building or maintaining things.
Unfortunately, that's where we, as conservatives, are at a disadvantage. In this case, fighting fire with fire only burns the house down, which suits them fine. They WANT it burned down ... they believe that somebody will build them a wonderful utopia in its place, where nobody has to work and everybody eats for free. At least, nobody IMPORTANT has to work. Any rational person should realize that only some type of forced labor of the underclass (slavery) could support such a plan.
I do know what you mean, though. We must not be silent and polite any more. Our beliefs and our thoughts matter, time for us to speak them. We have the truth on our side."

Leftist nations of the past should be famous for murdering their own citizens for things they said and/or might say, but Americans are unaware since the left has controlled education and media for a century. We allowed them to take control of those institutions and were too dumb to see what they were doing with their power. It never occurs to more than 1% of American to take back the nation's education and media and ban government and the left from having any control or impact on them ever again.
Ben Stiller is not a good guy. He and thousands in the entertainment industry are leftist monsters who have manipulated democracy with ease since the birth of the movie industry about a hundred years ago. Democracy, free speech and liberty are going to vanish in a few years when we elect someone like socialist Bernie Sanders/AOC/Beto.
But democracy itself is the culprit, our Achilles heel -- and the main reason we're about to lose everything of value. In future, mob rule [democracy] will be avoided like the plague by people who want to live in freedom and prosperity. America as founded was NOT a democracy. Congress made it a democracy in 1929 and it's been downhill ever since."
