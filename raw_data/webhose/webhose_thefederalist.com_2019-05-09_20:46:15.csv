New York City Has A Good Legal Case For Mandating Vaccines,thefederalist.com,Elad Hakim,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/new-york-city-good-legal-case-mandating-vaccines/,"By Elad Hakim April 19, 2019
Five anonymous parents recently filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn Supreme Court against the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and its commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot. At issue is an emergency order making measles vaccinations mandatory, which opponents claim violates their religious beliefs.
Clearly, this is a highly sensitive issue, especially since the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn has been hit quite hard by this latest measles outbreak. Across New York City, just shy of 300 cases have been reported, many of those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. However, based on prior case law, the Brooklyn Supreme Court has compelling reason should it rule against the parents in this case.
In essence, the suit touches on the difficult question of when personal religious beliefs are outweighed by public safety concerns. According to the New York Post :
Mayor de Blasio on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over an outbreak of measles in Williamsburg and ordered mandatory vaccinations in the Brooklyn neighborhood under the threat of $1,000 fines — and even the possibility of forcible injections .
The unprecedented move, which covers more than 212,000 people living in an area covered by four ZIP codes, followed the diagnoses of 285 cases of measles in the city — mostly in Williamsburg — since October.
Under the order signed by Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, everyone who lives, works or attends school within the 11205, 11206, 11211 and 11249 ZIP codes and isn’t already immune to measles must be vaccinated within 48 hours.
Parents are responsible for getting their children vaccinated, and the only exception is for people who can prove they ‘should be medically exempt.’
Health Department inspectors will also visit Jewish religious schools to make sure that yeshiva students who haven’t been vaccinated ‘are being appropriately excluded [from school] under this order,’ Deputy Mayor of Health and Human Services Herminia Palacio said.
According to the Post , opponents to this order allege that the measles outbreak isn’t serious enough for the quick 48-hour vaccination requirement, since no deaths have been reported in the outbreak. They also allege that they are being forced to vaccinate for rubella and mumps, which they claim is risky, and that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine carries risks for children under 12 months of age and young women who may become pregnant.
The lawsuit claims that “the respondents’ emergency orders unnecessarily override the petitioners’ and their children’s religious practices and the children’s lawful exemptions from vaccination to attend school, which they have obtained in full compliance with Public Health.”
This is a very difficult issue, as it pits the right to individual autonomy, informed consent, and the free exercise of religion against the city’s need to protect the public. However, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s order appears to be somewhat well-supported from a legal perspective.
In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), the United States Supreme Court considered the issue of mandatory vaccinations with regard to a smallpox outbreak. In discussing the Jacobson case, the AMA Journal of Ethics explained:
There the Court ruled that the police power of a state absolutely included reasonable regulations established by legislature to protect public health and safety. Such regulations do not violate the 14th Amendment right to liberty because they fall within the many restraints to which every person is necessarily subjected for the common good. Real liberty for all cannot exist if each individual is allowed to act without regard to the injury that his or her actions might cause others; liberty is constrained by law. The Court went on to determine in Jacobson that a state may require vaccination if the board of health deems it necessary for public health or safety.
While people have varying opinions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, the question is whether such concerns and the decision not to vaccinate should outweigh the potential public health risks. The answer to this question, based on Jacobson , appears to be no. A subsequent question is whether the decision not to vaccinate based on deeply held religious beliefs should be protected when there is a risk or threat to the public.
Interestingly, as noted by Stat News , Jacobson did not involve a religious exemption from vaccination. In other words, the argument against mandatory vaccination revolved around the harmful effects of the smallpox shot on the plaintiff and his son. It had nothing to do with Jacobson’s religious beliefs.
According to Stat News, citing Wendy Parmet, a professor of public health law at Northeastern University, “multiple cases over the years have, if indirectly, created the impression that the Constitution does not enshrine the right to object to vaccination on religious grounds. It’s pretty clear there is no constitutional right to a religious exemption.” Moreover, according to The Jewish Star , some rabbis have opined that there are no legitimate religious grounds to oppose vaccination. There are, however, clear religious grounds to make vaccination of kids obligatory.
Undoubtedly, this case will slowly work its way through the court system. Of course, by the time it reaches the end of the road from a legal standpoint, the outbreak could be over. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how the courts handle this difficult and very delicate legal issue. Elad Hakim is a writer and a practicing attorney.

Revisiting ‘See No Evil’ From ‘Batman: The Animated Series’,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/revisiting-see-no-evil-batman-animated-series/,"April 19, 2019
Spoilers ahead .
“See No Evil” is the first episode in which a villain created for the series works well. Perhaps the creative team learned from reimagining Mr. Freeze for “ Heart of Ice ” that the key is motivation. In this episode, Lloyd Ventrix is an ex-con, but his new crimes are driven by a desire to reunite his family.
His behavior is a very recognizable sort of domestic criminality, though strong stuff for a show primarily targeted at children. The difference is Lloyd coming into possession of a suit which renders him invisible. The suit also affects Lloyd’s mind, though there may be a chicken/egg issue here.
The script by comics veteran Martin Pasko thus pays homage to H.G. Wells’“The Invisible Man” (1897), James Whale’s famous 1933 film adaptation, and even Paul Verhoeven’s “Hollow Man” (2000). These works also employ the trope of the mad scientist, whereas Ventrix steals his means of invisibility (perhaps influencing the character of Rodney Skinner in the film version of “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” from 2003). There is even a tangential discussion in “Shazam!” (2019) of whether invisibility is an inherently dark super-power.
The script is well-served by director Dan Riba and the voice talent behind the Ventrix family. Lloyd is voiced by Michael Gross, whose performance spans the warm father from “Family Ties” in the ’80s, the dishonest husband who landed in prison trying to recover his old life, and the increasingly deranged sociopath fueled by invisibility. His young daughter Kimmy is voiced by Elisabeth Moss, who would go on to “The West Wing,”“Mad Men,” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Lloyd’s ex-wife Helen is voiced by Jean Smart of “Garden State,”“24,”“Designing Women,” and The X-Men spinoff “Legion” (among many others). She brings a weary anger to her estrangement from Lloyd which grounds the narrative in reality.
The Dong Yang studio’s animation is also in the series’ top tier. Depicting an invisible man—and an invisible car—presents challenges in any medium, let alone a cartoon. Beyond these flashier moments, the detailed highlighting and shadowing of the characters brings artistry to what could be seen as a “small” Batman story. The Plot
Our drama opens in a downscale Gotham suburb. Kimmy talks to her “imaginary” friend Mojo, who is holding her doll in midair. Mojo gives Kimmy a locket and promises to bring her the pearl necklace she wants on his next visit. Kimmy tells Mojo she and her mother are moving soon for a better life, causing Mojo to drop the doll as his voice grows pained.
Helen opens the bedroom door to check on her daughter and chuckles upon learning Kimmy is talking to her imaginary friend. (The simultaneously innocent and creepy tones of this scene are enhanced by Shirley Walker’s score, though the reprise of Kimmy’s theme during a later action scene is slightly distracting.)
Kimmy’s imaginary friend is really her father Lloyd, who goes to the Gotham Jewelry Expo the next day. While Bruce Wayne considers buying a watch, Lloyd locks himself in a bathroom and dons a grey plastic suit which turns him invisible by pressing a button on his wristwatch. Lloyd then loots the jewelry vendors as stunned bystanders see valuables disappearing into thin air.
Batman pursues the invisible thief, who knocks down a guard and bursts through the exposition hall’s doors to a construction zone outside. Lloyd’s footsteps are revealed by wet cement. Batman uses a smoke bomb and a can of paint to locate and mark him. Lloyd uses the watch to re-energize his suit and burn off the paint. Lloyd then delivers a beating to the Dark Knight, leaving our hero collapsed in the wet cement.
The following day, Lloyd approaches Helen during her lunch at Goth-Mart. The dapper ex-con tries to convince Helen he is doing well on parole, while she reminds him she has a restraining order issued against him. He pleads to visit Kimmy, but Helen wishes he would disappear. As Helen storms out of Goth-Mart, Lloyd muses to himself that she should be careful what she wishes for. Batman’s Journey
Meanwhile, Bruce visits WayneTech’s optics lab to investigate an invisibility project he heard about the prior year. Lucius Fox (Brock Peters of “To Kill a Mockingbird,”“Soylent Green,” and “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home”) says the company was interested in working with a Dr. Karos, who withdrew his proposal before they could accept. Although Karos died a few months ago, his assistant Dr. Giddell still lives.
Batman breaks into Giddell’s lab to read files on the invisibility project and is briefly disabled when Giddell topples a bookcase on him. (This episode finds Batman repeatedly bested by people of normal strength.)
The Caped Crusader frees himself and questions Giddell, who claims the security guard will provide an alibi regarding the jewel heist. Batman notices a roll of plastic, prompting Giddell to explain that running electricity through filaments in the plastic bends light around the material, but also makes the plastic toxic—a problem Karos and Giddell could not solve. When Batman asks who else knew about the plastic, Giddell mentions Lloyd worked as the lab’s errand boy.
Batman warns Helen about Lloyd, while Lloyd invisibly kidnaps Kimmy by using the pearl necklace as a lure. At an abandoned drive-in theater, Lloyd tries to persuade Kimmy to get into his car, even revealing his disembodied head. Kimmy refuses, remembering her mother’s warnings about her father. This suspenseful scene benefits from its setting, a metaphor for the decline of the nuclear family and dissolution of the Ventrix family.
Batman, having discovered Kimmy was missing within minutes of the abduction, intervenes at the drive-in. Lloyd’s visble head allows Batman to floor him with a kick while Kimmy flees the scene.
Lloyd enters his car, which is covered in the special plastic and turns invisible upon starting. Lloyd tries to run down Batman in the drive-in lot. Batman jumps on the car’s roof, clinging desperately as Lloyd drives recklessly through Gotham traffic, removing part of the plastic and rendering the car partially visible. Lloyd ultimately crashes the car by driving off elevated train tracks. He delivers another beating to Batman, dismissing the masked detective’s warnings about the plastic.
Batman throws ninja Bat-stars at an old water tower in the rail yard, causing streams of water to reveal Lloyd’s location. The Caped Crusader takes full advantage to knock Lloyd unconscious.
A few nights later, Helen checks in on Kimmy, who says she was talking to Batman. Helen again dismisses this as an imaginary conversation as Batman makes his way from the Ventrix home. Aside from Helen’s odd disbelief, this final scene reminds us again of Batman’s concern for children. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois."
CNN Shows Zero Interest In Probing Conventional Wisdom On Watergate,thefederalist.com,Geoff Shepard,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/cnn-shows-zero-interest-questioning-conventional-wisdom-watergate/,"By Geoff Shepard April 22, 2019
CNN completed its four-part series on President Nixon last Sunday evening with a panel discussion between John Dean, Richard Ben-Veniste, Carl Bernstein, and Tim Naftali, led by Anderson Cooper. Last month, one of their producers had reached out to me, seeking someone to participate who would represent Nixon’s point of view.
The producer and I discussed the 39 documentaries, co-sponsored by the National Archives, that I’d helped to produce since 2010 on President Nixon’s various public policy initiatives, as well as my extensive research, writing, books, and lectures on the inside story of the Watergate scandal, where I served as deputy counsel during the last 10 months of the Nixon administration.
The producer assured me that CNN was committed to presenting a balanced view, but she never even called back, and I think I know why: I would have presented a dramatically different and disruptive point of view from the other pre-packaged panelists.
For example, I would have asked Dean, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 1-4 years in prison and disbarred from practicing law for his key role in the Watergate cover-up, why he was freed immediately after the cover-up trial (where he’d been the prosecutor’s lead witness) and had never actually spent a single night in jail.
While seldom mentioned, Dean’s leadership role in the cover-up included, in addition to obstruction of justice, rehearsing Jeb Magruder in advance of his perjured testimony in two grand jury appearances, embezzling some $4,000 of campaign funds from his office safe to pay for his honeymoon, destroying key evidence taken from Howard Hunt’s office safe, and improperly disclosing investigatory information to Watergate defense counsel.
I would have asked Richard Ben-Veniste, deputy of the special prosecutor’s Watergate Task Force and one of the lead prosecutors in the cover-up trial, just what was discussed in the secret meeting he attended between the four top prosecutors and trial judges John Sirica and Gerhard Gesell on December 14, 1973—just days after Sirica had turned over key White House tapes to the prosecutors.
I also would have asked how Ben-Veniste appears to have secretly assured Watergate grand jurors, as well as House Judiciary Committee staff, that President Nixon had personally authorized the blackmail payment to Howard Hunt, when he failed to prove that allegation in the later cover-up trial.
Finally, I would have asked just how he could have claimed, when the cover-up verdicts were announced, that “justice was done” when he knew of the whole series of secret meetings prosecutors had held with Judge Sirica, of prosecutors’ failure to share exculpatory information that would have seriously undercut the veracity of their two lead witnesses, and their highly improper indictment of Charles Colson (a prominent Republican) on the flimsiest of evidence, especially when coupled with their decision not to indict Hunt’s lawyer, William Bittman, who was far more culpable.
I would have asked Carl Bernstein, who admitted in 2012 that he and Bob Woodward had lied about not having interviewed Watergate grand jurors and had misrepresented their stories in “All the President’s Men” as having been sourced from interviews with re-election committee secretaries. I would have asked how he could have claimed after the Watergate convictions that “the system worked, the American system worked,” when Watergate trial judges met in secret with prosecutors and other interested parties on at least a dozen occasions.
A specially recruited, 100-person team of highly partisan officials, whose top 17 lawyers all had served in the Kennedy/Johnson Department of Justice, postponed any Watergate indictments while they launched investigations into every aspect of the Nixon presidency, sent IRS and FBI agents to interview some 150 GOP donors to the 1970 midterm elections, and investigated (and leaked the results from) each and every potential GOP candidate for the 1976 presidential election, including Jerry Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, Bob Dole, and even Ronald Reagan—none of whom had even the remotest connection with the Watergate scandal.
I would have asked Tim Naftali, the disgraced archivist who was the first director of the Nixon Library, just how it was that he produced a hugely one-sided Watergate exhibit, without even the merest mention of any of the above improprieties, when I had brought them to his personal attention in our many meetings over the prior year.
No, CNN had good reason not to include me on this panel: I would have brought up many, many issues and incidents that would challenge conventional wisdom about Watergate.

"No, Men Don’t Need Cuddle Parties To ‘Fix’ Their Masculinity",thefederalist.com,Libby Emmons,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/no-men-dont-need-cuddle-parties-fix-masculinity/,"By Libby Emmons April 22, 2019
Rage against traditional masculinity has been swift and fierce over the past half decade. From the proliferation of privilege theory that casts men as the top perpetrators on the power food chain, to hashtag movements like #MeToo and “the future is female” branding, to claims of toxicity, masculinity has taken quite a beating.
Men’s rights activists and organizations are derided and laughed at, while the women and men who take up the helm are critiqued for what is perceived as their reactionary views. When men jump on board with practices that are traditionally feminine, they are lauded, applauded, and signal boosted. Enter the male-only cuddle party, the men, and the psychologists who love them. Yes, People Do Need Touch
Chick flicks, sitcoms, and jokes about post-coital practices would have us believe that cuddling is entirely the purview of women, but we know for sure that human beings need to be touched, meaning men, too. It’s a basic human need. For those in solitary confinement, or the elderly, the hunger is more pronounced, and the lack of touch debilitating. For men without partners, spouses, or sexual contact, a demographic a recent Washington Post article revealed is on the rise, this lack of human contact can contribute to feelings of isolation.
Perhaps that’s why an educator at Pennsylvania’s Lehigh University recently jumped into the fully clothed cuddle pile in support of the local Men’s Therapeutic Cuddle Group in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. Dr. Christopher Liang, who teaches a gender, race, inclusion, and trauma lab at Lehigh, believes that men’s cuddle groups can redefine masculinity. This statement is predicated on the assumption that masculinity itself is problematic, and needs redefinition.
Cuddle parties have been a mainstay of the intimacy industry for years, making waves and rolling eyes from Silicon Valley to Brooklyn. Touted by Cuddle Party as “a playful social event designed for adults to explore communication, boundaries and affection,” a cuddle party is decidedly non-sexual, and rooted in the idea that human beings crave to touch and be touched. But is touch so far from the realm of masculinity that for men to engage in it is to redefine the term?
Liang was one of the creators of the American Psychological Association’s first-ever “Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men.” In a release from Lehigh, he advocated for the Men’s Therapeutic Cuddle Group as something that “can do a whole lot of good” for men. If what he means by “a whole lot of good” is based in the concept of masculinity that is elucidated in the guidelines , then “good” is the opposite of what’s being put forward. Which Parts of Masculinity Should Be Scrapped?
Noted psychologist Jordan Peterson, of “12 Rules for Life” fame, assessed these guidelines for us laypeople, and concluded that “the authors are claiming that men who socialize their boys in a traditional manner destroy their mental health.” He goes on to say “that men who encourage their boys to be ‘self-reliant, strong and manage their problems on their own’ destroy the mental health of their children” and “produce adults who are a primary menace to their families and society.”
Is that what Liang means when he talks about redefining masculinity? Does he want to deconstruct masculinity to the point where it is not commonplace to teach boys to be ”self-reliant, strong and manage their problems on their own”? Even men who cuddle need to know how to get stuff done; they can’t stay all day in the cuddle pile. Men need to be able to address threats, they can’t be constantly vulnerable, because that vulnerability can harm their ability to compete in the world.
Unlike Cuddle Party, which is designated as a charitable organization by the IRS and has upcoming parties in Australia, Ireland, California, New York, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington, the Men’s Therapeutic Cuddle Group is an amateur affair. It was founded a few years ago as a means to help men cope with stress, trauma, and the desire to express a masculinity that was not inherently toxic. A co-founder of the group, interior designer Scott Turner, was quoted as saying, “So often, we’re taught that to be an emotional stoic is the mark of manhood. If you show any emotional weakness or vulnerability, that’s a failure to your title of a man.”
Femininity and masculinity have come under fire all over the place in recent years. Femininity in females is either considered a weakness or is cause to objectify them, while masculinity in men is perceived as harmful or toxic. Through it all, men are getting the message that there’s something wrong with being traditionally masculine, but there isn’t. Men are being asked to step aside, make room, and take stock of those attitudes they have that have contributed to othering and objectifying, and to cede power and influence to, well, not men. Vulnerability and Masculinity
It’s a mixed message, however, because while men are being asked to be less traditionally masculine, they are still held to the standards of that masculinity. The cuddle group is an opportunity for men to explore their emotional side with platonic affection, and for the men in the group, this seems to be a valuable undertaking. Men in the group use the new form of closeness as a means to deal with past trauma, learning to be vulnerable, and finding the language to ask consent. The problem is in assuming that being masculine means entirely hiding vulnerability, whereas masculinity contains within it the burden of taking existential risks.
My grandmother read parenting books during her time mothering four young children in the 1950s. The books told her to keep her children at a distance, not to hold them or cuddle them. She did as the books dictated, until she couldn’t anymore. She scooped up her children, cuddling them, holding them, covering them with kisses. She said it made her feel like a bad mother to disobey the book, physically showing love to her children.
The problem isn’t that culture tells men vulnerability isn’t masculine enough, or that standards of affection need be at arm’s length. The problem is that we negate, at every turn, what it means to be human, and to love. Touch is not anti-masculine; it never was. Masculinity doesn’t need to be redefined, nor does femininity.
These are valiant forces in culture that are viable expressions, with usefulness, and weight. Before they are destroyed, we need to know what is proposed to replace them. If the new rubric is one in which men and women are interchangeable, with neither able to take true risk, embark upon dangerous quests, or cover each other with kisses, we won’t like the loveless world we wind up with.

"If You Really Care About The Earth, Don’t Buy Earth Day Gear From Everlane",thefederalist.com,Libby Emmons,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/really-care-earth-dont-buy-earth-day-gear-everlane/,"By Libby Emmons April 22, 2019
This year for Earth Day, do something truly revolutionary to show your support for raising awareness about climate change: buy a sweatshirt from Everlane! Everlane has teamed up with The New York Times, and the result is cotton wear. Purchasing just one of these T-shirts or sweatshirts will fund New York Times subscriptions for nine public school students in the U.S.
Emblazoned with the word “Truth,” these shirts in subtle, naturalish tones simply scream awareness. They’re the kind of T-shirts that can really make a person feel good about his contribution to reducing planetary waste, and his carbon footprint. But that’s only because the wearer has convinced themselves of that, not because the shirts actually do anything worthwhile.
Clothing retailer Everlane touts “Exceptional quality. Ethical Factories. Radical Transparency.” They have a pay what you wish program, where selected items are for the low price of pretty much whatever you want. Their website is as in-depth on their factories and employee appreciation programs as it is on their $100 cashmere collection. The gear they move looks pretty nice, and it’s even refreshing to see a company take responsibility for its human impact.
The New York Times has been vocal on the present and future effects of climate change. For all of their in-depth research and reporting, however, they don’t do much coverage of efforts to adapt to climate change. Instead, they issue dire warning and retributions, excelling in efforts to raise awareness about how humanity must stop the very progress that has generated the wealth necessary to alleviate poverty.
Times staff wrote the verbiage for the shirts: “Truth. It affects us all. What we buy. What we put on our plates. What we recycle. What we waste. How we travel. How we stay informed. What we talk about. What we know. How we understand climate change. The truth is worth it.” Of course truth is a dicey term these days, where it’s been appropriated from noun to adjective (truthy, anyone?), and everyone seems to have his own.
If Everlane really wanted to give New York Times subscriptions to dozens or even hundreds of school children, it would be substantially more sustainable to provide those subscriptions without unleashing a whole batch of new, wastable clothing upon the world. The only problem is that simply funding some news subscriptions wouldn’t do anything for their marketing, or for consumers who want people to know just how much truthiness they are on board with.
What good are clothes if they can’t show everyone how much you believe in sustainability? So what if you’re participating in an industry that contributes exponentially to the worldwide waste chain? The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the average American tosses 81 pounds of clothing are tossed each year, and that despite the potential for up to 95 percent of textiles to be recycled, 85 percent end up in landfill.
Fast fashion, decline in clothing quality, and a perpetual trend cycle contribute to the drastic increase in clothing manufacturing. The swell in cheap clothing means that it can easily be jettisoned at the end of any number of micro seasons when the stitching wears out, the color fades, or the fashion is no longer relevant.
Getting rid of clothing that no longer fits, is no longer worn, or is no longer stylish, is also part of our self-congratulatory consciousness. Just as we are encouraged by big retail to buy until our closets are glutted with unwearables, we are encouraged to throw it all out, ideally via recycling programs or in the form of charitable donations.
How many truth-labeled, altruistic, cotton T-shirts and soft terry sweatshirts made by Everlane for the benefit of The New York Times’ proliferation in public schools will end up in landfill just a few, short years from now, or even months? Will the “Truth” label, and the virtuous sound bites, still be legible when the clothes are boxed, packed on barges, and sold in textile markets in the developing world? With they feel as quippy and righteous when they land in heaps of solid waste on the tall, growing mountain of our discarded textile trends?
If Everlane and The New York Times had actually considered this joint endeavor before manufacturing the clothing, they might have come up with the even more sustainable idea of just not doing it at all, and providing student subscriptions without having to make a whole bunch of T-shirts about it. This useless undertaking is all about the visual virtue, and not about the actual goal at all, which at its best is education, and at its worst is mere marketing.

Why Abortion Never Works Onscreen Even Though Hollywood Desperately Wants It To,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/abortion-never-works-onscreen-even-though-hollywood-desperately-wants/,"By Ellie Bufkin April 22, 2019
Abortion has recently become a tremendously popular topic in movies and television. Movies like “Gosnell” and “Unplanned” attempt to show the ugly reality of the abortion industry, highlighting the dangers to the mothers, the unscrupulous practices of the clinics, and—most importantly—exposing the reality that an abortion extinguishes a human life.
These movies absolutely have an axe to grind, and their impact is undeniable. Meanwhile, much of Hollywood keeps trying to use abortion as something light and funny.
Outside of films that are specifically exposing the abortion industry, however, abortion has also found its way into the narratives of movies and shows that use it as entertainment and even fodder for jokes. Sitcoms like “Shrill,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “GLOW” all featured characters choosing to get an abortion in the wake of an unplanned pregnancy.
In these instances, the shows’ mission is quite clear: to advance the idea that ending the life of an unborn child is a casual medical procedure. Why shouldn’t we joke about it? Abortion Portrayed as No Big Deal
According to the shows’ narratives, the women who choose to abort are modern, strong feminists. Their babies are disposable because—to them—they are just inconvenient clumps of cells that can so easily be flushed away in the name of empowerment.
Although previously considered taboo, abortion did appear as a dark plot point in many films and shows over the years. Famously, in “Dirty Dancing,” a character has an illegal abortion at a dirty clinic and becomes infected. The whole affair is ugly, deeply emotional, and certainly no means to add levity or romance to the situation.
In “High Fidelity,” a character chooses to have an abortion in an act of desperation after the failure of her relationship. Later in the movie, she bursts into tears when she is casually asked by her ex-boyfriend if she ever wanted to have children. There was nothing casual about these storylines.
It’s the recent call to celebrate abortion as a woke rite of passage from movements like #ShoutYourAbortion that has changed the entertainment landscape. Abortion on film used to be quite uncomfortable; it was meant to be. It was a way to make the audience feel intense loss with the characters. It set a tone of tragedy and peril.
However, in last week’s episode of the HBO comedy “Veep,” a character chooses to have an abortion after deciding the baby’s father was too immature to date. Taking a cue from other recent comedy arcs, the show treated the entire arc like one big punch line. The character, Amy, even refers to her unborn child as a “baby” before she ultimately chooses to end his or her life.
“Veep” is known for its quick-witted, sharp-tongued writing and has consistently claimed that no subject is off limits for jokes. Staying true to their word, the trip to the abortion clinic included a confrontation with pro-life protestors, jokes about not wanting to see an ultrasound, and telling someone on the phone that her schedule was just “scraped clean.”
In reality, most fans of Amy and her unborn child’s father, Dan, were hoping for a baby . Progressive filmmakers, showrunners, and writers may have set their sights on pushing casual abortion as a fan-favored plot choice, but they may be in store for a cold reality. Most fans want a happy ending; they want to see the baby. Hollywood’s New Favorite Plot Twist
Being pro-abortion is not new for Hollywood. Replacing a bouncing happy baby with a joke-filled trip to the abortion clinic is.
Even in a 2017 episode of the HBO show “Girls,” created by noted abortion enthusiast Lena Dunham, the main character becomes unexpectedly pregnant and ultimately decides against an abortion. Perhaps this creative choice was meant to show how her character developed and matured over the series run, but more likely, it was written this way because who wants to see a baby die on TV?
“Girls” had a smaller story in an earlier season when a lesser character has a very casual abortion, barely mentioning it to her boyfriend after she returns from the procedure. The boyfriend has an emotional outburst in a state of complete disbelief, and is never able to look at her the same way. They break up soon after. This isn’t the epilogue to abortion that abortion-is-power feminists would have you believe.
Pro-abortion people want everyone to think abortion is nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing to feel sad about. The fact is that abortion is an awful, ugly tragedy in any situation, no matter if you believe it should be legal or not.
“Awful, ugly, and tragic” aren’t exactly the adjectives that match a happy conclusion. There is also no adorable, crying baby to bring all the characters together at the end of the story. There are many examples of otherwise very liberal shows and movies choosing the pro-life plot, simply because killing babies does not make a good story.
In “Sex and the City,” Miranda becomes pregnant with no intention of keeping her baby, and viewers were led to believe that she has gone through with the abortion until the very end of the episode. In a classic tear-jerking moment, we find out that she is keeping the baby. Another character goes through the episode reliving her long-ago abortion, wondering what life would be like with her child, reflecting on a choice she cannot unmake. For a show that was all about glamorizing carefree sex, they had a decidedly unglamorous take on abortion, handled with nuance.
In “Juno,” a charming teen becomes pregnant while still attending high school, and even plans to have an abortion. However, she finds the abortion clinic so offputting, and is partially persuaded by a protester outside, that she decides to continue her pregnancy and explore adoption. Similarly, “Knocked Up” finds the humor in an unplanned pregnancy, even showing how the developing baby starts to change and soften the parents before she is even born.
The fact is that the reality of abortion simply does not match the pro-abortion belief that it is easy and casual. Creating a story where a fictional character has no feelings about her abortion does not reflect reality. Writing snarky jokes does nothing to conceal the image of a character in stirrups at an abortion clinic having a tiny life sucked out of her. No matter how much fans believe that abortion should be legal, they’ll never root for a character to not have the baby.

Why The So-Called Equality Act Is A Bait-and-Switch Power Grab,thefederalist.com,Stella Morabito,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/called-equality-act-bait-switch-power-grab/,"By Stella Morabito April 22, 2019
Let’s place ourselves, for a moment, into the mindset of a statist. If you and your cronies wanted to control everybody’s lives, how exactly would you go about getting such raw power? Obviously, you wouldn’t come right out and say you have a special project designed specifically to cement a permanent one-party state.
You wouldn’t explain, full disclosure, that the ever-growing bureaucracy you have in mind would promote a surveillance state and coercion that produces toxic levels of social distrust. You wouldn’t clarify that the point is to keep tabs on everyone in every aspect of their lives, including their education, their businesses, their medicine, their housing, their families, and their churches.
No, of course not. You would mask your self-supremacist intentions with a benign and trendy word like “equality.” You’d pretend that your project was about helping a vulnerable minority. To prevent scrutiny, you’d quickly shame anybody who had a question about it and defame them as haters. At the same time, you’d give special favors to those who can be persuaded to support your con job.
That’s usually how such things are done, as the history of authoritarian systems proves. Sowing a Colossal Inequality of Power
So we have the “ Equality” Act , recently introduced by Democrats in Congress. It’s currently being considered in various committee hearings and is on track for a floor vote in the House of Representatives later this spring or early this summer.
On the surface, the “Equality” Act is supposed to protect LGBT folks from discrimination by adding the categories of sexual orientation and gender identity to all federal civil rights laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It would make claims of discrimination related to these characteristics legally actionable in the way racism is, and aapplying to virtually every area of life: the workplace, education, banking, jury service, federal funding, housing, medicine and psychiatry, and all public facilities.
It is a power grab in the guise of anti-discrimination. A bait-and-switch. It’s another attempt by a ruling micro-clique to exert mega-control over everyone else’s lives, including those it purports to protect. It allows the Mass State to maximize bureaucracy and social engineering, especially by its huge regulation of speech and expression. It erodes individual rights while claiming to uphold them.
Sane people of goodwill have a host of good reasons to object to the so-called Equality Act. And many of those reasons have been written up, including the de-sexing of toilets and showers, the compelled speech inherent in pronoun protocols and severe punishment for “ misgendering, ” the promised harassment of business owners, the invasion of girls’ and women’s sports by biological men who force on them an unequal playing field, the utter contempt for individual conscience, and more.
The net result of this act would be a huge inequality of power accrued to the state and drained from the individual. Below I offer five general reasons to object to this legislation.
I think they give us a more macro view of how it would destabilize a free society, by 1) undermining the First Amendment; 2) threatening the rule of law; 3) nudging us towards a social credit system; 4) redefining humanity; and 5) enshrining identity politics in law. In short, the “Equality” Act doesn’t really protect anybody. It undermines human freedom and dignity by legally stripping Americans across the board of inalienable rights. 1. It Undermines Everyone’s First Amendment Rights
Our First Amendment freedoms of religion, speech, press, and association are clearly targeted by the “Equality” Act. It explicitly invalidates the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act so that anybody caught in this bill’s legal web is pre-emptively stripped of the right to express his or her conscience without loss of liberty and property.
So the mask is off. All prior promises of conscience clauses in past incarnations of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) laws are hereby exposed as bait intended only to push through bad laws until conscience protections could be abolished.
This act would suspend the right to free expression in secular daily life. There can be no question that it will lead to compelled speech . One huge hint is the 2015 New York law that compels speech by slapping a fine of up to $250,000 for the crime of using a sex-matched pronoun on someone who doesn’t want that. Federal law would take a page from Twitter, which suspends the accounts of users who are viewed as not compliant with transgender politics.
Freedom of association would also take a big hit. With its emphases on perceptions of gender identity (both self-perception and one’s perceptions of gender identity), a defendant who may have been perceived to raise an eyebrow can be threatened with loss of livelihood and even jail time. It’s bound to sow social distrust and a fear of guilt by association with a defendant.
It will also have huge repercussions for freedom of association. As I’ll note below, the Equality Act would erase sex distinctions in law, which means open war on family relationships. We’ve already seen a court removing of parental custody of a minor child identifying as transgender for refusing to have their child injected with powerful hormones.
It also places Big Brother into the therapist’s office by banning any sort of talk therapy that might lead to a patient undoing a transgender decision or going from gay to straight, even if the patient wanted to do so. This one-way street goes under the moniker “conversion therapy,” which the “Equality” Act explicitly bans.
Nevermind that there are already plenty of laws against coercion and medical malpractice on the books. A ban on so-called conversion therapy uses a few cases of malpractice essentially to ban open conversations with a cognitive therapist. This is not the sort of law a free people seek. It is reminiscent, however, of the sort of law cult leaders have always sought to prevent people from leaving the cult. 2. The Ambiguities in the Bill Threaten the Rule of Law
The first thing that should hit any reader of the so-called Equality Act is the ambiguity of its language, especially with the bill’s outright emphasis throughout on “perceptions.”
We should ask ourselves: How does the rule of law survive such intangibles? The bill is set up to pass harsh judgments on how people are perceived or how people perceive things. Such haziness is guaranteed to create wide latitude for an arbitrary system of punishment and rewards, with no regard for (or even much possibility for) due process. It would have to calculate your intent, read your mind, check out your body language, pick you apart for any suggestion of malice.
It injects into numerous federal anti-discrimination laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a new protected class that is defined not by an immutable and noticeable characteristic like race and sex, nor of a person’s religious beliefs, which are inherent to First Amendment protections.
Instead, the newly injected category is “LGBT,” which refers to an entire panoply of personal relationships, social activities, attitudes, and various feelings of identity that can change from day to day. Granted, LGBT activists have succeeded in getting numerous state and local SOGI laws on the books. But a blanket fiat on the federal level is certain to open wider floodgates of abuse in interpreting and punishing any perception of discrimination, real or imagined.
Consider how much the “Equality” Act would rely on bureaucratic and court actors to divine the “perception” of the perpetrator or victim of so-called discrimination: it would have to calculate your intent, read your mind, check out your body language, pick you apart for any suggestion of malice. For example, it repeatedly refers to sexual orientation and gender identity as “ actual or perceived.” Many times throughout, the text notes that discrimination (or identity?) involves “ perception or belief even if inaccurate ” (emphasis mine).
This dependence on perception or belief about a person’s self-identity did not exist before. The language of this proposed law is more fluid than gender fluidity on steroids, and it’s wild stuff to push, especially at the federal level. It invites no end of accusations and lawfare that bodes ill for society and promises much human wreckage. The only people “empowered” by such a scam are those on the upper levels of this newly devised food chain who can call the shots. 3. Nudge Toward a Chinese-style Social Credit System
If passed, we shouldn’t be surprised if it eventually produces a social credit system not unlike what is happening in China , whereby your livelihood, education, career, mobility, and access to goods and services is based on a literal “score” of your compliance with government policy. To paraphrase Sir Richard Scruton’s excellent observation of how that works in China, I’d say that the so-called Equality Act would help create robots out of Americans, with the state programming what they can say and do.
As more people self-censor because of the risk of losing their livelihoods and social status, they simply become more prone to robotic compliance and conformity with limits on their speech. This is fast becoming the case in China, where citizens feel the need to build up their “social credit” to be allowed access to jobs, education, housing, and who knows what other goods and services. The so-called Equality Act’s restrictions on First Amendment freedoms would be a big step in that direction.
A social credit system that scores you for conformity would be a logical effect of the intent of the Equality Act: to punish free expression in just about every sphere of life, including the workplace, at school, in the public square, and in all public facilities, and any place that might be connected with federal funding. (By the way, Scruton was punished —stripped of his chairmanship of an architectural commission in Britain—simply for explaining what the social credit system does to people in China. That should be another lesson for us here.) 4. Redefining Humanity By Outlawing Sex Distinctions
The “Equality” Act is de-humanizing because it essentially de-sexes all of us in law. It does so in two ways. First, it abolishes the legal definition of sex as a physical reality by incorporating both sexual orientation and gender identity—which means your perception of your sex—into its very definition of sex. Wherever the term “sex” appears in federal anti-discrimination law, the so-called Equality Act parenthetically adds the words “including gender identity and sexual orientation.” Eliminating sex distinctions in law is the most effective path to abolishing state recognition of biological familial relationships.
Second, the act embeds a premise into its definition of gender identity that tells every American that his or her physical sex should not be legally recognized as real. Here’s its definition: “The term ‘gender identity’ means the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerism, or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth.”
The key phrase here is “regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth,” which means that genitalia, or any distinction between male and female, would be irrelevant to any legal definition of sex. Many SOGI laws use the phrase “sex assigned at birth.” Either way, the premise is the same: physical reality has nothing to do with your maleness or femaleness.
This premise would apply to everybody universally, not merely those who choose to believe in a gender spectrum. More jurisdictions like Oregon are allowing people to opt out of sex distinctions altogether on official identification. With such laws, your sexual identity is deemed to be all in your mind, even if your perception is aligned with physical reality. So your sexed body essentially becomes unrecognized in law .
We should note that eliminating sex distinctions in law is the most effective path to abolishing state recognition of biological familial relationships. Once we no longer recognize male and female as distinct legal identities, any family relationships based on those distinctions—mother or father, son or daughter, husband or wife—fade away. 5. It Enshrines Socially Destructive Identity Politics
The so-called Equality Act depends entirely on a spirit of resentment embedded in identity politics. Identity politics can be summed up as the belief that your worth as an individual depends on your politically correct victim status. Identity politics have been a plague on the nation, dividing and pigeon-holing everyone.
Increasingly, it relies on the concept of “ intersectionality ,” which scores your status according to which groups you belong to by race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, and so on. If you are perceived as “white” and heterosexual, for example, gurus of identity politics will deem you guilty of “white privilege” in an effort to smear you and cut your voice off from public discourse.
Those who push identity politics rely heavily on promoting stereotypes and caricatures of people with no interest in getting to know people as individuals. Thus identity politics have been a plague on the nation, dividing and pigeon-holing everyone instead of allowing citizens to aspire to live happily as unique individuals with unique personalities.
This erases the intrinsic worth and dignity we all have as human beings. The regime of identity politics doesn’t allow people to interact freely with one another, which would allow us to achieve the sort of social balance we would need in order to optimize social harmony.
If members of Congress succumb to the toxins of identity politics by passing this act, they will have done enormous damage to the health of American society. In the end, it means that our worth would be assigned to us by the state, as is done in all authoritarian systems. The Mass State Decides What Equality Means
The reasons I list above all come down to one trenchant point worth repeating yet again: this proposed law is a thinly veiled power grab by statists. The LGBT demographic is simply the victim group used as their pawn, their vehicle, the means to that end.
For the moment, people who identify as LGBT might seem protected by it, but if enacted, the law is designed to generate a hydra-headed monster of the Mass State that will take on a chaotic life of its own. It’ll mete out “protections” by whim. In the end, it just won’t protect anybody.
That’s because those running the show won’t be concerned about anything but maintaining the unchecked power that measures such as this ambiguously worded bill would bestow upon them. Any bureaucrat or judge can simply cherry pick from the act’s wording to decide whether you qualify as “equal, unequal, or something else.”
George Orwell’s novel “Animal Farm” included the maxim that “some animals are more equal than others.” Along with the 1984 slogan “Slavery is Freedom,” Orwell could easily have predicted the “Equality Act.” It’s a weird new world.

"Why Relocating Illegal Aliens To Sanctuary Cities Is A Brilliant, Win-Win Idea",thefederalist.com,J. Michael Waller,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/relocating-illegal-aliens-sanctuary-cities-brilliant-win-win-idea/,"By J. Michael Waller April 22, 2019
Until the border wall with Mexico is built, what do we do with the illegal immigrants already in federal detention, and the million more expected to cross into our country this year? Nobody had any idea what to do.
In making an amnesty deal with Democrats, as rumors say his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are brokering, Trump risks angering his base by allowing tens of millions of foreign law-breakers to move ahead of those who respected our country’s laws and people by applying for citizenship lawfully.
Then, out of the blue on April 12, President Trump tweeted a win-win solution: Relocate foreign trespassers to states and communities that have already voted to welcome them. “We are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only,” he tweeted.
His law-and-order supporters seemed stunned. His critics suspected a vengeful trap. Few saw it as what could become the most magnanimous gesture of his presidency.
The president’s controversial move offers a political jackpot to liberals and socialists from coast to coast. Within a matter of months, Trump would expand leftists’ constituencies in states and towns that voted to become “sanctuaries” for illegal immigrants. Even better, this idea would grant sanctuary to countless foreign citizens from the frigid clutches of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No sanctuary area is known to have placed a cap on the number of people it would welcome, so the opportunities are endless.
Trump has taken “winning” to a new level. Under his plan, everybody wins. Legal and constitutional hurdles stand in the way, to be sure. But the nation needs an interim solution, and Trump has found it. What This Grand Compromise Would Accomplish
First, the illegal immigrants would be sent only to progressive locales that celebrate diversity and inclusion with official sanctuary policies. This is means the poor, huddled masses wouldn’t be trucked to hurtful, bigoted, and racist communities in red states and other places with more respect for the nation’s laws. And they can stay as long as they like.
Many of those sanctuaries are among the nicest places in America. Foreign law-breakers can relocate to the posh and overwhelmingly white Nassau County, New York, or the Washington, DC suburb of Montgomery County, Maryland. Or much of the Pacific Northwest.
Trump’s political opponents would win bigly, too. The president’s plan would instantly expand his top opponents’ base of minorities to cultivate and aggrieve. Trump would instantly make sanctuary cities and states more ethnically, linguistically, and socially diverse.
Like Nassau and Montgomery counties on the east coast, the median income in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s sanctuary San Francisco district is in the six figures. Moving in thousands of illegals will lower the median income level to something more in line with the rest of the world’s. How about that equality.
Trump’s plan doesn’t neglect rural America. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ sanctuary state of Vermont is a shocking 95 percent white. By receiving thousands of new illegal immigrants every year, the Green Mountain state’s pale-faced population would quickly become browner and more diverse. And, because Vermont’s population growth rate is just one-quarter the national average, the sanctuary relocation plan would provide more workers to strengthen the state economy.
The Trump plan miraculously caters to special interests that oppose one another. California’s besieged agriculture industry, about to be wrecked by a $15-an-hour minimum wage, will receive new influxes of illegal immigrant laborers they can pay under the table, and the feds won’t be able to do a thing. Meanwhile the dying United Farm Workers union, whose members keep leaving in droves, could get a fresh injection of dues-payers.
The compromise would help Democrat political machines keep control in cities and states, but, because the sanctuary states themselves are already progressive, the population increase would have no effect on the Electoral College. Win-win again. Let’s Have an Equitable Distribution of Law-Breakers
The Center for Immigration Studies has compiled a list and interactive map that could guide where the illegal immigrants can live. According to CIS, eight entire states have become sanctuaries: California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont.
Let’s presume that, without a wall on the Mexican border, 1 million illegal aliens will cross into the United States in 2019 and every year thereafter. That’s what the trendlines suggest right now. The above eight states total about 81,130,000 residents. For equitable distribution, each state will receive 8,113 illegal immigrants for every million current residents. Here’s how an equitable relocation formula can work: California, with 39,776,830 residents, would receive 322,709 illegal immigrants in 2019; Colorado, with 5,684,023 residents, would receive 46,114; Illinois, population 12,768,320, receives 103,589; Massachusetts, with 6,895,917 people, takes 55,947 illegal immigrants; New Jersey, population 9,032,872, gets 73,284; New Mexico: sparsely populated with 2,090,708, houses 16,962; Oregon, with 4,256,350 residents, takes in 34,532; and Vermont, population 623,960, absorbs 5,062 illegal immigrants in 2019.
Of course, cities, counties, and towns in many of the other 42 states have declared themselves sanctuary zones. Targeted distribution to sanctuary cities, towns, and counties would spread the wealth beyond entire sanctuary states. So we would recalculate the distribution of illegal immigrants to all sanctuary jurisdictions.
Baltimore has almost the same population as the state of Vermont, so including sanctuary cities in addition to the eight states lowers the distribution ratio below 8,113 illegal immigrants per million citizens. Major population centers like New York City (population 8.5 million) and nearby Nassau County (1.7 million), plus Albany, Ithaca, and four other counties have declared themselves sanctuaries, but the rest of New York has not.
Those jurisdictions alone add another 11 million-plus people to the 81 million in the eight sanctuary states, So the per-capita distribution would go even lower. How to Pay for Everything
ICE can use current taxpayer funds to move the illegal immigrants to sanctuary localities, in a makeshift compromise between enforcing federal law (to detain and deport) and respecting state and local law (jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement), and deliver the immigrants directly to those states and communities. It’s a curious twist that allows big-government progressives to enjoy federalism, too.
The sanctuary states and communities would develop their own policies to cover the costs of settlement and welfare. Sanctuary state and local taxpayers would bear sole responsibility for funding what they voted to enact.
As with federal funding of state and local highways and schools, recipient communities are obligated to abide by federal laws and regulations to receive federal funding. They are not forced to accept federal money, but if they do accept, they must observe federal laws and regulations. For example, states must enforce the federal alcohol drinking age of 21 to receive federal tax dollars for roads, or Department of Education provisions to receive federal school funds. Those practices, in place for decades, are no longer controversial.
Since sanctuary locales, by definition, violate or refuse to observe federal laws, such jurisdictions logically forego federal taxpayer funding. This is fair to the taxpayers in jurisdictions that did not vote for ignoring federal laws.
This Trump compromise, if one accepts the gravity of what’s becoming a national crisis, is both consistent with the founding principles of states’ rights and local self-government. That should appeal to federalists. And it prevents federal intrusion into sanctuary states and localities should they wish not to obey federal law, a curious twist that allows big-government progressives to enjoy federalism, too. So it’s win-win. C’Mon, Democrats, Don’t Be Bigots Now
There are, of course, occasional mean-spirited people who oppose the Trump compromise.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced it as “vengeful.” She sounded as if, in her heart, she doesn’t really find illegal immigration an enrichment of the diverse social fabric of America. Indeed, some critics sound like they find the very thought of illegal immigrants being relocated to their own communities repulsive.
“I understand helping struggling immigrants but my city (Los Angeles) isn’t taking care of its own,” clucked Cher the entertainer two days after Trump raised his plan. “What about the 50,000+ citizens who live on the streets?” she tweeted (edited for clarity). “People who live below poverty line & hungry? If my state can’t take care of its own (many are vets), how can it take care of more?”
Trump knew he’d bridged the political gap. He had achieved the impossible by finding common ground. The president tweeted back, “I finally agree with Cher!” J.

"All 21 Marvel Superhero Films, Ranked",thefederalist.com,John Cooper,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/all-21-marvel-films-ranked/,"By John Cooper April 22, 2019
When Marvel kicked off production on “Iron Man” more than a decade ago, few would have thought they were creating a movie that would birth a shared cinematic universe spanning more than 20 films, grossing more than $18 billion to date, and changing cinema forever. With “Avengers: Endgame” set to arrive later this month, it’s worth looking back at how far they’ve come by ranking every film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Let’s go in reverse order, starting with the worst. The Pretenders
21. “Captain Marvel”
Let’s jump right in with a hot take: “Captain Marvel” is not a good MCU film. In fact, it’s quite possibly the MCU’s weakest. A thoroughly uncharismatic lead? Check. Plot holes large enough to pilot a Quinjet through? Check. Underwhelming action set pieces? Check.
While the majority of MCU films have delivered likable characters and memorable moments, this film was shockingly short on both—a shame given Carol Danvers’ iconic status.
20. “The Incredible Hulk”
Many fans hesitate to count Edward Norton’s take on “The Incredible Hulk” as part of the MCU, but hey, Tony Stark shows up at the end, and you can’t forget Gen. Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, who comes back later to make life difficult for the Avengers. This Hulk film is basic stuff, but it’s entertaining enough. I definitely prefer Mark Ruffalo’s take on Bruce Banner, though.
19. “Ant-Man”
This one will also get me in trouble with the fans, not only because everyone loves Paul Rudd (seriously, how does he manage to always look so young?), but because I rank it below “Ant-Man and the Wasp.” And if Marvel films have taught us anything, it’s that the sequel is almost always worse. But this one just feels cookie-cutter (looking at you, Corey Stoll), and while it has some enjoyable moments, the film is fairly forgettable.
18. “Thor: The Dark World”
This film gives us a better introduction to Asgard, something we didn’t really get the first time, and Thor springing Loki out of prison is entertaining, but this film didn’t really deliver much else, with a generic, under-developed villain as its chief fault. “The Dark World” was very much emblematic of the early-Phase 2 MCU.
17. “Iron Man 3”
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WITH THE MANDARIN!? Sorry, am I yelling?
Seriously, though, why? This film could have been so, so good, but director Shane Black decided to undercut all dramatic tension with some very poor story-telling decisions. Tony finally coming to realize that he, not his suit, is Iron Man, is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy’s arc, but wow, what a missed opportunity.
16. “Iron Man 2”
We take for granted how successful this series ended up being, and much of the credit should go to Jon Favreau. This film is weaker, of course, than its predecessor, and man, is Sam Rockwell annoying as Tony’s nemesis. But Favreau’s style shines through in genuinely funny quips and his effort to show us a superhero grappling with, and overcoming, his own limitations. The Good Ones
15. “Doctor Strange”
Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange is impeccable casting, bringing just the right amount of cynical realism, balanced with scientific hope, to the role. This film was the first in the MCU to really introduce us to magic, and it’s a fun ride.
14. “Black Panther”
“Black Panther” is a solid film, and I walked out of the theater very pleased. It has many engaging components, like the Busan sequence and solid performances from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, and Martin Freeman. On subsequent viewings, though, it gets weaker. The third act is visually messy, and this film continued the MCU tradition of killing off compelling villains after one feature performance. RIP Killmonger and Ulysses Klaue.
13. “Ant-Man and the Wasp”
That’s right, it’s the rare sequel that’s actually better than the original. The stakes are higher in this installment, and the characters’ motivations are relatable. Evangeline Lilly is a criminally underused talent in the MCU. This film also took the best aspects of the first, like the X-Con Security crew, led by Michael Pena, and built on them.
12. “Thor”
Quite possibly the most underrated film in the MCU is “Thor.” (No, I’m not kidding. Yes, I will fight you.) The “fish out of water” plotline is a great way to introduce us to Chris Hemsworth’s charismatic version of the character. Another underrated part to this film? While many of the MCU films have very forgettable scores, Thor’s theme is iconic and incredibly moving.
11. “Captain America: The First Avenger”
If “Thor” isn’t the most underrated MCU film, this one is. Perhaps more than any other MCU character, I am always struck how Steve Rogers is good for the sake of being good, and how that affects everything he does. It makes his conflict with Tony even more believable, and it makes me always want to root for him, even if he may be wrong about something. That all starts in this film.
10. “Captain America: Civil War”
If Marvel wasn’t going to follow the true “Civil War” storyline, this was a good alternative. The conflict between Cap and Tony is real, the set pieces are fantastic, and we get some extra depth we’re not used to in a Marvel film. Hopefully we get more Zemo in the next phase.
9. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”
Volume 2 may never reach the classic, take-the-world-by-storm status as the original, but it never ceases to make me laugh. Drax’s constant one-liners, Baby Groot, and its subversion of expectations with the famous “Assemble!” circling shot are just a few of the highlights. Still waiting for that Adam Warlock payoff, though.
8. “Avengers: Age of Ultron”
While it didn’t live up to the original “Avengers” hype, there are plenty of things to love about this film, like Tony breaking out the Hulkbuster armor, Thor finally getting a chance to shine, the personalization of Hawkeye, new characters in Scarlet Witch and Vision, and, of course, James Spader as Ultron. The finale is entertaining, too.
7. “Spider-Man: Homecoming”
You wouldn’t think the third Spiderman in two decades would really be a breath of fresh air, but Tom Holland proved everyone wrong. Kudos to Marvel for skipping the backstory and putting us right into Peter Parker’s high school world, with Tony there to be a guiding hand. This movie isn’t “epic” like some others, but it doesn’t need to be. The Elite
6. “Guardians of the Galaxy”
The minute Chris Pratt started playing “Come and Get Your Love,” I knew I was going to enjoy this movie. Marvel took a huge chance pouring millions into this film, and wow, did it ever pay off. “Guardians” made me laugh from start to finish, the chemistry between the leads is strong, Lee Pace is an underrated villain (although again, Marvel, come on), and even a simple cameo from Thanos is chilling.
5. Marvel’s “The Avengers”
Besides “Iron Man,” no other film in the MCU has had such cultural impact. What Marvel did in this film had never been done before, but its success changed cinema for the better. So much of the MCU as we know it today stems from what Marvel created in this film, from the plotlines, of course, to the interpersonal relationships that are still paying off in films seven years later. And honestly, can you beat the “Avengers Assemble” shot and that theme?
4. “Avengers: Infinity War”
As much as “The Avengers” introduced us to superhero team-ups and launched so many interwoven storylines, “Infinity War” represents the near-culmination of those stories, and of those character arcs. It’s a beautiful movie to watch, and moments like Thor’s arrival on Wakanda are chill-inducing. Of course, Thanos as the lead villain does not disappoint, and hey, he’s even still alive for a second movie!
3. “Thor: Ragnarok”
I didn’t think an MCU movie would make me laugh just as much as the Guardians films. I was wrong. I was chuckling to outright laughing throughout this entire film. Hemsworth absolutely knocks this performance out of the park, Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster was a revelation, finally getting the reconciliation between Thor and Loki was moving—and that ‘80s vibe in the score is spot-on.
2. “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”
This was Marvel’s first real attempt at a genre film, and the Russo brothers nailed it. The spy-thriller approach worked perfectly for a movie featuring Cap, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and The Falcon. The concept that S.H.I.E.L.D. had just been a front for Hydra for decades was not only a game-changer for the film, but changed the course of the MCU. The score for this movie is also underrated. A near-perfect film.
1. “Iron Man”
Was there ever any doubt? The one that started them all, the one that introduced us to Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, reigns supreme as the top MCU film. I still remember seeing this with friends on opening night in college, and having an absolute blast.

"Barbara Bush’s Diaries Make Me Want To Tweet Less, And Journal More",thefederalist.com,Stephanie Green,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/why-barbara-bushs-diaries-make-me-want-to-tweet-less/,"April 22, 2019 By Stephanie Green
It seems that Barbara Bush, who died a year ago this month, was more Bridget Jones than Mamie Eisenhower. Caustic. Funny. Vain. Spiteful. These are just a few of the adjectives that come to mind as I read Susan Page’s new biography of the first lady, “The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty.”
Behind the pearls, sun hats, and spaniels, there was a woman sometimes living in opposition to herself, a tension revealed by a habit that now sets her apart, a throwback pastime that’s been excised by social media—the art of diary keeping. Page was given unprecedented access to Bush’s diaries, which date back to 1948, and include entries just days before her death.
This is where the feisty Barbara (the one I prefer) emerges: “My-oh-my it was a tense evening,” she writes about a dinner at the White House just days after the chaotic election of 2000 that, after weeks of hanging chad chaos, put her son in the Oval Office.
“What absolute nerve, “she fumed about then-President Bill Clinton. “He was impeached because he lied to the American people. I have come to the conclusion that he really does not know right from wrong.” Ouch.
Here’s another Barbara-barb. “Aren’t we a funny country? We all go to each other’s funerals and Library openings. At the funerals you can see people thinking like the cartoons with a bubble over their heads: This guy was a rotten lying mean guy and all these liars are saying these nice untrue things about him.”
The diary was a way for her to sheath her views from an intrusive public, ever more ravenous for the first lady’s thoughts on all manner of social issues percolating in the ’70s and ’80s. “The elected person’s opinion is the one the public has the right to know,” was Bush’s default talking point, but she retreated into her private world of note taking to weigh the pros and cons of the issues.
“Thoughts on abortion,” she scribbled on the page. “When does the soul enter the body is the #1 question,” the diary reads. “If the answer to that question is the moment the first breath is taken, then abortion is not murder. What does Barbara Bush feel about abortion,” she continued in the third person.
She also used her diary as a therapist, confiding in it her perceived shortcomings as a woman. “They discussed how to make me snappier,” she revealed about campaign operatives who wanted her to be more Dynasty-era glamorous. “I know it was meant to be helpful, but I wept quietly,” she wrote.
These entries are relics of a bygone era, much to the disadvantage of historians and biographers. Presidents and first ladies of today and tomorrow have their social media accounts, but they reveal what they want us to see—not the raw, the frail, and the inner workings of their minds.
Bush is often compared to Abigail Adams, the only other woman who had a husband and son who became president. Her best legacy, however, is another commonality between the two women: their penchant for the written word. Recall those “Remember the Ladies” letters she wrote to her hubby during the height of the Revolution.
Here’s a sampling from her return voyage to America in 1788: “further to be known from the page of History. I do not think the four years I have past abroad the pleasentest part of my Life. Tis Domestick happiness and Rural felicity in the Bosom of my Native Land, that has charms for me. Yet I do not regreet that I made this excursion since it has only more attached me to America.”
I am just as guilty as the next millennial for letting Instagram usurp my proclivity for writing. I did, however, journal about a trip to France last year, and will squirrel my notebook away in the hopes that one day my grandchild will find it amusing. My musings mostly centered on the historic places I saw, and my minor irritations in coach. I’ll never reach the heights of Abigail’s 18th-century eloquence.
The photos on my social media accounts tell, literally, a filtered story, much like Bush’s public appearances. But a diary allows you to go deeper, reflect honestly, and record your unvarnished voice in a given moment, even if it falls short of Abigail’s prose, and Barbara’s acute insights.
After seeing how Bush’s life (and those of her precursors) was so enriched by this written conversation with herself, I’ve decided to tweet less, and journal more — if for no other reason than to savor experiences, and relish in the fact that I’m still here. As Bush wrote, “Amazing life. Lucky lucky me.” Stephanie Green is journalist in Washington.

Amazon’s ‘The Tick’ Is Better Than The Superhero Movies It’s Parodying,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/amazons-tick-better-superhero-movies-parodying/,"April 22, 2019 By Nathanael Blake
Earlier this month, Amazon released season two of “The Tick”—the delightful superhero spoof we need amidst today’s surfeit of comic book adaptations and their endless advertising barrages. If you want to laugh about our glut of superhero shows and movies, “The Tick” is for you.
The title character is a big blue superhero with mysterious memory loss, a sense of destiny, and a penchant for off-kilter heroic patter (“the mystery of me is an onion with many leaves”). Played with earnest, bombastic perfection by Peter Serafinowicz, the Tick doesn’t know much, but he knows heroes, villains, and dramatic narrative: “Destiny is doing the folding, and we are her origami swans.” The Tick’s cognitive deficits are compensated for by sidekick Arthur (Griffin Newman), a scrawny, traumatized accountant with a high-tech flying suit the Tick looted from bad guys at the start of the series.
Having vanquished villains and established themselves as heroes in season one, the Tick and Arthur are now confronted by superhero bureaucracy in the form of A.E.G.I.S. This is a funhouse version of comic book agencies such as Marvel’s S.H.I.EL.D. It seeks to assess, assist, and monitor superheroes, who also get a nice lounge with free Wi-Fi and delectable pastries.
This turn to the government creates tension between the protagonists. While the Tick breaks testing machines and chafes at inaction and filling out forms, Arthur has no powers without his suit (which he can’t entirely control) other than a knack for paperwork, but he is awed at being part of A.E.G.I.S. The Tick, despite his childlike excitement and enthusiasm for almost everything new, meets agents and heroes as colleagues, while Arthur struggles to keep his fanboy impulses under control.
The new characters at A.E.G.I.S. join a familiar supporting cast, from Arthur’s family to the vigilante Overkill, who is despondent that he can no longer live up to his name because the Tick made him promise to stop killing people (“If Overkill can’t kill people, then he’s over, man”). Superian—a discount Superman—also returns, suffering from social media-induced depression and angry at his cable news critics.
As for the dark side, season one’s villain, the Terror, is on ice for season two. This sidelines a truly great bad guy, but it is a pleasing contrast to the usual practice of supervillain catch-and-release—some comic book asylums might as well have revolving doors. However, the Terror’s “human Tesla coil” henchwoman Miss Lint returns, and new villains rise.
The stage is set for drama, comedy, heroes, villains ,and some surprisingly cute moments with lobsters. Standard tropes are mined for laughs, such as when Arthur infiltrates an underground gambling den—instead of glamour and glitz, there is just a bumbling accountant trying to be suave.
Secret identities are a difficulty. The Tick doesn’t have an alternate identity, and Arthur’s is a little too obvious, which leads to him losing his job. Per his boss: “We’re simply not insured for your kind of hobby.” Arthur may be inept at having a secret identity, but other characters can manage it, so the second half of the season indulges in a game of masks, as secret identities and superpowers are revealed all over the place. It’s a bit silly, which is the point.
Yet perhaps because the characters live in an absurd world, playing them earnestly gives them pathos beyond that of standard comic book fodder. For a superhero comedy, “The Tick” is surprisingly character-driven. Perhaps not having enormous sums of money to spend on CGI forced the show to do a better job of character development. This is why, in a genre where almost anything can be undone and even death is rarely permanent, “The Tick” still manages to feel like it has real stakes, in contrast to Marvel, which killed off half of its heroes without anyone caring.
Although the villains are often cartoonish, season two closes with a suggestion that some of them had a point— perhaps an alien superhero is not the savior humanity needs, especially if that leaves mankind a superhuman mental breakdown away from extinction.
The new season of “The Tick” is easy viewing, with 10 episodes at about 25 minutes each. The show has also toned down the profanity and violence from the first season, dropping from a TV-MA rating to TV-14, putting it on par with most of the material it is parodying.
But “The Tick” is more fun than the big-screen, big-budget spectacles it satirizes. It works to get details right, from the Tick’s emotive antennae to a cola commercial in the background. It provides laughs, and it uses the all-too-human weaknesses of its characters (including the superhuman ones) to craft better dramatic narratives than are found in the explosion extravaganzas ruling the box office.

Why Chip And Joanna Gaines’s Ubiquity Holds Perils And Promise,thefederalist.com,Casey Chalk,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/chip-joanna-gainess-ubiquity-holds-perils-promise/,"By Casey Chalk April 22, 2019
I can’t escape Chip and Joanna Gaines, just named two of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people . Everywhere, including every grocery store checkout counter, I’m greeted by the smiling faces of the co-founders of the popular HGTV program “Fixer Upper.”
When I recently visited my aunt in southern Virginia, she had a copy of Joanna’s magazine, The Magnolia Journal, full of recipe and home decor recommendations. On a recent drive to visit my in-laws, Joanna’s visage was on billboards all down Interstate 85, advertising her products at a regional furniture chain.
In Atlanta I discovered her 2018 bestselling book, “Magnolia Table: A Collection of Recipes for Gathering,” on my mother-in-law’s coffee table. During our stay, my television-starved wife (we don’t have cable) kept tuning in to the “Fixer Upper” marathon. Although the pervasiveness of the couple’s influence can seem a bit overwhelming, there’s good reason we should hope and pray that the Gaines craze stands the test of time. A Family Standing for Good in the Public Square
The Gaines are most famous for their five-season HGTV hit show “Fixer Upper,” in which Chip, the construction expert, and Joanna, the home designer, work with clients to buy and remodel homes in the area around Waco, Texas. The last episode aired in spring 2018.
This is only one of many of their entrepreneurial enterprises . Chip apparently has business deep in the blood: he’s bought a neighborhood laundromat and talked a bank into a loan for equipment to start a lawn-mowing service. The couple opened the first “Magnolia Market” in 2003, where Joanna developed her design style and skills. After a couple of kids, they closed their shop and focused on Magnolia Homes, their construction business.
They reopened Magnolia Market, which they soon outgrew, replacing it with Magnolia Silos in downtown Waco. They also now have multiple books and a magazine , and are planning to develop their own television channel .
Although it is never explicitly communicated in their many business ventures, a deep conservative vein runs through everything they do. “Fixer Upper,” for example, was premised on the concept of taking some of the ugliest lots in Waco and turning them into something beautiful. Yet Joanna always sought to preserve whatever artifacts and parts of the buildings could be reused, including one of their favorites, shiplap.
Joanna also routinely relied on local antique stores to provide home decor, as well as local businessmen to build custom features. As they explain, “We loved the idea that we were ‘making Waco beautiful one home at a time.’”
They succeeded in spades, and have, quite amazingly, made the local community life of Waco something attractive for viewers watching from coast to coast. Did I ever think I would turn to my wife and utter the words “Maybe we could live in Waco”? More fundamentally, they’ve created a template for how Americans can foster and renew pride in their local communities.
The Gaines model conservative values in other respects. They now have five children, after Joanna gave birth to their latest in 2018 — something for which they’ve taken heat from the liberal side of their fanbase. This is at a time when the United States’ birth rate continues to decline , now at 1.8 children per woman, well below replacement level.
Data shows that the people more like to have more children are more likely to be religious and live in red states (and be politically conservative). The Gaines are also practicing Christians, attending Antioch Community Church in the Waco area. In another sign of their religious convictions, Chip took several of their children to an evangelical ministry in Uganda in 2018. The Danger of Selling Your Life
The Gaines have shared much of their lives with their fans and customers — their stories, their personalities, their family, their passions, even some of their character flaws . This is a dangerous business, fraught with threats. Selling one’s life, as the Gaines effectively have done, risks a backlash against any perceived flaw or failure.
Indeed, many fans criticized the couple for attending a church that teaches homosexual behavior is sinful, and whose pastor has been outspoken in opposing same-sex marriage . For those in the entertainment industry, associating with such an organization can spell doom and destruction. Other websites have catalogued every little controversy that has ever haunted the couple. Chip has acknowledged that at times he felt “trapped” in the grind of their popular television show.
The Gaineses, in many respects, have placed themselves in a tenuous position by offering their lives and persons for public consumption and scrutiny. It would not take much to wreck all that they have worked to accomplish.
Not long ago, my wife saw the Gaineses featured on the front cover of the tabloid In Touch Weekly . I’d wager money that any future controversy will result in a front-page story. One can imagine many scenarios that could cause the sinking of the Gaines image and industry. God knows we’ve seen plenty of examples of popular conservative-leaning celebrities who have suffered an unceremonious dethroning from their seat atop pop culture. Why Supporting the Gaineses Matters
What the Gaines family has offered America over the last several years is singularly unique. They’ve presented the country with a creative, fun-loving, hard-working, religiously devout family at the top of their game. In the process, they’ve made a lot of money, and earned incredible respect and devotion from an ever-widening fan base.
Americans — and humans, for that matter — love people to celebrate and cheer for. Unfortunately, as we so often witness, Americans love a good controversy, and have demonstrated a deep, ever-capable willingness to kick their heroes to the curb if they violate certain social standards or mores. Often such topplings are justified, but they can just as easily be cruel and unfair.
This is why we should offer our moral support and prayers to the Gaines family. Saturation must feel great for a brand, but it also poses dangers, such as becoming a fad, or making a bigger target for opponents. But what they stand for is an amalgamation of much of what is good about America: entrepreneurial tenacity, strong moral character, a devotion to one’s family and home community, and an abiding faith in God.
I wish them my deepest regards for their success. For as long as they stay in our country’s limelight, it means there’s still a chance for the conservative way of life to be considered a legitimate source for good in our nation’s public square.

How Jordan Peterson Lost His ‘Debate’ Against Slavoj Zizek,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/jordan-peterson-lost-debate-slavoj-zizek/,"By David Marcus April 22, 2019
It was billed as an intellectual clash of the titans. On one side, Jordan Peterson, the tsk-tsking Canadian psychology professor who is the fastest-rising public thinker in the world, and a lodestar for the directionless (mostly directionless men). On the other was Slavoj Zizek, the Slovenian philosophy professor who has, for decades, broken down everything from Kant to Lacan to pop culture with some of the most fascinating, if often haphazard, ideas of his time. Excitement was in the air last Friday in Toronto as they squared off for a live audience and paying livestream audience around the world.
The debate was titled “Happiness, Capitalism vs. Marxism.” As the title gives away, this was not really a debate in any usual sense of the word. There was no proposition, no affirmative or negative to defend or argue. Rather, this was a wide-ranging discussion around the ideas of capitalism and Marxism, instead of a head-to-head analysis of which is superior in promoting happiness, whatever that is. This is something that Peterson did not seem to understand, and that misunderstanding threw him badly off track right from the start.
The format was 30-minute opening remarks, followed by 10 minutes each for rebuttal and then a question and answer period. The Canadian guru of cleaning your room and defeating your dragons went first. This was a major disadvantage. Peterson, who seemed out of sorts, was tripping over himself, and engaging in long awkward pauses very unlike his usual style. He laid out 10 reasons why the Communist Manifesto is an absurd document.
As these kinds of surveys go, it was not bad. It finally landed on the reasonable idea that Karl Marx is envisioning a dictatorship of the proletariat to replace the power of capitalism, and assuming, without evidence, that the proletariat are good and the capitalists are bad. Yet everywhere, these dictatorships have turned into brutal killing machines. It was a very good college lecture. It was not, however, an assemblage of ideas that could compete with the rhetorical powers Zizek would next bring to bear.
Almost immediately Zizek made clear that he would not be playing the same game as Peterson. He opened by decrying how both of them have been condemned by the academy’s political correctness. Then he forayed into a more nuanced discussion of the relative value of capitalism and Marxism in creating happiness. His opening salvo was cutting and important. It was China. Peterson had extolled the virtues of capitalism in terms of raising people out of poverty, but so too has communist China over the past two decades, so how can this be explained?
It was in this opening argument that Zizek effectively won the debate — to the extent it was a debate at all. Peterson had trapped himself into a zero-sum game, Zizek had opened up a universe of overlapping ideas, taking in economics, politics, and even tech. At one point he wondered how an unbridled free market could avoid pursuing biotech, genetic manipulation, and bio hacking that will almost certainly create a new apartheid between high-tech wealthy supermen and the world’s poor trapped in frail and faulty human bodies.
By centering his arguments on the comparative value of each economic and political system to create happiness, Zizek gave a far more compelling account of both. His opening was by far the most interesting half hour of the nearly three-hour event. By the time he was done, Peterson seemed a little stunned. He opened his rebuttal by admitting his opening statement had effectively been rendered useless. He thought it was because he had misunderstood the terms of the debate, and maybe he had, but he had also been swept into Zizek’s rhetorical web, and there wasn’t much of a way out.
Peterson did have a very good moment in the question and answer period, something of an own goal by Zizek. The Slovenian polymath insisted that Peterson name actual Marxists on the progressive academic left. His point seemed to be that identity politics, often called postmodern neo-Marxism, is not and never has been real Marxism, which focuses almost solely on class rather than identity.
Peterson tore this assertion to shreds, deftly explaining that, after the atrocities of Stalin and Mao became apparent in the late 1960s, continental philosophers like Foucault, who had been avowed Marxists, needed a change of course. So they simply replaced class with identity but maintained the same Marxist systems and power structures in their philosophy. It was a lively and fun exchange.
When the debate becomes available for free streaming in a few weeks, it’s worth a watch if only because it is entertaining. Peterson and Zizek almost come off like an intellectual comedy duo. The former is the straight man, tall, thin, in a perfect suit, pacing and reading notes off a laptop, his gestures limited to the flickering of fingers while making a point. Zizek the comedian (he was much funnier) is bulky, unkempt, tugging at his shirt and nose like a cokehead while seated reading from sheets of paper. They could not be more different, but somehow complimented each other.
All in all, our society can use more of this. Seeing two thinkers who delve as deeply into our modern society as Peterson and Zizek do creates enormous fodder for all of us to consider our place in that society. In a world that operates so much on the surface, three hours of deep philosophical talk is a welcome breath of fresh air.

Islamic Terrorism Remains The World’s Greatest Threat To Peace,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/islamic-terrorism-remains-the-worlds-greatest-threat-to-peace/,"April 22, 2019 By David Harsanyi
After the horrific mass murder of 50 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch , New Zealand, there was widespread coverage and a torrent of mainstream news networks contemplating the threat of white supremacy. These conversations, completely reasonable and necessary in the face of violent attacks from a racist gunman, soon began deteriorating into politically motivated and specious claims contending that “white supremacy” had become the predominate terror threat in the world.
Well, the coordinated bomb blasts aimed at Christian worshippers on Easter Sunday, which killed at least 290 people and injured hundreds more, demonstrates the kind of meticulous planning, funding, resources, and support that is still exclusively the domain of radical Islamic terrorism. It’s not merely that the act was planned to maximize the death toll, but that it is a continuation of long-standing efforts by Islamists to destroy the Christian communities left in Asia.
Those who kill in the name of Islam are part of a worldwide, historic, ideological, and political movement that includes, to various degrees and various reasons, radicalized men and women from both great factions of the faith. Then again, terrorist groups—as well as their recruitment and propaganda outfits—are often functioning in Islamic regimes, which either actively sustain terror , tolerate these groups, or pay them off to engage in terrorism elsewhere.
The Christians who remain in the Islamic world are often oppressed in other ways. In a number of these nations, publicly praying in any faith but Islam is forbidden and, in many, converting to Christianity is still punishable by death. “ Islamic extremism remains the global, dominant driver of persecution, responsible for initiating oppression and conflict in 35 of the 50 countries on the list,” according to Open Doors, a worldwide Christian group.
The idea that a similar threat exists in the West is risible. There’s not a single Western country that doesn’t afford Muslim citizens the same rights it does as all other citizens. No government on Earth supports white supremacy.
There is no funding infrastructure for those who support white power. There is no Christian or Jewish denomination, or any notable political factions, in those nations that imbue white supremacy with any theological or ideological legitimacy. There is no white supremacist government trying to obtain nuclear weapons, and none sending their terrorists to other countries. In the world’s free nations, where any political party can participate in the process, the power of racist groups is minimal.
Yet the American left continues to downplay the danger, first by arguing that Islam has nothing to do with Islamic terrorism, then by lumping every white-skinned person who commits a terrorist act into one imaginary coherent political movement to contrast against it. It’s true that Americans have been spared much Islamic terror since 2002—a year that, curiously, nearly every graph media uses to measure domestic terrorism starts—but only because we’ve spent billions of dollars each year and immense resources, both in lives and treasure, keeping it out of the country and fighting it abroad.
Another reason the majority of Americans might not comprehend Islamic radicalism’s reach is the skewed intensity of the media coverage. Political correctness and a chilling fear of being labeled “Islamophobic” makes it difficult to honestly report on terrorism around the world.
In addition to the massacre this Easter in Sri Lanka, at least 200 Christian civilians have been murdered in Africa by Islamic militants thus far in 2019—many of them killed by machete, some by bombings. Many more Christians have been murdered during the past calendar year.
In November 2018, for example, 42 people were slaughtered in an attack on a Catholic mission in the Central African Republic. In October, 55 Christians were murdered by a group of Islamists in Nigeria. Another 29 were killed when 10 churches were burned down in Ethiopia last summer. Another seven Coptic Christians were gunned down in Egypt—and others spared only because of the good work of police .
There are pockets of racists in the world, and individuals who engage in terrible acts of violence against innocent people. These are dangerous men, capable of doing tremendous damage . But no group threatens global peace the same way that political Islam does. None has its reach or material and theological support. None has created more mayhem and death in the world since the end of the Cold War. The Sri Lankan massacre is just another harrowing reminder."

Medicare Report Reality-Checks Bernie Sanders’ Socialist Delusions,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/medicare-trustees-report-reality-checks-bernie-sanders-socialist-delusions/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 23, 2019
Many of the left’s policy proposals come with the same design flaw: While sounding great on paper, they have little chance of working in practice. Monday brought one such type of reality check to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and supporters of single-payer health care, in the form of the annual Medicare trustees report .
The report once again demonstrates Medicare’s shaky financial standing, as the retirement of 10,000 Baby Boomers every day continues to tax the program’s limited resources. So why would Sanders and Democrats raid this precariously funded program to finance their government takeover of health care? Medicare’s Ruinous Finances
Before even dissecting the report itself, one major caveat worth noting: The trustees report assumes that many of the Medicare payment reductions, and tax increases, included in Obamacare can be used “ both ” to “save Medicare” and fund Obamacare. In practice, however, sheer common sense suggests the impossibility of this scenario—as not even the federal government can spend the same dollars twice.
The last trustees report prior to these Obamacare gimmicks, in 2009, predicted that the Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) Trust Fund would become insolvent in 2017—two years ago. To put it another way, under a more accurate accounting mechanism, Medicare has already become functionally insolvent. Obamacare’s accounting gimmicks just allowed politicians (including President Trump) to continue to ignore Medicare’s funding shortfalls , thus making them worse by failing to act.
Even despite the double-counting created by Obamacare, the Part A Trust Fund faces significant obstacles. Monday’s report reveals that the trust fund suffered a $1.6 billion loss in 2018. This loss comes on the heels of a total of $132.2 billion in trust fund deficits from 2008 through 2015, as payroll tax revenues dropped dramatically during the Great Recession.
Worse yet, the trustees report that trust fund deficits will continue forever . Deficits will continue to rise, and by 2026—within the decade—the Trust Fund will become insolvent, and unable to pay all of its bills. Replacing One Decrepit Program with an Even Worse One
Another little-noticed element of the report also hints at the problems single-payer supporters face. For the third straight year, the trustees issued an “excess general revenue Medicare funding,” further illustrating the program’s questionable finances.
In 2003, House conservatives included this mechanism in the Medicare Modernization Act, which requires the trustees to make an annual assessment of the program’s funding. If general revenues—as opposed to the payroll tax revenues that largely cover the costs of the Part A program—are projected to exceed 45 percent of total program outlays, this provision seeks to prompt a debate about Medicare’s long-term funding.
Compare this provision, which triggers whenever general revenues (i.e., those not specifically dedicated to Medicare) approach half of total program spending, with single payer. As these pages have previously noted , here’s what Section 701(d) both the House and Senate single payer bills would do to Medicare:
(d) TRANSFER OF FUNDS.—Any amounts remaining in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) or the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1841 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395t) after the payment of claims for items and services furnished under title XVIII of such Act have been completed, shall be transferred into the Universal Medicare Trust Fund under this section.
Both bills would liquidate both of the current Medicare trust funds—and abolish the current Medicare program—to pay for the new single-payer plan. But how do Democrats propose to pay for the rest of the estimated $32 trillion cost of their program? Sanders referenced a list of potential tax increases (not drafted as legislative language), but the House sponsors didn’t even bother to go that far.
In sum, single-payer supporters would take a program on shaky financial footing, and replace it with a program that Democrats have little idea how to fund. Apart from the fact that the American people can’t afford this “reform”—how much of that $32 trillion tax increase would you like to pay?—American seniors certainly can’t either.

Here's What Rep. Ilhan Omar Gets Wrong About 'Black Hawk Down',thefederalist.com,Kyle Lamb,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/fought-battle-mogadishu-heres-ilhan-omar-gets-wrong-black-hawk/,"By Kyle Lamb April 23, 2019
Earlier this week, a 2017 tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) surfaced in which she attacked the men who helped defend from starvation and civil war the country she abandoned in the early 1990s. In her tweet, Omar blasted “American forces” for killing “thousands of Somalis” during the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993. “#NotTodaySatan,” Omar wrote .
I take special exception to Omar’s disgusting comments because I served in the Battle of Mogadishu, which was later portrayed in the movie “Black Hawk Down.” If you aren’t familiar with the real story behind “Black Hawk Down,” let me set the scene for you.
In late 1992, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Restore Hope in support of United Nations initiatives to restore some semblance of law and order to Somalia, which was wracked by devastating famine and violent warlords eager to use the chaos and hopelessness to establish corrupt fiefdoms.
The purpose of American involvement in Somalia was to protect the peacekeepers tasked with the near-impossible mission of delivering vital food and medical supplies to the starving, war-torn population. As the aid grew, so did the opportunities for graft from warring clans who saw the humanitarian crisis as a way to cement their power throughout the country.
The Habar Gidir clan, one of the more powerful clans around Mogadishu, was led by the notorious warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, who made the distribution of international aid to those who needed it nearly impossible. Instead of equitably spreading food and medical supplies, Aidid and his henchmen spread terror and death.
On June 5, 1993, two dozen Pakistani soldiers working for the United Nations peacekeeping effort were attacked and killed by forces loyal to Farah Aidid (three Americans were injured in that attack as well). The next day, the U.N. passed a resolution condemning the attack and calling for the arrest of those responsible and of those inciting and organizing other attacks against U.N. forces. The man most responsible for the violence was Aidid himself, who unilaterally declared himself president (he was never recognized as a legitimate political leader).
Task Force Ranger was the 1993 military effort ordered by President Bill Clinton to capture Aidid and his lieutenants so the U.N. could deliver food and medical aid without fear of being attacked or killed by Aidid’s forces. The American soldiers Omar attacked in her tweet — the men of Task Force Ranger –weren’t sent to Somalia for fame or fortune. They weren’t there because of a deep desire to visit the God-forsaken nation of Somalia. They were deployed to support peacekeepers who were desperate to rescue the country from starvation and the ravages of civil war. To do that, they had to capture the men responsible for it.
By the time Task Force Ranger had been launched, Aidid’s network of drug-addled, Khat-dealing gun runners had taken over Mogadishu and were doing everything they could to oppress any and all rival clans, including that of Omar, the Majeerteen. In other words, we were sent halfway across the world to help protect people just like Omar and her family. Nineteen incredible men gave their lives defending her country while serving ours. They deserve to be lauded for their service, not attacked for it.
I am thankful Omar and her family and countless others were able to escape to neighboring Kenya while we fought to protect those left behind, but I simply cannot comprehend her attitude towards those of us who fought to protect her country and countrymen from warlords who plunged Somalia only further into violence and starvation. I am glad that Omar can now enjoy the very freedoms we fought to protect, like the freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion affirmed in the U.S. Constitution, but I don’t understand why she uses those freedoms to slur the men and women of the U.S. military who made her security and liberty a reality.
The simple truth is that Omar enjoys the fruits of American combat deaths, yet she can’t even bring herself to acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice that was made on her behalf, either as a Somali or an American. Her clan didn’t stand a chance against Aidid and Habar Gidirs, so I don’t blame her for leaving. But I do blame her for attacking those of us who had zero personal interest or investment in her nation for doing our jobs on behalf of our country. And I blame her for smearing American servicemen because we answered the call of our nation to address the violent barbarism of hers.
Unlike Omar, I’m not a politician. I don’t have power or influence. I don’t have a vote in Congress or the ability to direct America’s foreign policy. I’m just one of the men who strapped it on as a member of Task Force Ranger and went into harm’s way to help bring peace and security to her and her people. And let me tell you, she missed a helluva fight. Sergeant Major Kyle E. Lamb (retired) spent more than 21 years with the United States Army, most of those years with U.S. Army Special Operations.

7 Glaring Omissions In The Mueller Report That Kill Its Credibility,thefederalist.com,Ben Weingarten,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/7-glaring-omissions-mueller-report-kill-credibility/,"By Ben Weingarten April 23, 2019
Robert Mueller’s special counsel was presented to the American public as unimpeachable. From its beginning, a distinct minority in politics and media, including several Federalist writers, were skeptical, citing the special counsel’s past prosecutorial abuses , the past alleged misconduct of its pivotal investigators, and the team’s peculiar partisan makeup .
Once in action, its seemingly limitless powers , heavy-handed usage of such powers, and more questionable if not dubious indictments , far removed from “collusion,” seemed to confirm our worst fears. While there is much within the Mueller report that further suggests this skepticism was well-founded, what is perhaps most probative is what the report omitted .
The following are seven of the most glaring omissions from the collusion section of the redacted Mueller report—since collusion, not obstruction, was the theory from which the investigation stemmed. 1. No Attempt to Grapple with the Investigation’s Troubling Underpinnings
Russiagate in many ways appears to be the fruit of a poisonous tree of epic proportions. Allegations of a treasonous Russian conspiracy led to beyond novel legal theories, including the ludicrous invocation of the Logan Act, pervasive unmasking, spying on a presidential campaign by a political adversary based in part on a salacious and unverified dossier gleaned from sketchy Russian sources by a foreign agent and paid for by an opposition campaign, chicanerous circularity in the warrants backing the spying, the use of informants to perhaps entrap campaign members, a deluge of leaks (some of which were illegal), and much else.
We can layer on top of these malevolent acts the biases, ethical infractions, outright criminality, and clear double standards applied by law enforcement figures common to the Trump-Russia and Hillary Clinton emails investigations.
The collusion section of the Mueller special counsel report barely addresses any of the foregoing. How could such an investigation have any credibility without dealing with any, if not all of these issues? 2. No Discussion of Whether the Special Counsel’s Appointment Was Legitimate
From the special counsel’s inception, former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy and others have harped on a single fundamental question: Was the special counsel appointed in accordance with Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations?
A special counsel must be appointed based on a criminal investigation. The Mueller special counsel stemmed from a counterintelligence investigation. A special counsel’s scope must be tailored to “a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated.” The Mueller special counsel order did not seem to adhere to this standard, and in practice, its scope was virtually unlimited .
The Mueller report does not even attempt to address this basic challenge to its legitimacy. Nor does it deal with the arguable conflicts of interest and improper actions taken by those associated with its creation, including former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe , former FBI director James Comey , and the man overseeing the special counsel, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—who, as Sean Davis points out , was a participant, witness, and perhaps target of the investigation himself. 3. No Discussion of Special Counsel’s Perceived Bias
The appearance of conflict based upon the composition of the special counsel team is striking. To highlight the affiliations of just a few members: Andrew Weissmann attended Hillary Clinton’s election night 2016 party and cheered on Obama DOJ holdover and former acting attorney general Sally Yates’ defying of a directive from President Trump.
Jeannie Rhee represented Hillary Clinton in a lawsuit regarding her private emails, as well as the Clinton Foundation, and previously served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the Obama administration. Aaron Zebley defended former Hillary Clinton staffer Justin Cooper, who installed her infamous private email server.
Democrats with deep ties to the administration under which the Russia investigations commenced, as well as Donald Trump’s presidential opponent, predominated in the special counsel’s office. Meanwhile, Mueller, as former FBI director, was a creature of the political establishment, and the institutions from which the investigations sprung. That his report does not grapple with any of the misconduct of the high-ranking individuals behind those investigations in and of itself raises questions.
One would think Mueller would have at least sought to create the appearance of neutrality among the investigators, especially given the anti-Trump biases exposed in the investigations preceding it. Yet Mueller did not, nor did he apparently feel it necessary to address this issue in his report. In fact, he fails even to discuss the circumstances surrounding the removal from his team of its most outspoken Trump hater known to the public, fired FBI agent Peter Strzok. 4. Skating Over the Papadopoulos Predicate for the Collusion Investigations
The Mueller report asserts that the investigation into collusion began when a foreign official (presumably unnamed former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer) told the FBI that Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos conveyed to him that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton that could help the Trump campaign. There is not even an attempt to grapple with the theory that Papadopoulos was set up, based on sketchy approaches from U.S. government informants and foreign counterparts who seemed to be fishing for validation from Papadopoulos that he had knowledge about this Russian “dirt.”
The focus of Papadopoulos’ contacts is Joseph Mifsud, who is described as “a London-based professor who had connections to Russia…” The Mueller report omits that Mifsud, who made the original claim to Papadopoulos about Russian dirt that Papadopoulos then regurgitated, also had extensive ties to Western intelligence agencies .
Was Mifsud planting this information on Papadopoulos? On whose behalf? Meanwhile, such contacts seem an awfully thin starting point for such a critical investigation. Yet the Mueller report fails to give a thorough explanation for why Papadopoulos’ contacts justified the start of the Trump-Russia investigation. 5. Never Mentions Steele or His Dossier in the ‘Collusion’ Section
Amazingly, in spite of the centrality of former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele’s so-called dossier to former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications, and the dossier’s dissemination across the highest levels of the intelligence community and law enforcement, neither Steele nor his dossier are mentioned once in the collusion section of the Mueller report. Steele and his “reporting” solely appear in the obstruction section of the report, largely in passing.
The paucity of attention to Steele’s work—and its origin, how and to whom it was disseminated, and what role it played in the “collusion” investigation—smacks of an attempt to downplay its significance. 6. Excluding Relevant Information About Numerous Actors
It is simply stunning the level of exculpatory evidence or at least needed context the Mueller report omits. While Steele and his dossier merit their own section, here are several other significant examples: Steele’s benefactor and Fusion GPS colleague, its founder Glenn Simpson, are never mentioned by name. Relatedly, critical information about Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is missing. In relevant passages about Veselnitskaya and the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower “bombshell” turned dud meeting she led, the Mueller special counsel fails to mention that Veselnitskaya (i) worked with Fusion GPS on behalf of Russian clients, and (ii) met with Simpson the morning of the Trump Tower meeting, as well as the night before and after it. Was the Trump Tower meeting, as journalist Lee Smith has hypothesized , a setup? The Mueller report omits the critical details that would underpin such a theory. Also unclear, and undisclosed, is why the Justice Department granted Veselnitskaya special entry to the United States multiple times in 2015 and 2016. In discussing Page’s background , the Mueller report notes his contacts with Russian agents, who supposedly tried to recruit him as an asset, beginning in 2013. The report notes that those agents were charged by U.S. authorities in 2015. What the Mueller report omits is that Page effectively served as an FBI asset in helping the bureau make the case against at least one of the agents. Further, one of the agents charged described Page in a secret recording as an “idiot.” Are not these facts relevant when Page was put under FISA surveillance and treated as a traitor? The Mueller report describes Felix Sater as a “New York-based real estate advisor” who worked with and lobbied disgraced former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen extensively in an effort to execute the Trump Tower Moscow project, touting its political benefits and the ability to garner support from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Not mentioned is Sater’s colorful background : The Soviet Union-born Sater spun a stock swindling conviction into a lengthy career as a major CIA, DIA, and FBI asset, participating in numerous critical operations. Was Sater planted in the Trump organization? While he disputes it, should not the special counsel have included this full background, and sought to remove all doubt? The Mueller report ties former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Russia by way of his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Not mentioned: Deripaska had served as an asset to Mueller’s FBI dating back to 2009; he was sought out by senior DOJ official Bruce Ohr and FBI in 2015 to help on organized crime investigations; FBI agents reportedly floated the theory of Trump-Russia collusion to Deripaska two months before the 2016 election, which Deripaska dismissed out of hand. None of this was mentioned in the Mueller report. Why? The Mueller report references Roger Stone and Trump campaign advisor Michael Caputo’s contacts with a Russian citizen named Henry Oknyansky. Oknyansky and an associate supposedly came to Stone by way of Caputo seeking to sell “derogatory information” on Hillary Clinton. Stone rebuffed them. Left unstated: Oknyansky, according to federal court filings and 14 visa waivers , has been an FBI informant for nearly two decades. Did he approach the Trump campaign in such a capacity? Last but not least, intelligence informant on the Trump campaign Stefan Halper , who made contact with both Papadopoulos and Page, is never mentioned in the Mueller report. 7. Raising Potential Russia Violations about Trump Not Applied to Clinton
The Mueller report explores the novel theory that the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign officials and Veselnitskya could have had campaign finance law implications. While it ultimately declines to assert any such violations, it notes:
[C]andidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds, but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value.
The above well describes the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funding of the Steele dossier. On this basis, and considering Rosenstein’s desire to “ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” should not the special counsel’s office have investigated the Clinton campaign for campaign finance violations associated with the Steele dossier?
The special counsel appears to have purposely sought to exclude any details pointing to an attempt to frame the Trump campaign by doctoring a Trump-Russia collusion narrative and entrapping campaign members, in spite of the fact there was no collusion, and ample evidence backing such a theory.
It simply ignored the real or perceived deficiencies of the special counsel’s investigation. It also refused to call into question any of the defects associated with the investigations that preceded it.
These takeaways challenge the idea that the special counsel engaged in anything resembling an intellectually honest, objective, and good faith investigation. Rather, it would seem to indicate that wittingly or unwittingly, this was more politicized smear job and de facto coverup.
Then, although “collusion” was the starting point for the special counsel’s investigation, when the Mueller team found none it nevertheless proceeded to obstruction. But there was nothing to obstruct. The Mueller special counsel could have ended its report at Volume I because absent Volume I there could be no Volume 2 .
By presenting the collusion section as it did, similarly to the obstruction section, the counsel damaged the Trump administration to the greatest extent possible without affirming its criminality. It seems that Mueller pulled a Comey .
We must have a thorough investigation of the investigators. The growing cacophony of attacks on Attorney General William Barr are a testament to it.

"If We Cancel Kate Smith, We Must Cancel The New York Yankees",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/cancel-kate-smith-must-cancel-new-york-yankees/,"April 23, 2019 By David Marcus
It was announced this week that both the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Flyers would stop using their traditional recorded version of Kate Smith singing “God Bless America” during their games. This happened after it surfaced that Smith had performed songs now considered racist during during her hey day in the 1930s. The Flyers, with whom Smith is more closely aligned as the good luck charm for their 1974 Stanley Cup run, even removed a statue of her from the Philadelphia sports complex.
In a brilliant monologue, sports commentator Jason Whitlock broke down the absurdity of these moves. The whole video is worth watching. Among other things, Whitlock points out that the song “That’s Why The Darkies Were Born,” recorded by Smith in the 1930s, was satire that was also performed by black civil rights legend Paul Robeson. I hope Robeson, one of the most important black figures of the 20th century, won’t have to meet this same fate. This is damn well said by @WhitlockJason on insane “God Bless America” singer controversy. pic.twitter.com/7roaE2M1eU

But I would like to focus for a moment on the New York Yankees, which is arguably the most important sports franchise in the world. The irony of this team cancelling Smith for actions she took almost a century ago that are only mildly problematic, while their own team refused to hire black ballplayers, is astounding.
Smith sang a silly song. The Yankees systematically denied qualified black baseball players the right to make a good a living for more than half a century. So why is Smith being exiled while the Bronx Bombers go along like nothing happened? The answer is that throwing Smith under the bus more than 40 years after her death costs nothing. It is the empty virtue signaling that corporate America prefers to reflecting on their actions.
If we must lose Smith — if her statues must be taken down, if her songs must be silenced — then how do we justify allowing modern players, including black players, to wear the uniform of a team that denied black Americans agency and personhood? Any fair treatment of this situation would require that the Yankee pinstripes be retired right along side Smith.
Amidst the controversy, Stephen Smith of ESPN chimed in to try to explain why banishing Kate Smith is acceptable. His co-panelist Will Cain argued that if we go down this road of dragging everyone who did something inappropriate nearly a century ago, who will be left? He even pointed out that maybe Barack Obama should be cancelled for his bigoted views on gay marriage, and that was only a decade ago. Smith thought he had an answer.
He said, “That’s pretty d-mn easy for you to say, because you’re not the offended party. It’s real easy for the group that is not the offended party to take that position.” Cain replied, “There will always be an offended party, Stephen A, and they’ll make that argument to you one day.” Count on it. . @stephenasmith , @maxkellerman and @willcain discuss teams distancing themselves from singer Kate Smith amid claims of racism. pic.twitter.com/fMU7TlyGp0
— First Take (@FirstTake) April 22, 2019
Smith’s deeply misguided point seems to be that if some group of people are offended — and it’s not entirely clear who actually is offended by Kate Smith — then their destructive desires must be entertained and acted upon. No discussion is needed, no context is required, no good works come into play. Just tear down the statue and throw the offender into the dustbin of history.
Fair enough. I am deeply offended by the fact that the New York Yankees refused to field a black player for the first half of the 20th century. Don’t tell me that’s just how it was. Don’t tell me it was the rule. Branch Rickey and the Brooklyn Dodgers had the courage to break that rule in the 1940s, well before the beloved Yankees did. How can this be forgiven? How can we celebrate their legacy while Kate Smith’s is destroyed?
The only fair and just thing to do here is for the New York Yankees franchise to fold, along with all but the expansion Major League Baseball franchises that came into being after integration. We can replace them quickly with new teams, teams that never denied black people the right to play. If Kate Smith is being cancelled for her actions 80 years ago, then so must the New York Yankees be.
These are the rules. Well, sort of. These are the rules when it doesn’t cost anybody any money. These are the rules when we decide to deride the memory of a woman who achieved greatness at a time when that was very hard.
She immortalized a second national anthem, and raised millions to support the war effort in World War II. Yet she is a problem for singing a satirical song. But Joe DiMaggio is a hero even though he consented to outright racism that helped him secure his job. Let’s end the Yankees. Please sign my petition.

Stop Assuming The Intellectual Dark Web Is A Political Movement,thefederalist.com,Free Expression,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/stop-assuming-intellectual-dark-web-political-movement/,"By Libby Emmons April 23, 2019
The Intellectual Dark Web (IDW) has been badly misunderstood by thinkers on both the left and right of the political spectrum. Perhaps the problem is assuming that people who malign this group of classically liberal pundits are thinking, because in many ways, that’s exactly the opposite of what they’re doing.
Justin Charity, a political writer for The Ringer, recently wrote an attempted takedown of the IDW crowd. He posited that these guys like Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and Claire Lehmann are always complaining about political correctness, restrictive speech rules on college campuses, cancel culture, wokeness, and wrongthink.
Charity writes:
The term ‘political correctness’ unites conservatives, libertarians, and vintage liberals in defense of various comedians, rappers, and columnists; and now ‘wrongthink’ unites conservatives and libertarians in defense of George Zimmerman and Alex Jones. ‘Wrongthinkers’ aren’t frustrated with liberals who have somehow failed to discover them, their biases, their anxieties, and their ideas; ‘wrongthinkers’ are frustrated with liberals who have declined to take their ideas and their style seriously in the first place.
Instead of reading the work put forth by IDW outlets like Quillette (for which I am a contributor), some leftists assume that, because the writers and journals don’t jump on board with progressive ideology, they must be alt-right. Meanwhile, conservatives know these IDW cats are not particularly conservative. So what are they? Those who classify themselves as part of this group would say, first and foremost, that they are critical thinkers, proponents of no ideology, beholden to no tribe.
When the left took a more progressive turn, and branded critical identity theory as a guideline for perspective, policy, morality, and social interaction, classical liberals—who believe first and foremost in the rights of the individual and the necessity of critical thought—found they had no place left to call home within the party. These intellectuals became politically homeless. They were reading articles about the problems inherent in whiteness, how men and women were interchangeable based on feelings, how relative oppression levels shape everything, and about how Western culture is apparently the perpetration of pure evil. How the Intellectual Dark Web Took Hold
As the English-speaking intellectual world tightened up due to globalism, social media, the emergence of international online journals and podcasts, and the cross-pollination of writers and ideas, the IDW began to take shape. Writers who dissect ideas for a living were aghast to find that the work they had been doing was now to be viewed through lenses that had nothing to do with intellectual rigor, but were entirely about emotional realities based in grievance, oppression, and identity.
Using these theories as the exclusive basis for how to think about governance, economics, foreign affairs, social policy, and the humanities is intellectually lazy at best and veering towards malevolence at worst. Writing in The New York Times, Bari Weiss and Damon Winter characterized the loose affiliation of IDW pundits this way:
Most simply, [the IDW] is a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities who are having a rolling conversation — on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in sold-out auditoriums — that sound unlike anything else happening, at least publicly, in the culture right now. Feeling largely locked out of legacy outlets, they are rapidly building their own mass media channels.
Academia tightened up. Contrarian academics weren’t getting published. The gatekeepers who put out the journals and books had to be circumvented. Intellectuals who were being shut out of academia had to take hold of the means of production and get into online platforms. This is how they landed on YouTube, in podcasts, and creating their own blogs and journals. The Classical Notion of Free Speech
Liberalism once claimed freedom of speech as its cornerstone. For those who come from either left or right and veer into the milieu of the IDW, it is the classical primacy of free speech that compels them. The reason the IDW is cast as conservative is because conservatives and libertarians are the ones currently advocating for free speech at all costs, even if what’s being said is vile. This used to be the domain of the left, which stuck to ideas such as “I despise your views, but I respect your right to have them,” (Jules Feiffer’s “Little Murders”).
Leftists en masse have since abandoned free speech as a driving principle in favor of an ideology that would penalize speech either by law or social disapprobation. This is what the IDW is fighting. These classical liberals, who believe in personal responsibility, rationalism, logic, and critical thinking, but not entirely aligned with contemporary conservative views, Donald Trump, or trans ideology or privilege theory, are a roundly misinterpreted group.
It is not, as Charity writes, that the IDW thinkers are frustrated that contemporary liberals don’t take their ideas seriously, but that their ideas used to be considered classically liberal ideas. Now the ideas of the IDW are too nuanced for the leftists, who are more comfortable shouting slogans and rattling off feelings-based position points that are often contradictory.
Uri Harris, writing for Quillette , recently asked if the IDW is ideologically diverse. He cites a recent, non-rigorous survey of some notable IDW thinkers to show that they personally tend to link with far-left ideas, while pointing out that these thinkers mostly end up speaking with, and on, conservative platforms.
Yet Harris is asking the wrong question. Political ideology has no claim to the IDW, because political perspective is not the driving thought behind the movement. Rational Thought Contradicts Today’s Progressive Dogma
The shifting sands of progressive ideology, where morality shifts depending on the level of oppression of the person holding the moral view or the relative privilege being wielded in service to a moral perspective, does not meld with rational thought. In fact, recently many on the left have begun asserting that rationalism itself is a racist concept, born of whiteness in the Enlightenment, and that its shackles need to be cast off. Some years ago, the very concept of debate was countered by student groups who attended debates, then refused to debate according to the standard terms, instead throwing down spoken word on the basis that the structure of debate itself was racist.
What can intellectuals do when everything they believe in regarding individual liberty is recast as cultural imperialism? They find themselves cast out, politically homeless, and yes, aghast when the very foundations upon which they have ever thought everything—foundations based in philosophy, dialectical theory, Kantian metaphysics, Judeo-Christian morality, and then thought about and rethought again for clarity toward human equality—are thrown out for no other reason than that those who conceived of these things are now considered oppressors.
The Intellectual Dark Web is an attempt to think clearly, as objectively as possible, with an awareness of potential biases, in an upholding of modernist critical thinking. Those who fall within this group do not share political perspectives because it is not a political movement. IDW is an intellectual movement, where individual freedom is paramount, free speech is non-negotiable, and rational, critical thought is the only reasonable way to discern anything about either the natural world or the self. The IDW is not in service to an ideology, because it questions the basis of any and all ideologies.
That is what makes it a threat to progressivism. The alt-right reaps a benefit from the IDW merely because the IDW does not believe in free speech restriction. But the right should be aware that the compulsion to not censor speech does not equal advocacy of their views, but just an acknowledgement of their right to have them.

Sanders Thinks The Boston Marathon Bomber Should Be Able To Vote From Prison,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/sanders-harris-think-boston-marathon-bomber-able-vote-prison/,"April 23, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
In his CNN town hall on Monday night, Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) said convicted criminals, including those who committed acts of sexual assault or terrorism like the Boston Marathon bomber, should have the right to vote.
Ignoring the fact that these individuals have violated public trust and, in some cases, taken away their fellow neighbor’s right to vote by murdering them, Sanders argued criminals’ right to vote is inherent to democracy.
“I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy,” he said. “Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away, you’re running down a slippery slope.”
“I believe even if they are in jail, they’re paying the price to society, that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy,” Sanders added.
Sanders’ home state of Vermont is one of two states that allows people vote while they’re in prison.
When CNN anchor Don Lemon asked Senator Kamala Harris whether she believes people in prison should have the right to vote, she said she was open to it.
“I think we should have that conversation,” Harris nodded.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg broke with other 2020 presidential hopefuls when asked the same question in his CNN Town Hall on Monday night.
“No. I don’t think so,” he said. “Part of the punishment when you are convicted of a crime and you’re incarcerated is you lose certain rights. You lose your freedom.”
Many U.S. court cases, including at the Supreme Court, have upheld these voting restrictions as constitutional, citing the 14th Amendment and the government’s right to withhold the right to vote due to “participation in rebellion, or other crime.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

Almost Everything You Know About Alcohol Prohibition Is Wrong,thefederalist.com,Timothy Hsiao,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/almost-everything-know-alcohol-prohibition-wrong/,"By Timothy Hsiao April 23, 2019
It’s generally accepted that alcohol prohibition in the United States was an abysmal failure. Alcohol consumption remained relatively unchanged, the black market thrived, and the homicide rate skyrocketed, all of which eventually lead to the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. According to many, the lesson to be learned from this experiment is that government initiatives to ban certain things—whether it be marijuana, pornography, gambling, or guns—are always doomed to failure.
This, however, is flat-out wrong . The actual data tell us a very different story. Yes, alcohol prohibition did fail, but not for the reasons that many think. Accordingly, the failure of alcohol prohibition cannot be used to justify legalizing other goods or services.
Now, before you jump to assumptions and accuse me of being a puritan, I’m not advocating that we return to alcohol prohibition. My point is simply that we cannot use the failure of alcohol prohibition to argue against other kinds of prohibition. There are many good and convincing arguments against, say, gun prohibition , but comparing it to the failure of alcohol prohibition is not one of them. We should not use bad arguments for good conclusions.
For drug prohibition especially, alcohol prohibition may actually teach us a lesson in the opposite direction. Alcohol prohibition may have failed politically, but in terms of reducing overall consumption, it was a qualified success. Thus, on an issue like marijuana legalization, there are good historical reasons to think that keeping marijuana illegal would in fact be effective at reducing both overall distribution and consumption. Prohibition Did Reduce Alcohol Use and Abuse
As Duke University economist Philip Cook explains in his carefully researched book “ Paying the Tab ,” the evidence shows that Prohibition had a clear effect in reducing overall alcohol consumption. Deaths from cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism (which are proxies for alcohol consumption) fell dramatically. Life insurance companies reported declines in alcohol-related deaths. According to Harvard criminologist Mark Moore , the best estimates are that consumption fell by around 30-50 percent. Moore also notes that hospitalizations for alcohol psychosis and arrests for drunk and disorderly conduct also declined.
Alcohol prohibition in the United States was not a single event. National prohibition was the culmination of a number of smaller alcohol control measures enacted during the 1910s, starting with state prohibitions and followed by wartime restrictions enacted during World War I. These measures all had the effect of facilitating a downward trend in consumption.
Although consumption did start to rise towards the later years of Prohibition, per capita ethanol consumption rates remained lower than what they were at during the 1911-1914 baseline period used by most scholars. Consumption levels during Prohibition never exceeded pre-Prohibition levels—indeed, that did not occur until the 1970s, which is perhaps a testament to its lasting effects.
So why do many people falsely think that Prohibition had no effect on drinking rates (or that it even increased them)? The answer is that while overall consumption fell, rates varied between regions and social classes. Prohibition was most effective in reducing consumption among working class and low-income individuals ( who tend the most susceptible to alcohol-related harms ). Prohibition made it more difficult and expensive for these individuals to obtain alcohol through illegal channels, so many decided to forego it. But for those in the upper class who were able to absorb the costs, Prohibition’s effects were less pronounced.
Thus, to journalists who reported on the proliferation of speakeasies, it seemed as if “everyone” continued drinking. But they were only observing the behavior of a segment of the population: namely, those who were able to afford illegal alcohol. They did not pay attention to the noticeable change in drinking habits among those whom alcohol harms the most, and for whom Prohibition is the most likely to benefit. These individuals could not easily obtain illegal alcohol, so their drinking levels plummeted.
Now obviously Prohibition did not completely eliminate alcohol consumption. It did, however, have a fairly significant effect on reducing it. Thus, it seems that with respect to alcohol consumption, prohibition was not a failure. In fact, it was a success .
Yet some would still consider this a failure: the mere fact that consumption continued (even if it was significantly decreased) shows that prohibition doesn’t work. But this is a ridiculous standard. By that same line of reasoning, laws against murder, rape, and theft do not “work” because murders, rape, and theft still happen despite being illegal. If perfection is our benchmark for success, then nothing would ever be successful. Prohibition does not need to be perfect, it just needs to be effective. Prohibition Did Not Increase Crime
Many associate the Prohibition era with a sharp rise in crime. Images of shootouts, turf wars, and assassinations immediately come to mind.
But actually, there’s little evidence for a rampant crime wave. First, the homicide rate experienced larger increases during the pre-Prohibition period between 1900 and 1910 than during all of Prohibition, which is not what we would expect if Prohibition were a catalyst of crime. That said, the apparent increase in homicide during the entire period of 1900 to 1933 may be entirely illusory. According to sociologist Douglas Lee Eckberg, rising homicide rates are likely the result of bad data collection : the number of jurisdictions whose homicides were being counted increased, which gave the appearance of a spike in homicide.
Building on Eckberg’s findings, economist Emily Owens found that “murder rates did not increase when alcohol markets were criminalized ,” and that “observed crime trends during the early 20th century are primarily explained by demographic changes.” Other factors, such as societal changes occasioned by World War I, immigration, and increased urbanization during the Roaring Twenties, largely accounted for the change in crime rates. In fact, Owens found that the “passage of legislation banning the commercial sale of alcohol had a net negative effect on the homicide rate,” meaning that alcohol prohibition may have reduced the homicide rate!
These findings were corroborated by Rowan University economist Brandon Livingston , who found that “alcohol prohibition decreased homicides for two years after enactment, but had no effect after two years.” There may have undoubtedly been some crimes that were made possible only because of Prohibition, but the evidence suggests that prohibition had no overall effect on crime. Indeed, it may have even reduced it. The Black Market Doesn’t Mean Prohibition Failed
Yes, there was a black market for alcohol during Prohibition. Whenever there is any kind of Prohibition, there is bound to be a black market. But the mere presence of a black market does not mean that Prohibition is a failure (unless we think of success in terms of absolute perfection, which I’ve argued is silly).
Prohibition is a deterrent to behavior. If you threaten sellers with legal penalties for selling a product, they will, of course, be less willing to sell it. This in turn makes it more difficult to obtain the product. The more difficult it is to obtain it, the more expensive it becomes. The more expensive it becomes, the less willing people are to obtain and use it. In essence, Prohibition drives up the cost of a given product, which in turn reduces demand.
Highly motivated individuals may not be deterred by this, but the barriers put in place by Prohibition do have a real effect at reducing overall proliferation of a given product, especially among those who are not highly motivated.
National alcohol prohibition increased the price of illegal alcohol by a factor of two or more. While it was still possible to obtain alcohol through illegal channels, individuals were overall less motivated to do so because it cost them substantially more. It is should come as no surprise, then, that overall consumption went down. Many judged that it just simply wasn’t worth it.
So while the black market did “flourish,” alcohol was still less available than it would be if it were legal. The existence of underground black markets did not mean that Prohibition was a failure, any more than the continued existence of thieves means that laws against theft are failures. So Why Did Prohibition Fail?
Prohibition ultimately failed for political reasons . Although it did have an enforcement problem, this wasn’t due to its impracticality. The Volstead Act contained a “joint enforcement” provision that required states to work together with the federal government to enforce prohibition. However, many “wet” states simply refused to enforce the law, while others repealed laws that were designed to facilitate enforcement.
Until Herbert Hoover took office in 1929, the federal government did little to allocate manpower and funds to enforce Prohibition. The result was that Prohibition enforcement efforts were chronically undermanned and underfunded . This lack of attention to enforcement—and not its impracticality—constituted the Achilles’ heel of prohibition. Had the Volstead Act been written differently, this problem could have been avoided.
The final blow came when the Great Depression changed voters’ priorities. In the midst of economic hardship, it was argued that repeal would generate tax revenues which could then be used to support struggling families. This same argument is used today to justify marijuana legalization. In the case of alcohol prohibition, however, initial tax collections after repeal fell very short of projections, which should make us think twice when applying this same argument to marijuana.
Even after repeal, the “dry” cause retained a great deal of support. In the late 1930s, more than 40 percent of Americans supported prohibition, and an equal number indicated that they abstained from alcohol completely. That number remained relatively unchanged even until 1960, when 38 percent of Americans described themselves as abstainers. Moreover, even after national prohibition was repealed, many states retained state-level prohibitions for some time. It wasn’t until 1966 that Mississippi became the final state to legalize the sale of alcohol.
What can we learn from all of this? Well, the chief lesson is that we should stop comparing alcohol prohibition to other kinds of prohibition. Yes, it did fail, but the reasons for its failure cannot be extrapolated to other forms of prohibition. Instead, each issue should be evaluated on its own merits. Prohibiting guns or drugs may be very bad policies. But if they are, they’re not bad because they can’t work. On the contrary, history tells us that prohibition can and has worked. We should rely on better arguments. Timothy Hsiao is a professor of humanities and philosophy at Grantham University. His website is http://timhsiao.org"
Sri Lanka Attacks Highlight Growing Worldwide Persecution Of Christians,thefederalist.com,Kenny Xu,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/sri-lanka-attacks-highlight-growing-worldwide-persecution-christians/,"By Kenny Xu April 23, 2019
On one of the holiest days of the Christian calendar, on Easter Sunday suicide bombers attacked and killed more than 200 people worshipping at Christian churches in three separate locations in Sri Lanka. While no group has taken responsibility for these actions, the tactics were borrowed from jihadist playbooks, and Islamic State supporters have cheered on the bombing, calling it “revenge” for past injustices against Muslims.
These attacks are only the latest and deadliest in an uptick of violence against the Christian minorities in Sri Lanka, who make up 17 percent of the populace. In 2018, Buddhist extremists burned down both Muslim-owned shops and Christian churches across the country, while the state police and civil authorities were criticized for not adopting stronger measures to protect the religious minorities targeted.
Violence against Christians spreads far beyond Sri Lanka. Pew Research lists Christians as the most harassed faith in the world, with significant levels of persecution in 144 countries, according to 2016 data. People of all faiths should care about this, because the world climate is growing increasingly hostile to religious freedom as religious fundamentalism creeps into national politics and people increasingly define themselves in opposition to other people’s faiths.
The idea of religious toleration, a proud feature of some parts of Middle Eastern history, is losing currency among a fundamentalist wave in the region. Throughout the twenty-first century, more than 2 million Christians have been displaced from countries like Egypt, Syria, and Iraq due to the effects of Islamic fundamentalism and sectarian violence in the region. Few groups have suffered as Christian minorities have due to the rise of Islamist political parties such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and ISIS in Libya, with arson , displacement , and even beheadings occurring in these persecutory domains.
It is not just backwards Islamist regimes who are persecuting Christians, either. China’s authoritarian atheist government, fearful of the revolutionary potential of Christian minorities, is tightening its restrictions on the country’s Christians, enforcing its laws against Chinese “house churches” (churches that operate outside the purview of the official state church ) and evangelistic speech with greater severity than in previous years.
South Asia is also becoming a hotbed for anti-Christian persecution. According to Open Doors USA, an organization tracking Christian persecution across the world, Indian Christians now face an “extreme” level of persecution, up from “high” just five years ago, due to spikes in Hindu extremism targeting churches, as well as halfhearted government responses failing to protect these minorities. Open Doors USA now claims with evidence that one in three Christians in all of Asia currently face some form of persecution.
Even in the enlightened West, religious freedom is facing its biggest challenge in centuries. Journalists have reported a record 47 documented desecrations of church property in France for February 2019. In Germany, three-quarters of resettled Christian refugees claim to experience persecution, mostly from the Muslim refugees which surround them. The number of attacks on Catholic churches in the whole of Europe is already up 25 percent compared to the number of attacks during a similar period last year.
While many European journalists rightly blame mass migration from majority-Muslim countries for these religious persecution issues, migration is not the only factor here. Just as significant is Western Europe’s culture of enforced secularism, a world where religious speech is policed and religious symbols (such as burqas ) are not allowed in French public schools or German business settings.
Western Europe no longer inspires religious freedom. Western Europe is instead now a land where public religion is actively discouraged, a world where religious differences are often hashed out in the dark rather than debated in the daylight.
No matter your faith, we should be concerned about the state of religious freedom in the world today. For thousands of years, the world had little concept of religious freedom—you were whatever religion your prince was, cuius regio, eius religio —but the death of millions in the Thirty Years’ War in Europe finally shook the continent into adopting rudimentary principles of religious toleration, to keep everyone from slaughtering each other.
These principles were eventually condensed into a single line in the U.S. Constitution, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” That’s the first line of the First Amendment.
It took thousands of years and millions of lives to enshrine the principle of freedom of religion into the liberal tradition of governance. Just when we Americans thought we could export this principle to the rest of the world, instead we are seeing it crumble before our very eyes, with Christian minorities harassed and persecuted for their faith in ways we’d never dreamt of.
Christian minorities are just one religious group facing persecution across the world. One only need to remember the horrific shooting of 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand to understand that religious persecution cuts across all faiths. Many of the same attacks against Christians are made against Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish minorities all over the world. Today, however, the horrible Sri Lankan bombings have cast Christian minorities in the world’s tragic spotlight.
The persecution of religious minorities across the world should make all Americans here grateful for our country’s stronger protections religious freedom, despite their legal and cultural erosions. It should remind us that these freedoms are never free, and that they must be guarded jealously against illiberal forces that seek to undermine them in the courts and in the court of public opinion . And it should motivate us to stop being complacent while people of many faiths bear sickening persecution for practicing what they believe. Kenny Xu is a senior Mathematics Major at Davidson College.

The Democratic Presidential Primary Is An Arms Race In Crazy,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/the-democratic-presidential-primary-is-an-arms-race-in-crazy/,"By David Harsanyi April 23, 2019
When asked at a CNN town hall this week if he believed that incarcerated felons should be allowed to vote, socialist presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders responded: “This is a democracy and we have got to expand that democracy, and I believe every single person does have the right to vote.”
What about someone like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , the Boston Marathon bomber? “Yes,” Sanders went on, “even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say, ‘Well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote. Well, that person did that. Not going to let that person vote,’ you’re running down a slippery slope.”
Slippery slope, indeed.
After spending decades incessantly repeating the “America is a democracy” lie—liberals, of course, tend to scoff when you point out this jejune detail —the only logical conclusion, ideologically speaking, is terrorist suffrage, I guess. “Every vote” means every vote.
Now, there’s a rational argument to be made for allowing Americans who have served their time and paid their debt to society to fully participate in American political life. Certainly those who’ve never committed violent crimes shouldn’t have to surrender their civic rights forever. The notion that incarcerated murderers should be weighing in on gun laws or that child molesters should have a say on local school bond issues or that a terrorist’s vote should have an effect on American foreign policy, however, undercuts the liberal contention that casting a ballot is a sacred act.
Most of the cynical anti-republican ideas that Democrats are willing to entertain these days—getting rid of Electoral College , giving children the right to vote , etc.— are popular because gullible activist types believe they would create more Democrats. There’s probably a better way to rally support for the Green New Deal than enlisting the Unabomber’s support. (Then again, when we consider the specifics , maybe not.)
There’s no denying that Sanders’ collectivist ideas have gained traction on the contemporary left. Sanders—a Marxist who spent time in the Soviet Union praising a system that offered no genuine voting rights to anyone; not even to the political prisoners being held in the still functioning-Gulag—could have been the nominee of the Democratic Party in 2016 had the primaries been run “democratically.” He’s certainly not alone.
In this crowded primary field, even allegedly moderate Democrats can’t say “no” to every extreme idea for fear of being cast from the group. The same night as Sanders’ CNN town hall, another presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was asked the same question: “People who are convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row, people who are convicted of sexual assault, they should be able to vote?” asked Don Lemon.
“I think we should have that conversation,” Harris responded.
CNN helpfully notes that this was a “noncommittal answer.” Technically, it’s true. I’ve already seen reporters laying the groundwork to rationalize her comments. In fact, I look forward to the 2,000 “fact check” articles next year explaining why the GOP is wrong to tie Harris to this idea. But try, if you can, to imagine a Republican candidate acquiescing to a discussion about the prospects of giving mass-murdering white supremacists a vote, and I’m sure you can understand why no one should regard Harris’ answer as noncommittal. (UPDATE: The next day, after considerable criticism, Harris “ clarified ”— which is to say, changed — her position. We have yet to learn why she felt the need to entertain the idea. )
“Having a conversation” is euphemism for “Sure, I back every puerile and sophomoric idea you socialist crackpots come up with, although I don’t know if I can explicitly do so during the general election, so here’s an unscrupulous political answer that telegraphs my moral support, but also gives me a measure of plausible deniability should I actually win the nomination.”
It’s not just voting voting rights for terrorists. Saying you’re willing to “have a conversation” about any issue is implicit support for the underlying idea. The only question is whether you believe it’s politically feasible. Would Harris have a conversation about legalizing fully automatic firearms? Of course not. Would she be open to having a conversation about banning post-20-week abortions? No. Harris won’t even have a conversation about banning post-abortion abortions . Any deviation from wild-eyed progressivism has the potential to brand you a heretic in this environment.
Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been the leading instigators of this dynamic, but they’re not alone. It’s a group effort. Every time a candidacy lags, the contender will offer a new attention-grabbing plan to confiscate wealth for some socialistic policy proposal. Want to form a commission to develop slavery reparations proposals? Let’s have a conversation . “Free college?” Let’s talk. Nationalize the entire health care industry? Let’s start a dialogue. You want to pass a law that guarantees every American a job? Yep, let’s huddle on it .
How about a plan that eliminates all fossil fuel energy production, the lifeblood of American industry and life, and replace them with windmills, bicycles, and choo choo trains? Nearly every Democratic Party presidential hopeful —including Harris, Sanders, Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Julián Castro, and Beto O’Rourke—says we need to get a conversation going .
Democrats who keep promising groups of people free stuff are just thinking “ outside the box ,” after all. It should be noted that some candidates have avoided the perfunctory habit of injecting legitimacy into every crazy idea. Pete Buttigieg, for example, deserves some credit. When asked about allowing terrorists to vote, he simply said “no.” Maybe others will follow his lead as the party goes off an ideological cliff.
At this point, Republicans should figure out ways to pose questions to Democrats in public and stimulate extremist contagion: Do you support allowing non-citizens voting rights? Do you believe all abortions should be paid for by taxpayers? Do you believe that border walls should be torn down ? Do you think it would be okay for presidents to unilaterally institute bans on fossil fuels to save the earth if Republicans had “ refused to act “?
Let’s have a conversation! "
Niche-ified Pop Culture Could Lead To Either A Renaissance Or A Dark Age,thefederalist.com,Auguste Meyrat,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/niche-ified-pop-culture-lead-either-renaissance-dark-age/,"By Auguste Meyrat April 23, 2019
What happens when the mainstream isn’t mainstream anymore? With online streaming and the digitization of entertainment, it is now so much easier for artists to find their audiences and create a niche.
No longer does a writer, filmmaker, or musician have to defer to the approval of a producer, editor, or some other gatekeeper. He or she can now self-publish, go to YouTube or Soundcloud, and market their creation through social media and gain a following.
This has not necessarily obliterated the gatekeepers, many of whom have adapted to the times and oversee online media, but it has diminished their hold on popular culture. While in the past Americans had little choice but to consume what the handful of major television networks and music companies offered, they now have plenty of alternatives. They have access to nearly every creative product, and, with the help of computer algorithms tracking their selections, can customize their media input.
This has led to niche markets where artists appeal to narrow audiences with highly specific preferences instead of a wider one with a broad set of preferences. Dispensing with most mainstream options, people tend to resort to what is comfortable and agreeable to them, fueling the niche-ification of entertainment. The Death of the Pop Culture Gatekeepers
All this summarizes Emily Jashinky’s argument about this recent evolution of popular culture. At the end, she asks what this change means for our culture. Considering other examples in history of mainstream cultures dividing into niches, the outcome will certainly be mixed. Depending on how people respond, however, the proliferation of alternatives could either contribute a veritable cultural renaissance or accelerate a new dark age.
Long before there was Netflix and Spotify, there was Johannes Gutenberg and Martin Luther. Prior to the Reformation, the Catholic Church unilaterally defined politics, religion, and culture for Christendom. For centuries, kingdoms and empires in Western Europe had few alternatives to the material and spiritual order set by the Catholic Church.
If any leaders, philosophers, writers, or artists had something to say, they needed a churchman’s imprimatur before sharing that thought with others. Those who tried to bypass this process were usually excommunicated, ostracized, or condemned as heretics—and often for good reason, since they threatened the social order with an unapproved, and therefore probably subversive and erroneous, idea.
Once Luther posted his 95 theses and popularized his ideas using Gutenberg’s printing press, the great mainstream that was the Catholic Church broke up into so many tributaries of competing beliefs and theories. People had choices in how and what they worshiped, what they read, and how they wanted to be governed. The Good of the Monoculture
Even though people today learn to look back at this time in purely positive terms, a strictly regulated monoculture had many benefits: civil unity, neighborliness, high standards for arts and letters, and greater spirituality. Unfortunately, these goods accompanied the evils of intellectual stagnation, corruption, and various forms of oppression. The Reformation and printing press reversed (or at least mitigated) these evils, but at the cost of diminishing the virtues.
One can see a parallel tradeoff in modern arts and entertainment in the past decade. People gain in choice and innovation, but they lose common standards and slowly fragment into walled-off niches. Whereas generations in the past could bond over global phenomena like the baby boomers with The Beatles, Gen Xers with “Star Wars,” or millennials with Harry Potter, today’s iGen struggle when one group listens to K-pop and reads manga, another follows people on Twitch and are hyperactive Redditors, while another listens to ’80s New Wave and reads Mojo magazine.
Some may argue that greater choice and alternatives to the mainstream can improve the culture by offering channels for new ideas and promoting healthy competition. After all, the two major political parties will adopt arguments from smaller parties on the fringe in order to better represent constituents and find new solutions to social problems. Similarly, successful painters or chefs can take ideas from other cultures and thereby enrich their paintings or dishes. And, even if the Reformation caused problems for the Catholic Church, it also inspired the Counter-Reformation, which brought about some of the greatest thinkers, artists, and saints that have ever lived.
Then again, these new ideas and competitors may just as well destroy or marginalize the predominating culture. As Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI suggested recently , the Catholic Church’s current scandals are caused by adopting secular values and abandoning orthodoxy. Arguments meant to modernize the church and increase its appeal were sold as reforms, but instead compromised the church and reduced much of its meaning and relevance. As for competition, the Reformation may have brought about great achievements from Catholics, but it also permanently tore Christianity to pieces and paved the way for secular ideologies hostile to religion in the following centuries.
Something similar has happened to the world of fine art. In the past century, rival artistic movements have inspired new masterpieces and expanded the range of creative output, but they have also pushed most art to a point of shallowness and irrelevance. Either art and music become cliché and simplified fodder for mass consumption, or they become a form of quirk meant to appeal to snobs who want to be different. Meanwhile, the true masterpieces remain hidden behind so much overhyped, under-scrutinized garbage. The Scourge of Choice Paralysis
Today’s loss of a mainstream creates a new problem that has no real analogy to the past: choice paralysis . The extreme abundance of choices can turn the pleasurable activity of listening to a song or watching a movie into something stressful. More and more time that should be spent enjoying entertainment is now spent sifting through the endless options—and it is almost certain that a person will make the wrong choice, or at least feel like he did.
To maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of overturning the mainstream, it has become necessary to educate general audiences in matters of taste. With no popular standard to serve as a point of reference, audiences in search of quality entertainment will need the help of critics—people who do the job of sifting, cutting through marketing propaganda, and applying objective standards of appraisal. Otherwise, these audiences will waste their time on so much dreck and be fooled by a compromised algorithm or clever advertisements.
This new deference and attention to critics will also require a general education in the arts. People do not need to become experts, but they should be able to understand the experts and the rules they apply to whatever medium. This means appreciating art and entertainment as disciplines and modes of knowledge, not just forms of pleasure. If people approach entertainment without any knowledge of objective aesthetic values—as many do now—they will select the ones that offer the greatest dopamine rush, setting aside so many works of beauty and brilliance for binge sessions of “Fortnite” and pornography.
Before the cynic tosses aside this whole discussion of art and entertainment as a “first world problem”—which, to some degree, it is—it should be stressed just how much art influences culture. Art informs the imagination, which in turn informs opinions and perceptions, which informs actions and behavior.
It is not unreasonable to judge a culture by its art or a person by her artistic preferences. Art often says much more about a place or a population than economic or scientific statistics do. Consequently, a culture that ceases to treat its art seriously and subordinates it to lower things like politics, pleasure, or commerce will lose its integrity, along with its identity.
With this in mind, there is reason to hope that this new phase in entertainment will be positive. If Americans resist the urge to huddle in niches and use entertainment for validation and pleasure (instead of the better purpose of edification and discovering beauty), then they will continue progressing towards a brighter future with stronger communities.
If they allow computer algorithms and superficial values to guide their media consumption, then all this choice will simply be a perfected form of distraction, dulling the senses and confusing the mind. In a time of so many choices, the one between thoughtful appreciation and mindless consumption will decide everything else. Auguste Meyrat is an English teacher in the Dallas area.

"Yes, ‘Chick Flick’ Is Still A Perfectly Valid Label",thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/chick-flick-is-a-perfectly-valid-label/,"April 23, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
I wanted to walk through Netflix’s viral protest of the term “chick flick” point by point, but that would have required them to display a higher level of coherence. You can read the full Twitter thread here .
Like many positions adopted by contemporary virtue signalers, it seems the company’s social media team started from a cool-sounding conclusion and groped clumsily for ways to get there, guided to their desired destination by the beguiling North Star of wokeness. (Debate over “chick flick,” by the way, is old. The label has rankled scores of easily rankled feminists for decades.)
That said, here’s their central contention: “Overall,” @NetflixFilms proclaimed at the end of a gripping six-tweet thread, “there’s nothing inherently gendered about liking a light-hearted film with a strong female lead and emotional arc. So next time you call something a ‘chick flick,’ you better be referring to Chicken Run.”
“Chicken Run” is an apt reference here. The year of its release probably marked the last time anyone actually used the term “chick flick.” That was 2000. Quick PSA: Can we stop calling films “chick flicks” unless the films are literally about small baby chickens? Here’s why this phrase should absolutely be retired (thread):
— Netflix Film (@NetflixFilm) April 15, 2019
The argument “there’s nothing inherently gendered about liking a light-hearted film with a strong female lead and emotional arc” is just bizarre, and predicated on the ascendant notion there’s something wrong with “gendering” products. Men and women like different things, and our entertainment options should absolutely cater to those divergent interests. But if you don’t buy into that reality, as is increasingly the case on the left, the world you seek is one in which a timeless masterpiece like “Crossroads” would either be advertised unsuccessfully to men or scrapped entirely (a world I hope I’m never alive to see).
Netflix’s anonymous Twitter pundit also complained that “chick flick” is a trivializing categorization, which I suspect is really at the heart of their disgruntlement. I think there’s a legitimate point to be made about slapping the “chick flick” label onto a movie like “Pretty Woman.”
There are absolutely female-led romantic comedies with broad appeal and high quality, to which the “chick flick” label would be misapplied—and with the effect of cheapening the film, as the thread complained. Even something like “Legally Blonde” probably doesn’t deserve the label, if we agree it’s “trivializing.” (I will for the sake of this argument, because I think there are varying perceptions on what it means, and Netflix doesn’t even know whether that point is essential to its own argument anyway.)
But then there are movies like “Crossroads.” Or “The Longest Ride.” Or “A Christmas Prince.” Clearly there’s an entire genre of easy-viewing films geared pretty much exclusively towards women that probably deserve to be trivialized, and perhaps deliberately so in many cases.
They’re the mindless movies that help us unwind after a long week. We like them. We crave them. That doesn’t make women less sophisticated consumers—indeed, there’s a parallel genre for men (“Gone in 60 Seconds,” most of these ), and I don’t think most people would object to the creation of a playfully pejorative term for it either. Gloria Steinem has proposed “prick flick,” but that may be a little graphic.
It’s okay that we have a gendered and trivializing label for these movies because they’re reasonably gendered and reasonably trivial. There may be something to the question of why we only have such a label for women’s films, although my guess would be it has more to do with the convenience of the rhyme than the patriarchy.
As is often the case with feminist complaints like these, disagreement with the cultural construct (think Barbie dolls) seems actually to be more of a discomfort with women’s preferences. Try as they might to free women from the spell of patriarchal social conditioning, something tells me the chick flick will endure. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist.

Violence Against Women Act Would Abuse Battered Women To Destroy Gun Rights,thefederalist.com,Matthew Larosiere,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/violence-women-act-abuse-battered-women-destroy-gun-rights/,"By Matthew Larosiere April 23, 2019
When politicians pass laws to please their bases, we often forget the costs inherent in these acts. “In every age it has been the tyrant who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism, or religion, or both,” Eugene V. Debs, prominent labor activist, remarked in a 1918 speech.
Debs invoked the profound irony through which humans often lose their liberties to thunderous applause. We’re currently facing another potential loss of due process rights for poor Americans if politicians get their way.
Both the government-insulating 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, and, more recently, the supposedly anti-terrorism 2001 PATRIOT Act stripped Americans of fundamental rights under the guise of a sympathetic cause. Now it’s happening again, as the modified version of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is on its way to a Senate vote . The History of the Act
Originally passed in 1994, the VAWA funded the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, and included several other measures aimed at curbing domestic violence. The act contains a sunset provision and was reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013, never expiring until the government shutdown of 2018-19. The act hadn’t changed much since 1994, except for adding protections for same-sex couples and victims who were unlawful immigrants. Now, though, it’s a different story.
Not everyone is happy with this latest version. The National Rifle Association (NRA) opposes the reauthorization, and has recently taken a considerable amount of heat for doing so. Critics are painting them as heartless for their opposition to a law that ostensibly protects victims. Of course, the NRA being on the receiving end of progressive rage is nothing new, but this time the pro-gun organization is quite right. The new bill contains sweeping changes that would eliminate the fundamental rights of many Americans, disregarding due process.
Three changes stand out as particularly alarming: The elimination of a hearing requirement before civil rights are suspended as a result of a restraining order, the new definition of “intimate partner,” and an expansion into misdemeanor crimes of “stalking.”
Many states will grant a restraining order with little evidence. There are sometimes good reasons for this. Sometimes it might be clear enough that someone is in danger for the state to intervene before anyone is hurt, but revoking someone’s civil rights is a serious— and dangerous —solution, one not to be used lightly. Restraining Orders Don’t Allow for Due Process
The VAWA previously struck a balance here by only removing the gun rights of a person subject to a restraining order if the person was actually notified of a hearing, and had an opportunity to participate in it. This means before a person’s rights were taken, he or she was able to present his or her side of the story—a crucial hallmark of due process. The new version all but eliminates the hearing requirement, expressly contemplating ex parte restraining orders (where the subject person never appears) as automatically removing someone’s rights.
The restraining order problem is compounded by the new definition of “intimate partner,” as the law only to handles situations involving “intimate partners.” The previous definition was pretty logical. It included one’s spouse, former spouse, the parent of one’s child, and cohabiting partners. The new, nearly 200-word definition includes “dating partners” and “former dating partners”—definitions so vague one might wonder if it includes the dog walker.
This is what lawmakers are calling “closing the boyfriend loophole .” This isn’t actually a loophole. The law was intended to address situations where the victim and abuser are in close proximity, where the risk of a repeated attack is high, and thus the severe measures made more sense to protect the purported victim.
This change seriously expands the reach of the provision, far beyond the scope of its original intention. With these two changes, someone’s ex could get a restraining order, and the ex would know nothing about it until receiving notice that his or her rights have been stripped. This result is unacceptable. Stalker Expansion Could Also Spell Trouble
The “stalking” expansion is another modification that seems good at first, but fails a closer reading. Previously, the VAWA prevented anyone who had ever been convicted of crimes of domestic violence from buying or owning a gun, but this now includes misdemeanor crimes of “stalking.” Now, one might agree that there are reasons to keep guns out of the hands of convicted “stalkers,” but there’s a lot more to this change than first meets the eye.
“Stalking” is loosely defined in the law. It includes any crime that “would reasonably be expected to cause emotional distress” to a “domestic partner.” Of course, I probably wouldn’t want to go camping with a convicted “stalker” of any definition, but a misdemeanor conviction under these grounds is a massive departure from crimes of “domestic violence.”
The fact that these are misdemeanor charges is more than a technical distinction. People facing misdemeanor charges are often given less serious treatment, both by disinterested public defenders and fast-and-loose prosecutors more interested in pursuing a conviction than they are the truth. This is especially concerning given the fact that many people facing misdemeanor charges are financially disadvantaged , often unable to afford a good defense. They’re left susceptible to the efforts of slick prosecutors who coerce guilty pleas, even when the state lacked a strong case against them to begin with.
When we think of an appropriate punishment for a misdemeanor offense, we think of jail time under a year and fines—not a permanent deprivation of fundamental rights. That’s a serious punishment. This means that someone convicted of a misdemeanor charge of “stalking” (which, as defined, could include excessive phone calls) at 18, could spend the rest of his or her life volunteering for a battered women’s shelter, helping old ladies cross the street, and feeding unwanted kittens—without ever restoring his or her civil rights. Should that really be part of a misdemeanor conviction? Expansive Changes Should Concern Everyone
Whether you agree with the provisions or not, the fact is that these are significant changes touching many Americans, many of whom may have been convicted years ago and since reformed. Don’t be fooled by attempts to frame gun rights supporters as anti-victim. What these changes do instead is create a new class of victims—poor Americans, who are significantly more likely to face criminal accusation and prosecution without competent legal counsel.
Telling people that they have no right to defend themselves for the rest of their lives sends the message that their lives are worthless. There were reasons to pass the VAWA, and there are still reasons to maintain it. But we must remember what Debs pointed out over a century ago: we can’t let ideologically motivated politicians sneak serious due process violations into popular laws just because the label sounds compelling.

What Research Says About How Religion Affects Your Health,thefederalist.com,Nicole Fisher,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/research-says-religion-affects-health/,"By Nicole Fisher April 23, 2019
Religion and spirituality are among the most important of cultural factors, giving structure and meaning to behaviors, value systems, and experiences. Near the holy days of Easter and Pesach, our bodies, minds, and spirit turn to renewing and reaffirming our faith for the year to come.
Consequently, theologians, scientists, and other thinkers have attempted for centuries to understand the effects religion can have on human beings, both mentally and physically. Despite ample reason to believe that faith in a higher power is associated with improved health, very little is still known about the effect religion has on the living body.
Perhaps surprisingly, there is still very little quantitative research published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the relationship between religiosity and health. A primary reason for the lack of institutional knowledge in this area of study is that as the centuries have progressed, scholars in medicine, public health, psychology, sociology, spirituality, religion, economics, and law have all gone to distinct silos.
Subsequently, there is a growing body of research , but it exists in disparate fields, with little overlap addressing the implications for health. There is also much contention about working definitions of terminology like “religious,” “faith,” and “spiritual,” making research difficult to standardize and impossible to randomize. Healing Has Long Been Linked to Religion
That said, the lack of knowledge about links between religious behaviors and health is fascinating given that health care is deeply rooted in religious institutions , and vice versa. Religious organizations built many of the first hospitals, and clergy (supplementing small church wages) were often practicing physicians and medical providers. This was true both in the Middle East and in the American colonies, and included much focus on mental health services , with both positive and negative recorded histories.
As time passed, the link between religion and health care has slowly fallen to the wayside in favor of strict clinical practices and medical protocols. Despite multiple studies over the last several decades concluding that those who are religiously involved live longer, and that many patients welcome spiritual beliefs into their care, this is no longer the norm in America.
For example, researchers at the Mayo Clinic concluded, “Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide. Several studies have shown that addressing the spiritual needs of the patient may enhance recovery from illness.”
Given how much we are learning about the influence social-emotional aspects of life can have on overall health, however, religious beliefs and activities should be an area of intense focus for medical researchers. And it’s a shame that practitioners don’t work more intentionally with religious communities and their leaders to treat the whole patient.
With that quandary in mind, I set out to learn more about existing academic research looking at the influence faith can have on health. First let’s look at what it says about how beliefs can influence a person’s behavior and health outcomes, then at how the health system in the United States integrates faith into the care process. The major takeaways are as follows. Mental Health Literature on religiosity and health overwhelmingly looks at patients’ mental health and belief systems. A surprising 80 percent of research on spirituality/religiousness and health focuses on mental health. This is because most associations with faith are related to how one thinks about the world and his role in it. Words like connectedness , hope , optimism , trust, and purpose are often associated with religious beliefs. All have been shown to boost mental health. Compassion, forgiveness, and gratefulness are also strongly associated with individuals who are spiritual and religious. Practicing these qualities is thought to be associated with decreased stress and increased resiliency . Religious practices tend to give one a sense of purpose greater than oneself. This desire to help others promotes social activities and reciprocal support systems. Being in a religious social group further increases the likelihood that you are surrounded with likeminded people with a shared belief system, reducing social conflict. Intriguingly, although religion and spirituality correlate to an external locus of control (God as a higher power in control of our destiny), most research concludes that those who are religious have a strong internal sense of control . Research from Duke University suggests this is because as people pray, and ask God for guidance, they feel a sense of control over their situation, helping them cope with depression and anxiety. Negative religious beliefs can (and do) play a part for some individuals. For example, fear that one is being punished or abandoned by God in the face of medical problems. These negative thoughts associated with religion can be linked to higher rates of depression and lower quality of life. Additional stress in these cases can also damage mental health. Physical Health While mental and physical health are intricately intertwined, the physical manifestations of spirituality and religious beliefs are considered indirect . That means our belief system drives the way we think and behave, which then affects our health-related actions. For example, people with greater depression and anxiety have more physical health problems. In turn, worse mental health and physical health lead to lower quality of life and a shorter life expectancy. And vice versa. Caring for one’s physical body is emphasized in many faiths, including Judeo-Christianity which says, “Do you not know that your bodies are templesof the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies” ( Corinthian 6:19-20 ). This leads many religious individuals to take better care of their bodies by actions such as abstaining from drinking, prioritizing meditation, and not partaking in activities that harm the body. Patient-Physician Relationship A 2018 survey of American physicians and patients suggests that about 64 percent of physicians believe in the existence of God or a higher power, and more than 90 percent of patients claimed the same. This is consistent with a Pew study, which concluded that about 90 percent of Americans believe in a higher power . In contrast, 25 percent of physicians reported uncertainty in their beliefs. Between medical protocols and a higher disbelief in religion, it’s not surprising many doctors do not engage patients about faith. While many health workers may think it inappropriate to ask patients about beliefs and faith, patients disagree. One study concluded that 77 percent of patients thought physicians should consider patients’ spiritual needs. More specifically, 48 percent welcomed or desired that their physicians pray with them, and another 37 percent wanted physicians to discuss religious beliefs with them. Despite these desires, the same study found that almost 70 percent of patients claimed their physician had never broached the topic of religion with them. Existential questions cannot be answered by medical professionals, yet they often accompany seeking medical care. This is particularly true for those with more traumatic or chronic conditions. Thus, when seeking answers to questions such as, “Why me?” or “What is the meaning of this?” people often look outside traditional health care settings—including religion—to find answers. Therefore, it is natural behavior for humans to turn to faith when touching the health care system.
Based on the consistent and slowly growing body of literature, it is known that religion, faith, and spiritual practices are intimately tied to overall health. Now, we need the care system and the research community to integrate the knowledge into the patient experience and continuum of care. Further, this is a time to call on our religious communities and leaders, as well as health leaders, to work together by putting the whole person at the center of care.

Father Guilty Of 'Family Violence' For Calling His Trans Daughter A 'She',thefederalist.com,Jeremiah Keenan,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/father-gagged-found-guilty-family-violence-calling-trans-daughter/,"By Jeremiah Keenan April 24, 2019
Last week, Justice Francesca Marzari of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, declared a father guilty of “family violence” against his 14-year-old daughter on the sole basis that he had engaged in “expressions of rejection of [her] gender identity.” These “expressions” revolved entirely around his polite refusal to refer to his daughter as a boy in private, and his steady choice to affirm that she is a girl in public.
As previously reported , the BC Supreme Court ordered in February that 14-year-old Maxine* receive testosterone injections without parental consent. Accordingly, Maxine began regular injections at British Columbia (BC) Children’s Hospital over the course of the last two months.
Her father, Clark*, strongly objects to this treatment and immediately sought to reverse the decision in the BC Court of Appeal. Hoping to raise awareness of his case, Clark gave a number of interviews to media outlets, including The Federalist. In these interviews, he repeatedly referred to his daughter as a girl, stating to The Federalist that “she is a girl. Her DNA will not change through all these experiments that they do.”
While many might take this to be an honest statement of biological fact, Marzari quoted it as a prime example of Clark’s “family violence of a public denial of [Maxine’s] gender identity.” Marzari convicted Clark of this violence, and issued a “protection order” preventing him from speaking to journalists or the public about his case.
While the main thrust of Marzari’s ruling focused on Clark’s public statements, Marzari also ordered that Clark be enjoined from “exposing” Maxine to any materials that might “question whether [her] gender identity is real or the treatments [she] seeks are in [her] best interests.” This order arose from the fact that, in mid-March, Clark invited his daughter to watch a video of a small-time Canadian conservative commentator with him.
The video contained a section discussing Maxine’s case, which she quickly recognized. She told her father she “did not want to watch the video, and went to [her] room.” This incident, according to Marzari, was a clear case of an “attempt to persuade [Maxine] to abandon treatment,” and, hence, of family violence. Family Violence via Talking in Public?
What Marzari found particularly egregious, however, was not Clark’s private interactions with his daughter but his “continued willingness to provide interviews to the media … in which he identifies [Maxine] as female, uses a female name for [Maxine] … and expresses his opposition to the therapies [Maxine] has chosen.” According to the court, this willingness placed Maxine at “a significant risk of harm.”
This harm was not so much feared because Maxine’s anonymity might be breached (it is worth noting that Maxine previously sought to have the press publish her real name), but because Clark’s “family violence of a public denial of [Maxine’s] gender identity” was regarded as likely to cause Maxine distress. Marzari argued that such a denial about such a “deeply private aspect of [Maxine’s] innermost thoughts and feelings” was likely to lead to a variety of dangers, “including self-harm.”
Marzari argued that the “people and organizations” to whom Clark granted interviews had shown themselves “fundamentally opposed” to transgender ideology, yet Clark “continued to support the media organizations posting his commentary with additional interviews.” This kind of attitude was, in Marzari’s view, justification for enjoining Clark from sharing any information with journalists—or with practically anyone outside his legal team—about his daughter’s “sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, mental or physical health, medical status or therapies.”
The court also emphasized that Clark must not allow relevant documents (petitions, affidavits, letters, court orders, etc.) to come into the hands of third parties not “authorized by order of this court,” or with “written consent” from his daughter.
While forbidding Clark to speak to the public about his daughter’s case, Marzari stated that she was not overriding Clark’s “freedom of thought and speech.” “There is no requirement that [Clark] change his views about what is best for [Maxine],” she explained. “It is only how he expresses those views privately to [Maxine] and publically to third parties that is affected.”
The fact that Clark is now not allowed to express his views publicly to anyone at all was, apparently, understood to be a fairly imposed consequence for his previous court-objected behavior. Had he strictly abstained from referring to his daughter “as a girl or with female pronouns,” he might not have been guilty of family violence and so subject to this order.
While the judge’s view of matters enjoys support on the political left, some feel the ruling is biased and politically motivated. Kari Simpson, president of Canadian pro-family organization Culture Guard , argued that Marzari’s decision severely limits Clark’s freedom of speech. Citing Marzari’s significant and recent history of LGBT and pro-abortion activism before her 2017 appointment to the BC Supreme Court, Simpson argued that she was operating as an “activist judge” more interested in delivering a ruling convenient to her cause than enforcing laws designed to protect families and children.
Unfortunately, the gag order on Clark makes it difficult to report his reaction to this new development in his case. In the meantime, his appeal of the court’s original ruling regarding testosterone injections is set to be heard on May 14.
*Clark and Maxine are not the real names of the father and daughter involved. Their identities have been concealed by court order. Court documents use the initials CD and AB, respectively, and media refers to Maxine as simply “Max.” Jeremiah Keenan is a pro-life activist and freelance writer.

Why 'Cobra Kai's' Suburban Charm Makes It An American Original,thefederalist.com,Katya Sedgwick,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/why-cobra-kais-suburban-charm-makes-it-an-american-original/,"By Katya Sedgwick April 24, 2019
The morning after we watched the first episode of “ Cobra Kai ,” my husband told me he dreamt happy dreams about the Valley all night. Happy dreams about the San Fernando Valley?
Well, he was born and raised there, if it helps to understand the mysterious workings of his REM sleep stage. But to utter anything positive about any suburban “air-conditioned nightmare” would have been anathema in the Bay Area only a few years ago. That is no longer the case, as everyone talks about swapping his prized Victorians for McMansions, preferably out of state, making a small fortune in the process. (Might as well—they’d removed all the walls in the Victorians, in effect turning them into those “open concept” McMansions.)
“Cobra Kai ,” the YouTube Premium series premiering its second season on Wednesday, is a show that belongs to a specific place, and that place is the Valley. Don’t believe the lazy thinkers accusing creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg of orientalism and “cultural appropriation.” Critics can always spot something borrowed—no really, Karate is a Japanese form of martial arts that the Japanese themselves lifted from the Chinese—after which the “cultural appropriation” narrative writes itself. It’s just that this type of analysis has nothing to do with the show in question.
In the San Fernando Valley, this appropriation-spotting exercise does not require much effort because the place is, and has always been, what would have been called “multicultural” a decade ago. When my husband was growing up, it was the kind of end of history place where Jews and Christians toasted the same Wonder Bread. So a karate dojo belongs in the Valley because its inhabitants are curious people, and kids need something to do.
The Valley looks like all other American suburbs, only more so. It’s hot, stretches out all the way into the hills, and nobody walks there. If back in my husband’s childhood, neighborhood kids all played together on their sprawling front lawns, filling the cul-de-sacs with laughter and photo-ops, that era is long gone. I can drive for hours now, and not see a single soul. They are all in backyards, probably swimming in their pools. On the outside, it looks more lifeless than ever intended.
The Valley might be nondescript, but it was built with a distinct sense of purpose, which is to raise the next generation of America. Form follows function so closely, it’s barely allowed to exist. In terms of parenting convenience, however, it can’t be beat.
Fittingly, probably a good half of coming-of-age movies in the 1980s were filmed there. One of those films was “ The Karate Kid .” This 1984 children’s classic kicked off its own franchise, but by 1989 its creator Robert Mark Karmen had seemingly run out of ideas. Besides, by then the children who fell for the original’s gimmickry and easy plot-lines were all grown up and on the way out of the suburbs.
“The Karate Kid” relies excessively on tropes to propel its storyline and establish characters. The viewer has to take it for granted, for instance, that figures dressed up as skeletons for a costume party have to be the bad guys. The writing is so sloppy that the generation raised on the film started noticing hero Danny La Russo can be easily recast as a bully .
This brings us back to the genius of the American suburb: It’s so generic and boring that when teens get restless there is no alternative to making your own fun. With a spark of inspiration, in the country where the sky is the limit, things fall into place.
The DIY ethic that made everything from garage bands to Apple computers possible, and that drives people to knock down the walls of their 100-year-old houses, is a product of the American suburb. It made “ C obra Kai” possible too, by turning “ The Karate Kid” on its head, while continuously referring back to it in the most nostalgic manner.
When we see the “ Cobra Kai” protagonist Johnny, played by William Zabka (Who knew he was such a good actor?) pick himself up by the bootstraps, it’s very much within the do-it-yourself suburbanite tradition. The first season started off as inspirational and optimistic but because, apart from the work ethic, nothing I’ve described above carries any kind of moral message, the fatherless Johnny failed to fashion himself into a father figure, and ended up creating a monster.
Visually, “ Cobra Kai” is nondescript, just like the Valley itself. Save for the occasionally attractive female leads, the screen offers no visual feast. There are the never-ending strip malls, very tall palm trees, and hills. Sometimes people from Southern California call this landscape “surreal.” I’m not sure about that.
The blandness of “ Cobra Kai” is both true to the original and refreshing. “ The Karate Kid” was no eye candy either. It was ’80s-drab, not that the middle school demo cared for any of that.
Digital technology gave filmmakers too much to play with. The ability to manipulate the picture can become a kind of substitute for narrative; I’m thinking of critically acclaimed films and TV series like “ Better Call Saul .” That series’s plotline all but evaporated in a few seasons.
“Cobra Kai” doesn’t need to be visually enticing because it’s moved by the narrative. In fact, since its charm is very DIY, the series is better off looking ordinary. Fittingly, it’s on YouTube, so the medium is the message. Anyone can make a movie and put it on YouTube. Each episode was only a half-hour long, and the briefness itself is very Punk Rock, which circles back to the DIY ethic.
So is the world of fandom. Zabka, it turns out, never got over that Johnny character he played 30 years ago. And the kids who grew up watching the cheesy “ Karate Kid” movies were stuck on them long enough to figure out, many years later, the real hero of the first, and the best of the three original films, is Johnny.
If the critics’s opinions are depressing dead-ends, visit the Reddit discussion groups. Those are full of excitement and deep textual analysis, the kind of conversations filmmakers want viewers to have about who is right and who is wrong. Critics, of course, are too cool for these questions.
I’m looking forward to the second season, but I’m worried, too. If the series hinges on a novel perspective, spirited storytelling, and Zabka’s acting, it will not take much for the whole experiment to go south. Not with Zabka’s acting, I’m quite confident in that. But Hurwitz and Schlossberg may feel a temptation to answer the woke critics who see cultural appropriation and toxic masculinity everywhere. The charge is total nonsense, the fans couldn’t care less, and the writers should be above it, but I just have a feeling that they might decide to address it.
I hope the new season will avoid an increase in production quality. The charm of “ Cobra Kai” is its DIY aesthetic, and I hope they stick with that. I don’t know how it all is going to work out, but season one was such a perfect fusion of form and function, the show became an instant classic.

James Clapper Knew There Was No Evidence of Collusion In 2016,thefederalist.com,H.A. Goodman,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/james-clapper-knew-no-evidence-trump-russia-collusion-2016/,"By H.A. Goodman April 24, 2019
Long before the special counsel probe ended in confirming there was no collusion between President Trump and Russia, the U.S. government knew there was no evidence of a vast conspiracy between Trump and a foreign power.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate “ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russian officials” on May 17, 2017 . President Obama’s director of national intelligence James Clapper had access and was privy to all the “evidence” the U.S. government collected since the Russia investigation began in July 2016 .
From July 2016 until Clapper’s appearance on “Meet the Press” in March 2017, not one shred of evidence linked anyone in Trump’s campaign to allegations listed in the Christopher Steele dossier or Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos’s meeting with Australian diplomat Alexander Downer. Clapper stated to Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on March 5, 2017 that the National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence Agency had collected “no evidence” regarding “improper contacts” between Trump and Russia:
CHUCK TODD: Well, that’s an important revelation at this point. Let me ask you this. Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?
JAMES CLAPPER: We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, ‘our,’ that’s N.S.A., F.B.I. and C.I.A., with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.
CHUCK TODD: I understand that. But does it exist?
JAMES CLAPPER: Not to my knowledge.
CHUCK TODD: If it existed, it would have been in this report?
JAMES CLAPPER: This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left the government.
CHUCK TODD: At some–
JAMES CLAPPER: But at the time, we had no evidence of such collusion.
So, President Obama’s top intelligence official and a man with access to FBI, CIA, and NSA surveillance on President Trump’s campaign stated categorically that no evidence existed of “any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians.” This was two months before Rosenstein appointed Mueller special counsel, and Clapper’s knowledge dated into 2017. So why did Rosenstein appoint Mueller?
Furthermore, the intelligence gathered for the reports Clapper referenced was compiled in 2016 and resulted in assessments of confidence, not any guarantees or certainty of the Russians even hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Clapper’s referenced joint Department of Homeland Security and FBI report begins with an actual warranty disclaimer:
DISCLAIMER: This report is provided ‘as is’ for informational purposes only. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within. DHS does not endorse any commercial product or service referenced in this advisory or otherwise.
This report makes serious allegations of election interference, alongside a disclaimer that states DHS “does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information” of Russia interfering in the election.
The description of Russia’s cyber campaign against the United States is not backed by the United States in terms of a legal guarantee, as stated in the disclaimer. There is no certainty or guarantees regarding Democratic Party suspicion that Trump obtained Facebook ads or helped Russians hack the DNC in this report. The DHS report, like Clapper’s admission on “Meet the Press,” is simply a guess based on suspicion, not a statement on evidence. Like Obama CIA director John Brennan said during congressional hearings (0:15 on the link) , “I don’t do evidence, I do intelligence.”
As for the ODNI report Clapper compiled from the DHS report and intelligence derived from the NSA and possibly other agencies, there’s an even more amusing warranty disclaimer within Annex B, the last page of the document :
Judgments are not intended to imply we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary…
High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in a judgement; such judgments might be wrong.
Therefore, if the FBI and CIA are highly confident that Russia hacked the DNC in order to embarrass Clinton, or that Facebook ads were part of a sophisticated Russian campaign, the ODNI report categorically states “such judgments might be wrong” and “judgments are not intended to imply we have proof that shows something to be a fact.” Americans still don’t know which Russian Facebook ads influenced a specific number of voters in certain swing states to vote Trump, nor did the U.S. government ever confirm the DNC-hired Crowdstrike’s analysis of DNC servers.
Finally, the infamous Steele dossier is linked directly to Hillary Clinton, as explained in a Washington Post article titled “ Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier ” by Adam Entous, Devlin Barrett, and Rosalind S. Helderman:
The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump’s connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin, people familiar with the matter said.
Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.
After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community…
The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS’s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.
Since both the DHS and ODNI reports have warranty disclaimers stating nothing written in them should be taken as fact, and the Steele dossier used by fired FBI officials James Comey, Peter Strzok, and Andrew McCabe is linked to Clinton’s funding, why was President Trump investigated by Mueller? The narrative of Russian meddling is only bolstered by “high” to “moderate” confidence assessments of the NSA, FBI, and CIA, not certainty.
Mueller’s appointment, and the behavior of FBI and intelligence officials that preceded this two-year investigation, point to violations of U.S. Code 371 and a conspiracy to defraud the United States . If mere allegation, suspicion, and dossiers were enough to form investigations then Attorney General William Barr should simply pick up Peter Schweizer’s “Clinton Cash,” a book documenting alleged pay to play schemes of the Clinton Foundation, to generate evidence to open a special counsel into the Obama-era uranium deal.
Democrats, however, would never allow what they did to President Trump to be leveled at them, and nothing about Clinton warrants suspicion in their minds. Ultimately, Barr and Republicans must uncover why Clapper and others investigated Clinton’s political rival with “no evidence” of a crime. H. A.

Planned Parenthood Wrote Regs Forcing Religious To Pay For Abortions,thefederalist.com,Nicole Russell,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/lawsuit-planned-parenthood-wrote-california-regs-forcing-religious-groups-pay-abortions/,"By Nicole Russell April 24, 2019
Nearly five years ago, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) forced religious organizations to pay for abortions in their health insurance plans, which blatantly violated their deeply-held religious convictions. Three churches joined in filing a lawsuit against the department, citing their First Amendment right to remain exempt from providing abortions. Litigation ensued.
Recently in discovery, attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the organization representing the churches, unearthed 2014 emails that show the department reversed the existing exemption and required that all insurance plans cover abortions largely due to lobbying from abortion giant Planned Parenthood’s political arm. Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, is a major contributor to Democratic politicians, but presents itself to the public as a provider of women’s care rather than a highly political operation. Planned Parenthood Rewrites California’s Regs
Before the fall of 2014, a provision in health insurance plans in California exempted religious organizations from paying for abortion through health insurance. However, on August 22, 2014, Michelle Rouillard, director of California’s DMHC, said the department had made a mistake and would now require insurance companies to cover abortions—even for religious organizations.
What prompted such a change? After hearing that the state had allowed Catholic universities to be exempt from providing abortion coverage due to their faith, Planned Parenthood legislative advocates began persuading the DMHC to drop the exemption or face a mandate from new legislation.
According to this Open Secrets information, in 2012, Planned Parenthood affiliates in California, specifically Mar Monte, donated thousands to Democrats running in federal races and against Republicans running in federal races. According to this site, which tracks organizations that donate to local candidates, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California hired 28 lobbyists over the last 12 years and donated thousands of dollars to more than a dozen Democrat candidates who won their state races. It’s easy to see why Planned Parenthood could threaten legislation if the DMHC wasn’t willing to provide a “regulatory fix.” After all, plenty of California legislators are in Planned Parenthood’s pockets.
The emails, dated from February to May 2014, detail numerous exchanges with DMHC officials and Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California’s legal counsel and legislative advocates. The emails provide markers of meetings that occurred and show a gradual progression of lobbying efforts: They start with Planned Parenthood simply requesting to know why the state exempted religious universities from sponsoring abortions, then Planned Parenthood begins trying to persuade the DMHC to reverse their exemption, and ultimately the department even requests Planned Parenthood’s assistance to make this happen.
One such email, from a Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California legislative advocate Brianna K. Pittman, to Lark Park, a policy advisor to California’s governor at the time, Jerry Brown, states:
Just wanted to follow up on this email to set up a time to meet about PPAC’s priorities this year. While there, the most timely is a spot bill to address the issue that DM HC has approved, and Catholic Universities have been purchasing, large group employee health plans that exclude certain types of abortions. We met with Donna Campbell at HHS yesterday to discuss this and explore whether there is a regulatory/ administrative fix or if legislation is needed. I believe that HHS will be looking into the issue and talking with both DMHC and the Governor’s office, but I wanted to flag it and give you the background we shared with HHS. We have a spot bill to address the issue in case there is not a regulatory fix.
On March 11, Pittman, emails Park again:
Do you have time to sit down with us to discuss PPAC’s priority legislation this year? We have a handful of sponsored bills, including a bill we are looking into that would ensure employers can’t exclude abortion or other types of reproductive health care services from their employee health insurance plans. There have been a couple of Catholic Universities that are excluding certain types of services from their health plans, and it appears that DM HC has approved these plans at some level.
About a week later, Planned Parenthood executives offer their proposed agreement. Pittman emails Donna Campbell, deputy secretary at the Office of Legislative Affairs at the DMHC:
As we mentioned in the meeting, this is of significant concern to Planned Parenthood and many of the reproductive rights groups that we work closely with. While we would prefer to see this resolved without legislation, we are concerned with DMHC’s ability to find a solution, based on several months of conversation and the inconsistencies in DMHC policy on abortion coverage we uncovered in health plan approval documents, all of which led up to our meeting last week. We really want to find a comprehensive resolution to this issue, whether legislative or administrative … Our folks would feel positive about pursuing an administrative solution, in lieu of legislation this year, if the Administration would….not approve any further plans that exclude coverage for abortion or other reproductive health care service. This includes a clarification that there is no such thing as an elective or voluntary abortion exclusion. (Emphasis mine.)
In April, Campbell emails Pittman that they’re still working on the “‘updated’ interpretation, if you will” and a few months later, Rouillard announced no insurance company is exempt from paying for abortions for their employees, and since religious organizations were the only ones who were exempt, they were—and remain—specifically targeted. California Violated First Amendment Rights On Purpose
While there was allegedly some confusion within the department, due to its size, about whether plans excluded abortion coverage, the emails show a concerted effort that went beyond repairing communication breakdowns. The emails show Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California were determined to ensure all insurance plans covered abortions, particularly those providers of religious organizations, since the only complaints about the exemption until that time had come from Catholic universities.
In a phone call, Jeremiah Galus, the lead attorney on the case, told me, “It was clear the department mandated abortion coverage in a way that seemed innocuous … when really it was quite planned.”
While this sounds a lot like the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case—the landmark Supreme Court decision that that allowed religious employers to decide not to fund abortifacients through company health insurance—Galus informed me that case was litigated under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a federal law. Since this is a state issue, so far only in California, this will be litigated purely under the First Amendment.
It was already bad enough that the California department rescinded their original provision acknowledging religious organizations’ pro-life preferences and mandated a reversal of the abortion exemption. Planned Parenthood was standing over the the department demanding a “regulatory fix” to remove the abortion exemption. This is a grievous demonstration of Planned Parenthood’s political power, abused to deny religious organizations their First Amendment freedoms. California should not have been colluding with Planned Parenthood to make these changes, nor should they have cowered under the demands of an unethical organization to do so.
Planned Parenthood already advocates for something that’s not only harmful but an increasingly ho- button issue in American politics, particularly as more Americans favor abortion regulations than ever before and “heartbeat bills” continue to pepper state legislatures. Evidence that the organization successfully lobbied the cowardly California DMHC to infringe on the First Amendment rights of religious organizations under the guise of “reproductive rights for all” is shameful, but not surprising.

Neocons Don’t Deserve All The Blame For The Iraq War,thefederalist.com,Edward Chang,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/neocons-dont-deserve-blame-iraq-war/,"By Edward Chang April 24, 2019
With each passing of the 2003 invasion of Iraq’s anniversary comes a fusillade of commentary placing the blame squarely on “neocons.” For the past 16 years, this political movement has been singled out by critics on both the left and right as responsible for the nation’s foreign policy woes.
It’s for good reason: neoconservatism constitutes a powerful and influential force in American defense and foreign policy-making circles. Their reflexive hawkishness, combined with a sense of moral righteousness and resolute determination to remake the world in America’s image, along with major financial and political capital, coalesce to make neocons, along with their left-wing counterparts, the liberal internationalists, the dominant voice in American foreign policy.
But has it become far too easy to blame them? Has the term “neocon” become yet another overused, “meaningless label,” as Max Boot recently put it , to describe individuals and policies one finds distasteful? The prevailing narrative depicts the United States’ invasion of Iraq as the brainchild of a cabal of political heavyweights, intellectuals, and think-tanks pulling the strings, but a closer, more honest look reveals the origins of the Iraq War to be more multifaceted. Let’s Review the Timeline
By March 2003, the United States had been engaged in armed conflict against Iraq for 12 years. After Desert Storm, the fighting between the two countries continued in the skies throughout the 1990s into the ‘00s, as Saddam Hussein defied the United Nations-mandated no-fly zones in the north and south of the country, alongside the economic sanctions against his country.
By the time George W. Bush entered the presidency, there was no end to the fighting in sight. Saddam continued to exhibit belligerence, firing routinely upon U.S. and allied aircraft in the no-fly zones. With an administration staffed with neocon all-stars like Elliott Abrams, Paul Bremer, Richard Perle, and Paul Wolfowitz, it was easy to believe the Bush White House would use the hostilities in the skies over Iraq as a justification for war and regime change in Baghdad.
This was not so. The no-fly zones were unpopular among Congress and the public, and concerns over losing aircrew prompted the Bush administration to initially scale back the intensity of Operations Northern and Southern Watch. To go as far as to launch preemptive war, the Bush administration would need something more than just combat aircraft being shot down while patrolling no-fly zones.
That something came in the form of 9/11. After the devastating terrorist attacks, the United States had the legal, logical, and moral justification to pursue a campaign of justice against all its enemies. 9/11 became and, continues to be, a convenient excuse for an aggressive, interventionist American foreign policy. We Were Already Involved in Iraq
There are two key points to absorb. The first is that there was a fair likelihood the United States and Iraq would have eventually fought another major war, given active, pre-existing armed hostilities. Baghdad under Saddam’s rule was as responsible as Washington under Bush was in the resultant Operation Iraqi Freedom. At the very least, the cycle of Iraqi provocation followed by limited U.S. military responses would have continued indefinitely.
The second point is, had a 9/11-like event not occurred, it would have been difficult for the Bush or any future administration to sell an invasion of Iraq. Even in the wake of the resounding victory in Desert Storm, then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was aware of both the risks of overthrowing Saddam’s Ba’athist regime and the political and public opposition such an operation would garner. The Bush administration’s de-escalatory approach to the no-fly zones in the months leading up to September 2001 supports the idea that even a neocon “dream team” would face great difficulty in taking the country to war without heavy political and public backing.
Therefore, it was the combination of 9/11 and the ongoing conflict between the United States and Iraq that culminated in the invasion of the latter in 2003. While viewed as a “war of choice,” conditions were such that two things were true at once —another U.S.-Iraq war was likely, and it would take a major casus belli to start it. Without 9/11, the Bush administration would be limited to the same tools available to the Trump administration as it pursues its “ ferocious tack ” on Iran—all options short of war. Huge Majorities of Americans Supported War
The neoconservatives clearly exploited the opportunities 9/11 wrought. But it is rather too convenient and disingenuous to heap all blame on them, given how popular the Iraq War was at the start. While evoking strong sentiments at both ends of the spectrum, overall public opinion was extremely supportive for the conflict at the outset.
How supportive? In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted just days after the invasion, a whopping 72 percent of Americans expressed support for the war, while only a quarter expressed opposition. If the Iraq War was deeply unpopular by its end , it unequivocally was not at the beginning. This is fact often forgotten by the war’s critics, many of whom were initially supporters.
While Americans, along with much of the world, view U.S. foreign policy in largely beneficent terms, the decision to conduct regime change via the most powerful military in history in not one, but two countries, one of which had nothing to do with 9/11, prove that America, like all nations, will lash out vengefully and violently under times of duress, out of love for country (patriotism) and in promotion of national interests (nationalism). Both were on full display following 9/11, but the latter motivated the Iraq War more than the former.
Scholar Walter Russell Mead referred to this distinctive brand of American nationalism as rooted in the “Jacksonian” school of American foreign policy in an essay published in The National Interest in 1999, then later in his masterwork, “ Special Providence .” Described by Mead as more a “folk community” rather than a distinct political ideology or movement, Jacksonianism encompasses a set of beliefs, impulses, and values associated with the “heartland” and “Middle America.”
This is critical to understanding it. Unlike neoconservatism, it is the doctrine of commoners, not the product of intellectuals, or policymakers. This is a crucial to absorb because it reveals neoconservatism for what it is—the thinking of an elite, vocal minority and hardly representative of American public opinion at large. We Hate You Until We Need You to Die
Despite comprising the heart and soul of a nation, Jacksonians are also dismissed or downright “deplored” (a word Mead uses) by the same cultural and political elites as ignorant, backwards, or simply representative of a culture and history that deserves to be cast, along with “outdated” notions such as nationalism, to the dustbin of history. The convictions and motivations of the Jacksonians make wars like Iraq possible.
Until times of trial. During America’s darkest hours, it is this Jacksonian community that rises to the challenge and supplies the blood, sweat, and tears of a nation. In the days and months following 9/11, it was this Jacksonian community that spoke heartedly for the country through fervent displays of patriotism, enlisting in the military in large numbers, and even through song, like country musician Toby Keith’s 2001 hit “ Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue .”
But it is also the convictions and motivations of the Jacksonians that make wars like Iraq possible. By associating support for the war with patriotism, Jacksonian sentiment dabbled in their own form of political correctness, that opposing the war was anti-American.
More importantly, Jacksonians think that when one’s nation is under assault, the only answer is to pursue absolute destruction of all enemies, at any cost, for as long as it takes. When President Bush declared , “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,” he was not channeling neoconservatism—he was channeling Jacksonian martial and unilateral sentiment. Caroline Glick once opined that it is Jacksonianism, not neoconservatism, that dominates the Republican Party’s foreign policy. Elites Didn’t March to War Alone
Finally, there is the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, in which almost 40 percent of the Democratic House Representatives and 58 percent of Democratic senators effectively voted in favor of invading Iraq. The results speak for itself—the Iraq War was very much a bipartisan war, no matter how hard the Democrats have attempted to distance themselves from it. The Iraq War was very much a bipartisan war, no matter how hard the Democrats have attempted to distance themselves from it.
None of this absolves the neocons of blame for the Iraq War. They were its greatest supporters, spending considerable money and time promoting regime change in Baghdad. The point is that it takes more than a relatively small, though politically influential, elite to affect policymaking.
The war was the product of four key ingredients: pre-existing hostilities, a political movement bent on global deliverance, vengeful nationalism, and bipartisan political support. Remove one of these four legs, and the Bush administration would, at minimum, been far less eager to sally forth into the dark.
As the Trump administration becomes increasingly under the influence of neoconservatives and tensions increase with Iran, the lesson of Iraq going forward is that Congress and the American people are very much a part of the decision to take the nation to war. A war with Iran may not be as likely as some believe, but neither was another war with Iraq until 9/11 happened and the national mood changed dramatically.
In times like these, there will be neoconservatives ready to act as white knights and sweep America off its feet once again. Edward Chang is a defense, military, and foreign policy writer.

We Loved The Magicians' Quentin Coldwater Right Before Losing Him,thefederalist.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/learned-love-magicians-quentin-coldwater-right-losing/,"April 24, 2019
Spoilers below for ‘The Magicians’ season four finale.
All love dies eventually. No matter how hard, how firm, how solid, our love goes the way of dust in the end. And so it is with the season 4 finale of “The Magicians,” a show I’ve been following since Lev Grossman’s trilogy, since since the first episodes on SyFy.
On Twitter earlier this year, show co-creator Sera Gamble posted about how she and John McNamara first got together, bought the rights to the books, and wrote the pilot on spec. To put in the kind of work that takes is an act of love. It cannot be done without love of story, world, and primarily love of character.
That is why it was so sincerely shocking to see series lead Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph) killed in the final episode of season four. It was like a puncture wound. It took all the air out of the room.
“The Magicians” has been running on SyFy for four beautiful seasons, and will be bringing a fifth. With a cast of talented, gorgeous actors, the plotlines keep veering entirely off course only to land in new, unexpected realms of fantasy and storytelling.
“The Magicians” blends elements of campy fantasy genre dramas with a sense of humor and a real fine arts sensibility. The premise is that Brakebills is a magical school for magicians, a Hogwarts for cosmopolitan kids with way too much personal baggage, an overload of attitude, and robust superiority complexes that barely mask the insecurity beneath.
There are multiple dimensions and worlds, each with their own timelines, natural laws, and properties. One of these is Fillory, a mythical land that has only existed in fiction written by Christopher Plover (Charles Shaughnessy), Quentin’s favorite novels, until the Brakebills kids realize it’s actually real.
Plover has been a background figure in the series, despite his Fillory books taking on a driving life in the narrative. When we find him in the season finale shunned, disgraced, in a back room of the interdimensional library of magic, he wants back into the mortal realm. In his defense, he says: “Problem is, no one will ever let you change. People always see you for what you’ve done, never for who you are.” He could very well be talking about Quentin Coldwater, who does not appear, until this bitter end, to be the main character of his own life.
In the books, Quentin, the ultimate Fillory fanboy, is kind of annoying. In the show, too, he began as kind of a lead afterthought somehow, the least colorful and the most uninteresting hero. Finally he is tasked with saving Fillory, the refuge of his heart, play place of all his childhood fantasies.
That you can never go home again isn’t simply a cliche, it’s also the truth. Standing at the edge of everything he ever wanted, Quentin gives this impassioned plea. “You know the worst part of getting exactly what you want? When it’s not good enough. Then what do you do? If this can’t make me happy, then what would? Fillory was supposed to mean something. I was supposed to mean something here. But it’s random, it’s so random that the only way to save my friends is to yell at a f-cking plant. Honestly, fuck Fillory for being so disappointing. Y’know maybe I was better off believing that it was fiction. The idea of Fillory is what saved my life. This promise that people like me, people like me can somehow find an escape. There has got to be some power in that. Shouldn’t loving the idea of Fillory be enough?”
It should. We want it to be. We want love to be enough, love of place, love of home, love of lover, love of love, but it isn’t, and we can’t make it be. We need to be our own escapes, we need to save ourselves.
No one is really out there to fix it all for us, no matter how much they want to, no matter how many plants we yell at. (Seriously, just watch the show.) In the end, the place that saves us is the place in our hearts, where the light shines, where the flowers grow, and where even in sadness we find the joy that is a gift to us from the beginning of time.
It took a few seasons for Quentin to live up to himself. He didn’t even have a magical discipline until two episodes ago (in the trilogy it’s book three). His love interest, the smartest, hottest, angst-iest magician, Alice (Olivia Dudley), has been a phosphoromancer (the magical manipulation of light) since season one, but Quentin has been muddling about without any real idea as to his meaning or purpose. It’s a sick irony that only shortly after he learns what type of magic he’s innately best at, he’s able to use to it to save the day, save magic, save Alice, and destroy himself.
It hurts for a writer to kill off a character he loves. These characters have not been crafted so much as they have been extracted from the hearts and minds of the writers who created them, who drew them out, lovingly, with grace and urging, from the ether of imagination. It must have been agony to write the script where Quentin dies of his own masterful spellwork. As hard as it was for Alice to watch him go, it must have been even more excruciating to pen the lines that released him from the world of the living magicians.
By the time Quentin makes his spectacular exit, with the captivating track “Cruel World” by Active Child and a slow-motion pyrotechnic golden sparks sequence, he and Alice are back in love. Quentin knows his worth, and can harness his ability for the first time. Moreover, we love him, we viewers who have had such trouble wrapping our hearts around Quentin Coldwater as the driver of the story arc. Right when we love him most he is snatched away into the realm of darkness.
“Magic comes from pain,” says Quentin from the afterlife, and he’s not wrong. Magic does come from pain. We all know it, and don’t want to admit it. We want to believe that we can be well-adjusted and super normative and still breed masses of creativity and brilliance, but it doesn’t quite work that way.
I had a writing professor in college, Cassandra Medley, who said, “Go to the place where you’re afraid, and start from there.” In fear, in terror, in the agony of our hearts, we create and reform ourselves, and in so doing, the magic of love is made.

Why I Refuse To Attend My College’s LGBT Graduation Ceremony,thefederalist.com,Brad Polumbo,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/refuse-attend-colleges-lgbt-graduation-ceremony/,"April 25, 2019 By Brad Polumbo LGBT icon Ellen DeGeneres once mused , “Do we have to know who’s gay and who’s straight? Can’t we just love everybody and judge them by the car they drive?” This was obviously a joke, but it contained a kernel of wisdom. After coming of age in a time of gay oppression, with her show canceled after she came out as lesbian, DeGeneres knew that the full potential of American values could never be realized until all people, regardless of sexual orientation, were treated alike. So in a fair world, this means sexuality should be irrelevant to a student’s education. Many modern campus progressives reject that vision. I recently realized just how far the LGBT left has strayed from this egalitarian mentality when I received a curious invitation from administrators at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, from which I’m set to graduate this May. The note invited me, a gay man, to attend a special “Rainbow Graduation,” an event supposedly “hosted every year to honor our graduating seniors within the LGBTQ community.” I wasn’t flattered to receive this invitation, I was mortified. Self-segregated celebrations are the exact opposite of the egalitarian vision of gay rights I believe in, where all Americans ought to be treated the same, with sexual orientation little more than a footnote in our public life. Yet identity politics ideology has become so pervasive on college campuses and the progressive elite that they’re blinded to the individualism gay advocates once stood for. Now, they champion regressive groupthink. How else could one possibly justify such a spectacle? The annual event regularly features keynote LGBT speakers, and is attended by LGBT students and their guests. Additionally, awards are given out to LGBT student leaders, sympathetic staff, and program participants. Interestingly, a “Spectrum” award is given to a student deemed most influential within the self-segregated LGBT residential community on campus. These types of events send a chilling message about how progressives view LGBT students. Are we incapable of standing out from the student body on our own merits, rather than our sexual proclivities? What’s more, it reinforces the odd notion that sexuality alone is worth celebrating. No one should face discrimination or violence for his identity, but we also shouldn’t act like the sheer act of being gay is an accomplishment. It really isn’t, even if some people still do have to overcome additional obstacles due to their orientation. And it’s not as if the modern university is such a homophobic, repressive place that students need solace to enjoy a graduation ceremony. The intention may be to provide “safe space” for LGBT people to celebrate, but in reality there is almost nowhere in the world safer or more accepting for gay people than an ultra-left campuses like UMass. In the absence of any real necessity, such a spectacle seems performative, not productive, like just another liberal attempt to cultivate the victim status that has become the new campus currency. But it’s a stunt that could have real consequences. This type of approach sets gay people back, because actual acceptance comes through assimilation. These kinds of events, decorated with rainbows and featuring controversial progressive speakers, only make gay students stick out like a sore thumb. But LGBT students are your neighbor in the dorm room next door, the classmate you borrowed a pen from, or the TA who taught your freshman seminar—and you might never know it. That’s, frankly, how it should be. Efforts to make a spectacle out of sexuality, which should really be irrelevant in an education setting, only set assimilation efforts back. This is a recipe for failure. After all, the most effective arguments for gay marriage were made in the court of public opinion not by railing against the traditional institution, but through framing same-sex marriage through the lens of widening a venerable social norm to include more everyday Americans. Ultimately, this was successful. Yet the developing strain of identitarianism consuming the advocacy class threatens this progress. It has the potential to further polarize LGBT issues and ostracize LGBT people from American life, when what we really should do is attempt to spread a message of mutual tolerance. In their effort to pursue equality, progressives may set us all back. The “Rainbow” graduation at UMass isn’t some one-off event. Rather, it’s emblematic of a nationwide trend: Colleges around the country have special LGBT student centers, graduation ceremonies, and even self-segregated LGBT dorms. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to solve this backwardness, but I do know that even DeGeneres wouldn’t dare call it progressive. Brad Polumbo is a freelance writer.

Nobody Was A More Complete Russian Stooge Than The U.S. Media,thefederalist.com,Scott Schroeder,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/nobody-complete-russian-collusion-stooge-u-s-media/,"By Scott Schroeder April 25, 2019
For the past two years, the mainstream media has reported hysterically on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. To listen to their apoplectic rants, one would believe it was the first time the Russians had ever interfered in U.S. domestic affairs.
Although this falsehood played embarrassingly well with cable news audiences, one doesn’t have to consult a CIA historian to realize that Russia has actively engaged in meddling and disinformation operations for decades to sow discord among Americans and undermine their confidence in U.S. institutions.
The 2016 Russian disinformation campaign was indisputably Russia’s most successful anti-USA propaganda operation to date. It divided families, ruptured friendships, and caused millions of Americans to question the legitimacy of their country’s leader and the system that elected him.
However, Vladimir Putin’s golden arrow was not the half-million dollars of social media advertisements and posts that seeded this turmoil, it was Russian intelligence’s minor contribution to Christopher Steele’s dossier, solicited by the Hillary Clinton campaign. What’s painfully ironic is that it did not cost Putin a dime. In fact, he likely pocketed a few Rubles from it. The Steele Dossier
This Steele dossier was the predication of the investigation into President Donald Trump, which has been at the epicenter of the country’s deep divide. The dossier was a weapon, but like all weapons, Putin needed hands to wield it: He needed accomplices. Who would put the weapon into action? Who would spread the deception to the American people and convince them that their lives and their country lay in the hands of a deranged lunatic who answered to a foreign power?
Apparently, Putin understood all too well the misplaced loyalties of the leadership Barack Obama placed in America’s judicial and intelligence institutions. He also understood the American media’s disdain for Republican presidents. He observed the escalation of the media’s attacks on Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan, and the media’s willingness to engage in lies and deception.
Although Putin is an intelligent and calculating villain, never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined such success from so little effort. It is likely he underestimated how hellbent the corrupt government officials and an unscrupulous media were to overturn the will of the American people.
Obama’s Deep State actors ran with Putin’s disinformation to initiate an unprecedented investigation on a sitting president—an investigation that lacked a shred of credible evidence to justify any level of investigation. Nonetheless, anything as illegal as an attempted soft coup predicated on knowingly false, malicious, unsubstantiated reports requires accomplices.
The perpetrators needed to convince the American people that their seditious activities had merit, so messaging to the American people needed to be consistent and repetitive. It required constant bombardment, day and night, of accusations bolstered by convincing charlatans to erode any doubt in the minds of the media audience that their outlandish accusations were true. The Media’s Role
Working together and coordinating their false pretenses, the mainstream media were successful. They convinced a large portion of the American public that their elected president was illegitimate. They convinced many that their election system and their governing documents were flawed. In doing so, they fomented discord and pitted American against American. In short, the American media accomplished Putin’s goals.
We now know that neither President Trump nor anyone in his campaign or administration coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 elections. We know that the Steele dossier, developed in collaboration with Russian intelligence operatives, was the basis for the investigation into President Trump. We are all aware of the damage this investigation and the false allegations made daily in the mainstream media did to the country in terms of financial costs, diverting attention and resources from real issues, while dividing the country.
In light of what has been learned, who should Americans blame for the fraud perpetrated on the country? Who should be the focus of the country’s ire? Putin? That would be be like sticking your hand in the lions cage and being angry at the lion for biting you. The finger should be pointed inward.
Those who serve in government positions should be trusted to do what is right and in the country’s best interests. The mainstream media should be trusted to inform the American people objectively and honestly. Both failed. However, the actions of a few bad apples in government, fueled by the accusations of a global foe, would not have been successful without the efforts of an army of journalists who worked tirelessly to convince the American people of a lie.
The sensible response of Americans would be to accept the phony Russian collusion story as a fraud and move on as a united country. Yet the mainstream media will not let this happen. They continue to hold the country hostage by continuing their baseless attacks. They continue to sow discord among Americans and undermine Americans’ faith in their government, all to Putin’s delight.
Putin will never change. He will continue to meddle in America’s domestic affairs and elections. He will continue to sow discord and undermine the U.S. government. Putin hardly needs to plant spies and engage in social media disinformation campaigns anymore. He’ll still do that, but that’s not where he’ll get the most bang for his buck.
Putin has found a loyal ally in America’s mainstream media. As he learned in 2016, he needs to do very little, as his collaborators will do his heavy lifting. As long as Putin and the American mainstream media share the same goals, America will remain divided. Unless Americans learn to change the channel.

5 Times The Mueller Probe Broke Prosecutorial Rules That Ensure Justice,thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/5-times-mueller-probe-broke-prosecutorial-rules-ensure-justice/,"By Adam Mill April 25, 2019
CNN recently published an article arguing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should not have issued a report suggesting the president may have committed obstruction of justice without actually reaching this conclusion. CNN is obviously disappointed because inside the leftist echo chamber the obstruction case seems undisputable.
For example, the Mueller report suggests that the president committed some kind of sin for wanting to fire former FBI director James Comey for being a party to the plot to blackmail or frame the president. Some believe presidents should fire FBI chiefs who participate in hoaxes against their boss.
Mueller did no favor to CNN’s client Democrats, who now face three terrible choices: (1) Impeach President Trump using their majority in the House, which will lead to a self-destructive trial in the Senate; (2) Drop it and move on in defiance of a rabid get-Trump base; or (3) use their majority in the House to drag the country through a Mueller 2.0 investigation, which runs the risk of distracting from Democratic messaging in the upcoming 2020 election.
Like Aesop’s scorpion on the frog’s back, the partisans on Mueller’s team just couldn’t help themselves. The Mueller report poisons public opinion without bringing charges. It should have been written on a postcard, because the outcome of a criminal proceeding is binary : Guilty or not guilty. There’s no middle ground under constitutional principles. President Trump is not guilty until the Senate convicts him otherwise.
Do you remember why Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote that Comey should be fired? If Rosenstein is still capable of embarrassment, it must have been hard to stand behind the lectern as he did what he has told us prosecutors and cops should never do.
Let’s review his words about Comey: “the [FBI]Director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation. Derogatory information sometimes is disclosed in the course of criminal investigations and prosecutions, but we never release it gratuitously. The Director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial. It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.”
Yet here we are, at the end of another highly political investigation with another public trashing of a target without indictment. People accused of “obstruction” or “collusion” (whatever that is) or any other crime are supposed to get their day in court. Prosecutors aren’t supposed to use the newspaper as a courtroom.
There are rules against using the power and authority of a prosecutor to smear a defendant without giving him his day in court. If Democrats impeach the president, he will receive a long-overdue opportunity to defend himself in the Senate. That is exactly why it will never happen.
Americans should be concerned about the conduct of the Mueller probe and its supervisor, Rosenstein. Let’s take a look at some of the basic law-and-order rules Mueller and Rosenstein broke during the probe of the Russia collusion hoax. 1. Using Leaks And Press Conferences to Trash Un-charged Targets
Rule 3.8 of the American Bar Association’s rules of professional responsibility for prosecutors provides,
A prosecutor shall, except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the prosecutor’s action and that serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose, refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused and exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel, employees or other persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor in a criminal case from making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited from making under Rule 3.6 or this Rule.
Mueller’s team violated this rule from virtually day one, and their final report makes no effort to hide this fact. Footnotes 561-563 cite news accounts that the president was being investigated for obstruction of justice. The sources for those news accounts? Likely Mueller’s team.
Much of the “obstruction” evidence comes from the statements of White House counsel John McGahn. We’ve known since at least January of 2018 about McGahn’s statement from “four people told of the matter.” Who would four people be who would confirm what McGahn said? Again, likely the leaks came from Mueller’s team.
For a longer list of Mueller leaks, read here . In fact, the entire report relies heavily on news accounts and indictments, neither of which constitute evidence but do remain effective for public reputation smearing.
Rosenstein, always an excellent source of legal guidance he liberally violates, spectacularly failed to direct Mueller to adhere to this principle , ““The guidance I always gave my prosecutors and the agents I worked with during my tenure on the front lines of law enforcement were if we aren’t prepared to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt in court, then we have no business making allegations against American citizens.”
So why didn’t he order Mueller to edit out the report’s innuendo and accusation that the team did not have the gumption to prosecute? Rosenstein understands the unfairness of what he did. And he did it anyway. 2. Using Their Power to Crush Client-Attorney Privilege
Rule 3.8 also provides,
A prosecutor shall not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:
(1) the information sought is not protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege;
(2) the evidence sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution; and
(3) there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the information;
When one considers the fact that Mueller knew early on, if not from day one , that there was no Russia collusion, it’s pretty hard to argue that the special counsel’s many invasions of attorney-client privilege were “essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation.”
Mueller has inflicted incalculable damage to the sacred principle of attorney-client privilege. We now know that prosecutors had search warrants collecting electronic files of the president’s private attorney within weeks of the special counsel appointment. Mueller’s team went on to coordinate a raid of Michael Cohen’s office, leading to shocking and public invasions of the attorney-client privilege.
One of Mueller’s first acts was the warrantless seizure of all of the president-elect’s emails for the entire team without regard to privilege. Add to that the now-public disclosure of Trump’s communication with McGahn, which resulted in no illegal presidential action.
We want our president, and all Americans, to be able to have a confidential conversation with his legal advisor, possibly blowing off steam or even contemplating unwise acts, without those conversations ending up in a special counsel report. It is the essence of an attorney-client relationship that the attorney is given the opportunity to confidentially guide his client away from rash action.
Because of the damage Mueller has done, future presidents may now avoid their White House counsel for fear that a special counsel will publicize the conversation. Instead, the president may act without counsel. That’s bad. 3. Prosecuting Despite Knowing They Can’t Prove Their Case
Rule 3.8 also provides “The prosecutor in a criminal case shall: refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause.”
Notwithstanding that the key collusion allegation had already been disproven before Mueller first turned on the lights in the special counsel’s office, for nearly two years Mueller has been trying President Trump in the court of public opinion . This is more than a mere expression. The venue for trying the president is in the Senate under Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, and the constitutional framers always intended that senators make their decisions based in part on the opinions of the electorate they represent.
There’s no apparent legitimate explanation for the Mueller probe to have continued the “hunt” for Russia collusion after both the House and Senate concluded their investigations finding the same thing Mueller eventually admitted. Yet another election in 2018 proceeded under that cloud and the Democrats made significant gains from motivated voters looking forward to the impeachment of a Russia-colluding president. Was the investigation left open just to gin up process crimes and tempt the president to “obstruct” an otherwise stationary investigation?
Imagine responding to a subpoena from Mueller and having to cough up voluminous financial and personal records. Now consider the fact that Mueller issued approximately 2,800 subpoenas—almost six per business day while the probe remained open. How on earth did they even review that much information?
Imagine yourself sitting through an interview with an FBI agent that might last hours. Imagine trying hard to answer the same question over and over again without contradicting yourself. Imagine searching your memory for what you said in an email or text message years ago, praying your memory remains true lest you be charged with a felony.
Now consider that 500 Americans were interrogated by federal agents during the probe—one per business day. Finally, imagine federal agents looking through your private email, pictures, and other electronic data. Imagine FBI agents swarming your house with guns drawn. Mueller executed approximately 500 search warrants against our fellow Americans, all to no end. 4. Special Counsels Aren’t Supposed to Be a Partisan Hit Squad
Federal law regarding the “Independence of the Special Counsel” says: “An individual named as Special Counsel shall be a lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking, …. The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States Government.”
Mueller should not have been selected as the special counsel, due to his close personal relationship with Comey. Further, his entire staff was clearly not impartial.
As one example, the prominent attorney Jeannie Rhee worked for the Clintons to keep Hillary’s emails out of public view only months before joining the Mueller team to investigate Hillary’s political opponent. Clinton might face legal consequences for secretly starting the Russia collusion hoax using campaign funds.
Is it a surprise that Clinton’s role in hiring Fusion GPS appears nowhere in the report? Instead, on the very first page of the report, Mueller’s team repeats the myth that the investigation began with Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos bragging to an Australian diplomat. This is the desperate cover story the media pushes to hide Clinton’s obvious effort to use campaign money to frame her political opponent.
Prosecuting Papadopoulos was key to advancing this myth because it distorted an early but innocuous “Russia has dirt” conversation into a sinister predicate for the entire hoax. Who worked on the Papadopoulos prosecutions? Jeannie Rhee .
Many of the other investigators involved in the investigation were “not from outside the United States Government,” and were already heavily involved in the hoax. You can read an in-depth analysis of the partisanship of the Mueller team here and here . This is not only a terrible look but actually contradicts federal law governing special counsels. Does anyone care? 5. Rosenstein Used His Government Position to Protect Himself
Federal conflict of interest law ( 28 C.F.R. § 45.2 (a) ) says:
Unless authorized under paragraph (b) of this section, no employee shall participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with: (1) Any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution; or (2) Any person or organization which he knows has a specific and substantial interest that would be directly affected by the outcome of the investigation or prosecution.
The Mueller report repeatedly references the indispensable role Rosenstein played as a witness (when he was supposedly supervising the investigation). As I predicted , the special counsel found no fault with Rosenstein’s participation in the Comey firing. Would Rosenstein have approved a report that said otherwise?
Of course not. This created a powerful motive for Rosenstein to hang around until the report was submitted. And that’s exactly what he did . Consider this line from the report: “Sessions and Rosenstein criticized Corney and did not raise concerns about replacing him. McGahn and Dhillon said the fact that neither Sessions nor Rosenstein objected to replacing Corney gave them peace of mind that the President’s decision to fire Corney was not an attempt to obstruct justice.”
What’s missing? Oh, how about a little post-Comey firing incident in which Rosenstein discussed recording his conversation with the president in order to recruit cabinet members to oust Trump under the 25th Amendment. One can imagine the awkward conversation in which Mueller asked Rosenstein for permission to interview Rosenstein.
Footnote 426 specifically cites Rosenstein’s May 23, 2017 statement to the special counsel as evidence. May 23, 2017? That’s less than a week after Rosenstein appointed Mueller to investigate the president for firing Comey. The conflict of interest was known immediately and should have been addressed.
The explanation justifying Rosenstein’s continued participation is nonsensical. In any case, Rosenstein should not have overseen the investigation into the president’s motives because, guess what, the investigator ended up taking a view of the facts that helped Rosenstein.
The get-Trump crowd has been carrying the scorpion of the Mueller investigation on their backs for nearly two years. The damage this has done to America may never be undone. The zealots claiming Trump to be a threat to the rule of law have proven themselves right by using their outrage to trample important constitutional principles such as the presumption of innocence, the right to defend oneself from criminal accusations, attorney-client privilege, and the right to be free from unreasonable searches.
None of that seemed important if we truly had a Russian agent occupying the White House. But we don’t. The anti-Trump zealots, not Trump, threatened these cherished principles that ensure equal treatment under the law for all Americans, even the president, regardless of political party.

Why Sticking Everyone's College Debt To Taxpayers Is Stupid And Immoral,thefederalist.com,Inez Feltscher Stepman,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/sticking-everyones-college-debt-future-taxpayers-stupid-immoral/,"April 25, 2019 By Inez Feltscher Stepman
Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed a college debt payoff that she claims out-socialists Bernie Sanders. She may be right. Her proposal calls for not only universal “free” college, but also totally wiping out the college debt of 95 percent of borrowers, with some benefits available for people up with incomes reaching all the way up to $250,000.
The plan is being sold as a boon to cash-strapped millennials and Gen-Zers, but the real recipients of largesse will be the institutions that offer those magical degrees: the universities. The biggest losers will be middle-class Americans.
Americans’ collective $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, mostly in government-backed loans, is likely to be the next looming financial crisis. Instead of underwriting loans that hand out money to “subprime” borrowers who couldn’t afford their mansions, the government now loans money to 17-year-olds to major in basket weaving, and taxpayers depend on debt-staggered students to pay it back despite unrealized income promises. The only happy partners in this equation are the universities, which continue to turn ever-higher tuition, millions in direct federal grants, and tax-free endowments into sprawling diversity departments staffed by administrators with six-figure salaries.
Regressive Democrat proposals for “free” college, like Warren’s and Sanders’, will ensure that the gravy train for universities continues at the expense of the average family making $60,000 a year and the two-thirds of Americans who do not have a college degree. College debt is—paradoxically though it may seem—largely a problem of the upper classes, with the top income quarter of households holding close to half the debt, and the bottom quarter just 10 percent.
Republican responses to such proposals have been predictably flaccid. While there is an effort to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, the piece of legislation that governs federal money streams to universities, cutting (or even freezing) subsidies is reportedly not even on the table. Instead, Republicans seem to be kowtowing to Democrats’ demands for more money in return for federal micromanagement of degree programs that look a lot like No Child Left Behind for higher education.
Even an amendment that protects freedom of speech under assault on college campuses is being treated by both parties as a distraction from the goal of sending more money to universities–because they’ve done such an excellent job with the funds taxpayers have sent them for the past several decades. The only positive in Republicans’ plans so far is refusing to allow different standards for innovative for-profit schools than for four-year institutions.
Universities once appealed to the public fisc on the basis of two assurances. First, they claimed that college-educated students would be wiser additions to the body politic: better voters, citizens, and neighbors. To advance that promise of wisdom in the days of safe spaces, intersectional Olympics, and “ cuddle parties ” is to beg for ridicule. Sixty percent of college graduates do not know how a constitutional amendment gets ratified, and only half know how long a senator’s term is.
Second, in return for our investment, colleges promised their graduates would boost the economy. A college degree, we were told, was the golden ticket to a successful life. While college graduate salaries still compare favorably with those of non-credentialed workers, it’s becoming clear that when debt and opportunity cost are taken into account, there are better ways to advance into the middle class.
Instead, what Americans have received is a breeding ground for some of the most irrational left-leaning ideas and a generation so besieged by student debt that it is a factor in one in eight divorces . One in five millennials expects to die without paying off their loans, and more than a third say their college debt wasn’t worth it .
Conservatives should have sympathy for millennial borrowers, who did everything their parents and culture told them to do to be successful, only to become the most debt-laden generation in history. Countering a culture of credentialism mania with apprenticeships and trade alternatives is a positive step, but the first rule of finding yourself in a hole should be to stop digging. There’s no reason for the average American to subsidize the elite sorting mechanism universities have become.
“Free college” proposals like Warren’s promise to make the route to success attainable for all young Americans. In reality, they grant yet another windfall to a university industry that has expanded by exploiting taxpayers and student debtors, while offering neither much in return for their outlays. The sons and daughters of the elite will receive $5 for every $1 in debt forgiveness given to poorer families, and college costs will continue their skyward march.
Our higher education system is failing students and taxpayers alike. The only entities making out like bandits in a sector awash with millions are the universities. “Free college” proposals are just more of the same, but with a few zeros attached to the price tag.

Trans Admission To HBCU Undermine What It Means To Be A Black Man,thefederalist.com,Justin Mcclinton,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/trans-admissions-to-all-male-historically-black-college-undermines-what-it-means-to-be-a-black-man/,"By Justin McClinton April 26, 2019
Beyonce’s new Netflix movie about her Coachella performance exposes the audience to the culture of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). HBCUs appeal to people because of their history and tradition.
These colleges continue to provide an education to black students, although all races are welcome to attend, that emphasizes being positive members of our community. While people like Beyonce and billionaire Robert Smith shining the spotlight on HBCUs can benefit the institutions, I fear mainstream culture has began to corrode the mission of some of these colleges. That includes my alma mater, Morehouse College, which has been an all-male institution — until now. Morehouse, the Powerhouse
Morehouse is an all-male college that boasts alumni such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Howard Thurman. The Atlanta-based college, like the city it is located in, has a strong gay male culture. In 2009, students cross-dressing on campus led administrators to create a dress code that explicitly forbade students from wearing women’s clothes.
Despite the dress code, the shifting culture around gender identity brought many young men who consider themselves gender non-conforming. I attended Morehouse with several non-conforming students who are biologically male, and I consider them just as much my Morehouse brothers as any other alumnus.
When Morehouse hired last year its first non-alumni president in five decades, I feared he would bring the sort of corrosive liberal policies that define predominantly white colleges and universities. This fear may have been founded, since the men’s college has recently changed its admissions policy to include the acceptance of transgender people who are biologically female.
The new policy states, “Morehouse will consider for undergraduate admission those applicants who live and self-identify as men, regardless of the sex assigned to them at birth.” This makes it clear the agenda of its Ivy League-educated president is to make Morehouse just like the liberal, white campuses that he is accustomed to. The “who live” part of the policy is the most troubling.
When I was a student at Morehouse, we were able to celebrate our differences and learn from one another. This was, in large part, due to the fact that the majority of us were black men. That common understanding is what makes Morehouse different from other colleges. This is undermined by stretching the definition of “black man.” If anyone can be a black man, this cheapens the experience of students currently on campus.
It is unsettling that a bureaucrat will get to determine what it means for a student to “live” as a man in order to determine whether someone with two X chromosomes should be allowed to attend an all-male college. Accepting students who are biologically female undermines the fact that the campus is historically all-male.
Morehouse was founded in 1867 to provide black men a college education. This tradition has stood more than 150 years, only to be undermined by people who don’t care about the history of the college. Spelman College, an all women’s HBCU located next to Morehouse, has instituted a similar policy to allow transgender males to attend. They celebrated when a trans man graduated from campus, even though this person was biologically female. Gender Ideology Undermines the Unique Value of Each Sex
This redefinition of biological “sex” is merely the tool of destructive identity politics, and it does not belong at HBCUs. These sorts of policies are especially out of place at single-sex campuses that don’t even allow students to have overnight visitors of the opposite sex.
Single-sex colleges and the notion that sex is assigned at birth cannot coexist. An astute Twitter commenter pointed out that the logical end of these liberal gender policies is also the end of single-sex institutions. A student at Morehouse has suggested that because “they” do not use masculine pronouns the college should stop using masculine pronouns . While these single-sex colleges might seem out of date, upholding tradition is the greatest defense against the degenerative, liberal forces that threaten our nation.
HBCU traditions are under threat thanks to outside influences that promote a western universalism based on faulty leftist ideology. Just like feminism has been used to manipulate women, identity politics continues to be used to manipulate minorities. The fact that Morehouse and Spelman have accepted these policies points out how dangerous it is to be beholden to external parties. Accepting this foolishness is little more than a cash grab. HBCUs will quickly find out that chasing liberal validation will only result in fool’s gold.
Paying lip service to the liberal elite plays on people’s emotions to gain political power. Statements like this from the current president of Morehouse: “I think Morehouse having the courage to speak to issues of masculinity in today’s environment is important,” diverts attention from the real issues facing America’s black communities. A positive black masculinity is best used to address the issues we have building strong family structures. Accepting a belief system that views traditional masculinity as toxic diverts this mission.
HBCUs have remained a beacon of hope in promoting traditional values, but they are clearly not impervious to the constant threat of liberal thinking. The Far-Left Doesn’t Represent Black Men
Morehouse and black people in general are in no way advanced by the far left’s views. The slippery slope toward “eliminating sex distinctions” is a threat to the black nuclear family.
Identity politics foster “a spirit of resentment” that pits the sexes against one another. The worst aspect of identity politics is that it makes citizens easier to control. This agenda conveniently makes all struggles the same.
A white man once proclaimed to me it was okay for him to refer to himself as a “pink n—er” because he is gay. Intersectional thought like this compels people to compare struggles and assume they are equal. Predominantly white colleges have disavowed their own traditions in order to keep up with the times, causing much of the value in American higher education to be watered down. HBCUs should not follow suit.
HBCUs are going down that same path because out-of-touch bureaucrats believe that is in the best interest of these institutions’ future. Yet these campuses are too precious a resource to water down in a time where all forms of tradition stand against the agenda of America’s corrupt elite.

Middlebury College Fracas Shows How Democracy Turns Totalitarian,thefederalist.com,Paula Rinehart,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/newest-middlebury-college-fracas-illustrates-democracy-turns-totalitarian/,"By Paula Rinehart April 26, 2019
A few years ago, a Polish statesman and philosophy professor with a hard-to-spell name, Ryszard Legutko, captured the imagination of many with his claim that “liberal democracy,” as it was being practiced in the west, is turning totalitarian. How could democracy begin to mimic Communism, minus Soviet-style brutality? It was an intriguing thesis.
Like many readers of Legutko, I was mesmerized by his book, “ The Demon in Democracy .” In 2016, when the book was published, democracy-turned-despotic still seemed a remote possibility, more like a small dark cloud on a distant horizon.
This past week, on the campus of Middlebury College, students and faculty proved Legutko’s point without him having to speak a word. Actually, he didn’t get to deliver the address that Middlebury invited him to give because after his plane landed, he received notice that he had been “disinvited.” The same campus that assaulted Charles Murray a few years before missed the chance to redeem its reputation as a place of academic inquiry.
What was Legutko’s crime? He’s not a big fan of multiculturalism, this is true. He holds the same traditional views on marriage to which faithful Catholics have subscribed for centuries. These and other thought transgressions mark him guilty. He must be silenced. Punished.
“He’s a f-cking homophobe,” students protested . Marginalized students would have their “academic freedom” compromised because Legutko’s presence causes them so much pain they cannot learn. Professors at Middlebury declined to exercise the courage of right-sizing students’ perspectives on the nature of academic learning, which always includes a variety of viewpoints. An audio tape of the student-faculty meeting records professors docilely agreeing with students, promising never to make this mistake again. “You should be outraged,” one adds.
Legutko was eventually ushered into one professor’s class, where about 40 students got the privilege of hearing him. Small ripples of applause could be heard as Legutko made comparisons and drew irrefutable parallels between liberal democracy and communist practice and ideology.
The vilification of those who differ, the use of social engineering and social control to punish, dividing all issues into victims and oppressors—what Legutko describes is no longer a small cloud on the horizon. It’s the air we are breathing. Legutko simply does the work that only someone raised in a communist state can do well, which is to name “liberal democracy” as old-school totalitarianism in modern garb .
Sadly, the larger consortium of Middlebury students missed out on hearing a true intellectual whose breadth of knowledge in history, economics, philosophy, and religion would normally send a person scrambling to take notes. Legutko is the embodiment of a genuinely educated person.
Legutko has been a prophetic voice warning that liberal democracy is a rigid orthodoxy determined to create a political mechanism for selecting people, organizations, and ideas that subscribe to its grand march of progress. He traces in detail how a hyper-focus on “equality” becomes a most clever means to garner power for the state. Sexual politics, he explains, is the major weapon used to destroy the old order and the instrument to forge a new one in which the individual is “coerced into the freedom” of the libertine life.
In decades past, professors from western universities were quietly smuggled into Soviet classrooms. Now, we are the ones spiriting the divergent voice into our midst through the back door, hoping we are not called out by a new version of secret police.
The irony must be particularly rich for Legutko. The students and faculty of Middlebury College provided a live demonstration that profoundly proved his treatise: only a narrow band of thought will be allowed in the brave new world being crafted in the name of “democracy.”
Legutko never got the hearing he deserved at Middlebury . But his rejection proves the utter truth he writes, “In its essence, liberalism is unabashedly aggressive because it is determined to hunt down all non-liberal agents and ideas, which it treats as a threat to itself and to humanity.”
When he’s invited back to this country, to some American university courageous enough to practice academic inquiry, perhaps he can address the question behind the question: so where, exactly, shall we go these days to learn?

When seeking to become the leader of the free world, it’s important to have a few key issues. Obviously, eradicating geese should be part of any candidate’s platform, but winged sky trash isn’t the only natural enemy we should be worried about. No, there is another enemy‒one much more pleasing‒that we need to consider, especially when it’s spring.
We’re talking about flora, not fauna. Mr. T may have focused his ire on trees , but he really should have gone after anything that blooms. Sure, it’s pretty and spring is a lovely season, what with all the flowers and fresh growth and the return of the leaves, but it also aggressively attacks those of us in the populace who suffer from allergies. Our sinuses fill, our brains turn to mush, we sneeze. It’s really a hassle.
Some may say it’s not really that much of a hassle, but now more than ever, it’s important to give all our grievances a public hearing. It’s especially important when those grievances involve the environment, which my advisors tell me is an issue that matters to lots of people who may or may not vote, but do like to gripe on social media.
In any case, in 2020, you have a choice. You can go for those who want to play Johnny Appleseed or you can go for those who have your ability to breathe freely in mind. (My advisors also caution me that trees and other flora may be important to helping us breathe and that “the environment” isn’t an issue people care about because they want to defeat it, but I make it a point not to listen to them too much and instead focus on what various cranks on the internet say.)
So let us rise up and declare not war, because that takes a lot of effort, but instead declare an ongoing conflict with nature. America: We’ve got grudges and we know how to use them. If you feel your anger waning, I offer my services as Grudge Monitor. The Grudge Monitor is never appeased nor should you be.

Because it’s best to get things off our chest. Or out of them, as it were. Also, stay angry, my friends. Much like sneezing, holding in an eye roll can be dangerous.
It is important to note that we’re not declaring an act of conflict on fauna, especially fauna that is delightfully aggressive. Plus people like candidates who have a pet. Who’s the crazy one now, I ask, as I return my badger to its Babybjörn carrier.

Kansas Supreme Court Issues Shocking Victory For Abortion Supporters,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/kansas-supreme-court-issues-shocking-victory-abortion-supporters/,"By Margot Cleveland April 26, 2019
Today, in a 6-1 decision , the Kansas Supreme Court held in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt, that the state constitution guarantees a right to abortion.
The named plaintiffs, Herbert Hodes and his daughter Traci Nauser, are two late-term abortionists who challenged Kansas’ ban on live dismemberment abortions—abortions which cause death by ripping the limbs and torso off of a fetus. Over the last several years, federal courts have declared similar bans on dismemberment abortions unconstitutional, but today’s decision is significant because, unlike other cases, it is based on a state constitutional right to abortion. The Majority Opinion
The majority in Hodes , held that Section 1 of the Kansas Bill of Rights enshrine a right to abortion in the state constitution, by providing “All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” This language, the Court concluded, guaranteed citizen “rights that preexisted the formation of the Kansas government,” and included in the “natural, inalienable rights” protected by Section 1 are “the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one’s own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination.”
The Kansas Supreme Court reasoned:
“This right allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life—decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy. Although not absolute, this right is fundamental. Accordingly, the State is prohibited from restricting this right unless it is doing so to further a compelling government interest and in a way that is narrowly tailored to that interest.”
After concluding that the Kansas constitution guarantees a right to an abortion, the state Supreme Court remanded the case for a determination of whether the Kansas Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act violates the newly defined constitutional right.
While the outcome was expected, given that former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, an abortion supporter, had appointed four of the seven Kansas Supreme Court justices, the 6-1 vote surprised some in the pro-life community. In addition to Sebelius’ appointed justices, Justices Marla Luckert and Lawton Nuss signed on to the majority opinion. The opinion was issued as a per curiam decision, thus not naming an individual justice as the author. The Dissent
The sole dissent came from Justice Caleb Stegall. In his lengthy dissent, Stegall stressed that “this case is not only about abortion policy—the most divisive social issue of our day—it is more elementally about the structure of our republican form of government.” Continuing, Justice Stegall explained:
“Here we venture onto a battlefield as old as politics itself. And as we argue about the structure of government—and ultimately delineate the proper conditions for just rule—we must never forget that we are also actively engaged in ruling.
The structural idea that gave birth to Kansas as a political community, which has achieved consensus support across most of our history, is that the proper conditions for just rule are met via participatory consent to secure and promote the common welfare. Today, a majority of this court dramatically departs from this consensus. Today, we hoist our sail and navigate the ship-of-state out of its firm anchorage in the harbor-of-common-good and onto the uncertain waters of the sea-of-fundamental-values. Today we issue the most significant and far-reaching decision this court has ever made.
The majority’s decision is so consequential because it fundamentally alters the structure of our government to magnify the power of the state—all while using that power to arbitrarily grant a regulatory reprieve to the judicially privileged act of abortion. In the process, the majority abandons the original public meaning of section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights and paints the interest in unborn life championed by millions of Kansans as rooted in an ugly prejudice.”
The Kansas Supreme Court’s decision today represents the latest example of the left pushing for the expansion of abortion laws. Earlier this year, New York’s passage of an extreme abortion-until-birth law made headlines, as did a similar law that failed in Virginia. The Kansas case is different though, as the pro-abortion decision came from the unelected judicial branch: By creating a state constitutional right to abortion, the Kansas Supreme Court has usurped the legislative branch’s authority to enact pro-life laws consistent with the conservative values of Kansans. The Pro-Life Reaction
Mary Kay Culp, executive director of Kansans for Life, told The Federalist:
“This horrendous ruling is due to the Court’s false claim that there exists a ‘right to abortion’ in our 1859 state constitution that despite being unstated somehow deserves to trump 45 years of citizen efforts that have cut abortions in half, increased women’s right to know protections, and resulted in the first state law to send the heinous dismemberment abortion method packing.”
Over the last decade, abortion providers and advocacy organizations have quietly pushed a strategy of using liberal judges in conservatives states to invent a state constitutional right to abortion—both as a failsafe should the United States Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade and as a means of attacking state restrictions on abortion upheld by federal courts.
The strategy has proven successful, as seen by NARAL Pro-Choice America’s boast that “15 states’ constitutions provide greater protection of a woman’s right to choose than does the federal constitution.” For instance, while the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law prohibiting physician assistances from performing abortions, the Montana Supreme Court struck the law, concluding it violated the state constitution.
The Kansas Supreme Court decision cannot be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court because the power to interpret a state constitution rests solely with the state’s judicial branch. That leaves pro-life Kansans with one option—amend the state constitution. To do so, both the Kansas House and Senate must approve a proposed constitutional amendment by a two-thirds majority vote, at which point the amendment is placed on the state’s next November ballot for voters to decide.
With the state’s legislative session set to end next week, it is unlikely pro-life representatives will succeed in approving a proposed constitutional amendment before recessing for the summer. Absent a special election, the earliest Kansans could seek to overturn the decision, then, would be during the 2020 August primaries. Or, if delayed, the measure could be on the ballot for the November 2020 presidential election, at which time the future of Roe would also likely be on the line—as well as the lives of millions of human beings.

Why You Should Plan A Low-Screen Summer For Your Kids,thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/plan-low-screen-summer-kids/,"By Joy Pullmann April 26, 2019
In the past decade there has been an explosion in research and anecdotes demonstrating that screen use has some highly negative effects that are worse for children. In response, a niche market has cropped up among people trying to use technology better, as represented by, for example, Cal Newport’s new book, “Digital Minimalism” and James Clear’s writings on productivity .
Yet it seems our society at large is still in the “early adopter” stage of questioning and limiting our tech addictions. Public schools continue to amp up screen-led learning despite myriad high-profile failures at giving all kids a device and the increasing amount of research questioning those decisions. While I ran errands last week, the majority of children I saw out with their parents or grandparents were staring at phones or tablets as they sat in their strollers or in restaurants.
T ime use studies still find Americans, including children, gobbling insane amounts of green-glow time. Kids ages 2 to 8 average 2.5-3 hours of daily screen time , or about 20 hours per week. Kids ages 8 to 12 average 4.5 hours of daily screen time , or more than 30 hours per week. Teens average more than six hours per day, or more than 40 hours per week. Teens could literally hold down a full-time job if they cut out the video games and YouTube. None of this is for school, either, as school-age kids average 16 minutes of daily school-related screentime.
We know deep inside that there’s something wrong with all this, and the proliferation of panicked online articles, including the replete genre of “I dumped my smartphone” articles, recently topped off by Charlotte Church, is evidence of that intuition. Sixty percent of American parents think their kids are addicted to screens (yet keep supplying the screens). One-third say they argue daily with their kids about screen use. Half of teens say they feel addicted to their devices. We’re definitely conflicted about our relationship with media, but often we just allow that conflict to ebb and flow as it will without taking proactive steps to intentionally direct it.
There’s a way out of this. It requires first getting over our inertia and deciding something must and will be done. Then once we’re convinced a change is necessary, we have to make that change wisely. Summer is the perfect time of year to plan and execute a reset of damaging family screen habits.
Future articles (I’ll link here after they’re published) will concern how to set yourself and your family up for success in replacing media addictions with more fulfilling and worthwhile pursuits. This one aims to convince you it’s necessary. No Child Needs a Screen. Period.
I’m going to be blunt: There is no real benefit to your children of using a cell phone, tablet, or computer before about age 12. They gain absolutely nothing of value that they could not get in a better way from some other activity. Zero . (Special-needs kids who use tablets for things like communication are obviously rare exceptions.) That includes entertainment, which we’ll talk about later, but right now just consider actual need .
Typing, or other computer use skills? Look, insofar as typing will be necessary in the decade or more from now when today’s kids presumably will be ready for a career — and we might all very well be using voice commands or even brain commands by then, making keyboards obsolete — it is a stupidly easy skill they can pick up in about two weeks of short lessons, tops.
Remember Mavis Beacon? It’s free now. If your kids are so typing-challenged at the time they actually need to produce a paper longer than 600 words — and it’s not a typical school that requires that until high school now, sad to say — you can help them solve that problem pronto. The same goes for all other pinch, swipe, and search skills, which kids pick up in about 90 seconds flat. Further, it’s actually better for their brains to write by hand instead of by computer.
Needing to contact you? How did parents ever parent before cell phones became ubiquitous in the last decade? They talked and made plans beforehand, that’s how. When kids really need their parents (i.e., medical emergency on the school playground, a spontaneous after-school playdate) another adult can call using his cell phone.
For safety reasons? Get the kid a walkie talkie, an electronic tracker, or a dumbphone if you’re anxious. But you really don’t need to. Again, ten years ago there were not mass murders of ten-year-olds who didn’t have cell phones. The safety concern is an illusion, a cover for our screen compulsions. Kids today are safer than kids have ever been in the history of mankind . They’re far more likely to be endangered by being fat because they stare at screens too much than they are to get injured, kidnapped, or any other hypothetical risk of being more active.
Kids get antsy in the doctor’s waiting room? Bring a book or some crayons and a coloring book, for Pete’s sake. It’s not that hard to not raise a zombie.
Just try to think of any reason your child truly needs a phone or tablet. There isn’t one. Screens Are For Parents Who Haven’t Learned Better Skills
Now that we’ve established your child does not need a screen, you are freer to consider its true value to your family. Most of them are actually benefits to parents, in the vein of buying a half hour (or, let’s be accurate: three to six hours a day) of kids sitting, glassy-eyed and not bickering or destroying your kitchen cabinets. It’s kid soma .
We all have had the days where every kid in the house is vacillating between puking all over you and screaming their feverish little brains out. That is a great day to pop some soma. But in reality, parenting days like those are extremely rare and not the typical reason for handing over the blue rectangle. We do it because it’s easier than genuine parenting, which requires actively cultivating our kids towards excellence.
Our job is to help our children learn how to be the best adults they can be, and we cannot help them do that if we’re not using media intentionally or teaching them how. We must stop being in denial about how addicted we and our kids are, and what we’re losing in the process. So it’s time to step up, ditch the denial, and prepare to lead. Screens Suck Your Family’s Growth Potential
Most parents are almost certainly not aware that when we hand our kids the Kindle again, we’re damaging our kids and our relationship. We’re developing the habit in ourselves and our children of addictively medicating and separating from each other when bored rather than using boredom as a personal and relational growth opportunity. It’s time to stop that, for the sake of our kids. They deserve much better, and we are capable of giving it to them.
Dennis Prager wrote recently about the erosion of hobbies, and how the most direct way to create the time for this kind of self-development is by limiting screens: “There is a world of difference between being active and being passive, between creating something and watching something, between doing something and being entertained… what will your child’s most important passion be after leaving school—in other words, for the next 70 years of his or her life?”
Prager referenced an article by younger writer Dan Scotti, “ Why Don’t Millennials Have Hobbies Anymore ?”“None of my friends have hobbies,” Scotti writes, and neither does he. “We’re not looking for the things that interest us or uniquely move us; we’re simply fixated on whatever is prepared for us on a silver platter by media outlets and trending topics.” Is that the kind of person you want to become, and want your children to become? If not, the time to prevent it is now.
My parents were screen Nazis when I was a kid. Our movie and Windows 95 “Oregon Trail” time were very limited. At the time it annoyed me, and I nagged them plenty about it, with the inevitable comparisons to all the other kids in town. But now as an adult, I have so many enjoyable modes of being thanks to my parents imposing self-control on me until I could control myself.
I paint (oils, walls, and acrylics), draw, crochet, sew, garden, and have even recently taken up woodworking and bike riding. I cook, bake, decorate, and am learning to landscape. I read like an addict. As a teen, I learned to ride and train horses, and wrote a book with the free time my parents secured by choking off the screens. Today, I have five kids, and when the babies wean I get bored and want another one. You can’t tell me another baby isn’t way better than having watched everything on Netflix . Not Just Opportunity Cost, But Active Harm to Kids
One of the worst things about screen-watching the equivalent of a part-time or full-time job’s worth of hours in a week is all the potential for creativity, learning, self-care and happiness it sucks out of a person’s life. It’s a major opportunity cost.
It’s also actively harmful to kids. For one, kids’ fitness levels today are at life-endangering low levels. Among kids ages 5 to 10, three-quarters spend less than one hour per day physically active, as a direct result of their screen use. I have kids in this age range. If they behaved that sedately I’d be sure they were sick. Not incidentally, they are also as fit as a fiddle.
Recent data from 28 advanced countries shows the kids are sick. Compared to kids 50 years ago, kids today “take 90 seconds longer to run a mile” and their “aerobic fitness has declined by 5 percent.” These are major risk factors for heart disease, a leading indicator of lifelong health problems.
Researcher Jean Twenge and many researchers have also exhaustively documented numerous psychological problems linked with increased screen use among children, as well as their higher susceptibility to related problems and an inability to control their use due to immature brains. Screen use is correlated with depression, ADHD, anxiety , and a host of other psychological problems.
“There’s many studies that look at MRI scans of the brain of kids who play a lot of video games, 20 hours or more of video games a week. And when they compare them to people who are addicted to, say, drugs or alcohol, their brains scans are similar,” Dr. Delaney Ruston told PBS about the documentary “Screenagers.”“So, something is really happening on a physiological level. It’s not just psychological.”
Add to this the negative effects on the life of the mind. In “The Wired Child,” Dr. Richard Freed writes, “research indicates that technologies our kids typically spend so much time with, including video games and social networks, hinder their success in school.” A recent survey from Common Sense Media found that kids are reading less than ever, partly due to staring at glowing boxes instead:
not only do reading rates decline as kids get older, but they’ve also dropped off significantly in the past 30 years. In 1984, 8% of 13-year-olds and 9% of 17-year-olds said they ‘never’ or ‘hardly ever’ read for pleasure. In 2014, that number had almost tripled, to 22% and 27%. Girls also tend to read more than boys, as 18% of boys say they read daily, while 30% of girls do.
Parents are also reading to their kids less than ever. In 1999, children ages 2 to 7 were read to for an average of 45 minutes per day. In 2013, that number had dropped to an average of just over 30 minutes per day.
It’s not merely because screentertainment displaces time kids could spend reading or thinking, although it definitely does that. It’s also because electronic media are less mentally “sticky”: people understand and remember more of what they read on paper.
One study found what others have also, that “students who read texts in print scored significantly better on the reading comprehension test than students who read the texts digitally.” Children and teens also prefer to read in print instead of on screens, and they read more when they do so in print. All You Have to Lose Are Poor Parenting Habits
Might you and your kids escape from all these terrible possibilities of screen overuse? Certainly. But you aren’t so far, are you? Be honest.
Also, why take all these risks with your kids for something that is not necessary, and when so many better opportunities to use their time exist? Literally playing in the mud with sticks would be better for kids than getting their grubs on a phone. It would help develop their imaginations, creativity, attention spans, curiosity, fine and gross motor skills, and relationships with the natural world and fellow mud-dabblers.
As a parent, my guess of the biggest barrier to change is not knowing how and not wanting to endure your kids’ withdrawal symptoms. I have some strategies for both that I’ll share next time.

Stop Complaining About Debt If You Spent 4 Years At College Instead Of 3,thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/stop-complaining-about-debt-if-you-spent-4-years-at-college-instead-of-3/,"By Liz Wolfe April 26, 2019
Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate and senator from Massachusetts, wants to cancel everyone’s student loan debt and make college free, she announced earlier this week.
Although she isn’t billing it as such, Warren’s plan will give handouts mostly to those who are wealthy already, or at least are on their way to upward mobility. Those people should not be priority candidates for government assistance. Inez Feltscher Stepman writes at The Federalist , “College debt is—paradoxically though it may seem—largely a problem of the upper classes, with the top income quarter of households holding close to half the debt, and the bottom quarter just 10 percent.”
Over at Reason, Peter Suderman identifies this same problem, saying, “the nature of college attendance and student loans means that Warren’s loan forgiveness plan is a massive giveaway to relatively well-off people.” He continues, “In the U.S., only about a third of people over 25 have a college degree, making them a comparatively elite group whose elite status is reinforced by, among other things, the connections they make while at college.”
I went to a decently fancy school, the College of William and Mary, and know many people struggling with the tab they had accrued upon graduating. For people from poorer families, who got no help from parents, I feel plenty of sympathy. For people from wealthier families, who got some amount of help from their parents yet are still stuck with a hefty chunk of student loan debt, I feel less sympathy. The hard truth is that if people were more strategic about reducing their debt burden, they could have graduated in three years instead of four.
I graduated in two and a half years while working 20-25 hours per week. I received a good bit of financial help from my parents, but it was not at all enough to cover four years of in-state tuition and living expenses. My plan from the start was to graduate in three years. After my first year, I realized I was going to run out of money before three years were over, so I sped it up. I entered school with roughly 40 credits through a combination of community college classes, Advanced Placement credits, and my high school’s dual enrollment program, where students could take classes at Virginia Commonwealth University, which counted toward most state school degrees.
Once I entered college, I had to petition do-nothing bureaucrats to let me take 19, 20, and 21 credit semesters to make it all work. I knew I didn’t want to go to grad school, so I got Cs and Ds in a lot of my classes, intentionally; I wanted to exert the minimal amount of effort because I was singleminded in my goal—to graduate with no debt and get the heck out the dismal swamp of Williamsburg, Virginia. I still wish I’d dropped out, but I’m at least glad to not be saddled with massive payments several years out.
Decently wealthy, decently high-performing students can and should do this. Administrators won’t make it easy or tell you this is a doable plan, because they have no incentive to. They want to suckle more money from you, your parents, and taxpayers, pretending it’s in service of your bright, bright future.
When I was in school, I asked for data on the number of students who had graduated in two and a half years over the past decade. The provost’s office identified about 15 (the number of three-year graduates was an order of magnitude higher).
This is a fundamental flaw in the way we’re messaging college. We’re telling people to prioritize the wrong things—the experience, not the shackles of debt; doing what’s normal, not doing what sets you up for happier adulthood; luxuriating in your four years, not thinking forward to the decades you might spend seemingly drowning in stress based on a decision you made at a very young age.
We’re failing students by not reminding them early graduation is an option, by not communicating what sort of dent loan payments will make in each and every paycheck for the next decade. We’re failing them when we put hurdles in their way, making it harder to take a creative path through college , acting like “good” and prestigious students would never dream of workarounds like mine.
Understandably, this is an area where people get defensive, regretful—perhaps defensive because they’re regretful—and self-righteous pretty quickly. People are convinced that their path was right, or that their circumstances dictated why they did college a certain way. People rarely self-identify an agency problem because that would require deeper reflection, and they might not like what they find.
To be sure, there are circumstances that make a route like mine harder. But specifically for this subset of students I described (one whose parents will not be footing the entire bill, but can chip in for a portion of it, who attend schools that have AP and dual-enrollment offerings), it shouldn’t be criminal to suggest that four years’ worth of college can reasonably be completed in three.
This route requires some sacrifice: you will drink less watery, garbage beer. Professors and administrators might try to instill doubt in you (remember, their incentives are not aligned with yours). You will feel overworked. Still, you always have the option of failure—and failure, in this case, means taking four years to graduate instead of three. At a highway robbery institution school like William and Mary, that would mean saving $23,400 .
Warren’s plan is foolish for many reasons, mostly because she’s attempting to provide handouts that help relatively affluent people get even wealthier. The government already botched their meddling in the higher education industry, and that’s a big reason we’re in this mess.
If you want to reduce your debt burden, don’t take other people’s money to do it. Attempt to get a little more creative and stop buying into the four-year college dream you’ve been peddled by scammers who don’t really care about your future at all.

Joe Biden On Anita Hill In 1998: 'She Was Lying',thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/28/joe-biden-on-anita-hill-in-1998-she-was-lying/,"By Mollie Hemingway April 28, 2019
Former vice president Joe Biden repeatedly said on The View on Friday that he believed Anita Hill from the moment he heard her tale of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas. But he previously told Sen. Arlen Specter that it was clear her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee included lies.
“Not only didn’t I vote for Clarence Thomas, I believed her from the beginning. I was against Clarence Thomas, I did everything in my power to defeat Clarence Thomas and he won by the smallest margin anyone ever won going on the Supreme Court,” Biden told “The View’s” Joy Behar.
But in 1998, Biden admitted to Specter that “It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, [Hill] was lying” about a key part of her testimony. The exchange was published in Specter’s 2000 memoir , “Passion for Truth: From Finding JFK’s Single Bullet to Questioning Anita Hill to Impeaching Clinton.”
The issue is important, as the media and other partisans rewrite the historical record about Hill and her accusations. The widely watched hearings revealed inaccuracies in Hill’s various versions of events and ended with 58 percent of Americans believing Thomas and only 24 percent believing Hill . There was no gap between the sexes in the results. In the intervening years, activists have relentlessly attempted to change the narrative, writing fan fiction about Hill, bestowing honors on her, and asserting that her disputed allegations were credible.
On “The View,” Biden claimed, “If you go back and look at what I said and didn’t say, I don’t think I treated her badly. I took on her opposition. What I couldn’t figure out how to do — and we still haven’t figured it out – how do you stop people from asking inflammatory questions?”
Prominent media partisans attacked Specter for asking tough questions of Hill. Or really, just for asking simple questions she struggled to answer. He began by noting that many people had reported Hill had praised Thomas and his nomination to the Supreme Court. These included a former colleague at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where both Hill and Thomas had worked years prior. Another person corroborated the colleague’s claim.
Hill disputed their claims. She also disputed the former dean of her law school, who said she had praised Thomas as a “fine man and an excellent legal scholar.” Then she claimed she didn’t know a woman named Phyllis Barry, who had told The New York Times that Hill’s allegations “were the result of Ms. Hill’s disappointment and frustration that Mr. Thomas did not show any sexual interest in her.”
Under questioning from Specter, in which he mentioned that two colleagues had provided statements attesting that she knew Barry, Hill was forced to concede that she knew her and had worked with her at the EEOC.
Specter then asked about the major contradictions between her testimony to the Senate and her interviews with the FBI. Her testimony with the Senate was much more colorful and descriptive even though it took place just days after her FBI interviews.
Finally he asked Hill about a USA Today article that claimed, “Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument that ‘quietly and behind the scenes’ would force him to withdraw his name.”
Specter read from the article: “Keith Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill and former Senate Judiciary Committee staffer, says Hill was advised by Senate staffers that her charge would be kept secret and her name kept from public scrutiny.” Later it said, “They would approach Judge Thomas with the information and he would withdraw and not turn this into a big story, Henderson says.”
Specter asked her if this was true, attempting to find out what Senate Democrats had arranged with Hill. Nine times she denied the claim, demurred, or otherwise attempted to get away from the question. She said she could vividly remember events related to Thomas from many years prior, but couldn’t quite remember this conversation from weeks prior. Specter described the scene in the book, and even interviewed Biden about it:
After this exchange Biden recessed the committee. Biden told me in November 1998, ‘It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, she was lying.’
‘At that point I truncated the hearing and recessed it early for lunch,’ Biden said. ‘I turned to my chief of staff and said, ‘Go down and tell her lawyers that if her recollection is not refreshed by the time she gets back, I will be compelled to pursue the same line of questioning the Senator [Specter] did. Because it seems to me, she did what he said.’
Biden, as the committee’s chairman and top Democrat, would have carried great sway if he had suggested publicly that Hill was lying when she repeatedly answered questions about Thomas’s potential withdrawal by saying she didn’t remember.
Now that he’s running for president again, Biden may be trying to avoid the reality of Hill’s weak testimony or his role in encouraging her to answer the question forthrightly. But in 1991, when Hill came back from lunch, her story had changed.
“There was some indication that the candidate — excuse me — the nominee might not wish to continue the process,” Hill admitted. Asked to clarify whether a particular staffer had told her that Thomas “might not wish to continue to go forward with his nomination, if you came forward?” Hill again admitted, “Yes.”
The exchange was just one example of why so many Americans outside of the liberal media thought Hill lacked credibility. Specter credited Biden’s warning to Hill about her lies as helping her with her eroding credibility: “Hill’s afternoon modification of her morning testimony, therefore, was not only deliberate but calculated to avoid greater erosion to her credibility.”
There were many problems with Hill’s claims, including that the record showed she had followed Thomas from a protected service job at the Education Department to one at the EEOC. The Yale Law graduate claimed she was confused about whether she could keep her job at the Education Department. She’d also voluntarily accompanied him to a speech, and had repeatedly called him with pleasantries. Thomas’ secretary had kept logs of Hill’s many calls. One message simply said she was calling to check in, for example.
Two FBI special agents swore out an affidavit after Hill’s testimony outlining “contradictions” between her interviews with them and her testimony. Special Agent Jolene Smith Jameson wrote, “Professor Hill made comments that were in contradiction with statements she had made to SAs Jameson and John B. Luton.” They also disputed her characterization of how honest they instructed her to be.
The media, who have defended Hill for decades despite inconsistencies and inaccuracies in her story, are upset that Biden didn’t apologize to Hill. “Biden Struggles to Apologize for Anita Hill’s Treatment, Reassure Women,” read the headline for Bloomberg’s Jennifer Epstein’s “news” story.
On “The View,” one interlocutor told Biden that people were upset he hadn’t allowed other women to testify against Thomas. He explained that he tried to get them to testify, but there were problems and that forcing them to testify may have been worse for Hill. He was understating wildly, referring to the last woman mentioned in this summary of problems with Hill’s alleged witnesses :
Hill’s four alleged corroborating witnesses provided very weak testimony. One witness told Committee staff that the alleged harassment happened before Hill ever worked for Thomas. Another witness claimed that Hill had no political motives to oppose Thomas because she was a conservative who fully supported the Reagan Administration’s civil rights policies. This representation was false. Angela Wright , who many claimed would provide similar testimony as Hill, declined to testify because of serious credibility issues related to her motives and her previous efforts to falsely accuse a supervisor of racism.
Much revisionist history has been drafted by partisans who oppose Thomas’s judicial philosophy. It’s true that Biden did his best to help Hill, including concealing witnesses who would have been a disaster under examination. But even he admitted to his colleague Specter that Hill was lying.
Hill’s allegations against Thomas were far from convincing when she made them, and the passage of time has done nothing to bolster the veracity of her accusations. But based on the uncritical acceptance of the revisionist history of the Clarence Thomas hearings, it’s crystal clear that journalists would do well to familiarize themselves with the actual facts of what happened and call Biden to account for his treatment of Thomas.

‘Avengers: Endgame’ Makes It Easier To Say Goodbye To An Era,thefederalist.com,John Cooper,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/avengers-endgame-makes-easier-say-goodbye-era/,"By John Cooper April 29, 2019
“It’s the end, the end of the path I started us on.” With the release of “Avengers: Endgame,” and after 11 years and 22 films, we are indeed at the end of the path Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man started us all on, and while that’s a somewhat bittersweet fact, “Endgame” is a fitting way to conclude that journey.
This is a unique moment in cinema. There will certainly be more Marvel Cinematic Universe films—Spiderman and Black Panther sequels are already on deck, as well as a third installment in the Guardians of the Galaxy series—but even before its release, it was widely accepted that “Endgame” represented the definitive end to this era of the MCU and the beginning of a transition to something new.
So, naturally, for this longtime fan of these films and these characters, the days leading up to the release of “Endgame” were a mix of emotions. Those included anticipation and excitement, certainly, but also a nervousness that perhaps the Russo brothers would uncharacteristically slip up and deliver a sub-par film.
More keenly, though, was a sense of sadness that this phase of the MCU is coming to a definitive close. Along with that was the understanding that, as with most things in life, there comes a time to move on. While doing so is never simple, this film makes taking that next step easier.
This film had a lot to accomplish. It had to drop us into a world shattered by a single snap of the Mad Titan’s fingers, reintroduce characters not present in “Infinity War,” and bring an epic series to a fitting and satisfying conclusion. By any objective measure, it does so.
It shows us a team ripped apart by the loss of their friends, and desperately searching, first for a solution to “the snap,” then for a way to move forward with their lives. It gives us engaging storylines for Ant-Man and Hawkeye, who play pivotal roles in the story. And if I told you that “Endgame” would contain time travel, a heist storyline, and a third-act set piece unlike any other put to the big screen, I would be understating it.
In fact, the sheer number of awe-inducing moments in this film separates it from even many of its peers in the MCU. The repeated, raucous cheers from the capacity crowd in my theater were just one proof. Also, of course, as with most MCU films, “Endgame” offers moments of genuine humor and profound emotion, consistently in a way faithful to the film’s broader tone.
What also makes “Endgame” so compelling is not simply that it accomplishes so much, but that it does so without undermining the foundation built by the films that came before it. The simple way out for any director would be to just “undo” the events of “Infinity War,” but in doing so, either undermine the impact of that film, or possibly undo events central to the previous 21 movies. Thankfully, Anthony and Joe Russo avoid both mistakes, and take the creative approach to tackling the problem of time travel in just about as compelling a way as possible.
The true heart of this film, however, as with so many others in the MCU, is the performance of the Avengers. Tony is guilty over his failure to stop Thanos, and embittered by what he perceives as Captain America’s abandonment of the fight. Captain America is struggling not only with losing the love of his life, but now also most of his remaining friends. Black Widow doesn’t know how to cope with life other than to throw herself into protecting the world from future threats.
These are just some of the dynamics we are introduced to in the film’s opening minutes, and the pace only picks up from there. Ultimately, this is a film not just about massive battles between good and evil, about flashy tech and iron suits, it is a look into the human soul, the challenges we face, and what we are willing to do to overcome them. It holds up a mirror to us and asks us to be honest about whether we are trying to get there in our own strength, or whether we will reach out and take the helping hand a friend is offering. Finally, it challenges us to be the friend who is willing to extend that hand.
This film succeeds because it is faithful to complete the journeys we have taken with these characters, especially those we’ve been with the longest, as they ask and answer those questions for themselves. All in all, “Endgame,” like its predecessors in the MCU, is a moving film about friendship, sacrifice, and perseverance. In no uncertain terms, it is a breath-taking spectacle that is a true pleasure to watch.
It may be the final chapter of that good book you don’t want to put down, but as The Vision points out in an earlier film, a thing isn’t beautiful because it lasts. Something similar is at work here. The Avengers, as we have come to know them, may no longer be on mission together, but they will last forever on film, and that is indeed a beautiful thing.

"Nationalism Is Not Our Biggest Threat, Technocracy Is",thefederalist.com,James Poulos,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/nationalism-not-biggest-threat-technocracy/,"By James Poulos April 29, 2019
Is nationalism right for America? With President Trump, an avowed nationalist, leading the Republican Party, it’s not surprising that the best commentary on nationalism—and the sharpest debate—is now found on the political right.
For proof, one need only have sat in on the National Review Institute’s recent Ideas Summit, where the grand debate saw Rich Lowry, National Review’s editor-in-chief, take the side of nationalism against Jonah Goldberg, the founder of National Review Online.
But why is nationalism such a hot topic today at all? While the president’s rhetoric is influential, and the ferment on the right has an attentive audience, something much more substantial accounts for the rise in nationalist sentiment at home and abroad.
Americans must realize that the solution to the puzzle is hiding in plain sight. Nationalism is back as a burning issue not because of modern demagoguery or ancient hatreds but because of the triumph of digital technology over everyday life. Dehumanization Versus Self-Rule
In the United States and around the world, the digital age is forcing a new choice between two types of governance—one nationalist, the other imperial. While both carry risks, only one is compatible with constitutional government and the central claims of the Declaration of Independence.
Americans shouldn’t fear that digital life is going to bring back the inhuman old days of twentieth-century-style nationalist extremism. The proper thing to fear is a dehumanizing new form of digital despotism.
The preeminent threat to American life is not the resurgence of the beasts within us, but the mastery of the bots above us. This is why the right’s new nationalists should command our attention.
The debate on the right frames the issue in exactly the right way. One side asserts that nationalism contains the paramount threat of the new age. These critics warn that all will be lost if we fail to head off a primitive backlash against the globalizing forces accelerated by the technocratic elite. They fear the beast within.
The other side warns that the West’s globalist technocrats have embraced a new imperial vision, one that promises uniform unfreedom on all, their worship of “diversity” notwithstanding. Their plan is increasingly out in the open.
In “The Big Nine,” New York University professor Amy Webb argues that artificial intelligence must be put not under American control but under that of a new international organization—a global diversity and inclusion agency. Otherwise, she warns, our robots will have white privilege—or even become white supremacists. Is Society the Problem Or Are Individuals?
So long as we learn to code our machines with the right secular religion, our imperialists believe, their robotic creations can and should order our lives better than we humans can order them ourselves. This is why today’s nationalists rightly conclude the bots above us, not the beasts within, are the proper object of our political fear.
This is an exercise of sound political judgment, not of dogma. As former national security advisor Michael Anton explained in a recent Princeton University address, in the totalitarian age, nationalism did pose a preeminent threat to America and the West. Only a globalized military and diplomatic response could destroy the threat and rebuild a legitimate order. But now, the order has mutated, and the context around it has changed. Nationalism our only political defense against the new imperialism.
Anton is hardly alone. The philosopher Yoram Hazony is now famous for persuasively advancing a similar argument. National Review’s Michael Brendan Dougherty, reviewing Goldberg’s latest book, stated the matter this way: “I’m less worried about foaming tribalists drunk on natural passion than I am of a generation of grass-eating males, who mute the natural passions and ambitions through drugs, pornography, and the flickering of the backlit screens. And so, in the immediate future, I don’t fear a return to the natural, I fear our continued flight from it.”
These insights arise from encounters with the reality of the digital age that established anti-nationalists strain to avoid. But their pedigree weaves back through philosophers from Montesquieu and Niccolo Machiavelli all the way to Aristotle. Intentionally or not, elites today who fear nationalism are working toward a much more alarming and damaging post-nationalist world of unfreedom and uniformity. Barreling Toward the Abolition of Man
With today’s progressives rushing to establish an automated imperium programmed with woke consciousness, the greatest peril today is not man’s barbaric inhumanity to man, which has always been with us, but a fresh horror without parallel: what Francis Fukuyama called “our posthuman future,” and C.S. Lewis called the “abolition of man.”
This is the new kind of evil empire Americans must stop today. To do so, we must travel down a path being cleared for now by President Trump, whose election forced our first big encounter with how dramatically digital life has disenchanted the one-world dream and made the “unthinkable” real. Trump’s administration will occupy only a handful of years, but his influence on the choice we must make might set us on a course of centuries.
Such a path delinks American finance, economics, and law from would-be automated imperialism. Trump’s skepticism of Silicon Valley, and his sense that government of the people and by the people must govern artificial intelligence, are essential instincts for securing the blessings of liberty and promoting the general welfare in a digital age.
Americanists should take heart in recalling how hard it is to force people to believe in obsolete dreams. But without clear and concerted action, that is precisely what the teched-up utopians will do.
Nationalism is back for one reason: awful as it is when men become as beasts, the more terrible threat of the new digital age is that the West’s progressive technocrats and woke seminarians will make us the slaves of their bots.

"No, It’s Not Bigoted For Lawmakers To Ban Child Drag Queens",thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/no-not-bigoted-lawmakers-ban-child-drag-queens/,"By Chad Felix Greene April 29, 2019
Child exploitation should not be controversial, yet to the modern LGBT left it seems to be a subjective matter depending on what political or social narrative they want to pursue. Child drag queens appear to be a growing trend after the success of Desmond Napoles, who has been in the public eye since he was nine years old.
While many oppose the idea of minors performing drag at all, it shouldn’t be considered a “conservative” position to oppose them performing drag in adult bars. Drag is inherently sexual in nature. The origin and purpose of drag is to indulge adult humor through exaggerated female impersonation.
Some celebrate drag queens, and rightly so. They provide a unique sense of humor that is often playful, sassy, and so bluntly honest as to be enjoyable to many. But we should all agree it just isn’t for kids. It’s Not Just Dress-Up, It’s Also Sexual Dancing
LGBT advocates of child drag performers insist it’s just children playing dress-up, as the mother of a nine-year-old performer stated recently: “Jacob is just a guy who likes to dress up and dance and feel pretty… it’s kind of like Halloween every time he has the opportunity to do it.”
It can certainly be argued there is a fine line between a boy dressing-up to “feel pretty” and that same boy dressing in a way that mimics a highly sexualized adult entertainment style. Pretending that there is no distinction is simply avoiding the truth of what is actually being done, even if everyone involved has innocent intentions.
I have no doubt the adults encouraging these kids are doing so out of a sense of openness and a kind nature. I equally do not believe the vast majority of adults cheering inside a bar as the child performs have any malicious motivations. But the sexualized nature cannot be ignored.
Recently, the LGBT site Pink News published a fairly startling headline: “ Republican lawmakers want to make child drag shows illegal .” Strangely, this is portrayed as an act of anti-LGBT puritanism by ignorant and malicious Republicans. The article states, “Republican lawmakers in Ohio have filed a bill that would clamp down on drag performances by minors as ‘child exploitation.’”
The writer validates his suspicions by noting House Bill 180, “Prohibit performance in which child simulates sexual activity ,” is co-sponsored by other Republicans with a history of anti-LGBT positions. The specific bill language the writer and LGBT advocates oppose states an illegal performance would include one “that suggests a minor is participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality and that, taken as a whole by the average person applying contemporary community standards, appeals to prurient interest.”
Jacob’s mother insists she does not allow her son to dance to songs with sexual lyrics and that she attends and monitors his performances. But the photo included in the article portrays the boy dressed in clearly provocative clothing and dancing in a way that should raise an eyebrow for any reasonable person. Kids Can Be Exploited With Their Clothes On
Being far too literal, the writer argues the child was not specifically engaging in “sexual activity, masturbation or bestiality.” Shockingly, the mayor of Lancaster, Ohio stated in response to the concerns about the performance he had seen online that the boy “was fully clothed and was not touched by anyone in the audience.”
It should be clear to anyone objectively viewing this that the standard of concern should not be ruling out actual sexual activity or adults touching the child during the performance. The article quotes LGBT+ campaigner Kristen Angelo saying, “There is nothing wrong with what Jacob is doing. Nothing sexual, nothing inappropriate.”
The story first gained local attention when a video of a performance of the boy in a gay bar was shared on Facebook: “The story was then picked up by various religious and conservative websites. Critics of a video shared online objected to the boy’s costume, which included a leotard and wig, dance moves characterized as sexual in nature, and that the boy can be seen accepting money from bar patrons during the performance.”
Defending her choice to allow her son to perform in gay bars, Jacob’s mother said, “Where else is there right now for children who identify as being in the LGBT community to explore that interest? There’s not.” Young musicians often perform in bars at the same time of night, she said: “The difference is a lack of wig and heels.”
But that is the point here. Nine-year-old musicians are not performing to drunken audiences in adults-only bars. The difference is far more than just a “wig and heels.” LGBT Contingent Appears to See No Problem
City police found no violations of state law or city ordinances, and the mayor stated, “The owners and managers of JD Hendersons [bar in question] did not approve of or condone this activity. Upon learning of this performance, the owners quickly condemned the show and banned this troupe of performers from returning to the establishment.”
He continued, “There have been serious threats of violence resulting from this post. Let us hope and pray that no harm comes to person or property as a result of it.” Jacob’s mother claimed to have received death threats and visits from local child protective services.
In a positive direction, State Sen. Teresa Fedor (D.-Toledo), who supports the proposed bill, said of the issue, “When we’re trying to prevent human trafficking from happening, especially the commercial, sexual exploitation of children, I don’t see how this is not very closely related to that issue — that concept of a rape culture where we’re normalizing this type of activity.”
Fedor is correct. A drag performance involves the entertainer typically lip-syncing to a song, dancing as provocatively as possible, and accepting “tips” from the audience during the performance. Many incorporate adult humor into their acts, which audiences loudly celebrate. It is intended to be adult entertainment. Create Kid Spaces Instead of Exposing Adult Behavior
Jacob’s mother is correct in one area of this discussion, and that is young boys interested in dressing up, dancing, and singing to their favorite female performers and entertaining an audience should have a safe and child-friendly environment to do so. There is no reason LGBT leaders cannot launch a child-friendly performance space to perform in front of other children, parents, and local supporters without incorporating the adult aspects of drag culture. There is no justifiable reason for a nine-year-old to dance on stage in front of drunk adults, accepting money, and being encouraged to mimic adult entertainers. There is no reason LGBT leaders cannot launch a child-friendly performance space.
The core of the issue is that anyone who views this from the outside clearly sees the problem. We do not see innocent dress-up dance parties, as portrayed by LGBT media. We see dark rooms, a stage surrounded by adult men, and a young boy dressed as a miniature adult woman parading around as the men toss money on stage. The only way LGBT activists can respond is to dismiss the concerns altogether or misrepresent what we can clearly see happening.
The exploitation of the child is in the environment and the portrayal. Adults who do prey on children have easy access to these venues, and normalizing this behavior allows young boys with less protective parents to be highly vulnerable. The very nature of the LGBT argument is to suggest the child should be able to freely indulge his or her gender expression and sexuality regardless of what other adults think is best for their safety.
LGBT advocacy does not benefit from stubbornly pretending there is nothing of concern with this activity. LGBT leadership has an opportunity to step up and advocate creative and free gender expression by providing a safe and transparent space for it to occur. While we can disagree on the appropriateness of parents allowing young boys to cross-dress in this fashion, we should all agree it should not be happening at night in a gay bar.
The sponsors of this bill recognize, as state Rep. Tim Schaffer (R-Lancaster) stated perfectly , “Given our heightened focus on human trafficking and the role money plays in trafficking children, I knew I had to take action to make sure this activity does not occur again. We can do better to protect innocent children and we must do better.”
I agree with him and it’s not the sole view of bigots or religious extremists. The average person would easily be able to distinguish why this is such an important and distressing concern. Unfortunately, LGBT activism, as it stands right now, refuses to do so. Chad Felix Greene is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Authorities To Arrest Father If He Refers To Trans Child As Her Real Sex,thefederalist.com,Jeremiah Keenan,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/authorities-arrest-canadian-father-refers-trans-child-real-sex/,"April 29, 2019 By Jeremiah Keenan
Last Wednesday, The Federalist reported that the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, declared a father guilty of family violence for his polite refusal to refer to his daughter as a boy in private, and his repeated choice to affirm in media interviews that she is a girl.
At about the same time that story was published, the Supreme Court issued an additional, more heavy-handed “protection order” from the same ruling. The three-page document declares that the father, Clark*, will henceforth be subject to arrest, immediately and “without warrant” if any police officer has “reasonable” grounds to believe that he has in any way referred to his daughter as a girl in public or in private.
The new order further stipulated not only that Clark must not discuss his daughter’s sex or gender identity in public, but also that he cannot share court documents describing his own gag order. On the one hand, this demand may seem ironic, since it covers a publicly available court ruling. On the other hand, the injunction is so broad that it naturally includes the very document upon which it is written and that document –with its threats of immediate arrest without warrant–has not, as of yet, been made available on the court’s website.
As previously reported , the BC Supreme Court ordered in February that 14-year-old Maxine* receive testosterone injections without parental consent. Accordingly, Maxine began regular injections at the BC Children’s Hospital over the last two months.
Her father, Clark, strongly objects to this treatment and immediately sought to reverse the decision in the BC Court of Appeal. “[These injections] will completely disrupt her puberty,” he lamented to The Federalist several weeks ago . “Her bones will stop growing, her brain will stop developing… and she’s not gonna be a boy. She won’t even have the bone-strength left to be a girl anymore.”
Hoping to raise awareness, Clark answered multiple requests for interviews in which he shared his opinion that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones were not right for his daughter. Like an increasing number of parents these days, Clark argued that his child had been misled and brainwashed by online activists and school administrators, who began to treat Maxine as a transgender boy at school, without informing her parents, when she was only 12 years old.
While Clark sought (and received) anonymity in these previous interviews in order to protect his daughter’s identity, the court appears to have been deeply disturbed by the negative publicity and politically incorrect commentary surrounding its decisions. In a ruling last week , Justice Francesca Marzari convicted Clark of “family violence” for his “public denial of [Maxine’s] gender identity.”
At the same time, Marzari also issued an order expunging from the court record the names of two doctors who had been actively involved in pushing a gender transition for Maxine. One of these doctors, Dr. Wallace Wong, has recently come under fire for potentially diagnosing as much as 20 percent of the children in his local orphanage system with some form of gender dysphoria.
While Marzari presented this tamping down of information as a matter of strict necessity, some argue that the BC Supreme Court is showing a lack of concern for freedom of speech and the open court principle. Kari Simpson, the president of Canadian pro-family organization Culture Guard, complained that the “BC Court has become a Star Chamber,” using raw power to rewrite reality.
“This is extreme and dangerous,” she said, arguing that the court was forcing Clark to embrace a “delusion” about his daughter’s gender and her “abuse” at the hands of doctors, or else be arrested.
Clark’s appeal of the court’s original ruling regarding testosterone injections into his daughter is set to be heard on May 14.

Libertarians Party For Hate Speech In New York City,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/libertarians-party-for-hate-speech-in-new-york-city/,"April 29, 2019 By David Marcus
Last Thursday night down on Bleeker Street in Manhattan, the libertarian entertainment company We The Internet gathered to throw a bash celebrating its latest mini-documentary, and the launch of its “The Funny Thing About Hate Speech” tour. The 15-minute film, “5 Reasons We Need Hate Speech,” is a full-throated defense of free speech that is well-produced, very clever, and often quite funny. Both the documentary and the party were hosted by Lou Perez, We The Internet’s jocular impresario whose straightforward and aw shucks style cuts straight to the heart of the matter.
The party in a downtown club space was fun and festive, a gathering of free thinkers and iconoclasts. Reason magazine’s Nick Gillespie was there (yes, he wore a leather jacket), and former American Civil Liberties Union head Nadine Strossen and author Zachary Wood joined Perez for a panel discussion. Among the questioners from the audience was journalist Jesse Singal, who appears in the film.
The documentary is now airing on YouTube and is linked below. The reasons it discusses for why we need hate speech, or more specifically need to not ban hate speech, are not particularly new. They focus mostly on how such bans not only make hate speech stronger, but that defining hate speech always winds up as a slippery slope that captures at its bottom a much wider range of speech than was ever intended.
What makes the film special, and is true of much of We The Internet’s work, is how difficult it is to pin down politically. Indeed one of the central focuses is European and to a lesser extent American efforts to criminalize or ban criticism of Israel.
In one of the film’s more humorous moments, Perez is on his way to interview a pro-Palestinian group at Fordham University that had been denied the right to organize. Before he arrives, he receives an email from them, explaining that in light of his previous controversial work, they were declining the interview. The irony was amazing. Those demanding free speech were declining this opportunity to engage in free speech.
While We The Internet is not conservative, and Perez insists the group attacks all sides, in this case the libertarian value of free speech overlaps considerably with conservative attitudes on the issue. So, while conservatives can’t exactly claim We The Internet as their own, the troupe often, as in this film, presents conservative ideas in a fun, fresh, and funny way. In a media landscape so hegemonically controlled by leftist voices, this is a very welcome thing.
Conservatives have long sought to parry the power of progressive media with original content of their own, but have most usually failed at it. We The Internet provides a road map for doing better. A lot of it has to do with a refusal to come off as angry or mean-spirited. Their productions are warm, calm, reasonable, and produce an affability that conservatives sometimes struggle with.
Although best known for their well-produced libertarian sketch comedy, of late We The Internet has been delving into more straightforward documentary work. This has included an interview series with Dr. Deborah Soh on the science of the sexes as well as discussions with thinkers like Coleman Hughes on race. This is a welcome and praiseworthy expansion of their mission, and it’s producing some really excellent content.
“5 Reasons Why We Need Hate Speech” is well worth the 15 minutes it takes to watch. It can be especially valuable for young people who are navigating a new set of speech codes and a society less friendly to free speech than even 10 or 20 years ago.
One hopes that We The Internet can keep up the good work, promoting a free and honest exchange of ideas. Operating outside the maelstrom of partisan politics, they create wonderful resources for understanding the deep cultural debates in society. Today such efforts, especially successful ones, are few and far between, but We The Internet seems to have it figured out.

Don't Bail Colleges Out Of The Student Loan Mess They've Made,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/dont-bail-colleges-student-loan-mess-theyve-made/,"By Nathanael Blake April 29, 2019
The political left owns higher education, and has broken it. With rare exception, colleges and universities are dominated by leftists, who should be held accountable for the mess they have made. But if we hope to reform higher education, we need to understand the dynamics at play. In particular, we must realize how administrators have used social justice activism to seize power and to cover for their economic injustices.
It is true that the tuition is too damn high . Working one’s way through college has become difficult or even impossible at many schools, including many of the most prestigious universities. With tuition and expenses in excess of $50,000 a year at elite schools, graduates often graduate with the equivalent of a mortgage. Yet even as tuition costs have shot up, classes are increasingly taught by underpaid adjunct faculty and graduate assistants. Students are paying more to learn from instructors who are paid less, so where does the money go?
Some goes to building projects and campus amenities that cater to well-to-do students who want and can afford a cushy life on campus. Much of it goes to pay for administrative bloat , as exemplified by the University of Michigan and its horde of nearly 100 diversity administrators. It has become normal for a university to have more administrators than full-time faculty. Many of these administrators draw fat salaries and build bureaucratic empires on the backs of instructors who are paid almost nothing for doing the actual work of the university, and students who have taken out exorbitant loans.
Borrowing for education is borrowing for life, as the student loans that fund this exploitation cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. As Michael Brendan Dougherty put it , the government has “made this debt more sacred than marriage”: student loan debt really is “until death.” The schools pocket the money upfront while the feds, who run student loans these days, have ways of getting their money back that even credit card companies lack.
This exploitative system should not be bailed out by boondoggles such as Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren’s plans for free college and student loan bailouts. Her proposal is a naked effort to revive her failing presidential campaign by buying off middle-class voters with subsidies. It is a policy rife with moral hazard that rewards irresponsible lending and borrowing, and will further inflate tuition. It is regressive insofar as it will be deficit-funded—and it will be. The notion that it will be funded by a tax on the very rich is laughable.
Ostensibly, federal student loans enable access to higher education. Practically, they inflate tuition , add burdensome regulations (federal cash comes with federal strings attached), and make higher education into a grift. As Kevin Williamson of National Review put it : “If you make a few gazillion dollars available to finance tuition payments with underwriting standards a little bit lower than those of the average pawn shop, you create a lot of potential tuition inflation…if Uncle Stupid puts a trillion bucks on the table, there are enough smart people at Harvard to figure out a way to pick it up.”
The problem is not that there isn’t enough government money going to higher education; the problem is that there is too much. Warren’s plan of debt forgiveness and free college would only expand the trough of federal cash at which higher education is gorging. Therefore Williamson suggests that we shut off the supply. Without a guaranteed pile of federal money available for every student, colleges and universities would be pressured to cut costs and reduce tuition.
Hopefully the administrative deadwood will bear the brunt of the axe. Those on the right tend to focus their ire on especially egregious cases of professorial insanity or particularly stupid student activists, but these are not the real rot in higher education. Today’s problems are less about radical professors and idiot students than administrative careerists who have given colleges and universities a new spiritual mission in the form of social justice activism.
This reorientation provides administrators a justification for their expanding power, prestige, and privilege. They are no longer the bookkeepers assisting the educational and research missions of higher education. Rather, they are the (well-paid) chaplains of the imperative of social justice and inclusion, now as important to the campus as anything professors do. Mainstream university administrators speak of social justice, diversity, and inclusion in ways that resemble the language conservative Christian colleges use to describe their spiritual purpose.
Positioning social justice concerns at the center of higher education’s mission gives power to the administrators who instigate and evaluate such efforts. Forcing the likes of engineering professors to define and defend their teaching and research in terms of diversity and inclusion is a way to control them. This is why proposals such as abolishing tenure will not fix the problems of campus radicalism. Indeed, administrators would love to be able to more easily fire professors who don’t toe the social justice line. But good luck firing the bias response team.
Of course, many campus administrators do not really believe the social justice creed, but their careers depend on acting like they do. The social justice poses of campus administrators also provide cover for economic injustice, as the true believers excuse careerists for economic injustice in exchange for an alliance on issues of race, gender, and sexuality.
No one wants to be accused of being insensitive to social justice, or insufficiently committed to diversity and inclusion. It would be a career killer. This intimidation ensures that people go along with the campus witch-hunts and inquisitions, and tolerate an expanding apparatus of enforcement, lest they become the next target. The academic cathedrals of the social justice left are full of silent heretics and doubting inquisitors, too afraid to oppose the insanity.
Those who control higher education have built a system of fearful, enforced orthodoxy on top of economic injustice. This provides conservatives an opportunity to offer solutions that reform, rather that propping up, the current failed system. Conservatives can be the champions of economically exploited students and adjunct professors, and of free thought and speech. But we must first understand how social justice activism has become the new religion on campus, and how bloated campus bureaucracy uses it to distract from their parasitism.

Watch Ben Rhodes Squirm When Asked If Obama’s WH Was Involved In FBI Investigation Of Trump,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/watch-ben-rhodes-squirm-when-asked-if-obamas-wh-was-involved-in-fbi-investigation-of-trump/,"April 29, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
Ben Rhodes, former deputy of national security for President Obama, told journalist Nicholas Ballasy that the Obama administration was unaware and uninvolved in the FBI’s investigation into then-candidate Donald Trump.
“Literally, I learned about the investigation into Trump as a private citizen in the freaking Washington Post,” Rhodes said.
When asked about the dossier, Rhodes insisted he had nothing to do with.
“I saw it—I heard about it at the very end in 2017. We weren’t, like, involved in commissioning the dossier. We learned about it when it was in the report that was appended to the report that went to Congress at the end of the administration,” he said.
Watch the full interview here.
While Rhodes maintains the Obama administration’s innocence, unredacted copies of text messages suggest otherwise. Former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page served on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation when their anti-Trump text messages were leaked. “The White House is running this,” one text read.
Between 2016 and 2017, Obama For America (OFA), Obama’s official campaign organization, paid nearly a million dollars to the same law firm that funneled money to Fusion GPS , the firm behind the Steele dossier.
OFA, which managed Obama’s successful re-election campaign in 2012, retooled after that campaign to focus on enacting the president’s agenda during his final term in office. The group reorganized again after the 2016 election and planned to use its staff and resources to oppose President Donald Trump. During the entire 2016 campaign cycle, the group spent only $4.5 million, according to FEC records.
Of course, this is not the first time Rhodes has been caught in a lie. Rhodes’ track record for fiction includes the Benghazi talking points characterizing the 9/11 terror attack as a response to a YouTube clip , lying about the U.S. vetting process of Syrian refugees , and the “echo chamber” he created to sell Obama’s failed Iran deal.

A Hatred Of Israel Is The One Thing All Anti-Semites Have In Common,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/its-a-hatred-of-israel-that-unites-all-anti-semites/,"By David Harsanyi April 29, 2019
“The past few days provide a useful case study,” The New York Times’ Bari Weiss wrote this weekend . “Thursday: an anti-Zionist cartoon is published in the Times. Saturday: a white nationalist guns down Jews in synagogue. Sunday: Javad Zarif appears on Fox. The three strands of modern anti-Semitism: far-left, far-right and Islamist.”
Although Weiss correctly identifies the three strands of contemporary Jew-hatred, none of them are truly modern. To various degrees, Islamic anti-Semitism has been prevalent for a long time . Left-wing anti-Semitism is old as Marx (and, really, even older .) And right-wing nationalist anti-Semitism has been with us since the concept was birthed in Europe.
The only truly modern component found in all three strands is Israel. Anti-Israel sentiment is already the predominant justification for violence, murder, and hatred against Jews in the Middle East and Europe. Now it’s coming here. Sometimes it’s merely a transparent excuse for animosity, other times it’s the spark for that hatred. But almost always a part of it.
The Passover shooting at the Poway Chabad synagogue in suburban San Diego was perpetrated by a 19-year-old gunman who seems to have acted alone. The man hadn’t cooked up his ugly ideas reading “Mein Kampf” in a cabin in the deep wilderness of Red America, but in a comfortable home in Southern California using the internet. The shooter wasn’t raised under the shadow of a Robert E. Lee statue or a Confederate flag, but in a substantially diverse area in a deeply liberal state.
As far as we know, he didn’t grow up in poverty, nor had any Jewish person done anything to personally undermine him. In fact, the shooter almost surely interacted with all types of races, ethnicities, and faiths on a daily basis. If reports are correct , the murderer of Lori Gilbert Kaye was from a churchgoing family and good student at Cal State University San Marcos, a university that earns an “A” in diversity.
The shooter’s manifesto makes clear that he didn’t kill because of Donald Trump or some alleged dog whistle or a New York Times cartoon or any concerted ideological cause other than hatred. Although we shouldn’t put too much thought into his vile rantings, the man was clearly a racist who detested Jews and “Zionists” because he saw them as the enemies of white people.
Now, we can “confront” these xenophobic murderers all day long, but they don’t really care about your emotional condemnations or your rallies or your PSAs. It’s unlikely that we can shame them. The shooter’s rhetoric, thankfully, is already unacceptable in mainstream American discourse.
The only anti-Semitism still widely used in public discourse is the kind masquerading as “anti-Zionism.” That is why there was warranted outrage when The New York Times’s international edition publishes a Der Sturmer-style cartoon and when members of Congress protect a woman who has persistently smeared Americans Jews as money-grubbing interlopers and when progressive activists march behind those who embrace the most noxious anti-Semitic notions imaginable.
Now, a Jew-baiting cartoon or an ugly tweet isn’t going to shoot you. But anti-Israel rhetoric doesn’t just hurt feelings, it leads to policy that puts people in danger. It is why, whatever the intentions were behind the Iran deal, many Jews were rightly disturbed when the antagonist Obama administration made a sweetheart agreement and sent pallets of cash to a Holocaust-denying terror state that openly threatens to throw six million Jews into an “inferno.” It’s a bit on-the-nose.
Since Israel is increasingly detested by the American left—often for the very same reasons the United States is detested—progressives have also been increasingly comfortable attacking Jews or defending those who do. And no, these people aren’t merely being “critical of Israel.” The New York Times cartoon depicting Trump as a blind man being led by the Star of David-bedecked Benjamin Netanyahu was a pictorial interpretation of a paranoid grievance that many anti-Israel progressives and paleocons have been peddling for years: that Jews control the U.S. government.
Claiming that Americans are dying to protect Jewish interests isn’t only a lie, it’s a fresh iteration of an old slur. Whereas once there were “bankers” and “money lenders,” today there are “Zionists.” I see this smear every day, and not merely from randos on Twitter.
Some progressives, in fact, argue that the concept of “Zionism” is itself a form of white supremacy . Liberal editors of major publications now contend that the democratically elected prime minister of this Jewish state is one of “global anti-semitism’s greatest allies.” Writers for major magazines breezily blame Jews who support Israel for their own massacres. Among them are a small number of progressives , who defraud the public by falsely using their abandoned Jewish heritage to promote their leftist ideology.
Like many left-wing publications, the Times has obsessively depicted the Jewish state—a nation that is not only the most liberal in the Middle East but perhaps the most liberal nation in all of Asia—as a national manifestation of bigotry. Not Hamas. Not the PLO. Not Iran. Not Qatar. Until recently, not even Saudi Arabia.
When outlets like The New York Times spend decades normalizing the idea that Zionism is tantamount to fascism and apartheid, it is just a matter of time before some hapless editor at the newspaper—if that’s really what happened—has trouble differentiating between the supposedly “anti-Israel” cartoon and demonstrably anti-Jewish one.
This position has driven them not only to embrace a decades-long bias but has opened them up to publishing all strands of ugly propaganda. Just one week before running the cartoon, the Times ran an Easter op-ed identifying Jesus as being “most likely a Palestinian man with dark skin.” Trying to strip a couple thousand years of Jewish (and Christian) history to promote a comforting fantasy for progressives is arguably more anti-Semitic than any dumb cartoon. “Palestine,” of course, was a name given to the land by Romans, who exiled most of the Jews from their homeland more than 600 years before the Arabs showed up.
The frustrating and tragic truth about this weekend’s shooting spree on Passover—a holiday that celebrates the miraculous escape from Egyptian slavery to freedom in Israel—is that there’s little we Jews can do about the presence of random far-right murderers other than continue to marginalize their ideas and defend ourselves. And nothing seems to aggravate all three varieties of anti-Semites more than the idea of Jews protecting themselves after 1,800 years of being at their mercy. The collective anger over Israel is proof. "
Protest Erupts Outside New York Times Offices Over Anti-Semitic Cartoon,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/protest-erupts-outside-the-new-york-times-offices-over-anti-semitic-cartoon/,"April 29, 2019 By David Marcus
Last week, in its international edition, The New York Times ran a blatantly anti-Semitic political cartoon that depicted a blind President Trump being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was depicted as a dog wearing a collar with a star of David. This was not trading in tropes. This was old-school, nauseating bigotry that would not be out of place on neo-Nazi websites or the deepest, darkest corners of Reddit.
The Times has apologized (disclosure, I have written for the Times) but for many New Yorkers that just wasn’t good enough. Monday evening, they staged a protest outside the lavish offices of the Gray Lady and demanded the firing of those involved with publishing the offensive cartoon.
At a time when anti-Semitism is growing around the world, synagogues in the United States are the subject of terrorist shootings, and Jews in New York are being violently attacked at an alarming rate, the response from the Times to its outrageous decision to run the cartoon is underwhelming and unacceptable.
According to Hillary Barr, one of the organizers of the protest, who works with Mothers Against Terrorism, “whoever was involved with the decision to publish this cartoon must be fired immediately.” She went on to say that “if it were any other race or religion it would never have been published.”
Robert Rogoff, wearing Trump 2020 garb, went even further. He and his wife are planning to move this year to Israel, and for Rogoff, this cartoon was evidence that America is becoming increasingly hostile to Jews. Rogoff told me that “The Democratic Party makes us feel unwelcome as Jews.” He fears that if Trump loses the 2020 election, this situation will become even worse.
The first speaker, Jeffrey Weisenfeld, asked a fair question: “Would the New York Times run a caricature of any other race of people?” The answer is, almost certainly, no. So why did the paper feel comfortable portraying Jews as literal dogs? The speaker said this harkened back to the bigoted media representations of Jews in pre-Nazi Germany. He called for an independent investigation, arguing that the Times could not be trusted to police itself on this issue.
Former New York Assemblyman Dove Hikind rallied the crowd with the chant, “Shame on the New York Times.” He recalled the ways the paper denied the Holocaust as it was happening. He said that from 1939 to 1945, the Times ran 23,000 headlines. Of them, only 26 stories were about the Holocaust. This is not a fantastic record for a paper of record. Hikind said that he is a Democrat, but a very embarrassed one.
During Hikind’s remarks, the crowd began shouting, “Where is Schumer?” Well, the Senate minority leader, a Democrat from New York, wasn’t there today. What his reaction is to this controversy is not entirely clear. Schumer has had no press conference regarding the incident and might fairly be said to be hiding. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler also came under attack for his lack of outrage over the cartoon.
The next speaker was professor Alan Dershowitz, who described himself as a formerly strong supporter of The New York Times who does not understand how this could have happened: “The New York Times has been wrong so often when it comes to Israel and when it comes to the Jewish people.” He suggested that because The New York Times is owned by Jews, they bend over backwards to not be seen as pro-Jewish.
Dershowitz particularly called out the Times for editorializing in its reporting, calling their “news analysis” pieces little more than opinion posing as news. He’s absolutely right.
Ultimately, the biggest question is: How did open and offensive anti-Semitism become something that professional journalists are unable to recognize? Have Jews so completely become white people in the eyes of progressives that they may now be treated, like white people, as a problem in society that has to be fought? If so — and it increasingly seems to be so — can’t that be achieved without literally depicting Jews as dogs?
The New York Times has much to be ashamed about here, and their response has been extremely weak. The good news is that American Jews have taken notice and are prepared to respond.

How Electronic Health Records Became An Absolute Fiasco,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/electronic-health-records-became-absolute-fiasco/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 30, 2019
Recent surveys of doctors show a sharp rise in frustrated physicians. One study last year analyzed a nearly 10 percentage point increase in burnout from 2011 to 2014, and laid much of the blame for the increase on a single culprit: Electronic health records. Physicians now spend more time staring at computer screens than connecting with patients, and find the drudgery soul-crushing.
What prompted the rise in screen fatigue and physician burnout? Why, government, of course. A recent Fortune magazine expose , titled “Death by 1,000 Clicks,” analyzed the history behind federal involvement in electronic records. The article reveals how electronic health records not only have not met their promise, but have led to numerous unintended and harmful consequences for American’s physicians, and the whole health care market. Electronic Bridge to Nowhere
The Fortune story details all the ways health information technology doesn’t work: Error-prone and glitch-laden systems; Impromptu work-arounds created by individual physicians and hospitals make it tough to compare systems to each other; An inability for one hospital’s system to interact with another’s—let alone deliver data and records directly to patients; and A morass of information, presented in a non-user-friendly format, that users cannot easily access—potentially increasing errors.
The data behind the EHR debacle illustrate the problem vividly. Physicians spend nearly six hours per day on EHRs, compared to just over five hours of direct time with patients. A study concluding that emergency room physicians average 4,000 mouse clicks per shift, a number that virtually guarantees doctors will make data errors. Thousands of documented medication errors caused by EHRs, and at least one hundred deaths (likely more) from “alert fatigue” caused by electronic systems’ constant warnings.
Other anecdotes prove almost absurdly hysterical. The EHR that presents emergency room physicians 86 separate options to order Tylenol. The parody Twitter account that plays an EHR come to life: “I once saw a doctor make eye contact with a patient. This horror must stop.” The EHR system that warns physicians ordering painkillers for female patients about the dangers of prescribing ibuprofen to women while pregnant—even if the patient is 80 years old.
What caused all this chaos in the American health care market? One doctor explained his theory: “I have an iPhone and a computer and they work the way they’re supposed to work, and then we’re given these incredibly cumbersome and error-prone tools. This is something the government mandated ” (emphasis added). Therein lies the problem. Obama’s ‘Stimulus’ Spending Spree
In June 2011, when talking about infrastructure projects included in the 2009 “stimulus” legislation, President Obama famously admitted that “shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.” Electronic health records, another concept included in the “stimulus,” ran into a very similar problem. Farzad Mostashari, who worked on health IT for the Obama administration from 2009-11, admitted to Fortune that creating a useful national records system was “utterly infeasible to get to in a short time frame.”
At the time, however, the Obama administration billeted electronic health records as the “magic bullet” that would practically eliminate medical errors, while also reducing health costs. Every government agency had its own “wish list” of things to include in EHR systems. Mostashari admitted this dynamic led to the typical bureaucratic problem of trying to do too much, too fast: “We had all the right ideas that were discussed and hashed out by the committee, but they were all of the right ideas” (emphasis original).
Meanwhile, records vendors saw dollar signs, and leapt at the business opportunity. As Fortune notes, many systems weren’t ready for prime time, but vendors didn’t focus on solving those types of inconsequential details:
[The] vendor community, then a scrappy $2 billion industry, griped at the litany of requirements but stood to gain so much from the government’s $36 billion injection that it jumped in line. As Rusty Frantz, CEO of EHR vendor NextGen Healthcare, put it: ‘The industry was like, ‘I’ve got this check dangling in front of me, and I have to check these boxes to get there, and so I’m going to do that.’’
The end result: Hospitals and doctors spent billions of dollars—because the government paid them to do so, and threatened to reduce their Medicare and Medicaid payments if they didn’t—to buy records systems that didn’t work well. These providers then became stuck with the systems once they purchased them, because of the systems’ cost, and because providers could not easily switch from one system to another.
David Blumenthal, who served as national coordinator for health IT under Obama, summed up the debacle accurately when he admitted that electronic health records “have not fulfilled their potential. I think few would argue they have.”
Electronic health records therefore provide an illustrative cautionary tale in which a government-imposed scheme spends billions of dollars but fails to live up to its hype, and alienates physicians and providers in the process. When the same thing happens under Democrats’ next proposed big-government health scheme—whether single payer, or some “moderate compromise” that only takes away half of Americans’ existing health coverage—don’t say you weren’t warned.

"In Michigan, Obergefell's Next Domino Hits Christian Adoption Agencies",thefederalist.com,Auguste Meyrat,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/michigan-obergefells-next-domino-hits-christian-adoption-agencies/,"By Auguste Meyrat April 30, 2019
Sued by the American Civil Liberties Union and two homosexual couples for deciding not to place orphans with same-sex couples, Bethany Christian Services was forced to change its policy in a settlement . No longer will they refer these couples to other non-religious organizations, but they must comply with the state’s rules since they are under contract.
Like Michigan’s attorney general, a lesbian and former gay issues activist , most people will celebrate this as real progress. In their mind, Christian charities are only using their religion as a cover for bigotry . If they can compel these organizations to eliminate this supposed hate and continue offering social work, it’s a win-win: LGBT people and the state government are vindicated, and the charity will continue serving children instead of shutting down, as they did in Philadelphia when the city banned Catholic adoption agencies for declining to place children with gay and unmarried couples.
Those who see matters from the Christian perspective will rightly lament this development. Not only does it mark a major setback for religious freedom, but it further enables anti-Christian groups to go after other Christian charities.
Following the logic of the Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges , they can claim that Christian sexual morality discriminates against LGBT couples, and any person, organization, or business who abides by this morality is violating the law of the land. If religious freedom exemptions exist, the government can still cancel their contracts and virtually ban Christian charities from working in local communities. A Sorry Loss of Assistance for the Most Vulnerable
Facing this hostility and loss of freedom, many Christian charities will stop providing services, leaving many people without assistance and reinforcing an American legal system that makes abortion far easier and cheaper than adoption . LGBT activists evidently see themselves as the real victims in this case, not the abused and neglected children in need of a home.
By forcing all charities to conform to their values, they bring about more harm than reform. One can only wonder how much more good could be done if these groups devoted their time, energy, and resources to offering services to those in need instead of trying to destroy religious organizations in court.
Those who don’t understand Christianity—which includes far too many on the left—like to maintain that Christians can just change their stance on sexuality without any problems. They think it’s only a matter of eliminating an irrational prejudice against a certain group of people. If Christianity is all about love, and gay people love one another, can Christians really argue against gay couples adopting children? Times have changed, and so should morality. This seems like an easy enough change to make.
Except that it isn’t. Christ makes it crystal clear that marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman , not a term for people who really love each other and seek legal recognition. Furthermore, God the Father makes it crystal clear that homosexual activity is a sin . What is also crystal clear is that God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—commands people to love sinners and those in need (in other words, everyone) and not to foster any kind of hate. Hence the preponderance of Christians in charitable projects. Which Teachings of Christ Can We Ignore? None of Them
When anyone asks Christians to tweak their theology to be more inclusive and ignore certain teachings, they are really asking them to change their whole faith. If God the Father or God the Son were wrong about marriage or homosexuality, what else are they wrong about?
If charity only means “being inclusive” instead of seeking the good of others, then maybe doing nothing and posting rainbow flags on social media is the most charitable thing a person can do. And if seeking the good is still important, is it really that good to give a child to a couple potentially unfit for parenthood? If loving one’s neighbors equates to letting them do whatever they want and refusing to judge, why does the Bible include so many judgments and rules?
If gay couples are essentially the same as straight couples in their relationship and capacity to care for children, why does God, who created the universe, not allow people of the same sex to create children naturally? Finally, is it wise to encourage Christians to define themselves by their sexuality rather than their relationship with God?
With so many issues raised by defining love and marriage differently, any Christian organization that compromises on this question necessarily forfeits its Christian identity. Bethany Christian Services now serves Michigan; it does not serve Christ. It has transformed from a Christian charity into another social service subsidized by the state and a dwindling pool of private donors.
Over time, Bethany Christian Services will go the way of other charities subverted by government and progressive activists—it will lose support among actual Christians, become thoroughly secularized, and end up perpetuating the problems it was originally designed to combat. Saturated with secular values, it will promote the behaviors and attitudes that lead to unparented children and abusive adults and discourage the virtues that empower family life.
Since it already compromised itself once, it will continue to do so, favoring fundraising and a public image over actually helping victims. Meanwhile, it will become less effective and more corrupt. This is how so many Catholic charities today end up distributing contraceptives , facilitating abortions , lobbying for open borders , endorsing anti-Christian ideologies like socialism , laundering money , and of course, embezzling countless millions of dollars .
These charities, thankfully, represent a minority among the many good charities that hold fast to Christian doctrine, but they harm Catholic culture as a whole. While there are many priests (and bishops) ready to denounce intolerance, lacking compassion, stressing over orthodoxy, or being miserly and uncharitable, there are very few priests (and almost no bishops) willing to preach against abortion, divorce, addiction, or respecting the laws and customs of a country. In all too many cases, they are accomplices or enablers of these sins.
One might attribute these scandals to the Catholic Church’s large charitable reach. Being by far the largest charitable organization in the world for so many centuries, mixing with bad actors is unavoidable. Nevertheless, many of these problems stem directly from the church’s collaboration with the government. As soon as the government becomes a customer, it will always impose its values on the provider, no matter what rights the Constitution guarantees.
Occasionally, Catholic organizations will push back—again, imagine what the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Obama administration could have done with the millions wasted in litigation—but many of them swallow the poison pill of government funding and hope no one finds out. A Certain Fate from Compromise
The consequence of a Christian charity changing its policies to match government-endorsed anti-religious views is not the possible outcome of a slippery slope; the decline is certain. When an organization compromises its values, it initiates a vicious sequence: without clear values or principles, the purpose becomes confused; a confused purpose then puts into question the identity of the organization; without an identity, the organization’s mission becomes incoherent and often counterproductive; and when this happens, those people who benefited from the organization are either neglected or actively harmed. This has been the fate of all too many liberal Christian churches that have adopted modern values prioritizing “inclusivity” and permissiveness over discipline and sacrifice.
The only way to prevent this sequence is for government and individuals to respect people’s beliefs and values in the first place. If someone wants to spread his values—Christian or not—through charity, he should do so by competing, not compelling. If the LGBT community wants to help gay couples adopt, they can start their own adoption agencies. If militant atheists want to indoctrinate kids with secular humanist values and hire liberal activists for teachers, they can build their own schools. If technocratic plutocrats want to provide contraceptives and iPads instead of food and medicine to starving families in the third world, they can do so without taxpayer or church assistance.
If any of these groups discriminate against Christians because serving them conflicts with their values or mission, they should be free to do so. And they should count on Christians to respond with their own charitable activity, and a limited, tolerant government to do nothing except uphold the law.
Not only would this reflect true social justice for all parties involved, but it would also lead to a healthy renewal of philanthropy in society and direct people’s efforts towards helping people in need. Charity starts with values, and safeguarding those values is the only way to safeguard charity. Auguste Meyrat is an English teacher in the Dallas area.

Read Some Of Aaron Wolf's Best Writing In Honor Of His Life,thefederalist.com,Rebekah Curtis,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/in-memory-of-aaron-d-wolf-executive-editor-of-chronicles-magazine/,"By Rebekah Curtis April 30, 2019
If there’s anything you don’t expect to see in the subject line of an email on Easter Sunday, it’s RIP. But Easter is when unexpected things happen. On this holiest day of days in 2019, Aaron D. Wolf sang with his family in the morning and the choir invisible in the evening.
Aaron was the executive editor of Chronicles magazine, published by the Charlemagne Institute . He was a man of insight, wit, kindness, humility, and integrity. He was 45 years old. Seeing his name attached to an RIP feels like watching the dwarfs shoot down the horses .
If you’re not familiar with Aaron’s writing, good things are in store for you. He is difficult to excerpt. Aaron did not boink doctrinaire slogans together like pop beads, knocking out bargain souvenirs for the day’s crisis. He was a rhetorician, weaving knowledge into wisdom on a loom of virtue. His essays on a screen resemble Beef Bourguignon on a paper plate. Alas, here we are. If you don’t have time right now, do yourself the favor of saving these (and many others ) for a rainy day. ‘Farewell to Spare Oom’ (2006)

When the ‘neo-evangelical’ movement began in the middle of the 20th century, and evangelical Americans set out to distinguish themselves from fundamentalists, their chief goal was to ‘engage the culture.’ One way of doing this was to imitate popular entertainment, and this resulted in the creation of ‘contemporary Christian music’ and many embarrassing films.
Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ took this to a new level. Mel was cool and one of us—except for his staunch, almost fanatical Roman Catholicism, but this is about getting the Gospel out there, and we can overlook the nonbiblical portions of the script supplied by Anne Catherine Emmerich. (Some church groups at least wondered whether it was acceptable to eat popcorn while watching “Jesus” being crucified.) I remember the looks of shock I received when I suggested that a(nother) ‘Jesus movie’ will not save America, because film is a medium of entertainment, not particularly suitable for preaching the Gospel.
‘Nonsense!’ was the usual reply. ‘If just one person believes in Christ because of something he saw in this movie, it will be worth it!’ In that spirit, churches all over the country rented theaters, brought people by the busload, and produced mountains of Passion of the Christ promotional and study materials. And the product was deeply satisfying for the vast majority of those who purchased it: Of course, it was the most powerful movie ever made! Now I really know what Jesus did for me!
And what did this Technicolor Jesus do for you? For evangelicals, he provided all of us with an opportunity to ask him into our hearts. For Mel Gibson (according to the juxtapositions during the crucifixion scene), he provided the Mass. For Sean Hannity, he provided an example of what happens when you tell the truth to liberals. In short, this special-effects blood-and-gore pretend Jesus was whatever you wanted him to be. ‘Democracy and Infanticide’ (2019)

A base as massive as ours will always tend toward baseness—unless it has a profound religious sensibility to keep it in check. And Christianity, being the one true Faith, cannot be replaced by a mere civic religion, neopaganism, nationalism, racialism (white or nonwhite), or citizenism; God is not mocked. Yet Christianity does not know how to operate apart from those mediating institutions which it instinctively creates and inspires: The Church must create culture, for She seeks to cultivate saints.
Conversely, the death of America’s mediating institutions—of family, school, university, neighborhood, community, local government, arts and letters—is the direct result of the Church’s failure to uphold the natural order, to cultivate virtue, to create culture. Cultural Marxists cannot march through Christian institutions.
Today, ‘conservative’ Church leaders seek shelter under the wings of liberal democracy, repeating the bromides of the Enlightenment, touting abstract ‘religious freedom’ as if it were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone. Instead of saying ‘Thus saith the Lord,’ they apologize for the Church’s failure to defend human rights. They speak not as prophets but as Jacobins. ‘I Heart Big Brother’ (2015)

The real question—for the adulterers of Ashley Madison, and for the rest of us as well—is, would we make the same stupid choice again? Here’s the pitch: What if I could offer you the ability to shop right there at your desktop computer, your laptop, or phone? What if, instead of going to a library or purchasing a map at a gas station, you could simply look up information where you sit? What if you could turn in your homework with the touch of a button, instead of having to print it out or write on paper? Pay your bills! See pictures of old friends and even people you’ve never met! Vote! Play video games! Refill your meds! You’ll never have to get out of your chair again! The only thing you’ll have to give up is every shred of privacy, while rendering meaningless or at least superfluous most face-to-face interaction.
Today, our privacy is mostly an illusion. … If we’re honest, we’ll have to admit that we’re all one good hack away from devastating embarrassment in one form or another.
This online world we now cherish is based on the illusion of anonymity—just me and my computer in a darkened room, searching for images of that hot actress or discolored mole, for information on this fringe group or that taboo thought, posting our I.P.-address identifiable pseudonymous zingers in the comment section, blogging our hearts out, clicking on the latest rumor, thrill-seeking an instant and ephemeral opinion to skim and share. Those moments are gone, but their digital records are out there on hard drives mirrored and accessible via the World-Wide Web.

Link here .
‘Adopt a refugee,’ the church bulletin urges. This Protestant church is encouraging each of its members to donate money, clothing, and personal items to the ethnic Albanian of his choice. On a marquee in front of an ornate Catholic church outside O’Hare Airport are the words, ‘Father, protect the refugees, in Jesus’ name. Amen.’ An ad in the Rockford Register Star announces an evangelical rock band’s ‘Concert for the Kosovar Refugees.’ And church leaders—from local priests and pastors to heads of synods, traveling speakers, and televangelists—seem to agree with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair that Slobodan Milosevic is the latest incarnation of Hitler. American Christians, it seems, are ‘sending a message”‘ of their own to the people of Serbia.
It is a message not readily understood by Serbian Orthodox immigrants to America. ‘Don’t they know the KLA is an Islamic terrorist group?’ they ask. ‘Don’t they realize that the Serbs are their Christian brothers and sisters?’…
American believers who back NATO are not self-consciously ‘social-gospel’ liberals. Many are members of the Christian right. Indefatigable in their opposition to abortion and homosexuality, they continue to press for federally—now imperialistically—imposed morality, abstracted from any historical context, and derived largely from popular sentiment.
‘Adopt a refugee’ campaigns in churches across America are not about loving one’s enemy. They are a cathartic response to 24-hour-a-day CNN broadcasts of people huddled in tents in Albania and Macedonia. They carry with them the sentiments of Mather’s Magnalia Christi Americana, molded by two centuries of American evangelicalism. Articles reminding us that ethnic Albanians are responsible for the heroin trade in Europe and for teenage prostitution in Italy and have engaged in terrorist acts against the Serbian police simply cannot trump the sentiments that arise when evangelicals view footage of crying children.
We do not see footage of dead Serbian children or their crying mothers, and so the Serbs become a mere afterthought—collateral damage, a necessary evil, like the ravaging of Atlanta and Columbia in the mid-1860s. Nonetheless, the fact remains that 10,000 hours of Christiane Amanpour and Geraldo Rivera could not diminish the resolve nor confuse the loyalties of a people with an identity established not by cause or sentiment, but by the Nicene Creed. Save for a small remnant, that type of American Christian has long since perished from the earth. ‘Home Church’ (2008)

Daniel, as you may recall, was a eunuch—he was made ‘prince of the eunuchs,’ in fact, against his will. Most American Christian men, on the other hand, are neither slaves nor eunuchs—or at least they weren’t before the vasectomy. Like most men throughout time, they have families. Stretching back as far as the patriarch Job (before Moses and perhaps before Abraham), a man was priest of his household. The addition of the Tabernacle some years later, then the Temple, then the synagogue, and their transformation and fulfillment in Christ and His Church, did not mitigate the responsibility of the father. …
There is much to deplore in today’s churches—pap-filled psychobabble sermons, excruciating pop music, the silliness of dramas and dances—but the fact remains: Home is not church. We can set aside (for the briefest of moments) what this or that denomination may teach about ordination and the sacraments. There is no way to read the history of the early Church or the Pastoral Epistles and conclude that, when things go badly at church, you can start your own at home. What to do, then? …
American men prefer a quick and one-sided fix. Bariatric surgery beats diet and daily exercise. Voting will save babies. Eunuchs can better afford to send their kids to college. And yet the days and the seasons and the years continue to pass, the churches become increasingly decadent and irrelevant, and the kids’ mouths get smarter. What does this mean?
It means we have to go home. It means that we have to gather around the table. And it means that Dad must take up the mantle of Job as household priest. This might mean taking some things off our plates. At least here, in the Age of Antichrist, we’re still free to do that. ‘Manifest(o)’ (2019)

Buoyed by their anonymous online friends whose imaginations have been deformed by vile ‘ironic’ memes that make light of evil and depict Muslims as subhuman, a few [young men of the Alt-Right] will commit heinous crimes ‘IRL,’ purportedly in ‘defense’ of the West. What do I have to lose? they reason. Or in the words of [New Zealand mass shooter Brenton] Tarrant, ‘WHY DON’T I DO SOMETHING?’
That the ‘Caucasoid’ peoples are succumbing, one after another, to their own ‘replacement’ is a direct result not of genocide, nor even of suicide, but of apostasy. The will to endure hardship in the service of duty, to marry and rear children, to build cultural institutions that will outlast you, to resist falsely conceived characterizations of ‘hate’—Islamophobia included—comes not from racial consciousness but from a simple confidence in the divinely ordained goodness and inviolability of family, kin, the inherited civil order, and the unique cultural institutions by which we pass on this confidence to our children. To attribute these good gifts, even partly, to our own racial merit is as wicked as it is to deny that they are good gifts to begin with. God is not mocked.
Tolerance is not a virtue, and its enforcement predictably leads to resentment and inhumane cruelty. On the other hand, to be magnanimous means literally to have a large soul, one big enough to pursue the highest good in humility and in recognition of one’s estate in the Divine Order. For those conditions to obtain, one must believe that he has a God and a soul—and that others do, too.
Requiescat in pace is a fine thing to say, and our Lord has promised peace for all who fall asleep in his arms like our brother Aaron. But Aaron strikes me more as a Resurgam kind of guy. The life, death, resurrection, and return of Jesus Christ was not a theme in the Wolf oeuvre—it was the thesis.
There is an Easter coming when the sea will give up its dead , and Aaron’s arresting final tweet will no longer be up for debate . Aaron Wolf: Resurgam.

Why Is Ilhan Omar’s Collusion With Islamists Acceptable?,thefederalist.com,Ben Weingarten,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/ilhan-omars-collusion-islamists-acceptable/,"By Ben Weingarten April 30, 2019
Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has distinguished herself with often offensive, outrageous, and unpatriotic rhetoric. One week she invokes classic anti-Jewish tropes. The next she trivializes the September 11 jihadist attacks. Another it is unearthed that she espouses morally relativistic if not overtly anti-American views about U.S. soldiers , the very ones who fought to defend civilians in her native Somalia to boot.
Omar’s penchant for provoking millions of Americans with odious words has masked the related, equally if not more troubling, elements of her associations, ideology, and background. Consider Omar’s Meeting with Turkey’s President
Consider, for example, the revelation, largely unnoticed outside of conservative media, that as a Minnesota Assemblywoman Omar had a closed-press meeting in fall 2017 with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to a curiously now-deleted article from the local Somalian-language periodical in her district, the Tusmo Times , she and the Islamist authoritarian president met during his U.N. General Assembly visit to New York.
Per one account, they discussed : “issues involving Omar’s native Somalia and issues for Somalis in Minnesota. She [Omar] thanked Erdogan for Turkey’s support for the Rohingya people in Myanmar. The two also discussed investment and trade between Turkey and Somalia. The meeting ended with Erdogan asking Omar to voice her support for Turkey. The report concludes by adding that Omar not only met with Erdogan, but also with the Turkish prime minister and other senior Turkish officials.”
A political-media establishment frenzied over foreign influence might ask many questions about this meeting, such as: Why did a state lawmaker have it? Was it appropriate for her to be discussing Turkish-Somali relations as an American representative? On whose behalf was she speaking? Did anyone bless this meeting at the federal level, and on what grounds? Did Omar have any reservations about meeting with President Erdogan given the totalitarian , bellicose , and bigoted nature of his regime? What do Omar’s Democratic colleagues at the national level make of this meeting?
This last question would likely elicit some interesting answers, given what prominent Democrats have said about President Erdogan. Take Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), for example, a critic of Erdogan and his repression of journalists. In April 2017, several months before the Omar-Erdogan meeting, a Turkish prosecutor announced he was investigating Schumer , among other Americans, for fomenting the supposed coup Erdogan crushed in 2016. Would Schumer have endorsed a meeting with a regime engaged in such an outlandish probe?
In May 2017, Schumer’s Senate colleague Ed Markey (D-MA) proffered a resolution “condemning the violence against peaceful protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence…and calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.” According to the resolution, Turkish officials had beaten, kicked, and choked unarmed protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence in Washington, D.C., injuring at least 11 people.
In the House, chief collusion arbiter Adam Schiff (D-CA) issued a related statement in which he challenged the Erdogan regime, asserting: “Erdogan cannot export the violent repression he visits on his own citizens to our streets. The violence of May 16 can’t go unanswered or forgotten…I stand here today to affirm that we will not allow Turkey to beat innocent protesters on the streets of our Nation’s capital. We will continue to pursue justice and to make clear that America will always stand up for the right of peaceful and free expression.” See No Democratic Evil, Hear No Democratic Evil
Yet there’s no word from Markey or Schiff regarding the revelations about Omar’s meeting with Erdogan.
Nor has there been any comment from the man who oversees the most prominent committee on which Omar sits, House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY). In July 2018, Engel questioned “whether Turkey’s autocratic ruler, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is truly committed to his country’s relationship with the United States,” citing the Turkish regime’s holding of American pastor Andrew Brunson under house arrest, crackdown following the supposed coup, contemplated purchase of a Russian air defense system, and other offending acts.
Last but not least, there was nary a peep about Logan Act violations from Obama administration officials.
Democrats would likely contend that U.S. leaders routinely meet with President Erdogan. Turkey is ostensibly a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, albeit increasingly in name only . But a state assemblywoman is not a head of state or diplomat. Nor did Omar have any business speaking as a representative of the U.S. government, which was her de facto position in discussing international relations—and perhaps most strangely, international relations independent of the United States’. Worse Ties to Terrorist Front Groups
Perhaps the more troubling tie that binds President Erdogan and Omar is their shared affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood—the tip of the Sunni jihadist spear . Erdogan has publicly defended the Muslim Brotherhood , and vice versa , as he and the group share a common Sunni Islamic supremacist ideology. Erdogan’s Turkey has also been an ardent supporter of Hamas , one of the Muslim Brotherhood’s most notorious jihadist offshoots.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has effectively served as the public relations arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States, in part through its support of Hamas. CAIR’s coordination with Hamas was revealed when it was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest jihad financing case in U.S. history, the Holy Land Foundation trial , in which several individuals were prosecuted for a scheme that resulted in millions of dollars flowing to Hamas.
The longstanding links between the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, and CAIR have been detailed in proposed legislation that would designate the Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization. The unpassed law notes:
Shortly after HAMAS was founded in 1987, as an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood, the International Muslim Brotherhood ordered the Muslim Brotherhood chapters throughout the world to create Palestine Committees, who supported HAMAS with ‘media, money and men’. The U.S.-Muslim Brotherhood created the United States Palestine Committee, which documents reflect was initially comprised of 3 organizations: the Holy Land Foundation, the Islamic Association for Palestine, and the United Association for Studies and Research. CAIR was later added to these organizations. The mandate of these organizations, per the International Muslim Brotherhood, was to support HAMAS, and the HLF’s [Holy Land Foundation] particular role was to raise money to support HAMAS’ organizations inside the Palestinian territories.
Following the Holy Land Foundation case, the FBI swore off contact with CAIR. On account of its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, the United Arab Emirates classified CAIR as a terrorist organization in 2014.
President Erdogan has met with senior members of CAIR on multiple occasions . Omar seems to share Erdogan’s affinity for the group. Her recent offending comments regarding the attacks of September 11, 2001 were made in front of CAIR’s Los Angeles chapter. Omar was previously an Advisory Board member for CAIR’s Minnesota branch . She has also received several thousand dollars’ worth of political contributions from CAIR’s California political action committee , as well as CAIR personnel in the 2018 fundraising cycle.
The congresswoman has been linked to the Muslim Brotherhood in other ways, as illustrated multiple times in recent weeks. In February 2019, Omar headlined an event hosted by Islamic Relief USA , whose chairman has been identified as one of the most prominent representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States. Earlier this month, Omar publicly lobbied the Trump administration, via her Twitter account, to press for the release of an imprisoned leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood’s female affiliate. Using Her Position to Benefit Terrorists’ Interests
Consistent with Islamic supremacist groups like CAIR , Omar has taken—to put it charitably—a soft line on terrorists. In a 2016 letter to a judge in which Omar pled for leniency for nine Minnesota men charged with planning to join the Islamic State, the congresswoman went so far as to claim that in effect the United States is to blame for creating jihadists. She proffered the perverse argument, favored by sophistic Islamists and their apologists, that jihad represents blowback for perceived Western sins, including those of materialism and disenfranchisement. It must be read to be believed.
In the past, Omar has exhibited a flippant attitude towards jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and Hezbollah, seeming to mock those Americans concerned with the groups’ violence and barbarism.
Then there’s Omar’s support of issues and positions shared by many of her Islamist supporters , including: the anti-Semitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement; the thinly veiled anti-Semitic propaganda Omar parrots regarding Israel; her outright bigotry towards Jews, consistent with the pervasive anti-Semitism of her Islamist supporters; and, perhaps most chillingly, Omar and her allies’ attempts to stifle any criticism of her rhetoric, by casting herself as the victim of Islamophobic “hate speech” that incites violence. This paradigm, incidentally, has been applied to great effect in Europe by Islamists who seek to shut up their critics.
There is a clear nexus between Omar’s associations, words, and actions: She consorts—one might say colludes—with Islamists, parrots their propaganda, and has advocated for their positions as a member of Congress. The Odd Behavior Doesn’t End There
On top of these issues, consider two more troubling stories the media has been completely loathe to cover, save for a few intrepid conservative journalists, led by PJ Media’s David Steinberg: (i) Omar’s oddly substantial role in the 2016 presidential elections of the highly corrupt Somalian government, in which her support for the winning candidate was followed by an appointment of her brother-in-law to a senior position on the victor’s staff; and (ii) Omar’s seemingly pervasive web of fraudulent, felonious activity centering on the bizarre but substantiated claim that she married her brother.
Set aside the backdrop of the last two years of hysteria over foreign collusion. If Omar were to fill out standard paperwork for a national security position , which she certainly holds, the red flags raised by information in the public domain alone in terms of the congresswoman’s Islamist ties, links to a corrupt foreign government with which she may have engaged in a quid pro quo and potentially compromising criminality would inundate investigators.
These are material issues affecting American national security, especially given Omar’s seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. While her anti-Semitic bigotry ought to be condemned at every turn, we must also acknowledge the plethora of other problems surrounding her. And we should ask ourselves a related question: Why is the political-media establishment, which claims to care about foreign influence, mum? Maybe Collusion Is Okay If You’re a Democrat
Is it that Omar is colluding with the right kind of people? This seems plausible. After all, in spite of Turkey leading the world in journalists jailed over the last three years, President Erdogan gets to pen editorials in the Washington Post. That same newspaper of course provided a platform for the similarly Muslim Brotherhood-supporting, virulently anti-Zionist, and anti-Semitic Jamal Khashoggi . She can offend millions of Americans with her words, and the left will absolve her.
The Post is a good proxy for where the political-media establishment stands on political Islam, which is where the Obama administration stood: It is generally sympathetic , especially vis-à-vis challenging nominally anti-Islamist authoritarian regimes, especially those who stand against the Iranian regime. In a climate in which leading Democratic candidates believe convicted jihadists should retain the right to vote, certainly Omar’s associations and inclinations would seem to be acceptable.
Or perhaps it is not so much an issue of whom Omar is colluding with, but who Omar is, namely an avatar for the intersectionalist, America-loathing, progressive-Islamic supremacist set. Omar appears to be protected by an identity politics veil. As such, she can offend millions of Americans with her words, and the left will absolve her from blame by refusing to censure her by name, then diluting even general charges against her by condemning any and all offensive rhetoric.
In a post-Kavanaugh era in which it is clear that winning trumps all else for the left, if Omar can be used as a cudgel against Republicans, that is probably reason enough to ignore the serious concerns about her. Omar’s danger is not just in her bigotry, but in the company she keeps, and the ideology it is clear she has been bathed in and continues to espouse—all of which serve to the detriment of American national interest.
The truth is that if Omar were held up to a standard of scrutiny even remotely approximating that to which the president has been subjected, she would not just be thrown off the House Foreign Affairs Committee, but forced by her party to resign and never step foot in Washington D.C. again. That it will not happen is a travesty. Ben Weingarten is a senior contributor at The Federalist and senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.

DePaul Students Demand Professor's Censure For Supporting Israel,thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/depaul-students-demand-professors-censure-as-racist-for-supporting-israel-in-the-federalist/,"— DePaul Democrats (@DePaulDems) April 24, 2019
“We weren’t calling for DePaul to fire him, we just wanted them to say that this was unacceptable,” student Hadyia Afzal told the campus newspaper , which labeled The Federalist a “right-wing” publication. “The administration hasn’t really learned how to take students seriously when it comes to these debates, which is disappointing.”
“I don’t feel safe as a Muslim student knowing that someone like this is on our campus,” Afzal said. “It’s ridiculous that my tuition is going to the salary of an Islamophobe, of a transphobe, of a very sexist man.”
Hill, a philosophy professor at DePaul, is gay and a naturalized immigrant to the United States from Jamaica. In the Federalist article, he wrote:
the [Palestinian Authority] has destroyed the freedom Palestinians enjoyed under Israeli rule and their economy through kleptocracy, corruption, nepotism, and authoritarian forms of governance subject to none of the checks and balances that characterize Israel’s Knesset. …
Not all cultures are indeed equal. Some are abysmally inferior and regressive based on their comprehensive philosophy and fundamental principles—or lack thereof—that guide or fail to protect the inalienable rights of their citizens.
Given the voting patterns of Palestinians—towards Islamicism and terrorist organizations for the most part—that openly advocate and work for Israeli and Jewish destruction and annihilation, a strong argument can and ought to be made to strip Palestinians of their right to vote—period. The regional hostilities towards Israel in the Middle East are such that Israel must take those threats seriously.

TED Talker Promotes Letting Doctors Mutilate Minors WO Parent Consent,thefederalist.com,Jane Robbins,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/ted-talker-promotes-laws-let-doctors-mutilate-minors-without-parent-consent/,"By Jane Robbins April 30, 2019
In the competition for the most hard-left doctor treating children who are confused about their sex (“transgender” kids), Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles has maintained a strong lead. Olson-Kennedy promotes medicalizing sex-confused children with puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery.
How radical is she? Radical enough to airily reject the idea that all such children should at least receive psychological counseling ( “I don’t send someone to a therapist when I’m going to start them on insulin”) and to minimize the seriousness of removing healthy but currently unwanted organs ( “if you want breasts at a later point in life, you can go and get them”). Olson-Kennedy is now using federal research dollars to administer sterility-inducing cross-sex hormones to children as young as eight years old to see what happens.
It doesn’t get more politicized at kids’ expense than that. Or does it?
Stanford pediatric endocrinologist Tandy Aye is determined to try. While Olson-Kennedy is injecting powerful hormones into physically healthy children, Aye isn’t satisfied with merely medical interventions. She wants to allow (and encourage) surgeons to perform mutilating surgery on children (“older adolescents,” she says) who are under 18 and therefore currently unable to agree to such permanent and life-altering procedures.
Aye’s recent TED talk on this issue is illuminating in several ways. One is her slavish adherence to the new grammatical mandates of the transgender orthodoxy. She consistently refers with female pronouns to a boy who identifies as a girl.
His parents realize they have “a daughter with a penis” (1:10). He was “assigned” a sex at birth (3:30). His treatment isn’t gender “reassignment” therapy but gender “affirmation” therapy (1:40). Similarly, surgery to remove healthy organs is gender-affirming surgery, or GAS. She smoothly strings together these misleading terms as though they are inarguably correct, thus suggesting that people should ignore the jarring dissonance between what they’re hearing and what they know to be true.
Aye also acknowledges but dismisses the obvious reason that states have set 18 as the age of consent: that minors are too immature to make life-altering medical decisions. Not to worry, Aye says, because all transgender minors know exactly what they’re doing: “The transgender patient may be one of the most well-informed patients. Who else has had years of psychological evaluation, months of medical therapy, and has thought of this one procedure for so long?” (7:00).
Perhaps Aye should have a chat with Olson-Kennedy, whose patients may very well have avoided “years of”—or any—psychological evaluation. Perhaps she should read the stories of frantic parents who helplessly watched their children get herded into medical treatment with little or no exploration of what might underlie that fixation on “this one procedure.”
The most noteworthy aspect of Aye’s discussion is her concession that the doctors who administer Gender Affirming Therapy (GAT) are sterilizing these children. The GAT crowd tends to shy away from this admission, preferring not to dwell on the fact they may be ruining lives.
Minor children clearly cannot grasp the full extent of problems caused by infertility. Adults who struggle with this condition suffer significant psychological distress, with affected women experiencing distress “comparable to the experience of a life threatening illness .” Rather than acknowledge this bleak future for their patients, GAT doctors typically downplay or ignore the physical and emotional ramifications of what they’re doing.
Aye is more forthcoming. Her argument in favor of GAS for minors is that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones have destroyed the child’s future reproductive capacity anyway, so why not remove the now useless organs? She explains (beginning at 6:10): “[A]s soon as puberty blockers were added and then estrogen was added to [the boy’s] therapy, [his] testes never developed. In fact, she [sic] does not make any sperm. And her [sic] reproductive capability to be a biological parent has been eliminated.” (Emphasis mine.)
Having blithely announced that she and her fellow practitioners have robbed this child of one of the most profound and meaningful experiences of human life, Aye concludes: “And in medicine, don’t we often recommend the removal of non-functional organs, like an appendix? So does it make sense for [the minor patient] to wait until she’s [sic] 18, or should older adolescents be allowed to have surgery before the age of 18?”
We’ve already destroyed the organ, Aye is saying, so we might as well lop it off. This is medical practice in the 21st century. Hippocrates indeed.
Following this perverse reasoning, Aye proposes that age of consent be replaced with the number of years the patient has lived in imitation of the opposite sex (although she doesn’t phrase it quite that honestly). If a young boy begins wearing dresses and is “affirmed” in this behavior by his family, his teachers, and his therapists, and so is not surprisingly still confused in adolescence, he should be allowed to undergo surgical sterilization and painful reconstructive procedures while still a minor.
Aye doesn’t specify how many years of charade would be required. We can only assume that whatever number is chosen will steadily fall as the GAS surgeons tap greater patient pools for greater insurance payments. She is seemingly insouciant about this outcome. Preparation for and recovery from this surgery is difficult, she concedes, so doesn’t it make sense to have the child undergo it while he or she is still at home under parental care? Win-win.
But what about the irreversibility of these procedures? Aye doesn’t mention that. What about the fact that thousands of patients who have endured surgical alteration, even as adults, have come to regret it? No mention of that either. What about the stubborn persistence of high suicide rates among people who have undergone the surgery? From Aye, crickets. What of the disturbing statistics showing the sudden and enormous increase in the number of children and adolescents claiming to be the opposite sex lately? Shouldn’t we at least investigate this phenomenon before putting children under the knife? Aye is apparently unconcerned.
That such reckless recommendations are coming from an apparently licensed physician at a formerly respected medical institution shows the depth of the rot that has infected the medical profession. Lives of children and their families are being destroyed, day by day, while the people and organizations who should be policing this are either asleep at the switch or simply craven cowards. But Aye and her fellow practitioners will make lots of money and get invited to present TED talks to the enlightened. That should go a long way toward easing the conscience.

You’re Not Following The Golden Rule If You’re Not Having Children,thefederalist.com,Matthew Cochran,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/youre-not-following-golden-rule-youre-not-children/,"By Matthew Cochran April 30, 2019
Christianity teaches many things that our culture finds controversial, but the Golden Rule generally isn’t one of them. That’s the statement, “Do to others as you would like them do to you.”
Whether Christian or not, the vast majority of people would accept this as a good rule of thumb when deciding how to live among others. So we ought to reflect on the fact that we in the West are deliberately failing to pursue the Golden Rule’s most fundamental expression: having children. Refusing to have a family is the Platonic ideal of selfishness.
Now, for those of you afflicted by “whataboutism,” I’m not addressing the barren, those called to celibacy, or those who’ve devoted their fertile years to starting a family but failed. None of those involve refusal.
But let’s be real here. Our falling birth rates aren’t explained by medical issues. And it couldn’t possibly be clearer that they aren’t falling because of celibacy. After all, the growing masses of people who refuse family are not being voluntarily celibate. They’re fornicating. They’re jerking off to porn plentifully. They’re constantly falling to sexual temptation—the precise situation for which the Apostle Paul actually commands marriage rather than celibacy. We are deciding to forgo children for our own sake.
People may try to portray that decision as some kind of noble service—to the world, to society, or even to the children they never have—but it is a love of self that refuses to sacrificially share with others. I make this charge as one of those very same selfish people. I deliberately avoided having children for many years. It didn’t feel selfish at the time, and I’m intimately familiar with how compelling various rationalizations and excuses can be because I’ve used my own fair share of them. But upon even brief reflection, the most common ones simply don’t hold up to scrutiny. All Your Excuses Are Just Excuses
Most frequently, of course, people make the excuse that there are already too many people in the world. It’s a surprisingly old claim. The earliest example I can think of is 500 years old. It came up at the Diet of Augsburg when Lutherans and papists were arguing about enforced celibacy for priests.
One of the things Rome contended was that God’s command to be fruitful and multiply no longer applied because the Earth was then full to the point of population pressure. Hindsight makes the claim pretty silly from a time in which fewer than half a billion people lived on the planet.
Both experience and foresight should make the claim just as silly for us today. For one thing, Western nations already have fertility well below replacement levels. If the earth were overpopulated, we aren’t the ones doing it.
For another, it has always been “impossible” for the world to support more people until we get more people and then figure out how to support them. The only thing Malthusianism has ever reliably produced is failed predictions. Modern abundance is the product of hope, perseverance, and ingenuity—not despair and surrender. Future abundance will be no different. No, Work Isn’t More Important than Children
Others will rationalize self-imposed barrenness by appealing to the immense value of their work, which society will miss if they devote their time to parenthood. Of course, more often than not, such evaluations are based on what they imagine they will accomplish someday rather than on what they actually have accomplished. But even if we ignore the personal arrogance that often accompanies this view, the reasoning is still faulty for two reasons.
First, parenthood is indeed an enormous time investment—particularly for mothers, as they are biologically best-equipped to nourish and nurture children in their youngest years. But children do grow up, and grow less constantly needy. There will still be time for parents to contribute their immense talents to the wider world after their kids are older and they are wiser. After all, the pressures of parenthood are great for teaching people to efficiently use their time and to understand what’s truly important in life.
Second, and more importantly, children are themselves a great way to contribute to the wider world. If you truly are blessed with exceptional ability, then that only makes it more important to pass that potential on to even more people in the next generation.
Even if either you or your spouse devote half the waking hours of your adult life to raising children, and every last one of your children does the same, then after a single child, you’ve already broken even because he’s ultimately going to supply that missing 50 percent. After the second, you’ve contributed far more to posterity than you ever could have alone. You Don’t Need Experience, Either
The other really common rationalization I hear is from those who contend that they are destined to be a bad parent and should not be trusted with a child. This one is extremely easy to believe because non-parents can envision just about any parental crisis under the sun and realize they have no idea what they would do.
This is particularly troubling when one is young. After being sequestered in schools for one’s entire life, classroom knowledge becomes a kind of security blanket—one can feel unequipped for any practical work for which one hasn’t first taken a course.
But the truth, as most college graduates quickly find out, is that while schooling can provide some helpful background knowledge, most practical job skills are acquired on the job. That’s no less true for parenthood. We don’t know what we’re doing, either, until we figure it out.
Before pregnancy, our society provides little incentive to acquire parenting skills. But make no mistake: actually having kids provides loads of incentive. You will learn because you have to. As that terrifyingly abstract idea of a baby becomes the flesh-and-blood reality of your son or daughter with his or her own feelings, character, and personality, you will also learn how to deal with the trials and obstacles that come along. The Truth Is, You’re Just Selfish (Like Me)
But enough about the rationalizations, because they’re just that. They aren’t the real reason so many of us refuse the challenge of family. Here’s the reality from a still-selfish person standing on the other side of parenthood: The real reason you don’t want to have children is that you find the prospect of raising them unpleasant. The real reason you don’t want to have children is that you find the prospect of raising them unpleasant.
It’s not as though you really, really wanted a family, but then heard an argument about overpopulation and consequently gave up your dream for the sake of the Earth. People in that situation adopt. If you’re anything like me, you didn’t really want a family in the first place and subsequently embraced various arguments because they resonated with what you had already decided.
The self-centered reality of that decision is precisely where we run afoul of the Golden Rule. Consider, for a moment, all the unattractive aspects of raising children that inspired your pious rationalizations in the first place. They’re loud, noisy, and needy. They’re always dribbling from one end or the other. They’ll interrupt your life goals.
You won’t have nearly as much time for your career, your causes, your hobbies, and your amusements. You’ll have less disposable income, go on fewer ideal vacations, wear less stylish clothes, eat at more mundane restaurants, and generally be much less free to do as thou wilt. Take all those reasons, and add whichever ones you want. Apart from rare circumstances like severe family trauma resulting in lasting and irreparable psychological damage, or the inability to care for other people due to severe disabilities, the specifics don’t really matter in the end. Your father and mother embraced everything you see as unpleasant, for you.
Now consider that your own parents went through pretty much that entire list of yours so that you could be here. Your father and mother embraced everything you see as unpleasant, for you—for the life that you so cherish that you don’t want to give up any of it to share with a family of your own.
Now consider that your grandparents made those very same sacrifices, as did their parents before them, all the way back to that day when God first said “Let us make man in our own image” and instructed his new creatures to be fruitful and multiply. Think of all those generations of selfless love that embraced every challenge on your list so that you could be here, reading this. So Go, Given Unto Others What Has Been Given You
What, then, does it mean to do unto others as you would have done unto you—as was done unto you? How do you treat others the way you yourself have been treated and have profoundly benefited from? The answer is quite clear, along with what that answer says about those of us who have refused to do so. If we refuse to be generous even to our own flesh and blood, then we haven’t even cleared level one.
Selfish people like us may talk a good game about generosity, but if we refuse to be generous even to our own flesh and blood, then we haven’t even cleared level one. Having children is the only way to make love a sustainable resource.
To be sure, parents will eventually find out that their children are a blessing and that everything they sacrificed was well worth what they’ve gained. Nevertheless, it’s hard to perceive the reward beforehand. It requires a leap of faith—a willingness to make the sacrifice without truly understanding the benefits. But the moral reality that we ought to make that sacrifice should be plain to us.
In light of the way we were loved by those who came before us, our long list of reasons comes to naught. Whether we admit it or not, the choice we face is this: Do we take the millennia of love that were poured out on us and consume every last drop until it’s gone? Or do we pay it forward by continuing to pass that love along to future generations?
Only one of those choices conforms to the Golden Rule. Choose wisely. Matthew’s writing may be found at The 96th Thesis . You can also follow him on Twitter @matt_e_cochran or subscribe to his YouTube Channel, Lutheran in a Strange Land ."
It’s Time To Ignore The People Who Shut Up Their Opponents By Shouting ‘Racist!’,thefederalist.com,Lawrence M. Mead,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/time-ignore-people-shut-opponents-shouting-racist/,"By Lawrence M. Mead April 30, 2019
Americans say that we have a multicultural society, but we do not allow discussion of group differences. An ideology of sameness insists that minorities and immigrants be seen as exactly the same as all other citizens, despite all our supposed celebration of diversity. Any suggestion to the contrary is deemed racist. One may mention the contributions each group has made to the nation, but not the social problems each has or the costs it imposes on others.
Even experts who study poverty, crime, or family breakdown are allowed to attribute these problems only to impersonal forces outside the groups most involved, such as lack of jobs, housing, or child care. Skeptics who point instead to the groups’ attitudes or lifestyle are forbidden to speak in leading venues (such as universities or think tanks) or to publish in leading outlets (major journals or newspapers).
They are silenced partly by academic political correctness, which endorses sameness, but also by fear of retribution from their employers. Cries of “racism” have become a trump card that bans all discussion of these issues. Institutions that allow debate scramble to disown any offending opinions.
Before communism collapsed, its defenders accused capitalist countries of false consciousness. Societies were dominated by class differences and were radically unequal, yet the culture denied that reality by refusing to talk about it. Today we are more open about economic inequality, even if it remains an issue, yet in denial about group differences. Supposedly, everyone is the same except for differences in their resources and opportunities. We refuse to discuss why some groups make much better use of their opportunities than others do.
One excuse for this silencing is defining “racism” to include any and all criticisms of the protected groups. Anyone saying anything negative about them is presumed to view them as inferior. But the dictionary confines “racism” to the beliefs that one race is superior to the others and that these differences are inherent, not subject to conditioning.
Outside of the alt-right, very few Americans believe such things today, let alone assert them. The vast majority accept that how people live reflects how they are raised, not racial or ethnic identity. So criticisms of any social groups that avoid racism should be heard, even if they are controversial. The proper response is not suppression but counter-argument. The Spirit of Free Speech
Another excuse is the common assumption that suppression is allowed by constitutional norms of free speech. That is, it is okay to block sensitive arguments about group differences provided that speech or publishing about them is not literally forbidden. Skeptics who question sameness have a right to free expression, but not to an audience. If they remain invisible, that is only because their arguments are unpersuasive.
But it violates the spirit of free speech to deny visibility to arguments not “on the merits” but simply because they are controversial. Nobody can deny that important group differences in behavior and lifestyle do exist; there is, however, much more dispute about how they arise. That is just the argument that should occur more openly. It should not be denied by elites seeking to avoid upset.
While freedom of speech is not directly violated, current sanctions resemble those that Russia or China use to protect their regimes. In these repressive countries, one can print or say most things publicly, but not in a place where many people will read or hear it. Only the broadcast media and the internet are tightly controlled. In America, a high-minded elite defends major venues and publications against perceived racial heresy. Tyranny of opinion does the work of censorship.
Another offense to free speech is to suppress challenging opinions because of the alleged motivation behind them. If one’s opponents are racists, then one need not respond to their arguments. But adversaries are entitled to a response on the merits of what they say, not on their purported intentions. Suppressing Ideas Doesn’t Work, Either
Suppression is ineffective as well as improper. The natural response when an opinion is silenced is that it must be true, not that it is false. Most Americans want to hear the facts and form their own opinions. Donald Trump’s election as president was driven in large part by popular resentment against the current thought control. His refusal to honor taboos is the most popular thing about him, even if much of what he says is false.
The general public demands a more honest discussion of minorities and immigrants. It refuses to do more to help them, as advocates demand, without greater candor about their difficulties. And to ask for openness is realistic, not racist.
Identity defenders think they are promoting integration and forestalling an American Holocaust, but the actual effect is to deepen our political division. Current politics pits the sameness ideology, entrenched in the public sector and academia, against the populist movement, which rejects the virtual silencing of the critics. Trump’s challenging manner, of course, does provoke fears that he or his followers are fascists who mean to end all immigration and attention to the needy.
But the danger the other way is greater. The thought controllers are entrenched inside the establishment, whereas Trump’s supporters are outsiders. Sameness leads the country toward Big Brother and “1984.” The nation would then be powerless to arrest the decay of work, families, and neighborhoods going on at the bottom of society. Our only response would be further income transfers. Absorbed in decline without hope, America would soon cease to be the world’s leading nation.
It is time for all Americans to respect differences of opinion and tolerate even the fiercest of debates. And it’s time for those who control leading venues and publications to stand up and be counted. Do not deny hearing the critics of social problems for fear of backlash. Do not permit cries of “racism” to remain the trump card it has become.
Instead, go with the evidence. Critics who have the facts right about problems and who make a good case should be heard, and those who don’t should not. Form your own view rather than siding with sameness.
No individual and no group can escape reality. Our nation must allow that debate to occur, rather than silencing it. A free society demands it. If the mere discussion of sensitive issues is racist, so be it. Lawrence M.

5 Major Heresies A Supposedly Christian Minister Preached To A Gullible New York Times Columnist,thefederalist.com,Robert Gagnon,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/5-major-heresies-supposedly-christian-minister-preached-gullible-new-york-times-columnist/,"By Robert Gagnon April 30, 2019
In an interview with Nicholas Kristoff of The New York Times just in time for Good Friday and Easter, Serene Jones, president of hard-left Union Theological Seminary in New York City, thought it would be an opportune moment to deliver a sweeping denial of the tenets of the Christian faith. In the course of her rant, Jones unintentionally gives a good indication of why “liberal Christianity” is a heretical cancer on Christian faith.
Her heresies should occasion no great surprise given Union’s long-standing opposition to orthodox Christianity and Jones’s Yale pedigree (M.Div., Ph.D., professor of theology and chair of “Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies”). Still, I am inclined to think that the general lay person in church would be shocked by the depth of her degradation of church teaching.
Apparently, Jones thinks that by broadcasting her heresies in the Times, she will increase donor giving and student enrollment to extricate Union from its cash-strapped situation. Let’s just say that I’m trying to do my part to test that delusion. Major Heresy 1: Christ’s Atoning Death
The creed that Christ died to atone for (i.e., make amends or restitution for) humanity’s sins is one of the two or three central confessions of the church. Arguably the earliest Christian creedal formulation is the tradition cited by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 that he says he received from others and for which he could count on the agreement of the rest of the apostles.
It contained two main formulas, each tagged with the buttressing phrase “in accordance with the Scriptures”: namely, that “Christ died (to atone) for our sins” and that “he has been raised on the third day.” Paul called this formulation “the gospel . . . by which you are being saved, if you hold firmly to [it]…unless you believed in vain” (15:1-2).
Jones denies both planks: Christ’s atoning death and his resurrection. Of his atoning death she says: “Crucifixion is not something that God is orchestrating from upstairs. The pervasive idea of an abusive God-father who sends his own kid to the cross so God could forgive people is nuts.”
The entire New Testament witness confirms this was God’s plan from eternity. What Jones deems to be “child abuse” and “nuts” is put forward by none other than Jesus himself at his Last Supper as the one creed that is to be remembered and celebrated regularly by the church in the Eucharist (“Thanksgiving”).
In connection with a Passover meal, Jesus redefined the bread served at the meal as “my body” and the wine as “my ‘blood of the covenant’ which [blood] is being poured out for many” (Mark 14:24; Matthew 26:28 adds: “… for [Gk. forgiveness of sins].” “Blood of the covenant” would have called to mind the same phrase Moses used at the covenant-ratifying ceremony at Mount Sinai, where death of bulls dashed both on the altar (symbolizing God) and the people (who had just heard the stipulations of the law) inaugurated a kinship agreement between God and Israel.
Jesus was signaling that by his atoning death, his life for ours, he was ratifying and inaugurating a new covenant in which God would write the law on our hearts and remember our sins no more (Jer 31:31-34). This explains Paul’s (and Luke’s) rephrasing of Jesus’ Eucharistic words for a Gentile audience: “This cup is the new covenant (ratified or inaugurated) by blood” (1 Cor. 11:25; Luke 22:20). Later the author of the letter “to the Hebrews” would write: “Not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood” (9:18) and “Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins” (9:22).
Jesus’ added words about his blood “being poured out for many” would have called to mind the words about a “Suffering Servant” in Isaiah 53: “He poured out his life to death … and bore the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors” (53:12). Jesus’s poured-out life and blood was the means by which he bore the sins of transgressors against God’s law.
Nor is this the only time that Jesus made such a claim. In another important saying of Jesus in Mark 10:45 (parallel in Matt 20:28), Jesus stated that he came “to give his life (or soul ) as a ransom (Gk. lútron , ‘price of release,’ ‘sum paid for manumission’ of slaves) for many.”
So what Jones calls “child abuse” and “nuts” is in fact a denial of what Jesus himself viewed as central to the mission given him by God, even as she claims to be not only a “Christian,” a disciple or learner of Jesus, but a “minister” of Christ’s.
The idea is not “nuts” but makes sense in the context of sacrificial rites and martyrdom theology. Jesus as God’s Son willingly lays down his life for the lives of sinners in a lost world. This is the crux of Christianity itself. What’s new in Jesus’ thinking is that his act of righteousness is not changing God’s wrath to love but rather is cooperating with God’s love for a lost world, where the greatest cost is incurred by God, who offers his Son only because it is necessary to save the world.
Jones does not accept this need for amends and restitution for sin accomplished in the Godhead. Yet Jesus required his followers to celebrate this as an act of love from God. To Jones, the crucifixion was just “a first-century lynching,” “an enactment of our human hatred.” Nothing could “be more pertinent to our world today,” she proclaims. Yet in her thinking the cross effects nothing in God’s plan of redemption, except to show where hatred leads. Major Heresy 2: Christ’s Resurrection
We noted above that the earliest church viewed Christ’s resurrection from the dead as the second great plank of the core gospel. By this the church meant not resurrection as a metaphor or even as merely a release of the soul from entombment in a body, but a genuine physical, bodily resurrection.
The Apostle Paul takes great pains to make this point in 1 Corinthians 15 against the church at Corinth (Greece) that appeared to ascribe little or no value to embodied existence. To be sure, Paul is not talking about a “flesh-and-blood” body (15:50), as though Christ’s resurrection was merely a resuscitated corpse. Yet he is talking about a new body for the Kingdom of God that clothes an otherwise “naked” spirit (2 Corinthians 5:2-4).
It is the resurrection appearances of Jesus that convinced his disciples that Jesus was alive again in a real (albeit higher) sense; further, that God had thereby confirmed the truth of Jesus’ message and mission. They also came to the conclusion that Christ’s resurrection was not an isolated event but the start of a new humanity, a “first fruits” of a much larger, future harvest of resurrected bodies culminating in a renewed heaven and earth where sin and death are vanquished forever (“O Death, where is your sting?”). This is the hope of Easter.
As important as this belief has been for Christianity from its inception, it plays little or no role in Jones’s belief system. She says, “Those who claim to know whether or not [Jesus’ resurrection] happened are kidding themselves. . . . For Christians for whom the physical resurrection becomes a sort of obsession, that seems to me to be a pretty wobbly faith.”
To the early Christians, however, Christ’s resurrection was an assurance given by God that those who risked their life for the faith would receive their life (with body) in an afterlife. In addition, they were convinced that God would not abandon his creation to sin and death forever.
Once again, Jones denies not only what the early followers of Jesus believed to be essential to the gospel, along with the evidence of the empty tomb and of the eyewitnesses to Christ’s resurrection (the apostles, Jesus’ brother James, and more than 500 people at one time, most of whom were still alive at the time Paul wrote his “first” epistle to the Corinthians; 15:5-7). She must also deny Jesus’ own teaching, for all the gospels record Jesus’ repeated predictions that after his suffering and death God would raise him bodily from the dead.
Right off the bat, then, Jones either denies (Christ’s atoning death) or fails to affirm (Christ’s bodily resurrection) what the early church treated as the two central planks of the faith, necessary to be believed to be saved. She is officially a pagan or heretic by the standards of historic Christian faith. Yet there’s more. Major Heresy 3: Heaven, Hell, and Afterlife
One sees only traces of a developed view of reward or recompenses in the afterlife in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament (the relatively late text in Daniel 12:1-2 provides the clearest case). The great persecution of the nation of Israel by a Greek ruler of Syria in the 160s B.C., with its stories of intense martyrdom of faithful Jews, served as a catalyst for deeper reflection: There must be some post-mortem reward for those who suffer for the faith and recompense for those who make the faithful suffer.
By the time of Jesus, this concept was commonplace among Jews (although there were still holdouts like the aristocratic Sadducees). The resurrection appearances of Christ ensured that Christianity from its inception would have a robust view of an afterlife associated with either heaven or hell. Life after death in the Kingdom of God is something Jesus repeatedly affirms.
“Robust” would not be the appropriate adjective to describe Jones’s view of an afterlife. She is agnostic on the question of a positive post-mortem existence. In response to Kristoff’s question, “What happens when we die?” she states: “I don’t know! There may be something, there may be nothing. My faith is not tied to some divine promise about the afterlife.”
This uncertainty for Jones, however, does not extend to all facets of the Christian view of an afterlife: “I’m absolutely certain that when we die, there is not a group of designated bad people sent to burn in hell. That does not exist.” So she categorically rejects the idea that any bad people will suffer after death (which is certainly good news for Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Pol Pot).
This is extraordinary in view of her claim to be a “minister” of Jesus the Christ. Life after death in the Kingdom of God is something Jesus repeatedly affirms. This includes a place of destruction for those who do not repent and believe, which Jesus described as “outer darkness where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.”
Indeed, more than 40 percent of all Jesus’ sayings in the Synoptic Gospels contain a warning regarding God’s judgment of those who do not receive Jesus and his message, including most of Jesus’ parables. The Lord’s Prayer is first and foremost a prayer that God would supernaturally break into the world to end all human rebellion against his will.
Of course, all these elements of Jesus’ teaching are repeatedly affirmed in the apostolic witness to Christ throughout the New Testament scriptures. There is no New Testament writer who thinks otherwise. If there is no afterlife, then not even Jesus in any non-metaphorical sense is alive. His memory lives on, but that is all.
Jones claims that belief in an afterlife is “faith driven by…selfish[ness]” from Christians. Jesus and the apostles who witnessed to him viewed it as incentive for doing what is right and a warning to those tempted to do wrong. Yet the apostle Paul wrote that if Christ has not been raised and there is no future resurrection from the dead for those who belong to him, then his proclamation is “empty” because he and his co-ministers have been “false testifiers about God.”
Moreover, in that case his converts’ faith would be “empty” because “you are still in your sins,” with sin through death having the last word. Clearly Christianity teaches in an afterlife. Major Heresy 4: God’s Omnipotence and Omniscience
Jesus and his apostles believed in an awesome God who created all there is with a mere thought and word, and who in the blink of an eye can destroy it all. They believed in a God who had a plan for his creation and who, though allowing for a significant degree of human choice, could work for good in all things.
Yes, God is sometimes viewed as bargaining and “changing his mind” in particular cases for particular people. Yet that God is, overall, both omnipotent and omniscient is not seriously doubted. So Jesus could exclaim, “With God all things are possible” (Mark 10:27). In the end God will triumph utterly and completely over sin and death, restore his creation, and save the maximum number of people possible to his greater honor and glory.
Jones takes a very different approach: “I don’t worship an all-powerful, all-controlling omnipotent, omniscient being. That is a fabrication of Roman juridical theory and Greek mythology.” She’s right there. She doesn’t worship an omnipotent and omniscient God. She worships a false god of her own making, a mere projection of her ideological prejudices. One wonders whether Jones has read the Book of Job recently when God reminds Job that he had no need for Job’s advice when he measured the cosmos. Major Heresy 5: The Virgin Birth
One could quibble whether this constitutes a “major” heresy. Arguably, it is not on the same level as denying Christ’s atoning death and resurrection or essential traits of God. Only two of the four gospels record it (nowhere else in the New Testament), and the author of one of these, Luke, doesn’t mention it among the conversion speeches in his second volume, Acts. The doctrine of the virgin birth does not arise out of some belief in the sinfulness of sex, nor from some felt need to oppress women.
It is strange that the NYT article should lead with a reference to this heresy (“Reverend, You Say the Virgin Birth Is ‘a Bizarre Claim’?”). Even so, Matthew and Luke do narrate that Jesus was born of a virgin. It is a part of Scripture.
Jones opines: “I find the virgin birth a bizarre claim. . . . The virgin birth only becomes important if you have a theology in which sexuality is considered sinful. It also promotes this notion that the pure, untouched female body is the best body, and that idea has led to centuries of oppressing women.”
The doctrine of the virgin birth does not arise out of some belief in the sinfulness of sex, nor from some felt need to oppress women. Mary sees it as a sign of God elevating the lowly and oppressed, as well as giving her great favor (so the Magnificat in Luke 1:46-55). The doctrine presents Jesus as having divine origin and as sinless, able thus to atone for the sins of others. It also demonstrates that Jesus is not merely human, as he could have otherwise not existed without his mother having had sex.
These heresies are just the heresies contained in the Kristoff interview. For example, she appears elsewhere (h/t Al Mohler) to dismiss the doctrine of the incarnation and to treat Jesus as God’s Son only in the sense that “in Jesus, divine love was fully present in a way that ordinary human beings rarely, if ever, experience and embody.” Does Jones Believe Anything?
Of course she does, you silly person. Can you guess what that is? You guessed it: Love. She says that the “empty tomb symbolizes that the ultimate love in our lives cannot be crucified and killed,” even though she has no confidence that Jesus was actually raised from the dead. It’s all a metaphor. “What happens on Easter is the triumph of love in the midst of suffering. Isn’t that reason for hope?” That and a couple of dollars will get you a good Hallmark card.
Well, no, not if Jesus deceived his disciples about his resurrection and the disciples remained deluded. “For me, the message of Easter is that love is stronger than life or death,” Jones says. “For me, living a life of love is driven by the simple fact that love is true.”
That and a couple of dollars will get you a good Hallmark card. Here’s another platitude: “After all, tomorrow is another day,” as one movie epic from generations past disappointingly concluded. Without dismissing the critical importance of love (and, more importantly, that God is love rather than that love is God), Christianity is based on something a bit more substantial.
Christianity is based on a belief that God intervenes in the act of creation, then in redemption of fallen creation, and finally in recreation of heaven and earth. God does so by concrete, world-encompassing acts in history and beyond, through his Son. That is what Jesus and the entire apostolic witness to him believed. Yet Jones knows better.
In the course of the interview Kristoff asks Jones, “Am I a Christian?” Jones’s response is ironic: “Well, you sound an awful lot like me, and I’m a Christian minister.” Now how in God’s holy name can you claim to be a Christian, let alone a Christian minister, while denying one essential element after another of Jesus’ own life and teaching? Either Jesus is a liar or she is.

"For All Jews, The Shooting At Poway Chabad Hits Too Close To Home",thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/jews-shooting-poway-chabad-hits-close-home/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein April 30, 2019
There’s nothing quite like logging onto Twitter on a Saturday night after spending the day with family and learning that there’s been another synagogue shooting. Momentarily, you forget to breathe. Then you find yourself thinking about the dead and the injured with a knot in your stomach.
Sixty-year-old Lori Gilbert Kaye should still be here. Her 22-year-old daughter should still have her mother, who was in synagogue honoring the memory of her own deceased mother. And Lori Gilbert Kaye’s husband should not be a widower. I can’t even imagine him realizing that he’d been called to perform CPR on his own wife. What a horror.
In a six-month period, American Jews have sustained two deadly attacks. This time it was a gunman at a San Diego-area synagogue, Chabad of Poway. He injured three exactly six months after the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Wanting to connect with members of their religious community and the Almighty, Jews have gathered in their local houses of worship to pray after these attacks. What should have been standard outings on two Saturday mornings have instead become historical moments of mourning. And the Jewish community does mourn, even though we may never have met any of the 12 victims in Pittsburgh and Poway, because they’re members of our extended Jewish family.
The shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, which took the lives of 11 American Jews, was shocking. That another deadly attack happened on the six-month anniversary of that attack is almost unbelievable.
Growing up in New York in the 1980s and ‘90s, I was proud to be Jewish and felt totally at home. I heard stories about anti-Semitism my family had experienced, but it all felt like ancient history. My grandfather and his brother applied to work at the local power company for kicks, knowing that institutional anti-Semitism would automatically disqualify them.
As a child, my father was chased home in his Brooklyn neighborhood by boys shouting he was a Christ-killer. When it came time to apply to college, my father didn’t bother applying to schools like Princeton and Yale, which were still known to be limiting their Jewish student populations.
It wasn’t until high school that I started encountering anti-Semitism myself. A non-Jewish classmate confused me by tossing a quarter on the floor. When I asked why, he said he was testing whether I’d dive for it. So me sitting still apparently confused him right back.
More widely contentious was the reaction of my classmates during a discussion of the Crown Heights riots, which caused fraught divisions among Jewish and African-American friends. And then I’ll never forget the Californian from a summer program who asked me to tell him about the worldwide Jewish conspiracy, promising to hold all juicy details in confidence. That was the end of that crush.
All of those things felt fairly fleeting, though. I never felt like I had to hide my Jewish identity. And while we had police at our synagogue for every High Holiday, it was about making sure that the surge of attendees was able to safely cross busy streets by our suburban synagogue.
I wish I could say that my children will know that same safe, philo-Semitic America. Increasingly, though, I don’t believe they will. For starters, security became de rigeur at so many Jewish institutions after 9/11. It became normal to have security that Americans who attend churches or use preschools affiliated with other religions would likely find foreign. Sadly, that security is necessary, as these attacks have shown.
Parenting is many things, including the art of managing many worries about one’s children. New ones are rapidly being added to that existing list. I was already grappling with how to best raise children who are knowledgeable and proud of their Judaism in a nation where we are a tiny minority. Now, I also worry about my children’s safety, while they pray and learn about the religion of our ancestors. What am I supposed to tell my young children about this turn of events without terrifying them?
This is not a way to raise a family. Or rather, it’s not a way I ever anticipated and definitely not one that I prefer. Of course, even as I write this, I imagine that if my grandparents and great-grandparents were still here, they’d nod knowingly. They might tell me the outlier has been my American experience, and that realistically, Jews have always raised children amidst the fear and uncertainty of deadly anti-Semitism.

"Yes, Teachers Are Raising Many People’s Kids, But They Shouldn’t Be",thefederalist.com,Anna Zeigler,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/yes-teachers-raising-many-peoples-kids-shouldnt/,"By Anna Zeigler April 30, 2019
Democratic Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris recently tweeted about a plan to raise teacher pay from the federal level: “ I often get asked ‘how can we afford this’ — but my question is: how can we afford NOT to give our teachers a raise? They’re raising our children. Don’t they deserve our respect? Don’t they deserve to get paid their value?”
We should all shiver when a U.S. senator proclaims that teachers are raising our children. This should profoundly bother us, yet her words were just a blip in the news. Unfortunately, in far too many instances teachers are raising America’s children, or they are at least attempting to do so. Teachers should not be faulted for their efforts, and in fact a desire to nurture leads many to the teaching profession, but there are significant reasons to ensure the line between teacher and parent remains distinct.
While I am not usually one to harp on pronoun usage, Harris’s use of the collective pronoun our for children ought to be a red flag. Children are not collective property to be raised by an unfeeling state. The God-designed family ought to be honored and supported by all who hope for a better America.
No matter how caring the teachers they hire are, government-funded schools cannot and should not attempt to pick up the slack for mom and dad. It not only costs too much, it is an impossible task. It will cost us tremendously in the many ways it will tear at the fabric of this nation.
In all the education-focused dialogue exchanged in this country, too few are willing to state the obvious: Some of educators’ top complaints are situations that are unlikely to improve unless and until mom and dad become more involved with their kids. Too many parents are allowing the state to step in and do their job, and this happens at least in part because the state is a willing enabler.
Understandably frustrated teachers turn to the government for help when the source of at least some of their frustration is a lack of support from home, and disinterested parents are not a recent trend . Common teacher complaints include students with poor hygiene , students who get no help with their homework, students who only eat when they are at school , and students whose behavior needs to be addressed either with medication they do not take regularly or with discipline that parents withhold.
Family psychologist John Rosemond summarizes the perfect storm raging in America’s public schools : “The problem consists of equal parts irresponsible parenting (not confined to any given demographic), parents who make excuses for brats they send to school (just another form of irresponsible parenting), teacher unions that have been given legal power to game the system, federal aid to education (long outlived its usefulness), and administrators who strip teachers of permission to discipline and then discipline teachers who have the temerity to do so.”
“Feeding a child is the fundamental duty of a parent,” notes Teresa Mull . Ronald Reagan once said, “All great change in America begins at the dinner table.” There is a great deal to consider when contemplating shifting the burden of providing a child’s sustenance from parents to the government.
Mull discusses some of the long-term emotional benefits of a government that encourages parents to meet their responsibilities rather than assuming another government program is the answer: “Parents would also be reminded of the pride and joy that comes from providing for one’s family, and they need to know that bonding with a child at the grocery store and the dinner table is a thousand times better for his or her development than any government-subsidized meal could ever be.”
It is one thing to need a few more textbooks or some extra paper. It is another matter when you seek money to feed children who are not fed at home, to assist children whose parents haven’t addressed their basic hygene, or to employ an army of counselors and therapists in an attempt to meet the psychological needs of students whose parents are physically or emotionally AWOL.
Are these things taxpayers should be supporting via the money budgeted for education? Are we not encouraging a dereliction of parental duty by spending more money and creating more programs that have little to do with education and everything to do with the government happily inserting itself into what ought to be private family matters?
Many teachers cannot teach as effectively as they otherwise might because they are physically and emotionally being drained attempting to fulfill their dual roles as mother and teacher. It is an untenable situation, a cycle fostered by a handful of parents who either cannot or will not fulfill their duties coupled with the pervasive but erroneous idea that it is normal, healthy, and fiscally possible for a child’s every need to be met by a publicly funded school system.
I believe a nation can withstand and possibly turn the tide against an intrusive government if its families remain strong and intact. There are reasons power-hungry regimes seek to destroy the family, to loosen the natural familial bonds and find government substitutes for mothers and fathers.
We are not yet at the stage George Orwell described in “1984”: “The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.” But we continue to take unwise steps toward a future in which the government is involved in child-rearing in unprecedented ways.
The individual family unit is the source from which any strong and functional nation derives its leaders and its stability. Continuing to unthinkingly funnel money into programs that allow for and even encourage parental absenteeism is undermining both the families and education for all school children, for even those students with attentive parents are certainly hurt by the strain placed on teachers attempting to not only teach but to simultaneously meet the physical, nutritional, and emotional needs of some students.
Teachers should be teaching. We can debate teacher pay, but the notion that we need to give teachers a raise because they are “raising our children” ought to raise eyebrows. Raising children is not an endeavor on which you could ever put a price, nor is it an endeavor schools ought to be undertaking at the taxpayers’ expense.

It’s Getting Difficult To Tell The Difference Between The New York Times And Al Jazeera,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/01/getting-difficult-tell-difference-new-york-times-al-jazeera/,"By David Harsanyi May 1, 2019
It’s hard not to laugh reading The New York Times coverage of the Trump administration’s efforts to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. The three-person-bylined article kicks off by describing the group as a “storied and influential Islamist political movement with millions of members across the Middle East.”
Sounds like a global social club! Just some folks batting around ideas. The authors didn’t even have the decency to throw in a superficial adjective like “controversial” to create a veneer of balance.
Whether the Muslim Brotherhood’s many disparate groups and organizations meet the criteria of a single terror organization under U.S. law is debatable, but what isn’t debatable is that a large faction of the Muslim Brotherhood leads a Sunni movement that aims to implement sharia law under a global caliphate. Its deep network of “charitable” institutions and political parties form an infrastructure for extremist causes.
One could, if not a New York Times writer, describe its philosophy as dogmatic, illiberal, theocratic, and violent; and its “storied” history a long-term threat to secularism, Muslim reformers, liberalism, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East. These days, members of the Muslim Brotherhood advocate for child suicide bombings , political assassinations , mass murder of minorities , violent mobs —basically the entire deadly menu of jihadist activities.
This is context that Times readers would not learn. Nor would they learn that the Muslim Brotherhood helped birth modern Islamic extremism, first to undermine nationalistic Arabic governments, but later moving onto bigger goals. Readers would not learn that Muslim Brotherhood’s spurred the creation of al-Qaeda or that its intellectual founder, Sayyid Qutb, was an inspiration to Osama bin Laden.
Zachary Laub of the Council on Foreign Relations once noted that Qutb’s writings “provided the intellectual and theological underpinnings for many militant Sunni Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda and Hamas.” It would have been easy to include such a quote.
Also not mentioned in the Times’s article is that in 2001, the U.S. government designated the Muslim Brotherhood’s Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, then the largest Muslim charity in the country, a “Global Terrorist” group, whose employees would later be found guilty of funneling millions to terrorists groups . We have already treated Muslim Brotherhood affiliates as terrorists.
Also, one of the Muslim Brotherhood’s most successful offshoots, Hamas— designated a terror group by the State Department in 1997— still runs a mini-terror state in Gaza that not only undercuts any chance of the peace in the region, and not only oppresses its own people with theocratic strictures and fascistic rule , but is also responsible for the murder of American citizens .
Those meanies in the Trump administration, though.
“American humanitarian organizations with links to the group,” the Times informs us, are concerned that Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who deposed Mohamed Morsi, “Egypt’s first democratically elected president,” will expand his power. It’s a popular, but absurd, notion that elected leaders can’t be illiberal. Morsi was a disaster for Egypt and the Middle East and freedom. And, no doubt, it’s an ugly, ethically precarious scene in the Middle East. But the fact is, we deal with plenty of bad guys to fight even worse ones.
The irony of all this is that The New York Times has a deeply ingrained antagonism towards one of the good guys. And it’s when the Times turns to the administration’s morally unambiguous designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization that we get a true taste of its hostility.
This “novel” move by the Trump administration, we’re told, “prompted alarm among American military, intelligence and diplomatic professionals.” After eight years of institutional coddling the Islamic Republic—and cheerleading from the Times opinion and news pages—the Trump administration moved to designate the Revolutionary Guard, which runs the nation’s ballistic missile program, military aspects of its (supposedly nonexistent) nuclear program, and large parts of its statist economy, to make it easier to implement more sanctions. Yet here’s what the Times deems the problem with this arrangement:
The potential problems included creating a need to grant huge numbers of visa waivers for Iraqi officials who interact with the Iranian military agency; raising the question of whether American officials should start denying visas to members of other countries’ intelligence services that use violence , including Israel, Pakistan and Russia; and risking retaliation against American troops and intelligence officials.
(Incredulous bolding mine.)
Who raised these questions? They don’t say. One wonders what kind of “American official” would make a moral equivalence between Israeli intelligence, an American ally who has engaged in a war against terrorism and existential threats for 70 years, with a military dictatorship and quasi-authoritarian—“democratically elected”!—foe of the United States?
For that matter, what kind of American official would liken the work of Israeli intelligence to that of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, a group that has helped carry out terror attacks against civilians on every continent, funded and trained terrorist proxies that destabilize entire regions, and acted as the Stasi against its own people? (Well, like the Stasi if the Stasi had been run by a fanatical religious Mafia family.)
Does anyone in the State Department really believe that handing out visas to those associated with the Revolutionary Guard, which was involved in killing 608 American troops in Iraq between 2003-2011, is in any way analogous to working with a close ally?
Journalists often speak through proxies who “raise” convenient questions. In addition to the entrenched bias at most major media outlets, Washington now teems with Qatari money and allies, who flood cable news and think tanks and op-ed pages. Their alleged expertise is used to run interference for the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran, and to smear Israel.
Now, on the latter issue, The New York Times hasn’t needed much prodding over the decades. These days, though, it’s getting increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the newspaper of record and Qatari-state-run al Jazeera."
Lawyers Say They’d Report A Client For Legally Owning A Gun,thefederalist.com,Rebecca Kathryn Jude,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/02/ethics-seminar-lawyers-say-theyd-report-client-legally-owning-gun/,"By Rebecca Kathryn Jude and Chauncey M. DePree, Jr. May 2, 2019
If your lawyer believes that having a firearm license defines you as dangerous, you may be at risk of losing your Second Amendment rights and even your freedom. You may not know about his belief or recognize the risk until it is too late.
I can almost hear you saying, “My attorney is my advocate. What are you talking about? That could never happen!” You are wrong.
Lawyers are required to attend continuing legal education. During a recent ethics seminar, “The ‘Perfect’ Match: Selecting Clients for Successful Representation (Ethics),” Adam Kilgore, general counsel for the Mississippi Bar, offered the following hypothetical to a group of experienced civil and criminal lawyers.
A man has been fired from his job. He is upset. He hires you as his attorney. You are of the opinion he has an excellent case and file a complaint on his behalf. You later discover he possesses a permit to carry a firearm. He also has a so-called enhanced carry license. While his case is wending through the courts, your client goes to a public area outside his former workplace. He displays signs that say he has been wrongfully fired. The man has no history of criminal activity, violence, or threatening anyone.
The instructor asked the class what actions, if any, a lawyer should take. It seemed obvious to me there was no reason to do anything except proceed with the client’s case. I (Jude) would also advise my client to avoid confrontations with anyone who worked for his former employer and what he might consider saying if approached by the media.
While I was forming an answer, many lawyers immediately said they would terminate the attorney-client relationship and contact law enforcement to report their client was potentially dangerous. The only reason offered was his firearm permits.
I have to admit, I was flabbergasted, for several reasons. First, I live in Mississippi, which is among the reddest of the red states. Second, the attorneys—let me call them gun-phobic — were proposing to violate the attorney-client privilege, which establishes one of the most sacrosanct confidential relationships. (American Bar Association “Rule of Professional Conduct” 1.6). As with most things, there are exceptions. They generally pertain to a client who is about to commit a criminal act or engage in fraudulent behavior.
The lawyers who proposed to call the police cited ABA Rule 1.6 (b)(1). It states “[a] lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary: … to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.”
I have no problem with the rule, if there is reliable evidence to believe a client is about to kill or injure someone. The question is whether there is sufficient reliable evidence to justify firing a client and reporting him to the police—a serious decision with significant consequences.
Evidence is facts, not conjecture, speculation, or supposition. The only fact addressed by attorneys who advocated reporting the client to police was the lawfully issued gun permits. It did not matter that he lawfully owned a firearm, or had a firearm permit, including an enhanced carry permit. He had met significant background and training criteria. He does not have anything in his background that would prevent him from owning a firearm or possessing a permit, including a history of criminal activity, violence, or mental illness.
Gun-phobic attorneys focused on the fact the client owned a gun and had firearm permits. In their opinion, that was enough to label him as reasonably certain to cause death or serious bodily harm and report him to the police.
No one claimed there was anything legally improper about being upset with a former employer. Hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit is a pretty good indicator of being upset. It is what you would expect from a law-abiding citizen, not a dangerous person. The gun-phobic attorneys acknowledged, in response to a question by the instructor, that displaying non-threatening signs in a public area is lawful, and is likely protected by the First Amendment.
Here’s what I found truly amazing. We are attorneys! We take evidence seriously. We study evidence in law school. Knowledge of evidence is tested on bar examinations. We would be appalled at the thought that a judge might permit our clients to be jailed based on conjecture.
If gun-phobic attorneys like this have their way, there may be truly terrifying consequences. They would punish an American citizen who had done absolutely nothing wrong. Because the lawyer claims his client is reasonably certain to cause death or serious bodily harm, the police would have little choice but to take action, up to and including arrest.
A lawyer’s claim that his client is dangerous is substantially identical to the judicial standard for psychiatric detention. Under these circumstances, the client might be held for a mental evaluation. Even if ultimately cleared, this citizen would be publicly (and permanently on the internet) labeled as “dangerous.”
The adverse consequences have just begun. After being fired by an attorney, reported to the police as likely to injure or kill, arrested and held for psychiatric evaluation, what would happen to the client’s lawsuit? He would face the almost insurmountable burden of finding a new lawyer. How many attorneys would accept a case where a client has been fired by his previous attorney and arrested based on his attorney’s opinion that he is dangerous?
Congress may pass laws to limit our ability to possess firearms. Courts may interpret existing laws to limit our ability to possess firearms. They are obvious threats. What we don’t expect is the insidious, hidden threat from an attorney who does not believe in our Second Amendment rights and who takes action on the belief that he needs to protect the public from us.

"Investigation Time Is Over, Democrats. Impeach Or Shut Up",thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/02/investigation-time-democrats-impeach-shut/,"By Adam Mill May 2, 2019
Elizabeth Drew, a journalist who covered Watergate, recently wrote a sleep-inducing New York Times lecture on her moral superiority over a president too boorish to be allowed to complete his constitutional term. It’s representative of what we’ve heard for two years from those who couldn’t abide the results of the 2016 election.
“The president and his allies argue that the country is ‘tired’ of investigations,” Drew sniffed, dismissing those arguments as “sounding very much like Nixon…as if that were the definitive criterion for deciding whether to proceed with a constitutional responsibility” and “Some Democrats continue to fear Mr. Trump…that his skill at…assigning humiliating nicknames…could end in their failure to win an impeachment fight. Some also doubt, with reason, their party’s capacity for handling the matter skillfully.”
Just in case you missed it, Drew placed scare quotes around “tired” to reinforce her disdain for anyone claiming fatigue from two years of fruitless investigations into the president. For a Trump administration that has attempted to prove the president’s innocence by producing more than 1 million pages of documents and partially waiving executive privilege to allow the special counsel broad access to the president’s most privileged conversations, enough is enough.
The president’s openness was rewarded by a steady drip, drip, drip of leaks of information entrusted to the special counsel ending up twisted into the mainstream media’s relentless public relations assault on the president. This is made worse by the fact that Robert Mueller team promptly contradicted a few of the most outrageous lies against the president, leaving an implied endorsement of all the rest.
For nearly two years, we’ve suffered elitist fools cheerleading Mueller’s lawless assault on the rule of law . And for so many months, the president was cautioned that he must endure the unendurable lest the Democrats impeach him ( here , here , here , here , here , and here ).
As reported by Newsweek, the White House counsel’s decision to allow the special counsel unprecedented access to privileged communication “came with the approval of Trump, whose legal team advised him to go with ‘an open-book strategy’ as the president insisted he had nothing to hide. They reportedly believed this would be the fastest way to wrap up the investigation.”
Only a guilty man would object to an investigation, right ? Tell that to Roger Stone , George Papadopoulos , and Michael Flynn , men guilty of nothing until the Mueller process crime machine caught them in its gears.
One commentator claimed that the Trump legal team negotiated a conditional waiver of executive privilege in exchange for giving Mueller access to White House counsel Don McGahn. The deal was that Mueller could talk to McGahn, but the contents would never leave the executive branch, meaning it would not be introduced into Mueller’s final report.
If true, Mueller violated the agreement by including the testimony in the report. But it wouldn’t have mattered, because people familiar with McGahn’s testimony destroyed any chance of preserving any promised confidentiality back in January 2018 by leaking to The New York Times.
Something happened after Mueller report. Warnings of impeachment have lost their power. The president said what millions of Americans were thinking: “ Enough !” Cue thunderous applause of Americans in living rooms across America.
“It’s enough…we’re fighting all the subpoenas,” of House Democrats in their investigations, Trump said. “Look, these aren’t like impartial people…They’re trying to win 2020 and the only way they think they can luck-out is by relentlessly attacking me.” But, but, Mr. President, the Democrats might impeach you!
The Democrats have the House. Passing articles of impeachment requires a simple majority, which Democrats can easily muster without a single Republican vote. There’s no burden of proof, and they can do so with a nakedly partisan show of force.
We can be spared further debate in the media whether the Mueller report shows obstruction of justice (it doesn’t). Democrats have the support of 66 percent of their electorate, who ferociously demand that the president be impeached.
So do it. Impeach or shut up. Investigation time is over. We’ve heard all of that talk about the president “obstructing justice,” emoluments, refusing to turn over his tax returns, and now an outright refusal to cooperate in future investigations. There’s no need for further investigation.
Drew said as much, amazingly telling Democrats not to worry about the absence of proof of actual crimes, writing, “It’s of course politically easier to go after a president for having committed a crime — for example, perjury, for which President Bill Clinton was ostensibly impeached.” As I’ve written so frequently before , we’ve all learned the only rule of Trump-era law is that if it helps get Trump, then it must be legal.
Well, Drew, better tell the House Democrats to hurry. Primary season starts in January. After that, voters will have the opportunity to decide whether to first nominate Donald Trump, and then whether to reelect him. If Democrats don’t impeach before then, he will have a mandate to mock and block these investigations.
But there won’t be a trial in the Senate. The Get Trump crowd can’t win a fair fight. They can’t put up the goods when called upon to do so. Proof: how many criminal trials resulted from the army of prosecutors and investigators Mueller deployed? Answer: Just one, for Paul Manafort. And it wasn’t pretty.
Line federal prosecutors who do their talking in the courtroom convict at about a 90 percent rate in trials before a jury. In contrast, the Mueller political hit squad fumbled their only evidentiary trial in front of a sympathetic DC-area jury.
The jury was confused . The prosecutors had a chart that kept track of how their hundreds of exhibits matched to the charges. But the bumbling political hacks forgot to introduce this essential tool to the jury during the trial. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 charges prosecutors piled onto Manafort.
By the way, none of the charges had anything to do with President Trump. Unlimited budgets and unlimited manpower cannot overcome the incompetence that attends unlimited ego.
Democrats won’t impeach Trump because then the president would get his day in court in the form of a trial in the Senate, and he would easily win it. So when they threaten to impeach, call the bluff. Here is what you say to anyone berating, bemoaning, or rehashing all of that monotonous carping about why he should be impeached: “Fine, do it. Put up or shut up.” Adam Mill is a pen name.

Democratic Socialists And Communists Rally On International Workers’ Day,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/02/democratic-socialists-communists-rally-international-workers-day/,"May 2, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
May 1st, also known as May Day or International Workers’ Day, brings the labor movement—socialists, communists, union people, and others—together in solidarity for the plight of workers everywhere. This informal and unrecognized international celebration has something for everyone on the Left. In South Carolina on Wednesday, 10,000 public educators marched on the state’s capital on Wednesday, while in Washington D.C., about 50 activists gathered at a local park.
May Day’s origins harken back to the 1886 Haymarket riots in Chicago, where police officers and civilians were killed during a labor rally. Decades later, European socialists and communists adopted May 1st as the day for workers’ struggle, but also as a propaganda tool to prop up their totalitarian rule.
Now, every year, demonstrations are held around the world to advocate for various workers’ rights, which can include anything from raising the minimum wage to calling for a radical overhaul of the economy and means of production. While teachers in South Carolina were demanding smaller class sizes and higher pay, D.C. organizations at plastic tables in Meridian Hill Park discussed abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) and Marxism.

Michael Golash, May Day festival attendee, said he has been a May Day organizer in D.C. for decades, and noted the evolution of impetus behind the informal holiday over time.
“In the 1930s, May Day protests focused on the fight over the Scottsboro Boys … and later focused on the fight against fascism,” he said. “Some of the largest May Day marches in the 1980s were in South Africa where people took to the streets to end apartheid.”
2020 Democratic candidates also got in on the May Day action, tweeting out their support of the teacher protests and International Workers’ Day. I stand with South Carolina teachers who are walking out for fairer pay, smaller classroom sizes, duty-free break time and full funding of the state’s promises to students. We need to treat educators with respect and dignity. #AllOutMay1 https://t.co/K8RpgUarw9

But on the same day that organizers gathered in the capital of the wealthiest and freest nation in the world to celebrate socialism, Venezuelans protested food shortages, electricity cuts, and political violence under their socialist leader President Nicolás Maduro. When I asked attendees of the International Workers’ Day festival in D.C. how they reconciled their beliefs with the crisis in Venezuela, the focus always shifted away from the country’s failed socialist policies to the issue of U.S. intervention.
Members of a local chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America (who asked not to be named) concluded that socialism is “always a work in progress,” and that most of the opposition to policies in Venezuela is stemming from Venezuelan-Americans who fled the country.
Golash, 76, suggested that the failure in Venezuela is due to falling oil prices. “The socialist experiment in Venezuela was to try to figure out a way to collaborate with capitalists. So Chevez—as along as the price of oil is very high, they were able to get a lot of revenue.”
Other groups in attendance included Iranian-Americans with posters displaying the faces of political prisoners in Iran, and Sanctuary DMV , a volunteer group that works with migrants and illegal immigrants.
While communist and socialist regimes continue to oppress workers and entire nations to this day in places like China, Russia, North Korea, and Venezuela, free nations share May Day as a politically expedient day of protest for any cause on the Left. Whether you’re a socialist, communist, unionized teacher, totalitarian dictator, or running for president of the United States, International Workers’ Day has evolved over time into a holiday available for the popular political issue of the day.

Netflix’s ‘Knock Down The House’ Is A Campaign Contribution To AOC,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/netflixs-knock-down-the-house-is-a-campaign-contribution-to-aoc/,"By David Marcus May 3, 2019
This year streaming giant Netflix purchased the rights to the documentary “Knock Down the House,” conceived and created by Rachel Lears, for $10 million. The film follows four women running outsider far-left campaigns for Congress in the 2018 cycle.
The most notable of these women is current New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has become a household name and one of the most prominent Democrat members of the House. Netflix is now streaming a documentary that feels like a love letter to AOC. In fact, what it feels like even more is a political ad.
But you don’t have to take my word for it, just look at this tweet from Justice Democrats, the progressive PAC that was behind Ocasio-Cortez’s shocking underdog victory. If you were inspired by @knockdownmovie make sure to chip in a few bucks to support the work that goes on behind-the-scenes to support grassroots candidates like AOC.
We’re a small-dollar funded organization and are grateful for the support! https://t.co/ygOeBfmZaw
— Justice Democrats (@justicedems) May 2, 2019
Clearly Justice Democrats think the documentary is complimentary and glowing enough that they can use it to raise money for AOC and other far-left candidates. This makes a lot of sense since, according to a Vanity Fair profile of Lears last year, Justice Democrats was one of the organizations she went to in order to find the women candidates she would follow to speak truth to Donald Trump’s power.
Lears is quite candid that the film was conceived as a reaction to Trump’s election and as a way to highlight those who oppose him. This is not an objective examination of interesting subjects, but a product meant to promote these politicians and their messages. In this sense, both Lears, who raised $28,000 to fund the project, and Netflix, which paid $10 million for it, are contributing to the political fortunes of both Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats.
To be clear, this kind of contribution to a candidate is perfectly legal. The Supreme Court has been clear on this point, most recently in its Citizens United decision. An unkind movie about Hillary Clinton violated the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, also known as the McCain-Feingold Act, caused that Supreme Court case in the first place. The court rightfully found that the government has no place stopping corporate entities from airing movies about political candidates.
The Supreme Court made the right decision, but of course that isn’t exactly how far-left Democrats look at it. No, they like to tell us, as often as possible, that corporate influence in our politics is a great scourge on our nation. However, the last time I checked, Netflix is itself a big ol’ corporation. Besides “Knock Down the House” Netflix is producing a series curated by Barack and Michelle Obama. So what gives?
Media and entertainment have always been a carve-out progressives use to approve of political corporate messaging they deem acceptable. Presumably, this is because it so often mirrors their own political ideologies and priorities. But if Netflix is and should be free to spend $10 million on “Knock Down the House” and offer it to millions of subscribers, why shouldn’t Citizens United be allowed to spend money to air a movie about Hillary Clinton?
It might be argued that Netflix is making these programming decisions based purely upon a profit motive and without a political purpose. This is almost impossible to really know, just as we don’t know exactly why social media companies disproportionately punish conservative accounts for supposedly violating their rules. But even if clicks were all Netflix cared about, it doesn’t matter. All kinds of corporate money in political messaging is spent based on a profit motive. A corporation might want lower taxes, or less regulation, or more regulation on competitors, so they support candidates and parties that align with their interest.
If Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats really believe corporations spending millions of dollars to push political ideas is a bad thing, they should condemn Netflix’s contribution to their political efforts, not use it to raise more coins for their coffers. But they don’t really believe that. They don’t really believe that corporations don’t have speech rights because they aren’t persons. They know that theater companies, universities, and Planned Parenthood, which are all corporations, have First Amendment rights. They just don’t like it when conservatives exercise those rights.
Netflix is every bit as much a corporation as any other corporation. And in streaming “Knock Down the House” it is clearly and decidedly benefiting the Justice Democrats’ political ambitions. That’s fine. They can do what they please. But the next time a conservative corporation wants to air a political ad or engage in political messaging, let’s not hear that big, moneyed interests should stay out of politics.

Do Androids Dream Of Humanity And Empathy?,thefederalist.com,Clay Waters,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/do-androids-dream-of-humanity-and-empathy/,"By Clay Waters May 3, 2019
Today I Am Carey is the debut novel of Martin L. Shoemaker, an expansion of his award-winning science-fiction short story “Today I Am Paul,” a warm tale about an android that mysteriously gains self-awareness as he assists a family dealing with an elderly grandmother suffering Alzheimer’s.
In the short story set in the near future, the family employs an android outfitted with new technologies of empathy and emulation, which enables it to play along with Mildred’s shifting, unpredictable memories. The android is able to change its features to emulate any members of the family that Mildred imagines she sees. It emulates her son Paul for most of the story, which explains the title.
After a tragedy, the android is accepted as part of the family and keeps the bonds of family memory alive by emulating the deceased Mildred, for the benefit of the granddaughter Millie. The optimistic, un-dystopian feel is refreshing, and the last line is lovely.
Unfortunately, the concept is stretched to novel length—65 chapters, all a variation of “Today I Am…”— and the results lean toward the sappy.
The “soft” science fiction of Today I Am Carey marks a change of pace for Baen Books, which tends toward military sci-fi (and is shunned by left-wing fandom for being the home of authors like John Ringo and Larry Correia). Carey is a hopeful domestic drama in the wistful, if sometimes overripe, tradition of Ray Bradbury.
The novel is delivered in the form of an internal journal, a literal day in the life from the caretaker android’s point of view, who early on is named “Carey” by Millie. Carey spends the novel puzzling out what has made him (Carey comes off as male) break his programming and display genuine sensitivity and kindness and above all, self-awareness.
As he tells Dr. Zinta Jansons, a.k.a. “Mom,” at the android lab, “somewhere in the interaction of those nets, ‘I’ engaged.” The science of Carey’s emergence as a personality of his own involves something about quantum entanglement that author Shoemaker perhaps wisely keeps vague, so Carey remains a mostly unexplained anomaly.
Family members grow up, get married, get old, and die, while Carey gets upgraded and becomes mildly obsolete, making for poignant asymmetry. The ravages of Alzheimer’s are portrayed honestly, with one character haunted by the genetic markers that show she will likely inherit the disease. Along the way, Carey performs a heroic rescue, makes sock monkeys for Millie, and puts on a juggling act.
Questions crop up about what makes us human: Can an android truly be kind, or is it just emulating kindness, and is there a difference in the end?
But the story doesn’t delve deeper. Potentially touchy subjects (do androids have souls? can they be “human” in a legal sense?) are not broached, as Carey’s journey to humanity is safely buffeted by well-meaning humans—too well-meaning to generate dramatic tension. And too obvious. When Carey befriends a former circus performer at an assisted living community, he comes out and tells Carey: “You care, I can tell.”
One problem is that Carey isn’t becoming fully human. To participate in the human condition comes with all the attendant weaknesses and besetting sins of envy and sloth and lust and greed; all the crooked timber of humanity. Save a brief bout of justified anger during a trip to Belize, Carey remains a perfect angel throughout.
Every garden needs a snake to keep readers on their toes. But there are no snakes, and only a few mild muffled rattles (like the trip to Belize) serve as threats. Shoemaker’s style is overly soft and spongy, making Carey’s thoughts seem bland. My dark heart longed for a little bloody-mindedness.
In robotics there is an “uncanny valley” hypothesis, which argues that in the range between “Robbie the Robot” unrealism on one end, and a robot indistinguishable from a human on the other, people feel the most disquiet toward a robot who looks and move almost, but not quite like, humans do. Android Carey falls into his own uncanny valley: He’s too bland and generic to be a compelling character, but not sufficiently utilitarian and rational to convincingly convey android behavior.
As generations age and pass on, mostly off-screen, Carey remains the faithful family caretaker. It’s nice to know that the future elderly (i.e., people like me) will be treated with dignity and respect, and perhaps not mocked for being Fox News’ main demographic. Sincerity is evident in Shoemaker’s self-described labor of “love,” which the novel’s acknowledgment page reveals is based on heart-wrenching personal experience.
But Shoemaker is vague about what this near-future looks like and how it works, besides noting that cars aren’t driven by humans much anymore. I would have liked to learn more about this world and watch how it evolves through Carey’s eyes, which would ground the reader more firmly in Carey’s reality.
Then, out of nowhere, in the very last chapter, as Carey himself ages, Shoemaker pulls a rabbit out of the hat, as all the character strands come together almost magically, and the book suddenly achieves the poignancy it had been struggling to capture. So, was the trip worth it? If you’re not a hopeless cynic, it just might be."
Trump Should Stick To His Original Foreign Policy Instincts On Venezuela,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/trump-stick-original-foreign-policy-instincts-venezuela/,"By Sumantra Maitra May 3, 2019
When the bugle calls, Peter Hitchens once wrote, the conservative instinct is to rally around the tattered banner. Nowhere was it truer than the last few days, with Venezuela teetering on the brink of civil war. For all practical purposes, Juan Guaido, the suave Macronist liberal whom the West recognizes as the legitimate president of the oil-rich republic, was on the way to topple the Maduro dictatorship, flanked by dissident military men. But that didn’t work out.
What transpired since then is dodgy, but it appears the dissident military leaders and bureaucrats chickened out. In what looked like a replay of the failed coup attempt against Turkish despot Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the forces loyal to Maduro started to attack protesters. Foreign Policy reported that “the lack of any major military figures publicly casting their lot with the opposition should worry the opposition leader. He [Guaido] says he has military support behind the scenes, which could be critical to a democratic transition, but he has not produced solid evidence of it.”
The Atlantic confirmed the chaos, saying that “despite administration officials’ ominous mantra that ‘all options are on the table’ in Venezuela, they appear to have little appetite for taking military action,” adding that the Pentagon was not ordered to prepare for any military intervention. One Wrong Move Would Spell Chaos for Venezuela
This is by far the closest to an actual foreign policy crisis that Trump administration has faced yet. It is also the one for which a single misstep could cause total chaos. Naturally, there were prominent (and predictable) voices calling for an intervention. While Maduro is indeed a despotic ruler, we need to think hard before suggesting any further misadventure. Consider the questions one needs to ask before another military intervention, which will inevitably result in a regime change and a civil war.
First, what strategic interests are there for the United States in Venezuela? Venezuela is an oil-rich country, but it is also an economic basket case. There’s no unity in the political class, the military is pretty solidly behind Maduro, and no large-scale defections or popular uprisings are spontaneously happening that look likely to topple Maduro anytime soon. In fact, the regime is propped up by Cuban forces.
Consider the similarity to Iraq immediately post-intervention, and the entire Baathist military and bureaucracy disbanded and pushed underground, fueling insurgency with the support of Iran. In other words, a regime change is a recipe for insurgency and civil war.
Second, what are the intervention plans, and what about mission creep? Would we have an exit strategy and timeframe? There is, so far, no clear coherent plan adopted by the administration, nor is it even possible, because of the reasons mentioned above. Dictators often leave the country and retire with their millions, but that is when they see the situation is hopeless . In this case, the situation isn’t.
The same reason Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gadhafi chose to fight ’til the bitter end is the same reason Maduro would also not quit, and instead go down fighting a long civil war. He has no incentive to quit, and nowhere to retire with his millions. For good or for bad, he enjoys the support of almost half his country and most of his military forces, who would also go down with him but not before bogging Americans in another quagmire. There is naturally no short-term military solution to this conundrum. What Would We Do After Toppling Maduro?
The American military is, of course, fully capable of toppling Maduro and installing Guaido. But then what? At this point, there are no signs of large-scale military defection. Nor are there signs that the local powers, like Brazil and Colombia, are planning military action. This means toppling Maduro would require American armor and boots, a long civil war, and subsequent stabilization mission.
Our experience in regime change and nation-building in the last 15 years should give us pause. The only place where anti-Americanism is traditionally higher than the Middle East but remains dormant is in Latin America. As the entire continent organically and slowly moves right-wing, any heavy-handed approach would turn the clock back to its default Marxist radicalism.
The Monroe Doctrine is still active, and America is well within her rights to intervene if any other great power approaches and forms a base that can change the balance of power of the region. But 100 Russian military advisors don’t change the balance of power. It is not the Cuban missile crisis redux, and neither Russia nor China currently has any cross-continental power projection will or capability.
As Dan DePetris wrote recently , “The propensity in Washington on both sides of the aisle to take ownership of the Venezuela problem and fix it with an American-imposed solution must be tamped down in favor of the prudence and restraint so often thrown by the wayside. Emotion should not dictate policy.”
Venezuela is a humanitarian concern, not a strategic concern, a key difference that needs to be considered. It’s easy to sympathize and offer diplomatic support, aid, food, and even weapons. It’s entirely another thing to intervene militarily, and force regime change.
As I wrote before , the two local powers of Brazil and Colombia are the two most allied to the United States, and have conservative governments who oppose a Cuban satellite in Venezuela, and growing migration that is flooding their countries. If American diplomacy were really prudent and capable, they would buck-pass the intervention and security burden to local allies, and provide diplomatic and material support, but without any U.S. troop involvement. Let Brazil and Colombia topple Maduro and stabilize Venezuela, with America’s blessing—but without American guns.
John Quincy Adams said, “America is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will commend the general cause by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example.” President Trump would do well to remember that.
He stands within the cusp of history, of being the first American president in more than a quarter-century to not have started an open-ended and costly so-called humanitarian intervention. He should trust his original electoral instincts and aspire to make that his legacy. There are genuine areas of threats to focus on instead, especially in Europe and Asia. Venezuela, behind the buffers of Colombia and Brazil, is not an existential threat to the United States.​ Sumantra Maitra is a doctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK, and a writer for The Federalist.

State Democrats Revolt Against National Leaders' Abortion Extremism,thefederalist.com,Marjorie Dannenfelser,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/state-level-democrats-revolt-national-leaders-abortion-extremism/,"By Marjorie Dannenfelser May 3, 2019
National Democratic leaders and presidential candidates continue to embrace radical positions on life issues. But grassroots Democrats are resisting the national party’s platform where the voters live: the states.
In 2019, prominent Democratic figures have gone to extremes to embrace fringe life-issue positions such as late-term abortions and infanticide. In January, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D–NY) signed a bill to cement the central holdings of Roe v. Wade as state law. In lockstep with other Democratic leaders, Cuomo deployed “health” as an undefined, catch-all term to open the door for abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Moreover, he repealed protections for infants born alive that formerly entitled them to all life-sustaining efforts.
Eight days later, Gov. Ralph Northam (D–VA) endorsed the removal of third-trimester abortion restrictions through labor and delivery. Northam argued that physicians should deliver the infant alive when the mother is in labor, then keep the infant comfortable, he said. Then, if the mother desires, physicians should resuscitate the child, or leave the child to die. He said at that point the physician and the mother should discuss how to proceed—i.e., whether to kill or care for the infant.
Merely 13 percent of Americans support national Democratic leaders’ position on third-trimester abortion. Nevertheless, Democratic presidential candidates Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg favor third-trimester abortion. They aren’t alone on this in the Democratic presidential field.
On January 31, 2019, Sen. Ben Sasse (R–NE) introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Under the bill, infants born alive after surviving an attempted abortion are legal persons under American law and entitled to all legal protections thereunder. Moreover, the bill would entitle infants to the same level of care as any other patient.
However, Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate voted against the bill. Sens. Cory Booker (D–NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D–NY), Kamala Harris (D–CA), Amy Klobuchar (D–MN), Bernie Sanders (I–VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Yet, 87 percent of Americans reject third-trimester abortions. Seventy-seven percent of voters support born-alive infant protections. Now grassroots Democrats are taking notice. Some Democrats, At the State Level, Have the Right Idea
In Ohio, all Democratic state senators approved a bipartisan resolution to urge the U.S. Congress to adopt Sasse’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. In New Mexico, legislators attempted to enact third-trimester abortion legislation similar to the proposals advanced in New York and Virginia. However, New Mexico’s Democrat-led Senate delivered a blow to the national party by voting against the measure.
North Carolina’s General Assembly passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act on April 16, 2019. Four House and two Senate Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the measure. Republicans and supportive Democrats must seek additional support from other Democratic lawmakers to build a veto-proof super-majority.
Arkansas saw three Democrats join Republicans to pass the Cherish Act, which banned abortion after 18 weeks except in cases of rape and incest. Moreover, the Cherish Act required abortion providers to determine the unborn child’s probable gestational age prior to inducing or performing an abortion. Previously, Arkansas banned abortion after 20 weeks of gestation in a mother’s womb.
Florida Democrat Kim Daniels voted to advance HB 1335 from the Judiciary Committee. HB 1335 requires minors to obtain parental or legal guardian consent prior to the abortion procedure. Minors may petition the corresponding circuit court and obtain court-appointed counsel to request that the court waive the consent requirement. HB 1335 has passed the Florida House and is pending in the state’s Senate.
In 2018, 27 percent of West Virginia Democratic lawmakers voted to place Amendment 1 on the ballot. Amendment 1 establishes that “nothing in the [West Virginia] Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.” West Virginians, a narrow majority of whom are registered Democrats, approved the amendment.
Rhode Island lawmakers are deliberating over H5125, which would codify Roe v. Wade ’s central holdings of abortion on request as state law. The bill advanced to the Rhode Island Senate Judiciary Committee by a 44-30 margin. However, 22 Democratic state representatives voted against the bill, which faces another test in the Rhode Island Senate.
In Tennessee, Democratic state Reps. Joe Towns, John Windle, and John DeBerry voted in favor of HB 0077. Under HB 0077, abortion is prohibited once the unborn child’s heartbeat is detected, except in certain medical emergencies. The Tennessee Senate deferred the bill for a study. Towns’s vote irked Planned Parenthood. In 2018, Towns sought and received Planned Parenthood’s endorsement. Planned Parenthood revoked its endorsement of Towns and is pursuing a challenger to his seat.
Louisiana state Rep. Katrina Jackson, a Democrat, continues to challenge the national Democratic Party’s status quo. Jackson joined U.S. Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D–IL) as one of two elected, pro-life Democratic speakers at the 2019 March for Life.
Jackson sponsored Louisiana Act 620 in 2014. Under Act 620, Louisiana abortion providers must have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of their clinic. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked Act 620 from going into effect, by a 5-4 vote. On April 17, 2019, the pro-abortion group Center for Reproductive Rights petitioned the court for a writ of certiorari. Jackson laid the groundwork for what may be the first major pro-life case heard by the new court. A Democratic Party Divided
Grassroots Democrats must come to terms with the national Democratic Party’s radical positions on life issues. Democratic leaders and presidential candidates continue to double down on late-term abortion on demand.
Infanticide is alarmingly close to becoming Democratic Party orthodoxy, if it has not already. But many grassroots Democrats continue to listen to their consciences and their constituents. More than three-quarters of voters support born-alive abortion protections. Meanwhile, 62 percent of voters oppose legislation that authorizes late-term abortions. And Americans increasingly identify as pro-life.
Life issues are not a Democrat or Republican issue. They are a bipartisan issue, and both sides are welcome to the right side of history. The gap between the extremism of the national leadership of the Democratic Party and the votes of the party grassroots across the country offers persuasive proof. Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of Susan B. Anthony List, a national pro-life organization dedicating to advancing leaders and pursuing policies to reduce and ultimately end abortion."
What Happens When An Artist Is Mugged By Identity Politics,thefederalist.com,Tony Daniel,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/what-happens-when-an-artist-is-mugged-by-identity-politics/,"By Tony Daniel May 3, 2019
Satirical novelist and sometime cultural geographer Bret Easton Ellis produced a podcast from 2014 to 2017 (and has continued it sporadically as a paid product ) in which he interviewed people in the Hollywood entertainment industry, where he now mostly makes his living. He has some excellent discussions with aging scriptwriters and movie directors such as Paul Schrader, Walter Hill, and Peter Bogdanovich. Ellis’s new book titled White is, for the most part, a compendium of the essay-length introductory pieces with which Ellis opens his podcast episodes, revised and topically arranged.
The theme is Ellis’s awakening awareness of, and growing repulsion to, woke culture. The perceptive reader will chuckle a bit (or perhaps experience a shudder of schadenfreude) at his seeming naivete, but for the most part, Ellis delivers a heartfelt defense of the good old days when free speech meant free speech, and people didn’t excuse atrocities like the murder of the Charlie Hebdo staffers with clouds of critical theory blather.
Because Ellis is mainly a creature of Hollywood now, there’s a great deal of movie discussion and analysis in White , along with reflection on the entertainment industry’s political antics in the past few years. There is also a big chunk of deadening material on what makes a good “gay” film, a discussion for which Ellis himself might be the only audience.
But the book gets good when Ellis opines on “Generation Wuss,” his term for so-called millennials, who simultaneously amuse and disgust him, and when he reflects on his own deracinated childhood in Los Angeles’s San Fernando Valley, and the circumstances surrounding the writing of his novels Less Than Zero and American Psycho , among others . There’s also a nice bit on his influences, and I was not surprised to see Joan Didion as chief among them. The Identity Politics Trap
Ellis despises identity politics. “Across the board, identity politics endorse the concept that people are essentially tribal, and our differences are irreconcilable,” he says, “which of course makes diversity and inclusion impossible. . . it’s a trap.” And there seems to be no way out, even for a good old-fashioned liberal, “not even vehement liberalism could save you anymore, not in a tyrannical and oppressive Hollywood culture that was now dictating how we expressed ourselves as comedians, filmmakers, artists. Freedom of expression had become, it seemed, an aesthetic death wish, effectively suicidal.”
Ah, the pain of the liberal mugged by reality. Or, in this case, by Identity. How could the lefty book tribe, which celebrated the empty hedonism, sex, and drugs of Less Than Zero as a fun satire on the early 1980s and, let’s face it, a how-to manual for Gen X literary hipsters, turn so viciously on Ellis when he produced the far creepier and more prescient American Psycho ? Then, two decades later, Twitter, which seems ephemeral at first blush, turns out to be a version of eternal damnation for Ellis.
I have often been at odds with the notion that anyone could really, deeply care about a tweet in the first place. You tweeted, people screamed, people laughed, you shrugged, everyone moved on—that’s how I initially saw Twitter. But after a while I realized that Twitter actually encourages anger and despair—from the overly sincere, the virtue signaler, the ignorant, the literal-minded, the humorless.
The minor muggings continued in Ellis’s Hollywood hothouse. The first brouhaha Ellis chronicles in the book is his shunning by the organization GLAAD for not being a woke enough gay guy. The second is the reaction to Ellis tweeting in December 2012 that Kathryn Bigelow, director of The Hurt Locker , “would be considered a mildly interesting filmmaker if she was a man but since she’s a very hot woman she’s really overrated.”
Ellis later apologized to Bigelow in the pages of Vanity Fair for the mistaken perception (among the usual suspects) that the tweet was sexist. It is not, of course. It is what used to be called an “opinion.” Or, to put it the way we used to, “merely an opinion.” It’s not even an effective smart-aleck remark.
His point is that he thinks she is a mediocre talent who has been overvalued because she is good-looking. So what? Does that make her a mediocre talent? No, Bigelow does that well enough without the help of Ellis. It is the “good-looking woman” part of the tweet that offends, one imagines. Yet Bigelow cannot be called ugly by any standard, except maybe that of the creators of Dove soap commercials. It has ever been the case that good-looking people have an easier time in the world, at least before they make Strange Days or write Undertow . This most certainly applies to men, too.
It isn’t sexist to say so. It’s just — well, you know. Merely an opinion. The real point of the tweet is that Ellis didn’t think “The Hurt Locker” was particularly great, and that Quentin Tarantino, whom Ellis admires, should have won best director for “Inglorious Basterds” instead. (If Bigelow ever should have won, it ought to have been for wrangling Gary Busey in Point Break .) Lecturing the Enfant Terrible
Then there was the tweet from April 2011 stating that, although he liked “the idea of ‘Glee,’” watching an episode of the television show was like “stepping in a puddle of HIV.” That is an effective smart aleck critique. And fairly funny.
Ellis doesn’t necessarily label himself, but he has been in gay relationships for the past 30 years. He’s a gay guy. With an opinion. Because of this tweet, and others objecting to the stereotyping of gay men as “magic elves,” the organization GLAAD disinvited him from a dinner honoring, of all people, Bill Clinton.
To top it off, GLAAD asked him not to speak or write about the disinvite, but instead to sit down so they could explain to him what he’d done wrong. Did they not realize they were saying this to a man whose foundational artistic persona is the enfant terrible ? Ellis was never going to be lectured by the likes of them.
What GLAAD reinforces is the notion that gay men are oversensitive babies who need to be coddled and protected—not from the hideous anti-gay assaults in Russia, the Muslim world, China, or India, to name a few, but within domestic cultural sentiments. GLAAD was at the red-hot center for the creation of the magical elf as an absurdly high-minded and cutesy role model—hopefully a victim with great pecs—and had often applauded the stereotypes we saw paraded around in embarrassing queer movies and degrading retro sitcoms as ‘positive’ simply because they were, um, gay . All the while they conveniently disregarded the truth, that a silent majority of gay men actively loathed and resisted the caricatures on display.
In the past decade, particularly after the presidential election, Ellis has been on a journey from generally not caring about Hollywood political ranting to being forced to choose sides, to becoming an active rebel against conformity. For those of us outside the bubble, he provides a great deal of amusement at his self-congratulating discovery of the blindingly obvious. In the end, however, he is a real artist with good instincts who has the proper reaction to the totalitarian mindset that has taken hold of the entertainment and news industry in America: disdain.
Ellis claims to never have really been in the bubble himself. He says he had a presentiment President Trump would be elected because he had acquaintances who were planning to vote for Trump. He puts the split in his circle at about 55 percent Clinton to 45 percent Trump, which may seem remarkable for Hollywood, but not so remarkable when you factor in that Ellis, who is trying to get his own projects made, moves among not just performing artists and creative types, but also producers and film financiers—in other words, people who put the money in and stand to lose their shirts and more if a movie doesn’t turn a buck.
On the downside, Ellis often speaks in generational clichés and hypes up unexceptional truisms enough to make one cringe. Gen X. Boomers. Millennials. These categories are frequent placeholders for thought throughout White .
. . . they’d never really been loved by their own selfish narcissistic true-boomer parents, and who as a result were smothering their kids and not teaching them how to deal with life’s hardships about how things actually work: people might not like you, this person will not love you back, kids are really cruel, work sucks, it’s hard to be good at something, your days will be made up of failure and disappointment, you’re not talented, people suffer, people grow old, people die. And the response from Generation Wuss was to collapse into sentimentality and create victim narratives, instead of grappling with the cold realities by struggling and processing them and then moving on, better prepared to navigate an often hostile or indifferent world that doesn’t care if you exist. Victimization as a Drug
Much of White is melodramatic and overwritten. As an artist, Ellis does not seem to know when to shut up. He tells us that a boyfriend once referred to him as “Overdramatic Chipmunk,” after the meme making the rounds in 2006. One can see it in his prose. Yet he can surely turn a phrase, and his heart is in the right place: “I have to believe in free speech no matter what—that’s as simple and true as it gets.”
Also, in the spirit of Ellis’s confessional style of essay in which literally anything anybody says to him—whether in confidence or not—seems to be fair game for an anecdote, I would add that I had a good friend who was peripherally a part of Ellis’s Bennington clique during college, a group that included writers Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem. My friend had traveled a difficult road by the time I knew him in the ’90s and was sometimes a bit erratic to say the least, but Ellis was always kind to him and invited him to get-togethers. He impressed me with this loyalty and decency.
Ellis is certainly not a progressive. He most definitely has the woke mob’s number.
If you feel you’re experiencing ‘micro-aggressions’ when someone asks you where you are from or ‘Can you help me with my math?’ or offers a ‘God bless you’ after you sneeze, or a drunken guy tries to grope you at a Christmas party, or some douche purposefully brushes against you at a valet stand in order to cop a feel, or someone merely insulted you, or the candidate you voted for wasn’t elected, or someone correctly identifies you by your gender, and you consider this a massive societal dis, and it’s triggering you and you need a safe space, then you need to seek professional help. If you’re afflicted by these traumas that occurred years ago, and that is still a part of you years later, then you probably are still sick and in need of treatment. But victimizing oneself is like a drug—it feels so delicious, you get so much attention from people, it does in fact define you, making you feel alive and even important while showing off your supposed wounds, no matter how minor, so people can lick them. Don’t they taste so good?
Ellis claims not to be a conservative or libertarian, but a sort of apolitical artist type who has some conservative and some liberal beliefs. Most importantly, he is a proponent of freedom of speech as the foundation for a free society and for all artistic expression.
Nowadays, this, of course, makes him a conservative by dint of occupying the same beleaguered patch of ground as the rest of us in the sane remnant. Sorry about that, Bret.

The CBO Report On Single Payer Isn’t The One We Deserve To See,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/cbo-report-single-payer-isnt-one-deserve-see/,"By Christopher Jacobs May 3, 2019
On Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a 30-page report analyzing a single-payer health insurance plan. While the publication explained some policy considerations behind such a massive change to America’s health care market, it included precious few specifics about such a change—like what it would cost.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), perhaps single payer’s biggest supporter, serves as the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. If he asked the budget scorekeepers to analyze his legislation in full to determine what it would cost, and how to go about paying for the spending, CBO would give it high-priority treatment.
But to the best of this observer’s knowledge, that hasn’t happened. Might that be because the senator does not want to know—or, more specifically, does not want the public to know—the dirty secrets behind his proposed health-care takeover? Hypothetical Scenarios
The CBO report examined single payer as an academic policy exercise, running through various options for establishing and operating such a mechanism. In the span of roughly thirty pages, the report used the word “would” 245 times and “could” 209 times, outlining various hypothetical scenarios.
That said, CBO did highlight several potential implications of a single-payer system for both the demand and supply of care. For instance, “free” health care could lead to major increases in demand that the government system could not meet:
An expansion of insurance coverage under a single-payer system would increase the demand for care and put pressure on the available supply of care. People who are currently uninsured would receive coverage, and some people who are currently insured could receive additional benefits under the single-payer system, depending on its design. Whether the supply of providers would be adequate to meet the greater demand would depend on various components of the system, such as provider payment rates. If the number of providers was not sufficient to meet demand, patients might face increased wait times and reduced access to care.
The report noted that in the United Kingdom, a system of global budgets—a concept included in the House’s single-payer legislation—has led to massive strains on the health-care system. Because payments to hospitals have not kept up with inflation, hospitals have had to reduce the available supply of care, leading to annual “ winter crises ” within the National Health Service:
In England, the global budget is allocated to approximately 200 local organizations that are responsible for paying for health care. Since 2010, the global budget in England has grown by about 1 percent annually in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, compared with an average real growth of about 4 percent previously. The relatively slow growth in the global budget since 2010 has created severe financial strains on the health care system. Provider payment rates have been reduced, many providers have incurred financial deficits, and wait times for receiving care have increased.
While cutting payments to hospitals could cause pain in the short term, CBO noted that reducing reimbursement levels could also have consequences in the long term, dissuading people from taking up medicine to permanently reduce the capacity of America’s health-care market:
Changes in provider payment rates under the single-payer system could have longer-term effects on the supply of providers. If the average provider payment rate under a single-payer system was significantly lower than it currently is, fewer people might decide to enter the medical profession in the future. The number of hospitals and other health care facilities might also decline as a result of closures, and there might be less investment in new and existing facilities. That decline could lead to a shortage of providers, longer wait times, and changes in the quality of care, especially if patient demand increased substantially because many previously uninsured people received coverage and if previously insured people received more generous benefits.
That said, because the report did not analyze a specific legislative proposal, its proverbial “On the one hand, on the other hand” approach generates a distinctly muted tone. Tax Increases Ahead
To give some perspective, the report spent a whopping two pages discussing “How Would a Single Payer System Be Financed?” (Seriously.) This raises the obvious question: If single-payer advocates think their bill would improve the lives of ordinary Americans, because the middle class would save so much money by not having to pay insurance premiums, wouldn’t they want the Congressional Budget Office to fully analyze how much money people would save?
During his Fox News town hall debate last month, Sanders claimed a large show of support from blue-collar residents of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for single payer. The ostensible support might have something to do with Sanders’ claim during the town hall that “the overwhelming majority of people are going to end up paying less for health care because they’re not paying premiums, co-payments, and deductibles.”
Where have we heard that kind of rhetoric before? Oh yeah—I remember:
At least one analysis has already discounted the accuracy of Sanders’ claims about people paying less. In scrutinizing Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign plan, Emory University economist Kenneth Thorpe concluded that the plan had a $10 trillion—yes, that’s $10 trillion —hole in its financing mechanism.
Filling that hole with tax increases meant that 71 percent of households would pay more under single payer than under the status quo, because taxes would have to go up by an average of 20 percentage points. Worse yet, 85 percent of Medicaid households—that is, people with the lowest incomes—would pay more, because a single-payer system would have to rely on regressive payroll taxes, which hit the poor hardest, to fund socialized medicine. Put Up or Shut Up, Bernie
If Sanders really wants to prove the accuracy of his statement at the Fox News town hall, he should 1) ask CBO to score his bill, 2) release specific tax increases to pay for the spending in the bill, and 3) ask CBO to analyze the number of households that would pay more, and pay less, under the bill and all its funding mechanisms.
That said, I’m not holding my breath. A full, public, and honest accounting of single payer, and how to pay for it, would expose the game of three-card monty that underpins Sanders’ rhetoric. But conservatives should keep pushing for Sanders to request that score from CBO—better yet, they should request it themselves.

Creative Project Brings Real-Life Holocaust Stories To Instagram,thefederalist.com,Daniella Greenbaum Davis,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/creative-project-brings-real-life-holocaust-stories-to-instagram/,"May 6, 2019 By Daniella Greenbaum Davis
If we held a moment of silence for every Jew brutally murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust, we would be silent for more than 11 years. That would be powerful, but it is, of course, entirely impractical.
As the survivor generation dies out, we have a special obligation to keep sharing their stories. On that, most decent people agree. But what is far from clear is the best mechanism by which to do that.
On Yom Hashoah in Israel, a particular way of honoring the murdered is incredibly poignant. A siren rings and life simply ceases. Traffic comes to a halt on streets and even on highways, and people get out of their cars, stand up, and pay their respects in silence. It’s chilling to watch.
But what about the international community? What new and creative ways can we use to educate a generation of people that is increasingly ignorant about the atrocities of the Holocaust? How can we educate people who will have never met a survivor? How do we keep things feeling personal and immediately relevant as time continues to pass?
The answer this year came from two people: Mati and Maya Kochavi. The father and daughter duo has taken the diary of Eva Heyman, a Jewish teenager who, not unlike Anne Frank, documented her experience in a journal, and transformed it into a series of Instagram stories. Kochavi told CNN they “were looking for a way to deal with Holocaust memory and manage this memory in a way that is going to be relevant for a younger generation today.”
The content of the stories are based on Eva’s diary pages. But the way they have been filmed and posted feels exactly like what you might expect had a teenage girl in the Holocaust somehow had access to an iPhone. The stories are not disappearing. They have been pinned under the highlights section, each one pertaining to a different date or diary entry. The account ( @eva.stories ) already has just under 1 million followers.
Critics have charged that the project dumbs down the Holocaust and belittles the most serious incident of genocide the world has ever seen. They’ve questioned the wisdom of making Instagram the vehicle to deliver this kind of powerful, haunting story.
But tech platforms like Instagram and Twitter are not inherently good or bad. They’re not inherently anything at all. Ultimately, it’s all about the content. And content can be anything; shallow and vapid or purposeful and important. This was the latter.
More importantly: Eva’s stories were already circulated through more traditional means. Her journal was published long ago. It never made anything close to the kind of impact this Instagram account has had in an incredibly short time. Younger Americans who are less likely to have ever met a survivor are incredibly likely to be on Instagram. There’s nothing gained by ignoring that sort of reality.
There’s incredible value in creative educational materials that reach audiences whom typical mediums might not otherwise reach. People seeking long historical reads about the horrors of the camps will always be able to find them. What’s important is that we create a kind of content that seeks out those unlikely to search out Holocaust materials themselves. And with rising anti-Semitism on both the left and the right, we shouldn’t be ruling out a single potential vehicle for education.
Eva Heyman was murdered in a Nazi gas chamber on October 17th, 1944. Say her name. Watch her stories. Daniella Greenbaum Davis, a Spectator columnist, is a writer living in New York. Follow her on Twitter . "
Report Omission Shows Mueller Was A Political Or Professional Hack,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/major-report-omission-shows-mueller-either-incompetent-political-hack/,"By Margot Cleveland May 6, 2019
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s March “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election” contains a glaring omission: Not once in the 448-page tome does Mueller mention an investigation into whether Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election by feeding dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation.
But Mueller also did not charge Steele with lying to the FBI, or refer a criminal case against Steele to federal prosecutors, as he did when the special counsel uncovered evidence of criminal misconduct unrelated to the 2016 election. Given Mueller’s conclusion that no one connected to the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election, one of those two scenarios must be true—either Russia fed Steele disinformation or Steele lied to the FBI about his Russian sources. Steele Openly Said He Got Info from Russians
The Steele dossier, which consisted of a series of memorandum authored by the former MI6 spy, detailed intel purportedly provided by a variety of Vladimir Putin-connected sources. For instance, Steele identified Source A as “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure” who “confided that the Kremlin had been feeding Trump and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.”
Other supposed sources identified in the dossier included: Source B, identified as “a former top-level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin”; Source C, a “Senior Russian Financial Officer”; and Source G, “a Senior Kremlin Official.” Steele also described a smattering of unlettered sources as a FSB Cyber Operative; a former Senior Intelligence Officer; a Senior Government Figure; “well-placed and established Kremlin source 1”; “well-placed and established Kremlin source 2”; a Kremlin official involved in U.S. relations; a Senior Russian leadership figure; and a Kremlin insider with direct access to leadership.
Steele first provided a summary of the Kremlin-supplied “intel” on Trump to the FBI in June or July 2016, when he met with his reputed handler, Rome-based FBI agent Mike Gaeta. In September 2016, Gaeta provided the dossier to agents working on the Russia collusion investigation at the FBI headquarters in Washington D.C.
The following month, the U.S. Department of Justice included details from the dossier in an application submitted to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court and obtained a court order to surveil former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. That FISA court order gave the Obama administration and career DOJ and FBI agents access to Page’s communications with Trump campaign officials prior to Page’s departure. Using Leaks to Seed News Stories
Leaks propelled the claimed collusion into the news. Steele shared details from the dossier with Michael Isikoff. Citing a “Western intelligence source,” Isikoff reported at Yahoo! News that “Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister,” and discussed the lifting of sanctions.
Government sources told Isikoff that Page’s activities in Russia had “been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election.” “After one of those briefings,” Isikoff wrote, “Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and ‘high ranking sanctioned individuals’ in Moscow over the summer as evidence of ‘significant and disturbing ties’ between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.”
The DOJ later cited Isikoff’s article to support its FISA application to surveil Page. The application also detailed some of the impact this news story had on the Trump campaign: “Based on statements in the September 23, [Yahoo!] News Article, as well as in other recent articles published by identified news organizations, Trump’s campaign repeatedly has made public statements in an attempt to create the appearance of distance between Page and [Trump’s] campaign.”
Mueller’s report also acknowledged that the Steele dossier, and leaks about it, affected the Trump campaign. For instance, Mueller noted that “on October 11, 2016, Podesta stated publicly that the FBI was investigating Russia’s hacking and said that candidate Trump might have known in advance that the hacked emails were going to be released.” Additionally, Mueller highlighted the media’s questioning of vice presidential candidate Mike Pence concerning “whether the Trump Campaign was ‘in cahoots’ with WikiLeaks in releasing damaging Clinton-related information.”
Although Pence shot down the suggestion, responding, “nothing could be further from the truth,” the narrative dragged the Trump campaign up to election day—and a rabid portion of the populace continues to believe and peddle the Russian hoax. Yet Trump still solidly defeated Hillary Clinton. It Appears Russia Used Steele to Meddle in U.S. Elections
But Trump’s victory does not negate the reality that, assuming Steele truthfully relayed to the FBI and the media the intel his Russian sources provided, Russia interfered in the election by feeding Steele false intel about Trump.
Yet in the special counsel report, Mueller identified only two principal ways Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election: “First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents.”
Surely, a plot by Kremlin-connected individuals to feed a known FBI source—Steele had helped the FBI uncover an international soccer bribery scandal—false claims that the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia would qualify as a “principal way” in which Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. The Russia social media campaign to disparage Hillary Clinton wasn’t a patch on the plot the Kremlin launched to destroy Trump: It resulted not only in bad press, but also an investigation into the Trump campaign and the use of court-approved surveillance exposing campaign communiques.
Even though Mueller was authorized, as he put it in the special counsel report, to investigate “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” the report is silent of efforts to investigate Russia’s role in feeding Steele misinformation. Only the Senate Has Raised This Possibility
Little notice was made of Mueller’s apparent failure to investigate whether Russia interfered in the election by peddling phony intel to Steele that Steele relayed to the FBI, until Sen. Chuck Grassley raised the issue with Attorney General William Barr last week. During questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley pitched the issue as follows:
The Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee hired Fusion GPS to do opposition research against candidate Trump. Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, former British intelligence officer, to compile what we all know as the Steele dossier, that reportedly used Russian government sources for information. The Steele dossier was central to the now-debunked collusion narrative.
Now here’s the irony: The Mueller report spent millions investigating and found no collusion between Trump campaign and Russia but the Democrats paid for a document created by a foreign national with reported foreign government sources. Not Trump, but the Democrats. That’s the definition of collusion. Despite the central status of the Steele dossier to the collusion narrative, the Mueller report failed to analyze whether the dossier was filled with disinformation to mislead U.S. intelligence agencies and the FBI.
“My question,” Grassley continued: “Mueller spent over two years and 30 million dollars investigating Russia interference in the election. In order for a full accounting of Russia interference attempts, shouldn’t the special counsel have considered whether the Steele dossier was part of a Russian disinformation and interfere campaign?”
Barr responded that he had “not yet had anyone go through the full scope of [Mueller’s] investigation to determine whether he did address or look at all into those issues,” before adding, “one of the things I’m doing in my review is to try to assemble all the existing information out there about it, not only for the Hill investigations and the OIG, but also to see what the Special Counsel looked into. So I really couldn’t say what he looked into.”
Later during the four-hour hearing, Sen. John Cornyn asked the attorney general, “how do we know that the Steele dossier is not evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign? Knowing what we know now that the allegations are unverified? Can we state with confidence that the Steele dossier was not part of the Russian disinformation campaign?” Barr responded: “No, I can’t state that with confidence, and that is one of the areas that I’m reviewing. I’m concerned about it, and I don’t think it is entirely speculative.”
If Barr is concerned about it, why wasn’t Mueller? Any competent prosecutor would have investigated whether Russia peddled false intel to Steele. Or Maybe Mueller Investigated and Omitted the Results
Or did Mueller investigate this question? It’s possible, maybe even likely, given this acknowledgement in the special counsel report: “From its inception, the Office recognized that its investigation could identify foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI’s broader national security mission.” “During the Special Counsel investigation,” Mueller then explained, the FBI had embedded personnel “whose purpose was to review the results of the investigation and to send-in writing-summaries of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information to FBIHQ and FBI Field Offices.” Not all of the intelligence and counterintelligence information derived from the special counsel investigation was included in the report.
Here’s the clincher: Not all of the intelligence and counterintelligence information derived from the special counsel investigation was included in the report. Rather, as Mueller explained, the report contains only the “information necessary to account for the Special Counsel’s prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation’s main factual results.”
This assertion is laughable given the special counsel’s report unnecessarily opined on whether Trump obstructed justice, but then failed to reach a “prosecution or declination decision,” as required by regulation. The more likely answer? Political expedience. After all, evidence that Russia interfered in the election by feeding the false collusion narrative to Steele would vindicate Trump, who has been screaming “Witch hunt” from day one.
Of course, there is another possibility: Steele could have invented his Russian sources and the “intel” they supposedly provided him. If so, Steele should have been charged with lying to the FBI. Yet Steele remains a free man, showing either Mueller is incompetent or a political hack. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Donald Trump’s Biggest Crime Was Winning The 2016 Election,thefederalist.com,Saritha Prabhu,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/donald-trumps-biggest-crime-winning-2016-election/,"By Saritha Prabhu May 6, 2019
Donald Trump’s biggest crime was winning the 2016 election. For our political and media elite in the Beltway, that was the catastrophic, unforgivable crime, from which all the other (imaginary) crimes they now pursue him for originated.
How dare he win that election? Didn’t he know the election belonged to Hillary Clinton, who’d been building up to this very moment for three decades, courting every relevant constituency, remembering every useful politician’s birthday, and being as banal as possible to check everyone’s “lesser political evil” box?
How dare he win the election on his very first try? If you scratch the surface, jealousy is one of the driving emotions among Washington’s elite against Trump and his electoral success. He achieved what many career politicians would die and sell their souls multiple times for. And Trump did it seemingly casually, almost effortlessly. How dare he? He must have stolen the election!
How dare he win that election with a shoestring budget and a ramshackle campaign apparatus? How dare he win without an army of consultants, strategists, advisers, pollsters, and fancy data interpreters? Didn’t he understand that our elections are an excellent jobs program for thousands of political operatives and media types?
How dare he win the old-fashioned way: you know, by having a simple, direct message; recognizing heartland voters’ economic woes; and campaigning in that retail-politics way of his? Didn’t he know that 21st-century elections are now won with Big Data, microtargeting of voters, and media-hyped candidates?
How dare he lie and exaggerate in that crude, undisciplined way of his? Doesn’t he know that Washington likes their liars to be polished prevaricators who know how to couch their fabrications in think-tankese?
To add insult to injury, how dare he win by just saying what he (and millions of ordinary voters) thinks? That’s just not done. Didn’t he appreciate that Presidential Campaign-Speak is an art unto itself—something that has been focus-grouped, poll-tested, script-driven, platitude-filled, that’ll give no offense whatsoever to any identity group in America, and bores listeners to tears. How dare Trump riff offhand and entertain voters? The gall of the man!
How dare he say obvious, common-sense things like spending blood and treasure on Middle Eastern quagmires isn’t okay anymore, that America can’t afford to be the world’s security underwriter anymore, that our global trade deals have shafted American workers for too long? Who does he think he is?
Doesn’t he know that on the issues of the day, he needs to consult our over-credentialed, corrupt, and inefficient elites before he says anything? And doesn’t he know that the solution to every issue in our politics is counter-intuitive now: Up is down, war is peace, more illegal immigration is good, and having a wall on our southern border is bad.
How dare he care about ordinary American workers in the Rust Belt? Doesn’t he know that we live in a global economy now, and those Americans are toast? Dang Trump for forcing us to pretend we care about those white working-class voters Democrats had snookered for so long. Thanks to Orange Man, we now have to cater to the very people we despise and who cling bitterly to their God, guns, and religion.
And for God’s sake, doesn’t he know that caring about one’s nation and its citizens is passé? It’s all global now! Pretend-caring in a vague, generalized, feel-good way about global citizens while getting richer off their cheap labor is the fashion now.
For all his flaws, Trump is the best thing to have happened to our ossified, corrupt national politics. He ripped the mask off our political and media establishments. His election victory exposed the empty-souled hypocrites in the establishments of both parties and the national media who shill for them. He is the much-needed human defibrillator to the American political system.
What our ruling elites used to have (and lost) after the 2016 election was a powerful sense of control over our politics. Like millions of voters who are outside the hardcore Democratic base, I’ve been enjoying the primal scream emanating from the ruling and media elite. I may not like or agree with everything Trump does, but the spectacle of jittery, grasping-at-anything-and-everything elites has been enjoyable to watch.
With his unpredictable, heterodox ways of policy-making and communicating to the masses, Trump has, in some ways, neutered the media elite. What we have been seeing for the last two-and-a-half years is nothing but revenge on steroids: For the crime of winning the 2016 election, the elites have pinned all manner of crimes on Trump, hoping something will stick.

Media Lies About Trump To Cover Up Brutality Of Late-Term Abortion,thefederalist.com,Rebecca Downs,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/media-lies-trump-cover-brutal-reality-late-term-abortion/,"The Cut’s “ Trump’s Lies About Abortion Keep Getting More Disturbing ,” by Hannah Gold
Many of these articles repeat the same falsehoods. Vesoulis’ article for Time is particularly bad, since 9 percent of abortions are committed during or after the second trimester, when the baby is between 14 and 27 weeks old and can sometimes be born as a preemie. Vesoulis instead focuses on the 1.2 percent of abortions committed during the third trimester, which is the point at which most unborn babies can be saved through a C-section or induced labor. Going by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures , Vesoulis is really talking about 56,797 abortions, which suddenly doesn’t seem so rare.
Vesoulis also claims that late-term abortions “mostly happen because of a serious fetal anomaly or for the health of the woman.” It is an oft-repeated claim and also a misleading one. The Guttmacher Institute and a study conducted from 2008-2010 found that most late-term abortions are performed on healthy women with healthy fetuses.
Women who sought these procedures were more likely to be young, minority women with limited financial resources. Reasons given were more logistical than medical. They may have aborted because they didn’t know they were pregnant until later in their pregnancy, had trouble deciding, or had trouble making arrangements.
The claim that many late-term abortions are performed on women who face medical problems is also turned on its head when medical professionals, including former abortionists , acknowledge that abortion is never medically necessary. In cases of medical emergencies, a child may be delivered by a C-section.
But these mainstream media outlets should not even need to discuss abortion numbers because legislation that has been considered at the state and federal levels, as emphasized by the bill’s sponsor, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, does not seek to regulate or restrict abortion. It merely requires that babies born alive from abortion attempts receive the same medical care as those born at that gestation for whom parents will take responsibility. Once a child is born, no distinction is made between whether the child is wanted or unwanted.
Another claim from the media is that babies are rarely born alive from an abortion procedure. So? Proper care should still be given even if it is just one baby who is born alive. An Associated Press article writes that “ Wisconsin health officials lack data on abortion survivals .” By that admittance, shouldn’t doctors err on the side of protecting babies who are born alive?
The article even acknowledges that “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 143 instances nationwide in which live births were caused by an attempted abortion between 2003 and 2014,” which means some of those live births could have resulted in babies being left to die. States aren’t even required to report their abortion numbers to the CDC, so it stands to reason that failed abortion attempts would be even more so covered-up.
It’s not merely the CDC that has evidence of babies born alive from abortion attempts. If congressional findings , personal testimonies , and stories shared by abortion survivors aren’t proof that babies are born alive, it’s worth wondering what would be.
That the mainstream media sees such a need to supposedly correct the record makes it all the more important for those of us who know better to speak up about the truth. The mainstream media is complicit in failing to protect the truly most innocent, vulnerable, and defenseless among us.

The Dark Power Of Anthony Jeselnik's 15-Minute Abortion Joke,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/the-dark-power-of-anthony-jeselniks-new-abortion-bit/,"May 6, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
The last bit in Anthony Jeselnik’s new Netflix special, his grand finale, could never have been about removing a mole. That it was actually a decadent, 15-minute joke about abortion is something of a statement on both Jeselnik’s deadpan act and the issue itself.
The joke is a story. Jeselnik regales viewers with a tale of his trip to an abortion facility, escorting a friend to her procedure (which actually happened ). “Don’t worry guys—wasn’t my baby, wasn’t important,” he assures the audience.
That follows some 40 minutes of quick hits like, “When I was a kid, my family used to move around a lot. But now they’re all fat as f-ck,” which was immediately preceded by, “I think, like a lot of guys, I’ll never forget the one time I saw my dad’s penis. I said, ‘Dad, don’t text me sh-t like that.’”
Jeselnik’s delivery is sadistically slow, and the stream of disjointed jokes pulled from one template gets exhausting. Even so, the comedian’s unwavering commitment to his bad-guy act feels refreshing amid a sea of stand-ups confusing themselves for superheroes. He never breaks character, even when he breaks the fourth wall. (Jeselnik looks directly into the camera more than once.)
This is solidified somewhere in the middle of his set, when Jeselnik savagely mocks the trend of stand-ups breaking for a Very Serious political interlude mid-special (a tactic frustratingly espoused by his ex-girlfriend Amy Schumer). After a long build-up about the importance of comedians “speaking truth to power,” he says, “My biggest pet peeve in America today is people will see all this horrible stuff going on and yet they still overreact to sh-t that just does not matter.”
“For example,” says Jeselnik, “have you ever dropped a baby?”
He never drops the persona. And the persona is a terrible human. Actually that’s his punchline, engaging the audience in an escalating game of “How bad can this guy get?”
Apparently bad enough to spend a long 15 minutes making light of abortion, which wouldn’t actually be funny if everyone agreed abortion were totally casual. Like a bit earlier in the set that saw Jeselnik rank different forms of suicide, this one is predicated on the callousness of the narrator. But what’s there to be callous about if it’s just a clump of cells?
The story’s darkness mirrors the darkness of the issue. Describing the abortion facility, Jeselnik jokes, “The whole place is filled with kids for some reason. I mean, I thought they were kids. Turns out they were just ghosts.” When informed by a Google search that a succulent is the best gift to give someone after an abortion, he demurs. “I would never be like, ‘Oh, here you go, Jessica. Here’s something else you never have to take care of.”
It’s grim. And it could never have been about a mole removal. The joke works because Jeselnik’s lack of sensitivity is laughably inhuman. (“For Jessica, With Love,” a dedication screen reads after the set.)
What’s so inhuman about having some fun with a harmless medical procedure? The bit isn’t exactly pro-life, yet it relies on the notion that abortion is difficult. But why should it be if there’s no value in what’s being extinguished?
Jeselnik’s willingness to go there with his act, rather than clumsily chase wokeness points for whatever vain reason, preserves the important tradition of stand-ups debasing themselves for the sake of comedy, not posturing as moral champions. That’s an important tradition because it creates the contrast that helps us more clearly distinguish good from bad. It’s also much funnier.
“Fire in the Maternity Ward,” as the special is titled, ends with Jeselnik recalling an interaction with a woman who stood up at a recent show to say, “Excuse me, Anthony, but what the f-ck is so funny about abortion?”
“Lady, I just told you,” was his response. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."
Rep. Ilhan Omar Supports Group That Produced Child Beheading Skit,thefederalist.com,Patrick Poole,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/rep-ilhan-omar-supports-group-that-produced-child-beheading-skit/,"By Patrick Poole May 7, 2019
Shocking footage uncovered by the Investigative Project last week shows a skit produced by the Muslim American Society (MAS) in Philadelphia showing children calling for martyrdom as soldiers in the “army of Allah” and threatening to behead their enemies and subject them to “eternal torture” to wrest Jerusalem from Jewish control.
The horrific MAS-Philly children’s skit was posted to their Facebook page and shows a choreographed production as part of the group’s April 17th “Ummah Day” pageant dedicated to supporting jihad to control Palestine. A MAS statement on Friday said the songs and poems the children recited exhorting violence and terrorism were an “unintended mistake” and attributed the incident to a vetting error.
MAS has 42 chapters across the United States. A 1997 FBI file obtained by Judicial Watch identifies MAS as the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States controlled by Hamas sympathizers “known to conduct firearms and other military type training.” A Justice Department filing (p. 58, fn. 13) in a terrorism-related case states that “MAS was founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in America.” A September 2004 Chicago Tribune investigative report revealed that MAS had been founded by Muslim Brotherhood leaders, adopted the group’s strict code for secrecy, and promoted Islamic supremacy.
The article interviewed one former MAS member who explained the group’s vision for Islamic rule in America: “It would convert Americans to Islam and elect like-minded Muslims to political office.” Even more shocking is that freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D–MN), of other recent controversies , has openly supported MAS.
In fact, Omar’s support for MAS goes back years. Her deep ties to the group were on display when she had the MAS-Minnesota chapter Oresident Asad Zaman stand with her as she was ceremonially sworn into the Minnesota House of Representatives in January 2017 with her hand on an enormous Quran. MAS held a reception in honor of her inauguration.
Just a few months later, Omar spoke at the 2017 MAS “Muslim Day” at the state capitol, acknowledging that she had previously participated in the group’s annual event before. Omar was subsequently elected to Congress in November 2018, succeeding former representative and now Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who had his own ties to MAS.
In fact, Ellison was the subject of a House Ethics investigation after MAS-Minnesota paid for his 16-day trip to Mecca in 2008. At first, Ellison had attempted to conceal the sponsors of the trip, and a senior MAS official had initially denied the group’s involvement.
The MAS-Minnesota chapter both Omar and Ellison have supported has a long history of controversy. The group gained national attention in 2007 when they issued a fatwa authorizing Muslim taxi cab drivers at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to deny service to non-Muslim passengers with seeing-eye dogs or who were carrying alcohol.
As I reported in May 2009, the MAS-Minnesota’s Vice President Hassan Mohamud had published a YouTube fundraising video decrying the “hell of living in America,” and had defended Palestinian suicide attacks. When questioned by the local Minneapolis Fox News affiliate about his remarks, Mohamud claimed that he didn’t mean anything anti-American by describing the United States as “hell.” When asked about his statements in support of suicide bombings, he had to stop the interview on three separate occasions and consult with his attorney.
That incident was shortly after a local Somali reporter had identified Mohamud and his mosque as radicalization incubators following the disappearance of dozens of young Somali men, who left the country for Somalia to join the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. In an interview with USA Today, Mohamud denied any radical preaching or that any of the terror recruits had been involved in his mosque.
Yet Mohamud was again tied to a terror recruiting case after five men from the Twin Cities were arrested attempting to fly to Turkey to join the Islamic State in Syria. In March 2016, Justice Department prosecutors asked the court to disqualify Mohamud from the defense team of one of the men, telling the judge that they intended to introduce testimony during the trial of a witness claiming Mohamud had been preaching jihad and making other extremist statements. This disclosure prompted another member of the defense team to move to withdraw from the case.
This raises questions about why Omar has openly supported an organization with a long reported record of supporting terrorism and violence, as exhibited most recently by the shocking children’s pageant in Philadelphia last month. When she previously accused American Jews of dual loyalties, drawing accusations of anti-Semitism by leading Democrats, why would she have willingly associated herself with an organization that the FBI has identified for at least two decades as a front for the Muslim Brotherhood?

"Gay Democrat Mocks, Harasses Christians For Praying Quietly On Sidewalk",thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/gay-democrat-mocks-harasses-christians-praying-quietly-sidewalk/,"By Chad Felix Greene May 7, 2019
Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims is best known for responding to a visit from Vice President Mike Pence to his city by raising his middle finger and saying , “To be clear, we’re a City of soaring diversity…So keep that in mind while you’re here raising money to attack more families, spread more lies, blaspheme with your bible, and maybe even talk to a woman without your wife in the room.” He ended his post declaring, “So…get bent, then get out!”
LGBT media cheered on the display of “resistance” during gay pride month. Then, just a few days ago, Sims filmed himself berating an elderly woman who stood in front of Philadelphia’s Planned Parenthood quietly praying. In a tweet posting his video he said , “Push back against Planned Parenthood protestors, PLEASE! They prey on young women, they use white privilege, & shame. They’re racist, classist, bigots who NEED & DESERVE our righteous opposition. Push back, please! #YouAreStrongEnough.”
He then began recording the woman while asking his followers to donate $100 to Planned Parenthood for every hour she stood praying. He approached her and asked, “How many children have you clothed today? How many shoes have you put on children today? How many have you fed? Or have you spent all day standing outside Planned Parenthood shaming people for what they have a constitutional right to do?” The woman ignored him and continued praying.
For nine minutes Sims berated the woman with growing aggressiveness, calling her a “racist,” “disgusting,” and referring to her as an “old white lady” who is telling people what they can do with their bodies. As of this writing, the video has nearly 600,000 views. Push back against Planned Parenthood protestors, PLEASE! They prey on young women, they use white privilege, & shame. They’re racist, classist, bigots who NEED & DESERVE our righteous opposition. Push back, please! #YouAreStrongEnough https://t.co/rYQOiAhC0D

Writing for a local Philadelphia paper in response, Christine Flowers argues correctly , “I am extremely troubled by the fact that a man who is paid by our tax dollars feels it is appropriate to publicly shame one of those taxpayers just because he disagrees with her.”
In a previous video Sims approached four women praying outside the Planned Parenthood and told his followers he would give anyone who could identify them $100. He then berated the peaceful protesters as not being real Christians. They tried to explain their purpose, but he ignored them. Pennsylvania REPRESENTATIVE @BrianSimsPA chooses to REPRESENT the 182nd district by targeting MINORS. Offering $100 to anyone who doxes them.
He fucking FILMED it all.

— Nick Monroe (@nickmon1112) May 6, 2019 Repentance Is the Last Thing on Sims’s Mind
The pro-life organization Live Action posted the video to their followers saying , “WATCH: Pennsylvania State Representative @BrianSimsPA harasses an elderly woman who is peacefully advocating for the lives of preborn human beings and women who are considering abortion. This is shameful.” Sims responded , “Bring it, Bible Bullies! You are bigots, sexists, and misogynists and I see right through your fake morals and your broken values. #BeReal.”
After a great deal of backlash he defiantly posted , “‘Don’t discriminate against our discrimination. Don’t bully our bullies. Don’t hate our haters.’ – [P-ssy] Grabbers and Baby Cagers.” This has become a common response to overt bigotry from the left, especially within LGBT circles. They view any response to “bad” people as justified. This angry, aggressive, and abusive mindset drives much of LGBT advocacy today.
In an interview in April, Sims ironically said , “In my six years in government as a civil rights attorney, LGBTQ advocate, and activist, I learned one thing that I think makes for good government: it’s empathy. It sounds kind and sweet to hear a cis white man say that, but what I mean is the more the substance of empathy. Empathy is about putting yourself in somebody else’s shoes. And being a good legislator is about having the ability to do that.”
From those with Sim’s perspective, the world is divided into good and bad people and it is the responsibility of the good people to shame and shun the bad ones. When he sees an elderly lady praying quietly to herself, he sees what he believes to be an oppressive movement designed to harm others. He feels justified in hostility because he believes her very existence is hostile to others. He genuinely believes he is fighting for the right cause in the strongest way possible for people he views as vulnerable and attacked. He simply cannot imagine empathy for anyone he determines is a “bad” person. This Will Obviously Backfire on Gay People
In 2018 after Sims won re-election, LGBTQ Nation gushed, “Sims, a liberal firebrand, is known for his nonstop advocacy for LGBTQ rights and his unique take on politics. He’s popular on social media and in queer media.” In another LGBT media profile, Queerty began an interview with the author musing , “Brian Sims reminds me of that older next-door neighbor gay kids might have had crushes on in elementary school: sexy and smart, and so friendly we almost didn’t feel like outcasts when we were in his presence. And like those guys, our imaginations would run to the impossible dream: If only a man like that could be gay.”
Sims’s aggressive and hostile interactions with anyone who challenges him, or whom he views as a “bigot,” is reminiscent of the early days of the gay rights movement. For many gay people, this in-your-face, open rage, and bullying is a sign of strength and progress.
While Sims may believe he is fighting for what is right and may indeed be helping a great many people, he does not realize, or possibly care, the damage he is doing to the movement. Unfortunately, none of the current generation of LGBT activists does.
Despite the glory of movies and historical revisionism of a heroic, rebellious LGBT movement, to most people these kinds of tactics come off as arrogant bullying. Angry protestors screaming insults and shouting profanity is not appealing to anyone outside of the movement. It is not a show of strength, and it is certainly not effective in winning people over. In truth, it is more likely to energize an otherwise tolerant population into opposition. This Is Not How to Advocate for Gay Rights
What does it mean to be an LGBT rights advocate today? From what we see most often, it appears to require a great deal of anger, hostility, and self-righteous intolerance. This is not merely a biased opinion of political opponents, it just seems to be the way the left chooses to promote LGBT people in media.
It also appears to be a narrow generational mentality in current LGBT leadership. Last-generation LGBT advocates like Ellen DeGeneres and RuPaul embraced society’s curiosity and discomfort. They used humor, empathy, and personality to allow the broader population to wade in gently and get a good look around at what gay mainstream culture had to offer. Instead, today’s LGBT leaders are harsh, full of rage and indignation, and eager to start a fight and demonize their opponents.
LGBT advocacy today comes from a place of rage and hatred. It is built on the assumption that to achieve equality, advocates must break through the doors, intimidate the naysayers, and take over the loudspeakers. It is a movement of obnoxious lecturing, silencing, intimidation, bullying, and bitter rage that does little more than validate their prejudices.
It is undermining, with dynamite, the foundation Ellen and RuPaul built carefully just a few decades ago, and it is creating animosity in otherwise polite people. No one should praise an adult man for harassing an elderly woman or attempting to publicly humiliate and intimidate several women peacefully praying on the sidewalk, no matter how passionately he opposes their beliefs.
More importantly, our elected leaders should be held to a higher standard and should not harass citizens practicing their civil rights. If Sims’s driving goal is empathy, he needs to genuinely address his own deeply held bigotry and speak to those he disagrees with, not shout at and shame them on camera. If LGBT people want to keep the social acceptance they’ve fought so long for, they need to stop promoting such hateful voices as their leaders as well.

"Kicking People Off Online Platforms Is About Control, Not Free Speech",thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/kicking-people-off-online-platforms-control-not-free-speech/,"By Warren Henry May 7, 2019
Last week, Facebook banned Alex Jones, InfoWars, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, Paul Nehlen, and Louis Farrakhan, setting off further discussion about the scope of free speech on the internet. Yet the debate over de-platforming is much more about control than freedom of speech.
After all, many on the right are ambivalent, caught between the free speech ethos and the “leave private businesses alone” ethos. Moreover, most of the pro-speech people would not argue for pornography to return to Twitter or YouTube, or that disrupting Islamic State recruitment on Facebook is a bad thing.
Instead, de-platforming is the high-tech version of an older complaint on the right: Big Media, run by the establishment, invariably seeks to marginalize and curate conservatism on their platforms. This debate used to be about broadcast TV; now it is about social media.
Similarly, de-platforming supporters may say they are solely concerned with removing only the most toxic actors from the public discourse to prevent harassment and harm to others. If this were true, they would care more about solutions targeting the platforms in the darker corners of the internet, where radicalization and incitement to violence are at their worst.
Furthermore, the establishment’s standards for toxic speakers are as slippery and selectively applied as always, whether on social or traditional media. Granted, Farrakhan is not actively platformed by legacy media companies. He is also sufficiently toxic that Democrats and progressives have tried to keep their relationships with him very hush-hush.
But The Atlantic published an apologia for these relationships, only to label Farrakhan as a “ far-right ” extremist after the Facebook ban. The Washington Post tried the same stunt before getting shamed into a correction . Media Matters omitted Farrakhan from their coverage like he was Leon Trotsky (they were also shamed into a stealth edit ).
The establishment media promotes Farrakhan’s progressive supporters, like Women’s March leaders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour (the latter ultimately rejected Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements — while defending the anti-Semitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement). For a long time, the establishment media was uninterested in reporting on these relationships.
Conservative media and Jewish media helped put the story on the public radar, but it was probably people at establishment outlets—notably Bari Weiss at The New York Times and Meghan McCain on “The View”—who made it impossible to ignore. The left grumbles about Weiss and McCain having access to establishment platforms (and tries to stop people like Kevin Williamson and Sarah Isgur Flores from similar access), a measure of how much the center-left wants to assert its old exclusionary function.
The establishment also provides a platform to the Rev. Al Sharpton , whose public notoriety was built on a hate crime hoax, incitement to racial violence and anti-Semitism. And he offered no apologies when The New York Times undertook to give him a media makeover. Yet MSNBC puts him on the air to shamelessly lecture on, among other subjects, hate crimes in the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting . Democratic presidential candidates breakfast with him and kiss his ring, and the establishment thinks nothing of it.
When MSNBC is not presenting an infamous race-hustler as a moral exemplar, the channel spends time pushing various conspiracy theories, usually involving President Trump and Russia. For example, Lawrence O’Donnell floated the theory that Russia had orchestrated a chemical attack in Syria so Trump could appear to distance himself from Vladmir Putin. Their premiere personality, Rachel Maddow , continues to air wild-eyed conspiracy theories about Trump and Russia, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed to find evidence that would support a charge of conspiracy or coordination.
More generally, the establishment that condemned candidate Trump for suggesting the 2016 election might get rigged continues to platform Hillary Clinton , Rev. Jesse Jackson , Sen. Sherrod Brown , former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams , and a host of others who claim without evidence that elections were stolen from Democrats.
When Rep. Steve King (R-IA) defended the terms “white supremacist” and “white nationalist” during a New York Times interview (he claims his words were deceptively edited), the House GOP caucus stripped him of committee assignments and supported a resolution of disapproval naming him. When. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) engaged in a series of anti-Semitic slurs, House Democrats decided to treat her as a martyr and pass a resolution condemning bigotry in general without naming her. Omar retained her seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee and continues to support the Hamas-led government in Gaza .
Speaking of Omar, she can quite fairly complain that American Muslims should not be required to ritually denounce acts of terror by radical Islamic groups around the world. Yet Omar and a broad swath of the establishment insinuates the right is generally guilty by association with the alt-right, even explicitly smearing people like Ben Shapiro as such. They also want to blame the right generally by extension for threats and violence by white nationalists and those adopting far-right conspiracy theories, in the hope of tightening the circle of what is considered permissible public debate.
Graeme Wood recently observed that this focus on far-right ideological extremism comes after years of the establishment downplaying or ignoring the role of radical Islamic theologies in motivating terror attacks here and abroad. Likewise, the establishment did not work themselves into an illiberal lather demanding the suppression of speech when left-wing activist James Hodgkinson shot U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, U.S. Capitol Police officer Crystal Griner, congressional aide Zack Barth, and lobbyist Matt Mika at a congressional baseball practice.
As columnist Megan McArdle observed as long ago as 2010: “It’s obviously no surprise that the lunatic BS of our own side doesn’t strike us nearly as forcefully as the absolutely appallingly unforgiveable wingnuttery of the opposition.”
Those criticized here may dismiss the critique as “whataboutism.” But no one need defend any of the people recently de-platformed by Facebook or Twitter to understand that the debate is really about an establishment desperate to regain the gatekeeping power they believed they lost as a result of satellite technology and the internet.
That is ultimately an illusion: de-platform enough mainstream righties and (a) social media companies risk losing the network effect at the heart of their dominance; and (b) some corporation like Fox would fill the market niche with another social network. But it is a fiction too pleasant for the establishment to let go of it. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois. "
"If Hong Kong Passes Extradition Bill, The Freest City In Asia Will Slowly Die",thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/hong-kong-passes-extradition-bill-freest-city-asia-will-slowly-die/,"By Helen Raleigh May 7, 2019
Lam Wing-Kee, a well-known book seller, recently moved to Taiwan because he no longer feels safe in Hong Kong, a city he loved and where he spent most of his life. He fears that if Hong Kong’s new extradition bill becomes law, Beijing would want him extradited to the mainland because of the kind of books he sells. Hong Kong and mainland China don’t currently have an extradition treaty, but a new bill seeks to change that.
Lam isn’t being paranoid. He is known to sell gossip books full of unverified details of the corruption and abuse of power by top mainland Communist leaders, including China’s President Xi Jinping. In 2015, he suddenly disappeared, along with several Hong Kong publishers. Clueless families and friends only learned later that Lam was detained by mainland police while crossing the mainland-Hong Kong border. Lam was never officially charged and was released after eight months of what he described as “mental torture” in a mainland detention facility. You can’t blame him for not wanting to go through this ordeal again.
The fact that a long-time Hong Kong resident doesn’t feel his rights to freedom of expression and due process are protected in Hong Kong anymore says a lot about Hong Kong’s decline from once being the freest city in Asia. Right before the United Kingdom’s government officially handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the Hong Kong legislature passed an extradition law, which prohibits the city from surrendering criminal suspects to “any parts of China.” According to the “one country, two systems” agreement between Great Britain and Beijing, Hong Kong is supposed to maintain its independent judicial system for 50 years.
Hong Kong’s independent judicial system enables it to establish extradition treaties with more than 20 countries, including the United States. Most of these countries do not have extradition treaties with mainland China because they are concerned that suspects, especially those Beijing deems political troublemakers, will not receive due process or a fair trial on the mainland. These countries were assured by Hong Kong authorities that criminal suspects extradited to Hong Kong will not be passed on to mainland China.
Hong Kong’s independent judicial system also ensures that Hongkongers enjoy a level of political freedom that is beyond reach for mainland Chinese. This is a political oasis for dissenting Chinese. Since 1997, it has been the only place in China where certain political activities deemed “criminal” by mainland authorities are still legal and permissible, including pro-democracy protests and the annual candlelight vigil commemorating victims of 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre . Such activities have annoyed Beijing to no end. Beijing Will Have Hong Kong in the End
As mainland China becomes rich and powerful, Beijing has become less tolerant about Hong Kong’s “differences” compared to the rest of China and has sought to exert a greater degree of control. In recent years under the assertive President Xi, Beijing has felt emboldened to send mainland Chinese police to Hong Kong to arrest Hong Kong booksellers and a Chinese tycoon , bypassing Hong Kong’s own judicial system.
Hongkongers are deeply unhappy about both incidents because they think Beijing is breaking its promise to respect Hong Kong’s judicial independence. They are disappointed in Hong Kong authorities’ inability to protect their residents’ legal rights and due process.
Yet Beijing isn’t backing down. This April, the Hong Kong legislature, which is stacked mostly with pro-Beijing legislators, proposed a new extradition bill, which will allow Hong Kong to extradite wanted criminals to mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan as well as other countries not covered by Hong Kong’s existing extradition treaties.
On the surface, this new proposal was prompted by a murder case. A Hongkonger who resided in Taiwan ran back to Hong Kong after Taiwanese authorities charged him with murdering his Taiwanese girlfriend. Hong Kong and Taiwan don’t have an extradition treaty because Hong Kong authorities adopted Beijing’s stance that Taiwan is part of China. So pro-Beijing legislators said the change in Hong Kong’s extradition law is needed to send the alleged criminal back to Taiwan.
But legal scholars pointed out that “there had long been a case-by-case arrangement under the existing ordinance, to allow Hong Kong to transfer fugitives to places it lacked an extradition deal with.” Therefore Hong Kong doesn’t need a new extradition bill if it wants to send the murder suspect back to Taiwan.
Many Hongkongers are concerned that if the new extradition bill becomes law, Hong Kong authorities, under Beijing’s pressure, will also surrender anyone wanted by Beijing based on trumped-up charges. Critics of Beijing, pro-democracy activists, and human rights activists would be at risk. Extradition Would Eradicate Hong Kongers’ Freedoms
Their concerns are valid. Hong Kong’s political environment has become more restrictive in recent years. Four pro-democracy legislators were disqualified for modifying their oaths of allegiance to China during their swearing-in ceremony. Hong Kong authorities refused to issue visas to several human rights activists and foreign journalists, including Victor Mallet of the Financial Times.
Nine leaders of the 2014 Umbrella movement that demanded universal suffrage in Hong Kong were sentenced to prison . Even Hong Kong’s once-cherished academic freedom is under constant interference from Beijing, whose overarching goal is to “rein in criticism and silence unrest.” Professors who supported the pro-democracy movement suddenly couldn’t get their papers published or receive the next appointment or promotion they deserve.
Like frogs in slowly boiling water, Hongkongers have been uneasy with the gradual erosion of their freedom but their responses since the 2014 Umbrella movement have been somewhat muted. The extradition bill seems to have become the last draw. Opposition to this bill is widespread, from a faction of legislators, legal scholars , and business people to ordinary citizens. It has rejuvenated the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
In last month alone, Hongkongers staged multiple protests and the most recent one drew more than 100,000 attendees. Even some pro-Beijing legislators have asked Carrie Lam, the Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong, to scrap the bill and “accept a counterproposal to give the city’s courts the authority to hear cases involving Hong Kong suspects abroad.”
But there is little sign that Lam will back down. Political insiders said this bill is Beijing’s political loyalty test. When facing opposition, Beijing’s only strategy is to crack down, not back down. If Lam can’t deliver it, her political career will be over and Beijing will simply find someone else who can.
Hong Kong used to be the freest city in Asia and one of the freest in the world. Its independent judiciary, protection of freedom of expression and thought, plus low taxes and light regulations, transformed a sleepy fishing village into a modern symbol of prosperity and freedom. Dr. Milton Friedman used scenes from Hong Kong to open his popular PBS series, “ Free to Choose .”
Should the extradition bill become law, however, it will ultimately spell the death of the freest city we have known. It’s truly a tragedy of our times that a great city is slowly dying in front of us. Helen Raleigh is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Why Women Can Never Have A Constitutional Right To An Abortion,thefederalist.com,Timothy M. Jackson,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/women-can-never-constitutional-right-abortion/,"By Timothy M. Jackson May 7, 2019
The Kansas Supreme Court recently ruled that women have a state constitutional right to abortion. This means, in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion would still be legal in Kansas.
What were the grounds for this ruling? Nothing less than an appeal to the inalienable rights of human beings. To quote the majority opinion:
All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” We are now asked: Is this declaration of rights more than an idealized aspiration? And, if so, do the substantive rights include a woman’s right to make decisions about her body, including the decision whether to continue her pregnancy? We answer these questions, “Yes.” We conclude that, through the language in section 1, the state’s founders acknowledged that the people had rights that preexisted the formation of the Kansas government. There they listed several of these natural, inalienable rights—deliberately choosing language of the Declaration of Independence by a vote of 42 to 6.
What is curious about the reasoning of this ruling is that it rejects the logical conclusions of the stated premises. If rights are inalienable, they exist prior to birth, they are harmonious, and they cannot rightly be revoked by counterfeit claims of rights. Inalienable Rights Begin When You Do
The claim that human beings have inalienable rights is an affirmation that all human beings by nature have rights as human beings, independent of any government ruling. This is what the Kansas Supreme Court explicitly acknowledged in their reasoning.
However, what necessarily follows from this reasoning is that a human being has rights from the moment she begins to exist. This, by the way, would include any claimed right to bodily autonomy.
If human beings have the right to bodily autonomy, you cannot consistently claim this is an inalienable right that is intrinsic to every human being and claim a human being only acquires this right at birth. It is hard to imagine a more acute violation of bodily autonomy than the intentional and forcible poisoning or dismemberment of their body to the point of death.
Yet what right did the court acknowledge of the live human beings who have not been born? If human beings are only conferred rights at birth, this not what the word “inalienable” means. This is the expression of the opposite, in fact. All Inalienable Rights Can Exist in Harmony
Second, if rights are inalienable, they cannot contradict each other. Others have an obligation to respect each particular right at every moment. You cannot pick and choose which rights to ignore. If inalienable rights could truly be in conflict with each other, this would result in an endless number of scenarios in which it is logically impossible to carry out your obligations to other human beings. This is absurd.
There cannot be a moral obligation to carry out the logically impossible. It is logically possible for all human beings to coexist in a society in which all their inalienable rights are protected under the law. This is the ideal the founders encouraged us to strive for and approximated in the Declaration of Independence. This ideal would lead to the recognition that both a pregnant woman and her unborn child can have all their inalienable rights consistently protected. Rejecting Counterfeit Claims to a Right
If there is an apparent conflict between two rights, it is important to recognize that it cannot be an actual conflict. One of the two “rights” is only masquerading as a genuine right. It must be a counterfeit. The real work is in identifying the imposter. This is where the debate on abortion must be waged.
For example, a right we can now all agree was counterfeit was the “right” to own slave. It was the false application of our inalienable right to property. Why? Although an inalienable right to property exists, another human being cannot be reduced to someone else’s property.
This also created an apparent conflict between to competing rights where none actually existed: namely, a right to property of one class of human beings versus the right to liberty of another class of human beings. But a right to property for some that inherently denied liberty to others, without due process, showed quite clearly it was not a valid claim to property. Two Competing Rights
With abortion, we have a similar apparent conflict between two or more competing rights: a right to bodily autonomy for one class of human beings versus the right to life (and bodily autonomy) for another class of human beings.
One understanding of a bodily autonomy claim also seems to reduce another class of human beings to someone else’s property, as it presumes a pregnant woman has a right to choose what she will do with that which belongs to her, and the human being in her womb is included in “that which belongs to her.” But as we have seen in the case of slavery, another human being cannot be reduced to another human being’s property.
Another way of framing the bodily autonomy claim is as a claim to liberty rather than property. One might argue the right to bodily autonomy does not reduce the unborn to property but protects a woman’s liberty to abstain from sustaining her child’s life in pregnancy. In this apparent conflict of liberty versus life, which is the imposter?
This is a false application of our natural right to liberty. There is no such thing as liberty to intentionally kill an innocent human being. A right to liberty that denies life without due process only reveals it is not a valid claim to liberty.
Whichever way you frame this, a ruling of this sort fails to acknowledge the right to life, liberty, or the bodily autonomy of the unborn, all of which would exist if human beings possess inalienable rights, as the Kansas Supreme Court claimed. Kansas failed to uphold the purpose of government: to protect life, liberty, and property with any internal coherence.

The Me Too Era Is Time To Revisit ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’s’ Defense Of Due Process,thefederalist.com,Daniel Buck,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/era-time-revisit-kill-mockingbirds-defense-due-process/,"By Daniel Buck May 7, 2019
When my class of freshmen students watched the trial scene in the film version of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” where the protagonist Atticus Finch defends black man Tom Robinson in court against a false allegation of raping a white woman, a student asked why so many people attended the hearing. In both the movie and book, local individuals flock to the trial. My freshmen students had never experienced a prominent court case, so they struggled to understand why anyone would want to watch.
I paused the movie. The image of Brett Kavanaugh with his right hand raised had loomed in my subconscious throughout the unit this year, and I finally had a moment to work the parallel into my lesson. A few students knew his name but none knew the details of the public controversy. I had expected it to be so. I summarized the events of the preceding year and continued the movie.
I’m sure that some would label the parallel I drew between Brett Kavanaugh and Tom Robinson problematic. Robinson is a man of color and we, as readers, are certain of his innocence while there remains the possibility that Kavanaugh is culpable.
Yet the facts of the cases show otherwise. In both, political implications extended beyond the courtroom. In both, it was a matter of two conflicting testimonies with little other evidence. In both, one party relied on conflicting accounts to discredit the defendant’s reputation, and the other provided evidence—inconclusive evidence, yes, but more than the accusers could procure.
Atticus would be problematized as well. While always polite and fair, he imposes a blitzkrieg of rhetorical questions upon Mayella Ewell, Robinson’s accuser, none of which she can answer. Instead, she suffers in silence as Atticus exposes her lie to the onlookers. If it took place today, his questioning would be scorned. People would claim he made her relive her traumas and placed her credibility into doubt. Does the Truth Matter or Not?
I let the movie run to the pronouncement of a guilty verdict. The same student who had asked me about attendance at the trial now asked how they could find him guilty when he wasn’t. It was an injustice, he declared.
Such a declaration is scarce in today’s media in the wake of the Me Too movement. Instead, one feminist author, Emily Linden, tweeted about her lack of concern for falsely accused men, saying, “If some innocent men’s reputations have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy, that is a price I am absolutely willing to pay.” Even if it were an injustice, it’s negligible, say some.
I want Linden to watch “To Kill a Mockingbird” and stand by her words. When Robinson says through tears “I did not,” after Atticus asks him if he raped Mayella, beat Mayella, or committed any crime, is he not a victim?
False allegations are rare, yes. One study aligns with others in placing the rate somewhere between 2 and 10 percent. However, they happen. Quillette recently ran an article that detailed one of these accusations. A woman accused her ex-boyfriend of rape, placing his career and other personal relationships into jeopardy.
In “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Atticus rightly says Mayella Ewell is to be pitied, but that his “pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man’s life at stake.” Robinson has a wife, children, and daily habits like work and assisting neighbors that give meaning to his life. His tears are valid. We view his condemnation and subsequent extra-judicial execution as a supreme injustice.
Any man sent to jail for a crime he didn’t commit is an injustice. If he’s black or white, any man facing life behind bars while his family must support themselves absent a father is a victim. Those who suffer the atrocity of sexual abuse are victims and they must be protected, but so, too, must the men whose lives are at stake when accused. Consider the Consequences for Vulnerable People
At the time of the book’ s publication, sexual assault was not the prominent societal discussion that it is today. The book instead focused on the issue at the forefront of public consciousness in the 1950s and ’60s: civil rights. Unfortunately, the victims in Lee’s time may be the same as those Me Too creates today.
Long before Michelle Alexander decried the unjust sentencing of black men to life in prison, Harper Lee wrote a bestselling novel to bring awareness to the masses. The story shows how racism can corrupt even ideal institutions like the courts. Contemporary movements like Black Lives Matter are rekindling that question and may soon come into conflict with the Me Too movement.
According to the National Registry of Exonerations , a joint project of University of Michigan School of Law and Michigan State University School of Law, almost half of false criminal accusations fall upon black men, who make up only 14 percent of the American populace. Thus, “To Kill a Mockingbird” reveals an unaddressed potential consequence of the Me Too movement.
As both parties seek to ameliorate former racial injustices perpetrated by unjust courts and the war on drugs, the Me Too movement may create a new target criminal. To be sure, men guilty of rape deserve the harshest of punishments, but to believe all women puts black men at enormous risk for false imprisonment. Don’t Forget Tom Robinson
Expressed in Linden’s tweet is almost a progressive utilitarianism: the destruction of a few men justifies the liberation of hundreds of women. At face value, it may be hard to argue with, yet in the face of Robinson, the assertion crumbles.
Throughout the novel, Atticus can become a bit of a drag, a verbose moralizer. He stands as the novel’s moral center, though, and is the character from whom we, as readers, draw the final theme. He knows that to place Robinson behind bars not only perpetuates the plight of racism but is itself an instance of grave injustice.
I commend Western society for its push to bring a ubiquitous crime, sexual assault, into the light that it may be struck down, but, as with Atticus’ pity, this commendation ends when it puts an innocent man’s life in jeopardy. That all men must be punished or else the guilty will go free is a false dichotomy and misdirection. We cannot replace one injustice with another."
Google Ban On Claremont Institute Ad Is Another Black Eye For Big Tech,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/google-ban-claremont-institute-ad-another-black-eye-big-tech/,"May 7, 2019 By David Marcus
Last month, Ryan Williams, the president of the Claremont Institute, published an essay in The American Mind that argued multiculturalism is undermining traditional American values. I published a response here in The Federalist criticizing his thoughtful, well-written argument on a few significant points. My colleague, John Daniel Davidson, ran another article in The Federalist respectfully criticizing my objections. This is how discourse is supposed to work. But it seems Google is not aware of this.
Instead this week Google responded to the Williams article by denying the Claremont Institute the ability to purchase advertising for its 40th anniversary gala. This was the result of the American Mind bizarrely being labeled a racially or ethnically motivated publication, which the tech giant’s terms of service bar from running ads.
Yesterday Google’s acting director of political and stakeholder outreach told Claremont the label and refusal to sell advertising was a mistake, but only after several conservative outlets and half of conservative Twitter expressed outrage over the suppression of Claremont’s speech. That frankly just isn’t good enough. If this is happening to Claremont, then it is almost certainly happening to individuals and groups that cannot muster the support Claremont could to address the situation.
The real question here is how could such a mistake have been made in the first place? Was this the result of an algorithm? Or did some person or persons tag the American Mind for this treatment? Last year, the heads of both Twitter and Facebook testified before Congress about, among other things, political censorship on their platforms, Google was also invited to testify but declined the invitation.
Congress learned from the social media companies that they haven’t figured out how to police the content of millions of users without bias against conservatives. Twitter head Jack Dorsey was clearest in saying this bias against conservatives exists, but he offered no solution to the problem.
There are two basic ways that Internet companies flag content that supposedly violates their terms of service. First is reporting. It is possible that Google received complaints regarding Williams’ original essay, but in all likelihood Claremont was flagged using the second method, which is basically algorithms searching content for terms or phrases that make it more likely to be in violation.
In this case the term that most likely triggered the action was “multicultural,” which is interesting because the use of that word, or in my opinion the misuse of it, was at the core of my criticism of Williams’s essay. But whether one agrees with me or Williams on that issue, what all should be able to agree on is that there was nothing offensive or racialized about the way Williams uses that term. While historically “multicultural” has been used to describe societies becoming more racially diverse, Williams was clear that was not at the root of his usage. He was talking about something much closer to the idea of cultural relativism, in which traditional values are thrown overboard.
But why might a word like multicultural trigger a review in the first place? It might be a word that does appear in legitimately racist or offensive content, which is therefore captured by the algorithm. But the vast majority of the time the content Internet companies punish is right of center. So is the bias of typically progressive software employees driving the algorithm? Is Google, perhaps without even knowing it, importing or uploading a political worldview into its massive systems?
That would be bad, and seems likely to be the case. But it is not the worst part of this incident. The worst part is the American Mind was punished for engaging in exactly the kind of respectful discourse that our society needs to build greater understanding. If merely mentioning controversial words or subjects triggers a clampdown, how on earth is anyone supposed to even talk about those subjects? The result is not just a chilling of speech, it is to set barriers to the kind of discourse America so badly needs today.
I believe it was Ludwig Wittgenstein who said that language is not merely the vessel of our thought, it is also the driver. This is perhaps even more true for Internet companies, whose algorithms now make daily decisions about what materials we are and are not exposed to. Any kind of political bias in those systems can have dramatic effects, as Claremont found out.
Although Google’s reaction to Claremont is a particularly outrageous example of anti-conservative bias, it is far from an outlier. This is something conservatives have become accustomed to, but which we must not accept. Our outlets, our leadership, and our politicians must continue to keep tech companies’ feet to the fire on this issue. Conservatives have as much right to speak and make their case as the left does. As the Internet takes over more and more of our lives, we must work to ensure it is a place for lively and important debate, not a database of rightthink and wrongthink.

Trans Competitors In Women’s Sports Destroy What Women Have Won,thefederalist.com,Amelia Koehn,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/trans-competitors-womens-sports-destroy-women-won/,"May 7, 2019 By Amelia Koehn
Competing on the University of Iowa Women’s Rowing Team was one of the greatest experiences imaginable. I look back on those four years with a thankful heart for not only representing my state on the national stage but also developing a lasting sisterhood with the women I rowed with.
I can speak for the majority of female athletes when saying that sports have given women an outlet to better ourselves. Yet Democrats’ proposed Equality Act in the House of Representatives will completely alter women’s sports. The most poignant fact of H.R.5. is that if a biological man chooses so, even without receiving opposite-sex hormones, he can compete against a biological woman.
To think that a biological man who identifies as a woman can compete with us as if our bodies can be cheapened like this is not only insulting but also a direct assault on our selves as female athletes. We’re athletes who have trained to become the best versions of ourselves, and what we’ve achieved is being stolen by the hands of one whose feelings are deemed more worthy, according to a select few on the left. Under progressivism, a transgender individual’s desires must dominate women’s freedoms.
Men are indeed built differently than women. Males have larger internal organs than females, meaning they can pump more oxygen into their bodies, which yields higher athletic performance. And no, opposite-sex hormones do not hinder men’s physical advantage.
Men are also able to develop greater muscle mass while maintaining it more quickly. In fact, men have an average of 72.75 pounds of skeletal muscle mass while women have an average of 46.29 pounds . This larger amount of naturally occurring muscle mass not only provides an unfair advantage in a non-contact sport, but it can inflict injury on a woman in the heat of face-to-face competition.
These two scientifically proven facts confirm that men are more efficient and powerful in sports. This does not mean that women are not powerful and strong in their sports. Rather, we perform at a different level. These undeniable truths are the clearest unfair advantages that women must endure.
As these men move into transgenderism, they pump hormones into their bodies. Meanwhile, every other athlete must adhere to the NCAA rules and guidelines that clearly ban several different types of substances. Women who want to live as if they are men also take testosterone and other drugs to become larger, similar to that of a man’s body.
This puts the majority of non-hormone-using females at a disadvantage because the women who are using male hormones are able to perform at a higher degree with the assistance of drugs. Athletes are required to not consume certain over-the-counter vitamins and supplements in fear of being suspended from the team and not ever competing on the collegiate level again. Yet apparently they can take powerful hormones and still compete. The juxtaposition is absurd.
Many feminists oppose the Equality Bill. One outspoken critic of this bill, Julia Beck, a producer for Women’s Liberation Radio News, stated, “ Many well-intentioned people think that this concept of gender identity is the next frontier of social justice, but in reality it is regressive .” Beck continued, “Gender is based on rigid sex roles that legitimize male dominance and female subordination. The idea of a female or male brain only justifies treating women as subhuman.”
Many biological female athletes disapprove of biological males competing against women. Ana Paula Henkel, a former Brazilian Olympic volleyball player, argued against transgender men competing with women: “It represses, embarrasses, humiliates and excludes women.”
Believe it or not, there was a time women’s sports teams did not exist. Women had to strive and earn the right to have leagues of their own. They had the desire to compete, and they wanted to be treated fairly.
Today, we’ve won that right, only to have it threatened by men who think they can manipulate their bodies to appear female. If passed, the Equality Act will open the door for assaults on women, especially in athletics.
Now, the goal that women have worked for years to achieve—to compete in a collegiate sport—could result in their potential positions being stolen by a man who calls himself a woman. This could mean a loss in a scholarship and a pathway to college for a woman who was once a little girl shooting basketball hoops outside on her driveway or the little girl who ran on her gravel roads to get ready for her very first track meet.
Where are her rights? Where is her exclusive league? Where is her sisterhood? Female athletes still have these opportunities, but they are eroding and under further threat.

‘The Intruder’ Can’t Even Be Saved By Dennis Quaid’s Good Acting,thefederalist.com,Ron Capshaw,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/intruder-cant-even-saved-dennis-quaids-good-acting/,"May 7, 2019 By Ron Capshaw
Spoilers ahead.
Most actors have a bag of expressions they use to put an individual stamp on their roles. For Humphrey Bogart, it was a significant puff on a cigarette followed by rapid-fire dialogue. For Clark Gable, it was a tomcat smile, with eyebrows raised. For Errol Flynn, it was a “roguish grin.”
Closer to today, Tom Cruise routinely grips the shoulders of his leading ladies to express intensity. Clint Eastwood scowls and then delivers a tight-lipped hiss to show boiling anger.
In “The Intruder,” Dennis Quaid dispenses with his “good ol’ boy” grin, which he played on for quite a long time. It was first established when he was cast as rocket ace Gordo Cooper in the chest-thumping “The Right Stuff.” At its best, this grin could express supreme self-confidence as well as a cocky put-down of his competitors.
As the psychopathic stalker Charlie in “The Intruder,” Quaid instead uses his aging, craggy features to convey menace. Quaid never goes over the top. It is a controlled performance. He is as menacing when mowing the yard of the home he had to give up due to financial mismanagement as he is when hugging the shadows of this home, now occupied by an affluent African-America couple.
Unfortunately, Quaid is the only good part of the movie. As the yuppie couple, Scott Ealy and Megan Good do the best they can. The filmmakers do not use this racial role reversal (African-American yuppies in contrast to Quaid’s working class financial failure) for dramatic effect. The only concession to our current zeitgeist is by featuring Megan Good’s character as a writer focusing on “injustice and empowerment” for a women’s magazine. But the filmmakers are clearly bored with this idea, as they don’t show Good tapping as much as one laptop key.
It is a requirement for horror/slasher films that the characters exhibit a certain amount of stupidity. If they were smart they would never open the creaky door or go down the darkened stairs, thus depriving viewers of the horror.
But this movie has taken stupidity to new depths. Good is amazingly oblivious to Quaid’s growing sexual obsession with her. Not even his frequent uninvited appearances, usually coinciding with her businessman husband being out of town, cause her unease. She invites the clearly certifiable Quaid in for a pizza.
In “Pacific Heights,” Melanie Griffith did have trademark spacey moments, but she got villain Michael Keaton’s number from the start and began turning his conman games against him. Good has no alarm bells until pretty late in the film, even though Quaid, a much better actor than Keaton in displaying menace, has all but screamed he is going to shred her and her husband. She doesn’t have the wit to realize that the strange bumps in the night are because Quaid is living in their basement.
Ealy and Good do the best they can, but the lackluster script defeats them at every turn. This is unforgivable given that the screenwriter (David Loughery) was capable of complexity over cliché as in a much better film, “Lakeview Terrace .” Here he didn’t traffic in one-dimensional menace but gave the audience both sides of the characters.
Samuel Jackson, a much better actor than Ealy, was undoubtedly racist toward his new interracial neighbors in “Lakeview Terrace,” but the couple, Luke Wilson and Kerry Washington, complicated things by having sex in their pool within full view of Jackson, a single father valiantly trying to raise his daughter.
Quaid is an interesting and accomplished actor, not afraid to play against type. And it is clear he is having a ball playing a homicidal nut. Unfortunately, this is not enough to save a film that would have been derided even in the heyday of this genre—the ’90s."
Medical Research Finds A Way To Treat Babies With Spina Bifida In The Womb,thefederalist.com,Moira Gaul,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/medical-research-finds-way-treat-babies-spina-bifida-womb/,"By Moira Gaul May 7, 2019
Diagnosed during pregnancy with spina bifida, chromosomal abnormalities, and hydrocephalus, young Noah Wall has defied predictions from the British medical community.
Roughly midway through pregnancy, during a 20-week scan, Shelly and Rob Wall of Cumbria, England, were told that their son Noah had spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal cord doesn’t fully close. Damage to the spinal cord and nerves can result. While health outcomes vary depending on the type and severity of the condition, physical and intellectual disabilities can vary from mild to severe and include paralysis of the legs.
Noah’s parents were later informed that he had hydrocephalus, a condition involving an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. On five separate occasions during the pregnancy, doctors advised Shelly and Rob to terminate their son, Noah. The Walls say their doctors projected that their son would be severely disabled both mentally and physically and potentially unable to see, hear, and speak.
When Shelly went in for Noah’s birth, the hospital placed a non-resuscitation order on him. She says it “was an amazing day” and “we waited with bated breath.” Noah gave a loud and strong cry announcing his birth. An initial scan showed Noah’s brain was at 2 percent of a newborn’s brain. His latest scan at age three astoundingly reflects 80 percent of a child’s brain.
Celebrating his seventh birthday this March, Noah continues to spread hope with his effusive joy. He visits and takes gifts to children in the hospital where he stayed and updates his former doctors. His parents share their story of enduring love and perseverance against pressures to end Noah’s life.
Although paralyzed from the waist down at birth, Noah has been learning to move his legs. He hopes one day to both walk and even surf. His care has led the family to an Australian clinic where Noah had an assessment in the emerging field of neurophysics.
Noah’s mom, Shelly, now also advocates for increased awareness about the importance of early folic acid intake for pregnant moms and women hoping to conceive. Folic acid, a form of vitamin B, aids in proper neural tube development as a baby grows. The neural tube in an embryo develops into the baby’s brain and spinal cord and tissues enclosing them.
Since spina bifida is a birth defect where the spinal cord doesn’t fully close, maternal folic acid intake during (and before) pregnancy has been shown to reduce the risk of spina bifida as well as the defect anencephaly—also caused by a neural tube defect. Encouraging folic acid intake through both prenatal and preconception education is a critically important prevention initiative.
Innovative prenatal surgeries also show incredible promise for babies diagnosed in utero with spina bifida and other birth defects. As a new paper entitled “The Perinatal Revolution,” co-authored by two Charlotte Lozier Institute scholars and a colleague, highlights a major reason more parents should be hopeful from a recent study.
Myelomeningocele is spina bifida in its most severe form. Not only did the research demonstrate the effectiveness of prenatal surgery, but it also found that when performed earlier in pregnancy (before 26 weeks) babies fared better. The outcomes were so positive, they interrupted the study so treatment wouldn’t be denied to babies who were to receive standard postnatal surgery. Their findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1,645 babies are born with spina bifida each year in the United States According to EUROCAT data, in the United Kingdom in 2016, a total of 53 babies were born with this condition, another 90 were lost to induced abortion, and four more babies died naturally.
Officials with the British National Health Service (NHS) announced in late 2018 that in utero spinal surgery for some unborn babies diagnosed with spina bifida will be made available in England for the first time in April 2019. It is surmised that the NHS will determine which babies may undergo the surgery and receive care. In-Utero Surgery Helped Elouise Simpson
Elouise Simpson, a baby girl who received one of the pioneering spina bifida surgeries in the womb at University College Hospital in London in February, was born on April 1 , and has now gone home with her parents. Bethan Simpson, Elouise’s mom and a mental health nurse, said she and her husband were advised to terminate their daughter following the spina bifida diagnosis.
But “I couldn’t justify terminating a child I could feel kicking,” she said. Little Elouise has shown no signs of spina bifida since birth and the in utero surgery has been deemed a success.
Stories like Noah Wall’s indicate that medical projections following a serious diagnosis during pregnancy are not always correct. The courage and love Noah’s parents demonstrated to fight to give their little boy a chance at life, despite the odds and contrary to the medical advice provided seven years ago, should encourage parents who receive such a serious diagnosis. The family interview on “Good Morning Britain” recounting their journey has endeared Noah and his parents to the public as an inspiration for hope and life.

Free The Students. Sink The Colleges,thefederalist.com,Daniel Oliver,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/free-students-sink-colleges/,"By Daniel Oliver May 7, 2019
Senator Elizabeth “Feathers” Warren has called for forgiving student loans, a proposal first made here back in 2014. But Warren would eliminate only $50,000 of student debt, and only for students whose income was less than $100,000, approximately 42 million people.
Of course, being Sen. Warren, she has also proposed that the government cover all tuition at all two-year and four-year colleges, and—well it goes on and on, essentially socializing the cost of everything, probably including toothpaste, chewing gum, and wampum belts.
The cost of the debt-forgiveness part of her proposal is said to be $640 billion. (Total student debt is estimated at $1.56 trillion.)
Just because Warren has latched onto the idea doesn’t make it kooky—though we are right to suspect anything that the first faculty member of color at Harvard Law School says.
Donald Trump should steal this idea, feathers and all, for the 2020 campaign.
Part Two of the original proposal (at, to repeat, here ) was that the federal government would pay for the loan cancellations by eliminating most of its grants to higher education institutions. Today total federal support of education is about $102.5 billion a year.
People who are skeptical of Part Two need to understand something about “higher” education: for most people it is worthless, as education. Completely worthless . And actually, worse than worthless because it corals young people into institutions for two or four of their most formative years where they learn absolutely nothing ! And wind up in debt up to their keisters.
In his book, The Case Against Education , Bryan Caplan makes, inter alia, two important points. The first is that students learn nothing: “Barely half of American adults,” he writes, “know the Earth goes around the sun.” Read that again, slowly, and contemplate the usefulness of a college education.
We should not be surprised. Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa in their book, Academically Adrift , agree with Caplan (“American education is characterized by limited or no learning for a large proportion of students”) and suggest why. “On average, [students] report spending only 12 hours per week studying.” Arum and Roksa also tell us that “fifty percent of the students in our sample reported that they had not taken a single course during the prior semester that required more than twenty pages of writing, and one third had not taken one that required even forty pages of reading per week.”
Bryan Caplan’s second point is that education is all about credentialing. “The labor market doesn’t pay you for the useless subjects you master;” he writes, “it pays you for the preexisting traits you reveal by mastering them.”
The education racket is all about the “sheepskin” effect. Graduates of the twelfth grade in high school earn more than graduates of only the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades combined . In college the sheepskin effect is even more pronounced: graduates earn more than twice as much as students who complete only one, two, or three years combined !
One theory—only a congressman could believe it—is that the teachers or professors save all the really important information for the last year. Horse feathers!
If college is all about credentialing, why not find another way to credential the nation’s young people? Why not make tasks available that would allow Johnny to show that he has the grit to stick with a difficult job?
Why not create service opportunities for young people to engage in, in addition to military service? They could work at senior citizen institutions, hospitals, high schools, or any number of other charitable institutions that serve the public. The work could be demanding: show up on time; learn specific skills; take responsibility. “Undergraduates in Service to America—USA all the way.” William F. Buckley Jr. wrote a whole book about it in 1990 called Gratitude .
Service would not be mandatory, of course—no indentured servitude. It would simply be an opportunity for young people to show what four years of college shows prospective employers now: that the “student” has the fortitude to persevere.
The feds could even “subsidize” part of the program by not taxing the income of people under the age of twenty-two in such a program.
Young people with good jobs and without huge loans could move out of their parents’ basements (or teepees), get married, have children, and lead normal, productive lives—the way Americans used to.
If a few big corporations started accepting as evidence of maturity and perseverance a work substitute for a sheepskin, the change could happen like a California wildfire.
By stopping support to higher education, the federal government could pay for the debt cancellation in less than a decade—much, much less if the government forgave only the first $10,000 of debt, which would eliminated the debt of about a third of borrowers.
But note that a key part of the proposal is stopping payments to the nation’s colleges. Those institutions, bloated with high-paid administrators, diversity deans, and grievance counselors, are the fever swamps of the Left, inculcating young people in big government, socialist, and often anti-American nostrums. Stopping that is worth twice the price.
This is a win-win-win proposition for Republicans: Get the students to vote Republican; save a generation or several generations of young people from wasting four important years in colleges where they will learn almost nothing; and defund the Left’s higher ed propaganda machine.

CNN Contributor Insanely Claims Unborn Babies Aren't Human,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/pro-abortion-cnn-contributor-insanely-claims-unborn-babies-arent-even-human/,"May 7, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
On CNN’s “Primetime with Chris Cuomo” on Monday night, a segment on the legality of state-level fetal heartbeat bills quickly spiraled into a chaotic debate about whether unborn children should be considered human beings. CNN contributor and erstwhile New York City Democratic politician Christine Quinn said, “When a woman is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her.”
When guest Rick Santorum asked CNN Host Chris Cuomo if he disagreed “that at the moment of conception that a child is human and alive?” Cumono replied that means it’s “viable.” When Santorum asked, “Is it biologically a human life?” Quinn shouted, “No!”
Cuomo and Quinn teamed up in pushing back on Santorum as he articulated what science tells us about unborn humans. At every stage of human life — as an embryo, a fetus, or after five weeks of age when his or her heartbeat can be detected by an ultrasound — an unborn child has his or her own unique DNA.
He or she has a unique genetic code, blood type, sex, and race, all which can differ from his or her mother and father’s. This unique individual is developed inside a women’s body, but is not part of a women’s body, and cannot be regulated as the mother’s property, Santorum argued.
“Her body is always her property,” Cuomo said, missing the point entirely.
“When a women is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her. It is part of her body,” Quinn said. “This is about a women having full agency and control of her body…and making decisions about what is part of her body with medical professionals.”
The right to abortion is just that — the right to kill unborn humans. But pro-abortionists like Quinn and Cuomo find it easier to argue that they are fighting for “reproductive rights” (even though pro-lifers are not objecting to any woman’s right to reproduce) or that fetuses are not humans but “clumps of cells.” Just as with slave owners and eugenicists before them, it’s easier for pro-abortionists to advocate for murder after they’ve dehumanized the lives they want to end.

How Overemphasizing Individualism Made Liberalism Morally Bankrupt,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/overemphasizing-individualism-made-liberalism-morally-bankrupt/,"By Nathanael Blake May 8, 2019
Only liberals can save liberalism. They do not seem up to the task, and their failure leaves liberalism languishing in decadence.
Political liberalism — broadly understood in terms of representative government, individual rights, and personal autonomy — should be an easy sell in an era of prosperity, technological marvels, and comparative peace, especially after the totalitarian horrors of the last century. But, from the ballot box to academia, liberals are struggling to respond to rivals and critics who contend that liberalism has not lived up to its promises.
For example, consider writer Gabriel Schoenfeld’s recent essay in The American Interest attacking critics of liberalism, particularly Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen and his book “ Why Liberalism Failed .” Schoenfeld makes two significant critiques of Deneen and his fellow travelers. The first is that their condemnations of modern liberalism do not account for historical context—today has flaws, but yesterday did, too, often worse. The second is that Deneen and his allies do not offer reasonable alternatives to liberalism; they tend to either dodge the question or else indulge in flights of fancy, such as theories of Catholic integralism .
These criticisms have some merit, and Schoenfeld avoids conflating technological progress with moral progress, making his one of the better responses to Deneen. He also deserves credit for recognizing the illiberalism of many on the left, including President Obama’s efforts to force nuns to fund and facilitate the distribution of birth control and the obsession with compelling nonconformist, devoutly religious wedding vendors to celebrate same-sex marriage ceremonies.
But Schoenfeld does not address the fundamental failures of modern liberalism because he believes there are none. He believes that although everything may not be awesome yet, overall life is better than it used to be. He is right that many current complainers are ignorant of the past and its problems, but he falls into the opposite error and seems oblivious to the worst evils of modern liberalism. What in today’s liberalism might compare with the atrocities of earlier eras? In his view: nothing. Our Age Embraces Atrocities, Too
He thus ignores the tens of millions dismembered in utero to secure the personal sexual autonomy that today’s liberalism cherishes above all else. Abortion is a veiled brutality that enables the modern liberal way of life. It gives the lie to Schoenfeld’s conclusion that “even if a gap persists between our ideals and practices, in any fair appraisal it has narrowed significantly from 100 or 200 years ago.”
In modern liberal regimes, the mother who marvels at an ultrasound revealing the movements of her child in the eighth week of pregnancy also has an absolute sovereign right to order that child’s death. But Schoenfeld declares ours to be “the most humane socio-political order ever to grace the face of the earth.” If human persons in utero have moral worth, then these paeans to liberalism’s moral progress are sung from the hymnbooks of Hell.
Just as a liberalism that endorsed slavery could not endure, so too a degenerate liberalism that embraces abortion deserves to be consigned to the ash heap of history. Abortion illuminates this moral blind spot in modern liberalism, but the problem extends throughout liberal theorizing about family and community, which has denigrated and dissolved familial and community bonds since at least John Locke. The Problem with Children and Family
Children and family have always been a problem for liberal political theory, which is centered on autonomous adults. Children are not born free and rational, but dependent and irrational, and liberal political theory has long struggled to address human development and dependence.
In particular, the developing human person’s specific dependence on the mother is an insoluble problem for modern liberalism. Human life in the womb can only exist and develop by imposing upon the mother’s body, regardless of her consent. Modern liberalism will not accept this loss of bodily autonomy (even if it usually arises as a natural and predictable result of consensual sex) and has chosen to secure the mother’s rights under the liberal regime by negating the child’s right to life.
Liberalism cannot keep all of its promises. Thus, a political philosophy that began by claiming to defend rights and liberty for all ends, has started denying the rights of the most vulnerable, in an ironic twist. As a political theory for rational, autonomous adults, liberalism has no place for the dependent and disabled, against whom Western liberal nations are engaged in a quiet genocide .
The failure to adequately address human dependence and vulnerability has left liberalism in a moral morass. Liberal apologists on both the left and the right may not care. Many of them even approve. GOP elites, for instance, are more socially liberal than the rank-and-file, hence their constant efforts to marginalize social conservatives. But they should not be mystified that those who value nascent human life doubt that today’s abortion-dependent liberalism is “the most humane socio-political order ever to grace the face of the earth.”
Liberalism’s disdain for the dependent is the inevitable product of its contempt for all constraints on adult autonomy. Liberalism sees the ties of family, community, and church as bonds to be overcome (often by state intervention) in the cause of autonomous individualism. In practice, as well as in philosophy, it has become decadent because it scorned obligations to its progeny and dissolved the sources from which it could be renewed.
This civilizational exhaustion is exemplified by the liberal West facing demographic disaster. In a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity, many people refuse to have children. Decadence is evident throughout the cultural and political elites of Western liberal nations. Examples of ineptitude, arrogance, insularity, and self-indulgence abound, and they are increasingly illiberal in their efforts to defend a desiccated and exhausted liberalism. Populists Sense the Decadence of Liberalism
The populist backlash throughout the West is a symptom of this decadence, not its cause. Although populists often lack the theoretical acumen of a scholar like Deneen or the moral clarity of pro-life activists, they sense the decadence permeating the liberal order. They see it in the dissolution of national, as well as familial, bonds. It is evident in the casual acceptance, even celebration, of the destruction of local economies and communities in the service of globalization.
This is why criticism of the follies and rough edges of populist leaders rarely dissuade their supporters. If the status quo and those perpetuating it are unacceptable, then many traits of the alternatives may be forgiven. Emphasizing President Trump’s many flaws will not persuade those who are convinced of the general decadence of our political and cultural order.
Although there are sycophants, fools, and hacks who, for example, burble about how “godly” Trump is, many who acknowledge the president’s sins still have come to support him as the best available option . This support is reinforced every time that those with platforms and power refuse to hold themselves and their class accountable, and instead berate ordinary voters who have little political power or cultural cache. It is amusing to watch politicians and pundits who are veterans of a hundred moral compromises declare themselves the last principled men in Washington.
Scolding and shaming populist outbursts against the liberal order will not save liberalism. Scholarly critics of liberalism will not be lectured into submission. Liberalism will survive and prosper only if liberals are able to address the critiques of philosophers and the concerns of populists.
There may be hope for revitalized liberalism. There are strands of liberal theory and practice that can be rewoven to account for human dependence and the non-voluntary ties at the heart of human existence. But this cultural and political renewal will only arise if liberalism’s current defenders take its critics seriously and (harder still) repent of their wrongs. If they try to hold their positions and defend decadent liberalism, they will either lose or, worse still, become illiberal and despotic in their victory.

Mueller's 10 Most Egregious Missteps During Anti-Trump Russia Probe,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/robert-muellers-10-egregious-missteps-anti-trump-russia-investigation/,"By Margot Cleveland May 8, 2019
The release of the special counsel’s report in April exposed several significant missteps Robert Mueller made over the last two years. Last week’s testimony by Attorney General William Barr before the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed these blunders and bared additional concerns with Mueller’s handling of the probe into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and President Trump’s supposed collusion and obstruction of justice.
Here are ten. 1. Mueller Spent $30 Million But Didn’t Do His Job
The special counsel probe reportedly cost more than $30 million, yet Mueller failed to do his job. Federal regulations expressly provide that at the conclusion of the special counsel’s work he must “provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.”
But in Volume 2 of the special counsel report, which addressed whether Trump obstructed justice, Mueller “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment” of whether “to initiate or decline a prosecution.” Instead, Mueller passed the prosecutorial buck and spent some 200 pages sliming Trump.
During an earlier press conference, Barr stressed that Mueller had flouted his prosecutorial responsibilities by rendering a non-decision: “The very prosecutorial function and all our powers as prosecutors, including the power to convene grand juries and compulsory process that’s involved there, is for one purpose only. It’s to determine yes or no, was alleged conduct criminal or not criminal. That is our responsibility and that’s why we have the tools we have. And we don’t go through this process just to collect information and throw it out to the public.”
Barr reiterated this point during last week’s hearing, again stressing that the special counsel “was appointed to carry out the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Department.” The attorney general noted that both he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were “surprised” when they first learned Mueller would not make a decision about obstruction, and he called it “irresponsible” to release Mueller’s report without providing such a decision.
The attorney general continued: “The function of the Department of Justice in this arena is to determine whether or not there has been criminal conduct. It’s a binary decision. Is there enough evidence to show a crime and do we believe a crime has been committed? We don’t conduct criminal investigations just to collect information and put it out to the public. We do so to make a decision.” 2. Mueller’s Non-Decision Rationale Was Incomprehensible
Not only did Mueller violate the controlling special counsel regulation by issuing a non-decision decision, he couldn’t coherently explain his rationale for doing so. During the recent hearing, Barr made this point in responding to Sen. Chuck Grassley’s question of whether Barr agreed with Mueller’s reasons for not deciding on obstruction of justice.
“I’m not really sure of his reasoning,” Barr replied. “I really could not recapitulate his analysis.”
Later, when Sen. John Kennedy asked the attorney general to explain again why Mueller said he couldn’t make up his mind on obstruction, Barr repeated, “I really couldn’t recapitulate it.”
“It was unclear to us when we first discussed it on March 5—the deputy was with me—and we didn’t really get a clear understanding of the reasoning,” Barr told the Judiciary Committee. And even after reading the final special counsel report, Barr noted, he still wasn’t “sure exactly what the full line of reasoning is” for not rendering a prosecutorial decision. 3. Mueller Continued to Investigate Obstruction Knowing No Prosecutorial Decision Would Be Forthcoming
During the Judiciary Committee hearing, Barr added a third criticism of Mueller’s non-decision decision, testifying: “The other thing that was confusing to me was that the investigation carried out for a while as additional episodes were looked into, episodes involving the president. So my question is or was ‘Why were those investigated if at the end of the day you weren’t going to reach a decision on them?’”
Barr reiterated this point in a later exchange with Grassley, stating that if Mueller “felt that he should not go down the path of making a traditional prosecutive decision, then he should have investigated. That was the time to pull up.”
But he didn’t. Instead, Mueller continued the investigation through the midterm elections and crafted a 200-page screed painting Trump’s conduct as consistent with criminal obstruction of justice. 4. Mueller Applied the Wrong Standard
Barr highlighted another Mueller mistake in an exchange with Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Blumenthal began it by quoting Mueller’s claim that “if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” The Democrat senator then confronted Barr with his decision to “in effect clear [] the president on both so-called collusion and obstruction of justice.”
Barr’s counter was devastating, both to Blumenthal and Mueller: “The difference is I used the proper standard,” he retorted. Barr went on to explain that Mueller’s statement “is actually a very strange statement.”
“The report says that they could not be sure they could clearly say that [Trump] did not violate the law,” Barr continued, before stressing, “as you know that’s not the standard, we use in the criminal justice system.” Rather, “it’s presumed that someone is innocent, and the government has to prove that they clearly violated the law. We’re not in the business of exoneration, not in the business of proving they’d didn’t violate the law—I found that whole passage very bizarre.”
Sen. Thom Tillis later returned to this point, first noting that the special counsel concluded it could not exonerate the president on obstruction. “When is a special counsel in the business of exonerating a subject on an investigation?” Tillis queried Barr. “They are not,” the attorney general replied. 5. Mueller Got Obstruction Law Wrong Too
One of the problems with Mueller’s approach to the question of obstruction of justice, Barr explained during the hearing, was the special counsel “trying to determine the subjective intent of a facially lawful act.” That approach “permits a lot of selectivity on the part of the prosecutors, and it’s been shot down in a number of other contexts.”
While Barr did not further expand during the hearing on Mueller’s misinterpretation of the law, he had previously destroyed the idea that Trump’s conduct could constitute criminal obstruction of justice. 6. Mueller Sent His Boss a ‘Snitty’ Letter
Mueller submitted his special counsel report to Barr on March 22, but that report could not be made public until necessary redactions were made. Pending the redactions, Barr released a letter on March 24, announcing Mueller’s conclusion: no collusion, and no decision on obstruction of justice.
Mueller didn’t like the way Barr’s letter was playing in the press, so he sent a letter on March 27, complaining to his boss that Barr’s March 24 letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions,” and asking Barr to release the executive summaries of the special counsel report. ‘Bob, what is with the letter? Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there is an issue?’
The public did not learn of Mueller’s March 27 letter until the day before Barr hit the Hill to discuss the special counsel’s findings, when the Washington Post published a leaked copy of Mueller’s letter. The timing proved politically expedient: Mueller’s criticism of Barr dominated the news cycle in the lead up to the hearing, and Democrats hammered Barr throughout the hearing for his supposed misrepresentation of the special counsel’s report.
While this tactic may have pleased some partisans, Barr’s response resonated with the open-minded. When asked his reaction to the letter, Barr testified that he called Mueller, “I said, ‘Bob, what is with the letter? Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there is an issue?’” The attorney general added that “the letter is a bit snitty and it was probably written by one of his staff people.”
On the merit of Mueller’s complaint, Barr explained during the hearing that he asked the special counsel if “he was suggesting that the March 24th letter was inaccurate and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate and that the press was reading too much into it.”
In short, Mueller wanted Barr to counter the media’s coverage by issuing the executive summaries from the special counsel report. But Barr told Mueller he “was not interested in putting out summaries and wasn’t going to put out the report piecemeal.” “I wanted to get the whole report out,” Barr explained, which he did on April 18.
In a head-to-head contest, Barr came off the bigger man, with the leak of Mueller’s letter harming the special counsel’s reputation much more than that of the attorney general.
Further, while sending a snitty letter to the attorney general was a dumb move, even dumber was putting pen to paper to complain that Barr’s letter announcing the conclusion of the special counsel “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the report. This complaint was a tacit acknowledgement that the special counsel’s 200-page discussion of obstruction of justice served solely to show one thing: orange man bad. 7. Mueller Made Some Horrendous Staffing Choices
The letter incident proved yet another problem with Mueller’s handling of the probe: his horrendous staffing choices. That Mueller would pick a team of “professionals” who would think it wise to draft the snitty letter, then convince Mueller to send it to his boss—or lacked the good sense to counsel against the move—speaks poorly of the man charged with investigating the president. 8. Mueller Could Have Previewed Barr’s Letter But Didn’t
While Mueller had no problem criticizing Barr’s March 24 letter after the fact, the special counsel demurred when Barr sought his input before he released the letter to Congress and the American people.
“I offered Bob Mueller the opportunity to review that letter before it went out, and he declined,” Barr explained in his opening statement. It takes some chutzpah to refuse to review a letter before it is dispatched, only to criticize it after the fact! 9. Mueller’s Team Was Responsible for Report Delay
In his March 27 complaint letter to Barr, Mueller bemoaned the media’s narrative and asked Barr to release the executive summaries of the special counsel report while the attorney general went through the necessary redaction process. As noted above, Barr refused because he wanted to get the full report out as soon as possible, which he did on April 18. Mueller delayed the report release much beyond what would have been needed had he just done his job.
However, had Mueller done his job, the special counsel report could have been issued much earlier, thereby truncating the media spin of which Mueller complained. Barr made this point in his opening statement to the Judiciary Committee, explaining that when he met with Mueller in early March “I reiterated to Special Counsel Mueller that in order to have the shortest possible time before I was in a position to release the report, I asked that they identify 6E materials,” which are grand jury materials that statute prohibits from release.
Barr had asked that Mueller identity the 6E material “so we could redact the material and prepare the report for public release as quickly as we could.” But as Barr explained to the committee, “Unfortunately it did not come in that form . . . so there was necessarily going to be a gap between the receipt of the report and getting the full report out publicly.”
By failing to identify the grand jury material in the special counsel report—as his boss had requested—Mueller delayed the report release much beyond what would have been needed had he just done his job. “The problem we had,” as Barr explained, was “we could not identify the 6E material when the report came over. We needed the help of Mueller’s team.” 10. Mueller Didn’t Investigate (Or Report On) All Russian Interference
Mueller’s final misstep was the step not taken. Even though he was charged with investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, Mueller’s report omitted any discussion of whether the Kremlin fed dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation about Donald Trump. As I wrote on Monday:
Not once in the 448-page tome does Mueller mention an investigation into whether Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election by feeding dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation.
But Mueller also did not charge Steele with lying to the FBI, or refer a criminal case against Steele to federal prosecutors, as he did when the special counsel uncovered evidence of criminal misconduct unrelated to the 2016 election. Given Mueller’s conclusion that no one connected to the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election, one of those two scenarios must be true—either Russia fed Steele disinformation or Steele lied to the FBI about his Russian sources.
These ten missteps make clear that Mueller wasn’t the right man for the job. But Barr is. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Chris Cuomo Says Pro-Life More About 'Faith And Feeling Than Fact',thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/apple-banana-chris-cuomo-says-pro-life-movement-faith-feeling-fact/,"May 8, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
Chris Cuomo is an “anchor” at CNN. On Tuesday, with all the casualness of a lunch order he revealed a significant personal bias about one of today’s most contentious political issues.
Defending his performance in this absurd Monday segment with Christine Quinn, Cuomo fired off a tweet worth bookmarking. Although conservatives had been circulating the Quinn clip critically for hours, the critique to which he was responding actually came from the left. Disingenuous? No. There is certainly a need to explain the medical realities of the procedures and the risks to women of losing access to care but this is about politics mostly – and the pro- life position is more about faith and feeling than fact. But I pursue both avenues https://t.co/iTO2VQZwhh
— Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) May 7, 2019
And there it is: “the pro-life position is more about faith and feeling than fact.” That’s obviously fine as the banal dorm room musings of a college freshman. As a prime-time news anchor’s stated position on abortion, it’s bananas ( horrible pun intended ).
The beauty of Twitter is that its immediacy tempts journalists like Cuomo into exposing these biases. If he insists on covering abortion, I’d rather know about his misguided condescension for the pro-life movement than wonder about it. Indeed, tweets like these help us understand why segments like the one that precipitated this debate happen the first place. It’s also perfectly fine for journalists to share their personal opinions—when they identify as opinion journalists.
Cuomo does not. His title at CNN is “anchor.” His bio on the network’s website reads, “Chris Cuomo anchors CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time, a 9pm nightly news program where Cuomo tests power with newsmakers and politicians from both sides of the aisle, and reports on the latest breaking news from Washington and around the world.”
He is not Rachel Maddow; he is not Sean Hannity. In fact, he openly distinguishes himself from both of them. “Maddow’s a professor, Hannity’s a preacher. … I was built for the battle,” he recently told The Hollywood Reporter. “You are rarely hearing my opinion on television,” Cuomo asserted to Rolling Stone last year, lamenting that “Politics was easier to cover when people weren’t so blatantly abusive of facts.”
Whatever your position, abortion, of course, is no minor issue. It’s one of the most important policy questions to both parties. Now we know an “anchor” at the “Facts First” network is completely biased against one side.
If you’re one of CNN’s few remaining viewers , remember Cuomo’s take on abortion next time he covers it. The conversation will probably make a lot more sense. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."

Everything Seth Meyers Said About Ilhan Omar Is Wrong,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/everything-seth-meyers-said-about-ilhan-omar-is-wrong/,"By David Harsanyi May 8, 2019
During Meghan McCain’s appearance on Seth Meyers’“Late Night” this week, the two got into a bit of an argument over the former’s criticism of Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitism.
“I do think it’s fairly dangerous and you brought it up after Congresswoman Omar had some death threats against her,” Meyers lectured McCain, who held her own in the back and forth. “Do you think, you know, she has obviously now stated that she needs to be more careful with her language, don’t you think other people who talk about her need to be more thoughtful as well? Or do you stand by those comments of tying her to this, her rhetoric to this synagogue shooting?”
The first part of this rhetorical question is setting up a destructive standard to undermine debate. For one thing, a public figure—an elected official, no less—has no dispensation from criticism merely because some nut sends her a death threat. Nor is there any indulgence for being a Muslim woman or black women or white middle-aged man, or anyone else. Omar is a 37-year-old educated woman who was elected to the U.S. Congress, not a middle schooler playacting in the Model U.N.
McCain condemned Omar’s words. She didn’t concoct a smear.
For another, we know Meyers’s standard is a transparent tactic to chill speech because of its selective deployment. Progressives didn’t stop arguing that Republicans were really just a bunch of fascists trying steal health care from the poor minority babies after a leftist shooter tried to assassinate the entire Republican leadership on a softball field in Alexandria, Virginia. Neither did Meyers, nor anyone else, stop perpetuating the fantastical notion that Trump conspired with Russia to steal the election just because the president receives death threats every day.
“Trump is a Traitor,” the shooter, James Hodgkinson, wrote on Facebook before the shooting. “Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” This sounds like any number of Twitter feeds from liberal columnists. No one feels the slightest bit inhibited.
Furthermore, Omar never really apologized. And even if she did, so what? Would Meyers care if Steve King was really, really sorry for his previous statements, or would he care more about the congressman’s policy positions?
Sure, Democratic House leadership pressured Omar to put together the words “unequivocally” and “apologize,” but those words were a precursor to a textbook “I’m-sorry-you-were-offended” non-apology. Listening to Omar and her defenders, you might be under the impression that her allegedly unintentional use of “tropes,” not the ugly ideas that gird her worldview, was what triggered many American Jews.
If you doubt this is true, listen to her own explanation. When Qatari mouthpiece Mehdi Hasan asked her if she had apologized for being either knowingly or unknowingly anti-Semitic, Omar responded: “Absolutely not. I apologized for the way that my words made people feel.”
Omar’s words make me feel like we have a congresswoman who peddles policy ideas that will get Jews killed. Her words make me feel like I’m listening to the kind of ideas about America that had long been relegated to college campuses.
Meyers also asked a misleading rhetorical question about whether people could be “critical” of Israel without being called anti-Semitic. Virtually every member of the Barack Obama administration was critical of Israel. Tons of people are critical of Israel all the time. Omar wasn’t merely critical of Israel—and by critical of Israel, it is true that she doesn’t believe it should exist—but she smeared American Jews as seditious activists.
So I’m sorry, but your condolences over the synagogue shooting in Poway, California, don’t really hold sway when the next week you defend terrorists who fire more than 700 rockets into Israel, killing at least four people for no other reason than that they were Jews.
Yet it’s not just the Jews. And it’s not merely that Omar dismissed the al-Qaida mass murderers as “some people” who “did something.” (Meyers claims that her comments were taken out of context, which is true. They are worse in context .) It’s not only that she referred to the dozen dead U.S. soldiers and 73 wounded in the Battle of Mogadishu as participants in the “worst terrorist attack in Somalia history” and the murderer of thousands (false). It’s not that Omar blames the United States rather than authoritarianism and socialism for the devastation in Venezuela. It’s all these things. Omar dislikes America and liberalism for the same reasons she dislikes Israel.
“I’m just someone who cares about the fact that there’s someone out there who is in a minority, who has had death threats against her, and I think that we should all use the same language,” Myers said. “You’re asking her to be careful about her language, and I would ask everyone to be careful about theirs.”
What makes people think Omar isn’t careful? Maybe she’s just being honest about what she thinks of Jews. And why should her critics have trepidation about calling her out? Democrats, including nearly every presidential candidate, have defended her. They have celebrated her. They have appeared on magazine covers with her. The idea that McCain put her in danger, as Meyers suggested , is just a way to try and shut people up."
