"State Rep. William Lamberth Completely Overhauls Public Records Bill, Creating Increased Government Transparency - Tennessee Star",tennesseestar.com,Laura Baigert,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/state-rep-william-lamberth-completely-overhauls-public-records-bill-creating-increased-government-transparency/,"State Rep. William Lamberth has completely overhauled a public records bill that received significant public outcry to a version that creates increased government transparency.
Rep. Lamberth (R-Portland), who is also the House Republican Majority Leader, initially drafted HB 0626 to protect government employees from abusive requesters. As The Tennessee Star reported , the original bill would limit public records access to as few as three requests per year, and that proposal was met with backlash on social media.
While government watchdogs and media might have disagreed with the measure that may have appeared to be directed toward them, Leader Lamberth was requested to assist in dealing with a situation where certain records custodians in his district are being intimidated and harassed, an issue for which there is no current remedy.
The five-page amendment that makes the bill seeks to balance public records requests that constitute harassment with improving the public‚Äôs access to basic government records.
The most recent version of the proposed legislation would allow a public records custodian to pursue judicial relief from a public records requestor, with clear and convincing evidence that the records requests constitute harassment.
The measure defines harassment as 12 or more public records requests to the same government entity within a one-year period that are also made in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to feel seriously abused, intimidated, threatened or harassed; that the conduct, in fact, seriously abuses, intimidates, threatens or harasses the person; and that the requests are not made in good faith, are made maliciously or are not made for any legitimate purpose.
Legitimate purpose is further explained as including, but not limited to the gathering of information for the purpose of publication or broadcast; investigating or evaluating a legitimate claim or potential claim against a government entity, its agents or employees; or using the information for a commercial purpose.
The remedy would be for the government entity to charge the harassing requestor for a period of one year for the viewing of public records, as if they had requested copies of the records.
That government entity will have to provide a written report to the Tennessee Comptroller‚Äôs Office of Open Records Counsel no later than three months after the petition to the court has been made.
The Comptroller‚Äôs Office of Open Records Counsel will track the reports and provide a summary to the Advisory Committee on Open Government to enable an evaluation as to the use of the process.
To facilitate access to public records, the second part of Leader Lamberth‚Äôs proposed legislation also requires that government entities that have a website will have to provide basic information on that website by January 1, 2020.
The basic information government entities would provide on their website would include meeting agendas that clearly describe the matters to be discussed or decided with the associated documents at least 48 hours in advance and draft meeting minutes or contact information for the purpose of obtaining draft minutes, if approved minutes are not yet available.
Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee on Open Government will provide a report and recommendations to the Tennessee General Assembly by January 1, 2021, as to what basic information is available to citizens on governmental websites.
The basic information for each that should be provided for each government entity that will be reported on by the Advisory Committee on Open Government includes:
Contact information of elected officials Agendas of upcoming meetings as well as at least the 12 most recent meetings Documents provided in a packet to the governing body in advance of an upcoming meeting as well as the 12 most recent meetings Current and previous five annual budgets Current and previous five comprehensive annual financial reports and audits, including summaries or information that provides an explanation and context to the financial reports Charter or other organizing or governing documents of the government entity Policies, rules, ordinances or resolutions governing the public meetings, hearings and records of the governing body Contact information for the party responsible for more information about public meetings, hearings and records, including the name and phone number of each person Contact information of the public records custodian Lamberth‚Äôs HB 0626 passed out of the Civil Justice Subcommittee and is scheduled to be heard in the full House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, April 10. The companion Senate bill SB 0590 sponsored by Senator Ferrell Haile (R-Gallatin) is scheduled to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, April 9.
Another public records bill HB 0665, sponsored by Rep. Jeremy Faison (R-Cosby) prohibits a government entity from entering into a confidentiality agreement with a third party in regards to records that are otherwise considered open to the public and are not otherwise considered confidential or protected under state or federal law.
In presenting the amendment that makes the bill, Rep. Faison said the measure codifies current law allowing a citizen to find out what a payout was after the fact, excluding anything to do with economic development and any current protections under the law.
There are 564 exceptions to Tennessee‚Äôs public records laws as of August 2018, up from 538 in January 2018. The additional 26 exceptions came about during the 2018 legislative session.
Rep. Faison‚Äôs bill passed out of the House Public Service & Employees Subcommittee and is headed for the House State Committee on Tuesday, April 9. The companion Senate bill, SB 0478, sponsored by Senator Todd Gardenhire (R-Chattanooga) is scheduled to be heard in the Senate State and Local Government Committee the same day.
As reported previously by The Star , another bill sponsored by Rep. Martin Daniel (R-Knoxville) under HB 0370 that would have prohibited businesses that receive taxpayer funds to determine what becomes public information by claiming ‚Äútrade secret‚Äù failed in the House Public Service & Employees Subcommittee on March 20.

After months of speculation, former New Japan Pro Wrestling standout Kushida was revealed as the latest signee to NXT.
The Japanese Superstar was introduced during a press conference before Takeover: New York. Triple H and NXT General Manager William Regal were on hand to show off their new acquisition.
You can watch the video below.
WWE
Yujiro Kushida is a former IWGP Junior Heavyweight champion who last wrestled for NJPW in January. After dropping the title to Taiji Ishimori at Wrestle Kingdom 13, the wrestler announced he would not renew his contract with the promotion when it expired at the end of January 2019.
""As Sugabayashi said, I will leave NJPW on January 31. This was an extremely tough condition made with Meij, Sugabayashi and Kidani,"" Kushida said following Wrestle Kingdom. ""It was a very big decision in my life and I‚Äôm thankful they understood. I will head overseas and to see the world of pro wrestling.""
His final match with NJPW was at the Road To The New Beginning show where he would fall to Hiroshi Tanahashi.
Dave Meltzer reported on his Wrestling Observer radio show in January that he was confident Kushida would go to WWE‚Äôs NXT brand. His sources said the company was aggressively trying to sign the Japanese superstar.
With the likely departures of NXT stars Aleister Black and Ricochet, who have now become mainstays on Monday Night RAW and SmackDown Live, and the injury to former NXT Champion, Tommaso Ciampa, the brand is looking to bulk up the roster once again and Kushida is a good start.

"Trump Faces Reality, Twice In One Week",www.chrisweigant.com,Chris Weigant,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.chrisweigant.com/2019/04/05/trump-faces-reality-twice-in-one-week/,"Trump Faces Reality, Twice In One Week [ Posted Friday, April 5th, 2019 ‚Äì 18:17 UTC ]
[ Program Note: OK, I'm feeling slightly better, but still nowhere near good enough to tackle a real Friday Talking Points column. I tried to write this column yesterday, but didn't make it very far. So I thought I'd finish it up today and hopefully by next week I will have recovered to the point where I can start posting regularly once again. Thanks to everyone for the ""get well soon"" wishes, and thanks to everyone for their ongoing patience in dealing with the interruption in service here. Oh, and... Wash your hands! Take some vitamin C! You DO NOT want to get this year's flu, trust me.... ]
In an extraordinary turn of events, President Donald Trump has had to face reality not once but twice within the same week. Seeing as how this has only happened a handful of times throughout his entire term, this double-shot of reality is rather notable. The last time he was forced by those around him to readjust his worldview to actual facts was after he had hastily announced he was pulling all U.S. troops out of Syria. It took weeks for his advisors to force him to backtrack on this decision, but in the end they successfully convinced him. This time around, though, it took only days -- and it happened not just once but twice.
Trump is becoming increasingly more focused on his re-election campaign, and he unilaterally decided earlier in the week that the Republican Party would magically turn the biggest losing issue for them in the 2018 midterms into a winning platform for 2020. He boldly announced (""You watch!"") that the Republican Party would soon be known by one and all as ""the party of great healthcare."" Trump would snap his fingers and the Republicans would instantly manage to do what has eluded them for the past nine years -- come up with a plan to replace Obamacare that would be cheaper, better for everyone, and so obviously superior that even Democrats would be eager to get on board with it. And, of course, the new plan would not have Obama's name attached to it (the overriding criteria for most Republicans, if truth be told).
Republicans, predictably, recoiled in horror. Not only are they actually cognizant that such a plan not only does not exist but is actually impossible to create, but they also are acutely aware of how the issue played for them politically in the midterms. They lost the House largely on the issue of their contempt for people with pre-existing conditions, and they had no stomach for a repeat of this performance in 2020.
Trump, however, was oblivious to all of this. He had, reportedly, come up with the idea of going on the offense on healthcare on the ride over to the Capitol to a meeting with Republicans, so how hard could it really be for them to fulfill his grandiose vision of GOP healthcare perfection, after all?
True to form, Trump was using his standard operating procedure: create a crisis (where none previously existed), announce he and he alone could solve it, and then introduce something only very slightly different than the status quo ante , before loudly proclaiming a great victory. In this particular case, Trump was going to precipitate the crisis by instructing his Justice Department to stop defending any portion of Obamacare as constitutional in the court case currently being brought against it by overzealous Republican state attorneys general. If the courts agreed, then Republicans could ride in to save the day at the last minute with their new plan to create great healthcare for all.
Which, of course, does not actually exist. Neither Donald Trump nor his own administration has any clue how to make good on his sweeping promises, and so their idea was to once again punt the whole ""come up with a fantastic plan"" to Republicans in Congress -- specifically in the Senate, where they still control the calendar. However, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately let it be known that he would be having nothing whatsoever to do with such a suicidal political mission, announcing that he'd be happy to consider any plan the White House sent over, but absent that, the Senate would not be dealing with replacing Obamacare at all for the foreseeable future.
Faced with this open revolt in his own ranks, Trump was forced to punt. He stopped talking about coming up with a plan any time soon and instead started laughably promising that Republicans would unveil their magic Obamacare replacement plan right after they had won the White House, the Senate, and the House in the 2020 elections. In other words: ""Trust us -- we'll show you our secret plan just as soon as you re-elect us all!"" To say that this isn't exactly a winning campaign strategy is to state the painfully obvious, really.
Which brings us to Trump's second dose of reality this week. He quite obviously had a grand plan to travel (once again) down to a border town and use it as a backdrop to announce that he was ""closing the border"" with Mexico. This was the original plan, at any rate.
In terms of border politics, Trump is caught in a cycle of trying to one-up himself, though. Nothing he's done so far has made the slightest difference in the reality of the border or immigration patterns, so he keeps trying to come up with ever-more-Draconian ideas to throw as red meat to his political base. He is absolutely, positively convinced that the border is the biggest winning political issue for him (all evidence to the contrary), so he keeps trying to outdo what he's already done in order to get those MAGA crowds cheering once again.
Trump hijacked the entire Republican Party midterm campaign strategy last year, focusing not on good economic news but rather on xenophobia and fear of hordes of immigrants despoiling America. This didn't do him any good at the ballot box, but that certainly hasn't changed his outlook one iota. He doubled down on the issue immediately after his electoral defeat, by shutting the government down for over a month and then declaring a non-existent ""national emergency"" at the border after Congress refused to fund the wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for.
This left Trump with little room to maneuver, however. How could he top his ""national emergency,"" after all? What could he do to dramatically focus everyone's attention on the border once again, to get those rally crowds cheering? Hey, why not just shut the border down completely, in a fit of pique? He could blame Mexico for not ""stopping all the drugs and immigrants"" and therefore wash his hands of any responsibility for whatever happened next. Yeah, that's the ticket! Trump loudly proclaimed that he wasn't ""playing games"" and that he was indeed serious about slamming the border shut. How manly! How decisive!
Sane Republicans immediately freaked out. While initially the news media treated the entire concept as something of a joke (focusing, bizarrely, on the fact that America's avocado supply would run out within three weeks), eventually some real economists explained to the public what a massive blow this would be to the entire American economy. For starters, the whole U.S. automotive industry would have to shut down within a single week, if no Mexican car parts were flowing north. And that's just one industry that would be affected, among many. Almost two billion dollars of trade happens each and every day with Mexico, and halting it would immediately send both countries' economies into a tailspin of epic proportions.
Thankfully, someone at the White House seems to have sat Trump down and fully explained what the fallout from his little temper tantrum would look like. Trump went from threatening to shut the border down ""this week"" (or ""soon"") to a rather dramatic walkback where he begrudgingly changed his mind to ""We're going to give them a one-year warning."" He then verbized the word ""tariff"" (""I'm going to tariff the cars"") and tried to regain his bluster and tough talk, hoping nobody would notice the fact that ""this week"" had turned into ""a year from now"" after someone explained the hard cold reality to him.
Donald Trump began the week in high spirits, convinced that he had come up with some winning strategies for the 2020 election. Republicans would be known (""You watch!"") as the party of great healthcare, and he'd show those wily Mexicans how serious he was about the border by just slamming the gates on everyone. This would all work out wonderfully for both him and his party, and the American public would gratefully thank him by re-electing him in a landslide.
Never before have we seen such a swift reversal of Trumpian fantasies, however. Never before has reality intruded so brutally on Trump's fantastical worldview. Republicans from the Senate to his own advisors obviously had to forcefully readjust his thinking in a way we've never really seen before. That is astonishing on its own, but what's even more astonishing is the speed with which it took place.
It's doubtful that Trump has learned any larger lesson from the disastrous political week he's had. He probably won't be consulting with anyone before he tries to singlehandedly dictate another election strategy for Republicans in the coming weeks, just to double-check on whether any of it is a good idea (or even slightly realistic). Which means we can probably look forward to similar reversals to come. What should keep Republicans awake at night, though, is the worry that sooner or later no matter how much actual reality is explained to Trump by his advisors, that he's just going to go ahead with whatever wacky idea pops into his head no matter what anyone else thinks of it. And then all his sycophantic Republican politicians will somehow have to get out on the campaign trail and explain to the voters that reality isn't really real, and how Trump knows better than anyone else what to do next.
Good luck with that."

Aurelia Skipwith has a BS in biology from Howard University, a Master‚Äôs in molecular genetics from Purdue and a law degree from Kentucky. She has worked as a molecular analyst and sustainable agriculture partnership manager. She was also co-founder and general counsel for AVC Global, a Washington, D.C.-based agricultural supply chain development company that helps small farmers link up with multinational buyers and with agronomy, business, financial and other service providers.
For two years, she served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Interior Department, where she performed her duties so well that last October President Trump nominated her to become the next Director of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) at Interior. She is an ideal candidate for the post.
She‚Äôs also only the third woman ever nominated for this position ‚Äì and the first African American. Her impeccable scientific, legal, agricultural and conservationist background would ensure fairness, balance, integrity, solid science and multidisciplinary thinking in FWS decision making.
And yet, Ms. Skipwith lingers in confirmation limbo, along with hundreds of others whose nominations have been stalled for many months to well over a year. Too many Democratic senators appear determined to prevent the president from having people onboard who would implement his policies.
In fact, the US Senate has already been forced to hold cloture votes ‚Äì ending drawn-out debates ‚Äì on 128 Trump nominees! In glaring contrast, the Senate had a grand total of only 24 such cloture votes for all six previous presidents combined: Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush II and Obama! That‚Äôs 32 times more nominees by this president sidelined by Congress than during all ten previous presidential terms. View Cartoon
Why is Ms. Skipwith being treated this way? It appears to be simple ideological politics. Senate Democrats seem to be acquiescing to the demands of Deep Green environmentalists and Deep State career bureaucrats who do not like having their views and policies challenged.
Her molecular analysis and sustainable agriculture work were with Monsanto, the ultimate Evil Corporation to many of her opponents, because it manufactures both Roundup weedkiller and genetically engineered (GE) crops like Bt corn and Roundup-Ready soybeans. As Deputy Assistant Secretary, Ms. Skipwith supported reversing Obama era bans on planting such crops and using advanced-technology neonicotinoid pesticides in wildlife refuges administered by Fish & Wildlife.
The 2014 bans resulted from collusive sue-and-settle lawsuits between environmentalist groups and Obama DOI officials. They were reversed in August 2018, following a careful review process. As I have noted in many articles ( here , here and here , for example), GE crops, glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup) and neonics are safe for humans and the environment. They also enable farmers to produce more food from less land, using less water and fewer pesticides, and with greater resistance to droughts, floods, insects and climate change, than is possible with conventional or organic crops.
Genetically engineered crops promote sustainable agriculture and help the world feed billions who otherwise face prolonged malnutrition and starvation. And yet, radical greens oppose them. They even attack Golden Rice , which prevents blindness and death in malnourished children and parents, by incorporating genes that produce Vitamin A precursors, vastly expanding nutritional values in rice.
Americans alone have consumed more than four trillion servings of foods with at least one GE ingredient ‚Äì without a single documented example of harm to a person or the environment.
Regarding glyphosate, only one agency, the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC), says the chemical is ‚Äúprobably carcinogenic‚Äù to humans ‚Äì and its analysis is tainted by fraud and blatant conflicts of interest. Studies by the European Food Safety Authority, Food and Agriculture Organization, Germany‚Äôs Institute for Risk Assessment, Australia‚Äôs Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, and other respected organizations worldwide have concluded that glyphosate is safe and non-carcinogenic.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency scientists conducted a ‚Äúcomprehensive systematic review of studies submitted to the agency and available in the open literature,‚Äù and concluded that the chemical ‚Äúis not likely to be carcinogenic in humans .‚Äù Health Canada conducted a similarly extensive review of global studies, found no likely cancer risk, and noted that ‚Äúno pesticide regulatory authority in the world‚Äù believes glyphosate is a cancer risk to humans ‚Äúat the levels at which humans are currently exposed.‚Äù
As cancer researcher Arthur Lambert noted recently , ‚Äúexposure to carcinogens influences the risk of developing cancer, which is a function of many factors, including the dose and duration of the exposure‚Äù ‚Äì to glyphosate for example. But other factors also play integral roles, including inherited genes and genetic mutations, how well one‚Äôs immune system can find and eliminate mutated cells before they develop into cancer, personal lifestyle choices, and exposure to additional carcinogens over the years. Separating all those factors is virtually impossible.
Risks associated with glyphosate fall ‚Äúsomewhere between the small hazard that comes from eating a considerable amount of bacon (for colorectal cancer) and consuming very hot tea (for esophageal cancer),‚Äù Lambert notes. In fact, IARC lumps bacon, sunlight and plutonium together in its ‚Äúdefinitely carcinogenic‚Äù category and lists as ‚Äúpossible‚Äù carcinogens pickled vegetables, caffeic acid found in many fruits and vegetables, and even drinking hot beverages or working the night shift.
If glyphosate poses few risks of cancer in humans, its threats to ducks, geese, turkeys and other animals in wildlife refuges are likely infinitesimal. The same is true for GE crops and neonicotinoid pesticides. Recommended No, President Trump Did Not Refer To Asylum Seekers As Animals. And The Mainstream Media Should Know This Timothy Meads
Most neonics are used as seed coatings, which get absorbed into plant tissues as crops grow. They protect plants against insect damage by targeting only pests that actually feed on the crops ‚Äì and are largely gone by the time mature plants flower, which means they are barely detectable in pollen.
As to claims that neonics harm bees and thus should be banned from wildlife refuges, a 2015 international study of wild bees found that most wild bees never even come into contact with crops or the neonics that supposedly threaten them. The same study also determined that the 2% of wild bees that do visit crops ‚Äì and so would be most exposed to these pesticides ‚Äì are among the healthiest bee species on Earth.
The eight senators who recently expressed concern that chlorpyrifos and other pesticides threaten multiple protected species should applaud Interior‚Äôs reversal of bans on modern agricultural technologies (which reduce the use of such pesticides). Ducks Unlimited and the National Wild Turkey Federation certainly did.
The bans ‚Äúwere clearly not based on science,‚Äù they said, adding that the reversal restored GE crop use as an ‚Äúessential tool‚Äù for waterfowl and wildlife management in national wildlife refuges. Many refuges were established along migratory bird flyways to provide food for waterfowl. But some can provide sufficient food only through cooperative agreements that let local farmers plant crops on refuge lands in exchange for leaving some of their crops unharvested, to supplement natural food on the refuge.
Genetically modified crops maximize crop yields, the FWS has explained , and ‚Äúa blanket denial‚Äù of their use limits the latitude that refuge managers need to fulfill the purposes of each refuge. The ban on neonics was equally problematical because they are often used with GE crops and Roundup.
Aurelia Skipwith‚Äôs actions reflect the best in science-based government decision making. Her broad expertise enables her to separate fact from fiction, and reality from ideological agendas. She is the right person for this job ‚Äì and indeed may turn out to be one of the best FWS directors ever. The Senate should confirm her forthwith.

As the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference opens this week in Washington, the group finds itself caught squarely amid the quadruple crosshairs of a deeply divided Israel and the fractured state of U.S. politics. AIPAC's president, Howard Kohr, who is by both temperament and avocation a centrist consensus builder with a strictly bipartisan U.S. mandate, is attempting to thread the needle in a way that will test his prodigious powers of persuasion and almost uncanny political instincts. But thread the needle he must, because the threads of the complex tapestry that forms the U.S.-Israel bond need mending.
The big story in the media has been President Donald Trump's attempt to cast Democrats as being anti-Israel and anti-Jewish. The president's assertions seem to fly in the face of the reality that, by and large, Jewish Americans overwhelmingly vote Democratic and Democrats have been long and vocal supporters of Israel. But a few backbenchers, notably newly elected Reps. Ilhan Omar and Palestinian American Rashida Tlaib -- who are themselves leading a progressive left flank of the party -- have spoken out vociferously against the special relationship America and Israel have fostered over the decades. AIPAC and the Democratic leadership have tried to rebuff their advances while at the same time preserving party unity. But at some point, there is bound to be a reckoning between the Israel lobby and Democrats.
Underlying the American political spectacle that AIPAC is attempting to address at this week's conference is the specter of Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu's tenuous hold on power. He is currently under both political and legal threat; investigations are underway in the Israeli Parliament and courts into allegations of official corruption, upsetting an already contentious election cycle in Israel. In order to support his ally, Trump announced by tweet that America would officially recognize the contested territory of the Golan Heights (officially part of Syria but occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War in 1967) as Israeli territory. This move -- and, by extension, Netanyahu's close relationship with Trump -- is certain to bolster Netanyahu's standing with his domestic political base. View Cartoon
But the move is certain to have lasting implications in terms of U.S. policy and objectives in the region -- most notably America's relationship with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, which have also petitioned the Trump administration for closer relationships and already signaled willingness to stand up against Iran, Israel's nemesis in the region. The complexity and fragility of the current state of affairs, with Islamists on the wane and Saudi Arabia seemingly ascendant as a regional influencer, cannot be overstated. If the Gulf nations feel threatened by Israel's incursions into Syria, they may have a difficult time convincing their own populations that aligning themselves with the U.S. is in their best interest. The fallout from such political backlash could prove troublesome for both the United States and the pro-Israel lobby in the U.S.
In fact, many among the Democratic leadership have signaled that they will not be attending this year's conference in what is seen as a public rebuke of Netanyahu's far-right policies -- including Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories. Of course, the question needs to be asked: Can Democrats be both pro-Israel and anti-Netanyahu? After all, Netanyahu is Israel's democratically elected leader, and no matter what controversy currently surrounds his leadership, one could argue that Netanyahu's policies represent what Israeli citizens believe is best for their nation. Recommended What is This?! AOC Makes Up Completely New Accent During Speech to Al Sharpton's Conference Katie Pavlich
Having visited both the Gulf nations, including the United Arab Emirates and Israel this year, I feel deeply connected to the warmth and friendship I received from the citizens of both sides. As an American, I was both welcomed and celebrated as a brother and ally. That is why it is truly important that we allow our voices to stand for peace and prosperity and that we affirm the rule of law and human rights throughout the region. In fact, American leadership in the region demands that we take an objective view of regional dynamics while at the same time affirming our alliances and strengthening our commitments to shared values.
This, of course, brings us full circle to AIPAC and this week's conference in Washington. It can no longer be AIPAC's sole objective to advocate for Israel's direct interests in the region. In order to truly be a partner to the U.S., AIPAC must also cast itself in the role of regional peace builder and help lead America's political class to sensible and practical solutions for security, trade and economic growth in the Middle East. In this respect, AIPAC is in a truly advantageous position in the current political climate. Instead of merely threading the needle, it can help mend the ties that bind us. "

For the Democrats it's still all about the collusion narrative.
They don't care that the Mueller Report concluded that Donald Trump's campaign and the Russians did not cooperate to steal the 2016 election.
President Trump's crazed enemies in Congress and in the liberal media will never believe Trump won fair and square.
You can give the House committees headed by Democrats Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler two more years of digging around in Trump World for impeachable crimes.
You can give them 800 pages, a thousand pages, ten-thousand more pages of interviews.
You can give them another $30 million to waste on lawyers and investigators.
They won't find anything, but it won't matter.
The ""Russia collusion"" narrative of the Trump Hating Industrial Complex will never die.
The Democrats just ""know"" that the epic tragedy of Hillary Clinton's defeat could only have happened because Donald Trump cheated.
The president himself was never under investigation for collusion.
Yes, but, but, but, the Democrats say, his son took that meeting with a Russian woman peddling dirt on Hillary.
And his national security advisor for 24 days, Michael Flynn, met with that jolly Russian ambassador.
And his longtime pal Roger Stone supposedly tried to get more hacked Hillary emails from Wikileaks.
It wasn't against the law for Trump's son or the others to meet with or talk to those Russians, by the way. View Cartoon
In the deranged minds of Trump haters and the liberal media, however, those and a few other brief encounters with Russians by Trump underlings are solid proof of collusion.
But Muller and his gang of lawyers, including several who were closely connected with the Clinton mob, obviously didn't agree. No collusion, no obstruction was their verdict.
Meanwhile, while we wait for Attorney General Bill Barr to release the full but redacted Mueller Report, I wonder how long it'll take the liberal mainstream media to investigate the folks who really colluded with the Russians in 2016: The Democrats.
Their collusion was instigated by Hillary's campaign and the Democratic National Committee when they paid the research company Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.
Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, an ex-British spy, who created a fake, salacious dossier on Donald Trump that Hillary partisans in the highest offices of the FBI used to get FISA surveillance warrants against low-level Trump staffers like George Papadopoulos.
So far, Fox News, talk radio and conservatives in Congress have been the only ones talking about or investigating the partisan origins and FBI's misuse of the so-called ""Steel dossier.""
You'd think the crack investigative journalists at The New York Times or Washington Post would be covering the heck out of this shocking and dangerous abuse of power by the FBI.
You'd think they'd want to expose how far the Democrats and some top political appointees in the FBI were willing to go to prevent someone they didn't like from becoming president. Recommended Democrat Presidential Conference Opens with Communist Cop-Killer‚Äôs Chants Humberto Fontova
But so far the great institutions of the liberal news media are sticking to the ""Trump Collusion"" script.
They hope to find new stuff in the footnotes of the Mueller Report to fit their Russian collusion narrative, which they refuse to accept has turned out to be the political hoax the president always said it was.
With the economy strong, black and Latino employment at their highest levels and a trade deal with China in the works, the Russian collusion narrative is the only issue the Democrats have.
You know the Muller team tried its best to get anything they could to nail President Trump on collusion. But they came up with zip, ultimately because they were professionals.
Unfortunately, the Democrats in the House running their purely political sideshows are not professionals interested in fairness or the truth.
Schiff and Nadler are partisan, power-hungry hacks who are out to do whatever they can to stymie Trump's agenda and prevent his reelection chances.
What they are doing in the House every day shows the country what happens when someone really tries to drain the swamp in Washington. "

‚ÄúI'm gonna actually have you participate with me in repeating some words from a leader by the name of Assata Shakur!‚Äù (NAACP V.P. Jamal Watkins opening the We The People conference this week.)
‚Äú(The conference speakers) included 2020 Democratic White House contenders Cory Booker, Juli√°n Castro, Beto O'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Jay Inslee and Kirsten Gillibrand.‚Äù
Now regarding that ‚Äúleader‚Äù whose words seemed worthy of opening a conference showcasing the entire roster of the Democrat Party‚Äôs Most-Likely-to-Succeed‚Äù:
In May 2013 the FBI announced a $1 million reward for ""information leading to the apprehension"" of Joanne Chesimard (also known as Assata Shakur) who they named a ""Most Wanted Terrorist."" Chesimard is the first woman to make the FBI‚Äôs list. The New Jersey State Police Dept., who also wants her, added another $1 million to the pot.
You see, amigos: Convicted cop-killer (of a New Jersey State-Trooper) and bona-fide ""domestic terrorist"" Chesimard (Assata Shakur) has been living in Cuba since 1984 as a Castro-coddled celebrity. But it‚Äôs not like bounty hunters can operate freely in a Stalinist country. So the $2 million was probably for show. Obama‚Äôs Justice Department was probably putting on a game face and saying: ""Look Castro, we‚Äôre serious here! You better turn Shakur over, or‚Ä¶or--or ELSE!‚Äù View Cartoon
Or else WHAT?...Well we know the answer to that: or else we‚Äôll take you off the State Department's list of terror-sponsors, open relations with you, return your convicted (all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court) murderer/spies. And then gift you with more U.S. dollars via travel expenses and remittances than what the Soviets used to gift you!...HA! --So TAKE THAT!
Which, of course, is exactly what happened as Assata Shakur remained snickering from her celebrity exile in the Castro-Family-Fiefdom.
More outrageous still, some of those heart-warming Obama-opened ‚Äúeducational‚Äù tours of Cuba by U.S. students seem to actually include inspirational visits with the U.S. convicted cop-killer.
Think I jest?
In the early 1970s Chesimard belonged to a Black Panther offshoot known as the Black Liberation Army. ""This case is just as important today as it was when it happened 40 years ago,"" said a press release from Mike Rinaldi of the New Jersey State Police when the bounty was placed on Shakur. ""Chesimard was a member of the Black Liberation Army, a ""radical left wing terror group that felt justified killing law enforcement officers...This group conducted assaults on police stations and murdered police officers.""
More than a mere member of these domestic terrorists, Chesimard was described by former assistant FBI director John Miller, as ""the soul of the Black Liberation Army.""
You see, amigos: In 1973, while wanted for multiple crimes from bank robbery to murder, Chesimard and two accomplices were pulled over for a tail-light violation on the New Jersey Turnpike. As the troopers were routinely questioning them, Chesimard in the passenger seat, and her pals opened up on the lawmen with semi-auto pistols (no word on whether these were properly registered.)
As trooper Werner Foerster grappled with the driver, Shakur shot him twice--then her gun apparently jammed. As Foerster lay on the ground wounded and helpless, the honored commencement-speech composer for this week‚Äôs Democrat conference grabbed the wounded trooper‚Äôs own gun and blasted two shots into his head, much in the manner of her Cuban idols Che Guevara and Raul Castro murdering hundreds of their own (always defenseless at the time) ""counter-revolutionary"" enemies.
She escaped but was captured in 1977, convicted of murder and sentenced to life plus 33 years. Then in 1979 she escaped from prison--with some ultra-professional help, probably by Cuban or Cuban-trained terrorists. ""Two men smuggled into the prison, took guards hostages and broke her out,"" explained John Miller to CBS News.
Chesimard‚Äôs 1979 escape from prison was well planned, Rinaldi explained in his press release. ""Armed domestic terrorists gained entry into the facility, neutralized the guards, broke her free, and turned her over to a nearby getaway team.""
""In 1984, they smuggled her to Mexico. Using a network of Cuban intelligence officers who worked with American radical groups, they got her into Cuba,"" added former Assistant FBI Director John Miller.
Since then, according to New Jersey State Police Col. Rick Fuentes, Chesimard ""flaunts her freedom....To this day from her safe haven in Cuba Chesimard has been given a pulpit (by the Castro regime ) to preach and profess, stirring supporters and groups to mobilize against the United States by any means necessary. She has been used by the Castro regime to greet foreign delegations visiting Cuba."" Recommended LOL: Chris Cuomo Interviews An Illegal Alien. The Man's Response Doesn't Align With CNN's Agenda. Beth Baumann
""Joanne Chesimard is a domestic terrorist,"" declared FBI agent Aaron T. Ford, during a news conference at the time. ""She absolutely is a threat to America.""
Along with Chesimard, Castro‚Äôs fiefdom has provided haven for over 70 fugitives from U.S. law, including several on the FBI‚Äôs most wanted listed. Cuba also harbors convicted cop-killers Michael Finney and Charlie Hill, along with Victor Gerena, responsible for a $7 million heist of a Wells Fargo truck in Connecticut in 1983, as a member of the Puerto Rican terrorist group, Los Macheteros . All requests by U.S. authorities for these criminals‚Äô extradition have been rebuffed, often cheekily by Fidel Castro himself: ""They want to portray her as a terrorist, something that was an injustice, a brutality, an infamous lie !"" Fidel Castro himself answered a U.S. request for Chesimard on May 3, 2005.
But was featuring Shakur‚Äôs (a rabidly, murderously anti-American, Castro-coddled cop-killer/terrorist‚Äôs) ravings at a Democrat conference a faux pas or fluke? Or was it perfectly‚Äîalmost immaculately‚Äîappropriate?
Well, regarding the cop-killer herself, Democrat luminary and power-broker Maxine Waters regards her as an ‚Äú activist ‚Äù who fled from ‚Äú political persecution‚Äù in the mean ‚Äòole U.S. and graciously received ‚Äú political asylum‚Äù in Stalinist/terror-sponsoring Cuba.
And regarding Shakur‚Äôs savior from ‚Äúpolitical persecution‚Äù Maxine regards him as: ""a bully, an egotistical maniac, a liar‚Ä¶the most deplorable person I've ever met in my life""‚ÄîWHOOPS! Sorry, amigos! That‚Äôs Maxine Waters regarding the current freely elected president of her homeland.
Now here‚Äôs Maxine Waters regarding the Stalinist mass-murder whose lifelong craving was to nuke her homeland and who jailed and tortured the most and longest ‚Äìsuffering black political prisoners in the modern history of the Western Hemisphere: "

The problem is: How do you prove the value that was lost? He could point to their growth in revenue (and share price) and claim success; we couldn't counter by proving that they'd have had even more revenue (and therefore probably higher stock prices) if they'd been hiring on merit instead of style-box.
The sad truth is that this mentality has infected the executive suite at every major public company. HR guys aren't hired based on whether or not they buy the concept; it's a given that they do, because their bosses and boards both expect and demand it."

We're routinely in the bottom half of all industrialized nations. Ultimately, that leads to us being left behind.
We're already seeing it in environments that demand high-level engineering skills. Ask anybody in IT, and they'll tell you that the guys who are graduating from the India Institute of Technology can run circles around the guys being graduated from any of America's vaunted IT universities, like Carnegie-Mellon.
As far as productivity is concerned, there are multiple analyses that put many countries ahead of the US in terms of productivity. We may lead now in GDP, but so long as we continue to bloat our population with a bunch of lazy losers who demand handouts instead of working for money, we're going to continue to lose grounds to nations with populations that were as industrious as America's used to be before the left went berserk.
I have an econ degree, and I'm not sure I can buy the notion that we lead the world in economics; too many American economists have been taught that Keynesian ideas are as valid in economics as Marxist ideas are in politics - despite the fact that they have a similarly abysmal record."

I got hired because I was the only female who applied - they really wanted a black female because that filled 2 quotas.
When business slowed enough to warrant lay-offs they had to lay off the white experienced males - not me - because I was a ""quota"" hire. When the clients found out I was their inexperienced go-to person and their experienced guy was gone...we lost more business...but I did not lose my job.
I personally was not the problem...but the REASON I was there WAS the problem...the damage to the company was nationwide and they almost did not survive (see Sears for a company DESTROYED by quotas).
The 70's ""joke""...what is the most worthless form of life? The white heterosexual male - they qualify for nothing and pay for everything.
