Your marriage failed. There are two sides to every story. I think adultery should be punishable by law and perhaps death. I'm not arguing that. What I am saying is that I don't care how hard your life was as a single mother. I don't care about your ""unique situation"". Actions have consequences. Life is a two person lift. You should be grateful rather than expectant for every dollar you receive that you did not earn. It sounds like you are a poor judge of character if you married a man that cheated on you. Again, you are not special. You are a victim of your choices and a sick culture of feminism and anti family values. You are not a hero."

Lord Jesus, whatever it takes, save those babies.
Amen.

On March 17, police officers with the Escambia County Sheriffâs Office in Pensacola, Florida were recorded illegally entering a home without a warrant. In the video, the victim of this crime repeatedly requested that officers not enter his home without a warrant. Ignoring his requests, police then entered his home to harass, manhandle, and eventually arrest him for âresisting arrest without violence.â The recording, which you can view here , was shared over 1,500 times on social media eventually catching the attention of the local news outlets, prompting the Escambia County Sheriffâs Office to issue a statement that an internal investigation would be conducted. Community members were upset by the news. In response to the video, nearby resident Raymond Pierce said, âIt didnât seem like there was a reason for [the cops] to come in at allâ¦ Everybody should be treated equally, not just off appearances.â Another concerned citizen, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed her dismay over the illegal entry, stating â[the man they arrested] said that you have to have a warrant to come into my house. And if you listened to the response from the sheriff, he said [the cops] can come in your home if thereâs some kind of domestic violence, or thereâs somebody being threatened, or if somebodyâs life is in danger. In this situation, nobodyâs life was in danger, and I felt like yes they need a warrant, they should not have come into his house.â She went on to share her own experiences with local police, explaining, âThis actually has happened to me in my home. I had a cop come to the wrong apartment, barge into my home. Because somebody stole a carâ¦ and [it] scared the mess out of my daughter. I also know that the cops was harassing people in the neighborhood and they were doing illegal stops. There are cops that are known to be bullies.â Raymond Pierce, who resides in the Brownsville neighborhood where incident in question was taped, shared a similar story: âI was getting out of the car to go into inside the house and [the cops] stopped me and was like âWhat are you doing here?â I was like Iâm going into the house, I live here. He was like âAe you sure you live here?â I was like yeah, Iâm sure I live here. He was like âwell, can I see some ID?â I gave him the ID, he did the whole running of the ID and eventually let me go but I got stopped right in front of my own house.â The wrongfully arrested man featured in the video is collecting donations for legal fees so that he can pursue a lawsuit. As he explains on his GoFundMe page, which can be found here , âThis happens in far too many communities far too often and sadly a lot of times there is no footage to shed light on such heinous acts of corruption carried out by the very people we employ to protect us. As I work at a hospital this incident could ruin my career rendering me unable to ever find employment in the medical field againâ¦ I plan to take aim at this corruption head on. I was unjustly manhandled and hauled away to jail just five minutes after being awakened by an angry deputy. Without shoes without a shirt without contact lenses or glasses and in front of my children and nephew.â A resident of the community and former police officer spoke with Liberation News. He chose not to watch the video, explaining âI already know what happens. I am a Black man in Americaâ¦ Everyday weâre getting killed by the police. Why do I got to see that?â When asked what he felt could be done about the actions of the ECSO, he stated âWe need law enforcement to be trained properly. Okay, my sister is a cop in Chicago. I have not talked to her in 10 yearsâ¦ You know why? You know why I told her I donât talk to her? âYou joined a system- I was in there before you- that you never can change.â She told me, âI am trying to make it better.â Youâre not going to make it better, itâs already corrupt, itâs corrupt. Itâs the system. Itâs gotta be changed from the root. Radical.â"
Brooklyn laundry workers make the boss come clean,www.liberationnews.org,Sophia Roberts,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.liberationnews.org/brooklyn-laundry-workers-make-the-boss-come-clean/,"Apr 06, 2019 Protest Against Retaliation from Sunshine Shirt Laundromat. March 6, Photo: Laundry Workerâs Center
Ricarda Mosso spent years trying to get management at Sunshine Shirts Laundry Center in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY, to address her by her own name. Instead, she was mockingly referred to as âRichardâ by her bosses. As a laundry worker, she experienced routine wage theft, physical abuse and skin burns from broken and unsafe machines.
After years of these illegal and dangerous working conditions, Mosso and her coworker MarÃ­a GarcÃ­a took a stand. On Feb. 16, the workers, along with 85 of their community allies as well as friends at the Laundry Workerâs Center, gathered in protest at Sunshine Shirts to submit their demands for fair wages and safe working conditions. This has been a winning combination. Mosso and GarcÃ­a, the only two workers at Sunshine Shirts, have since won a raise, some benefits and better working conditions. They are now fighting for back wages.
As Mosso explained, âI am an immigrant woman and mother of two, and I cannot support my family with this miserable salary. I have worked for 15 years under physical abuse, without ventilation during the summers and no heating during the winter. I have not been paid a minimum wage salary nor overtime. I will not remain silent anymore, and we demand better wages and better working conditions. I want to be treated with respect and with dignity like a human being.â
Empowered by community support
Management, including boss Sharon Chen, quickly retaliated. They cut the workerâs hours, changed their schedules, and imposed false work quotas. But the workers persisted.
After several actions outside of the Sunshine Shirts and after hours of negotiations, the workers won $14.28 an hour, a guaranteed set schedule of 35 hours per week with lunch breaks, reduced workload and an improved work environment with proper heating and protective gear. âLaundromat worker leaders Maria GarcÃ­a (left) and Ricarda Mosso at International Working Womenâs Day, March 8. Photo: Laundry Workerâs Centerâ
GarcÃ­a explains, âWe talked to the employer about improving the working conditions, and he responded to us by laughing. Today, we are empowered with the support of the community. We are not alone in this struggle; it gives me the strength to continue organizing for change.â
To prepare for this campaign, GarcÃ­a and her coworker trained with the Instituto La Cuadra Progresista (Progressive Block Leadership Institute), a program created by the Laundry Workerâs Center which helps empower workers to know their rights and gain skills to organize their workplace.
It is the same program that helped Juana and Nicholas, workers at TYS laundromat in East Harlem, fight back and make gains against similar conditions last year. TYS also employs just two workers.
Co-Director Rosanna RodrÃ­guez-Aran, explained that the similarities between the two campaigns match up with the extensive research that LWC has done on conditions in over 400 laundromats across the city. âItâs a real confirmation of what we found when we made the research. For us, it is not just in writingâitâs happening.â
She continued, âThis is part of a bigger picture and a big issue for our organization. We are really looking to change the conditions in the entire industry. Itâs more about raising consciousness about what the workers are going through and how we can change the industry as a whole.â
Next step: Winning back pay
The next steps in both campaigns, at Sunshine Shirt and TYS, is negotiating for the back wages that the workers are owed. At TYS, the company first made the offer of $20,000. RodrÃ­guez-Aran describes this offer as âa jokeâ compared to the estimated $200,000 in back wages that they owe. The slow pace of these negotiations and the retaliation experienced by the workers has led LWC to hold weekly Thursday night actions in front of the store, passing out flyers to community members encouraging them to pressure the bosses to pay what they owe.
In Bay Ridge, things are moving more quickly, but the LWC is still laying the grounds for broad community support. RodrÃ­guez-Aran reports, âWe want to continue building the community in Bay Ridgeâreach out to different groups in the neighborhood and build solidarity. Itâs part of the strategy. For our case, if something happens, it takes an hour for us to be there. We want to be in the community so that if something happens to the workers we have the support and we can respond immediately.â
In addition to the active campaigns at TYS Laundromat and Sunshine Shirts Laundry Center, the Laundry Workerâs Center is currently preparing to launch a third campaign, which is still underground. They also organized a presence at a major March 8 activity, the International Womenâs Strike, which highlighted some of their work.
RodrÃ­guez-Aran explains that their presence there was important because âwe are representing women of color, immigrant women in the laundromat industryâ¦ Ricarda and Maria, leaders of the Bay Ridge campaign, came and spoke for the first time in front of a group of activists and organizers. It was very powerful for them.â
The Laundry Workers Center is a not-for-profit, member-led organization that provides community-based leadership development to improve the living and working conditions of some of the most vulnerable members of the working classâlow wage laundry, warehouse, and food service workers in New York City and New Jersey."
"Nipsey Hussle: What he gave, why we honor him",www.liberationnews.org,Marcus Bois Aubin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.liberationnews.org/his-dream-of-class-unity-for-our-people-to-step-into-their-greatness-collectively/,"Apr 06, 2019 Photo: Twitter.com: misteralek
The following is based on a talk given by Marcus Bois Aubin at a PSL forum in New York City on April 5.
Hip Hop is a cultural force that is rooted in community building. We must remember that one of Hip Hop cultureâs earliest mantras was: âPeace, unity, and having fun.â It was Hip Hop culture that kept the names of liberation figures like Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela, and Huey P. Newton alive in the Black American consciousness during the depth of the crack epidemic from the 1980s to early 1990s. Many revolutionaries of today started their journey of political consciousness through listening to rap music and learning about the foundations of Hip Hop culture.
We would like to honor and celebrate the life of the Eritrean-American entertainer, entrepreneur, and activist Ermias Joseph Asghedom, known as Nipsey Hussle, who was tragically gunned down March 31 at the age of 33. We honor him because of what he meant to the Crenshaw and south LA community where he was rooted, and to so many Black and Brown young people worldwide.
Crenshaw and south LA in the 1990s
Born in 1985, Nipsey came of age in a time and place â LA in the 90s â marked, like so many Black neighborhoods nationwide, by extreme poverty, mass incarceration, de-industrialization, racist police brutality, overcrowded schools and declining social services. The revolutionary mood and organizations of the 1960s and 1970s had largely been all destroyed. The drug epidemic was in full swing.
In this environment, where playing by the rules of the capitalist order appeared to offer nothing hopeful to a young man like Nipsey, he joined the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips. While we do not glorify such street organizations or minimize their crimes against the people, we do not scorn the oppressed young men and women who join them in such a social context. We understand that they are attracted by the community, collectivity, sense of power as well as economic livelihood that they seem to offer.
Biggest gang: the Los Angeles Police Department
What we do scorn is the hypocritical condemnation of these young men from the ruling class, who call them âsuper-predatorsâ and âmonsters,â who rob them of their humanity in the press, who design laws to strip them of their civil rights and lock them up for their whole lives in a prison system that has no intention of transforming them, but in fact entrenches them deeper into a life of crime. We know that the biggest murderers and drug dealers are in the Pentagon and Wall Street banks, and we know that the biggest gang in LA doesnât go by the names Bloods or Crips â they go by the four letters L-A-P-D.
Nipsey was such an important figure because of his individual transformation and journey. Even years ago, before he became a big artist, there are videos where he speaks of colonialism, the robing of the Black communityâs cultural work, and the need for organization to combat the heavily armed and centralized state. He tapped into that long existing tradition of Black independence and radical thought, and then devoted himself to use his platform to bring change to the music industry and community as an independent artist.
Promoted class unity
Nipsey was a business person who literally bought his block for community development. He developed economic opportunities like Vector 90, a co-working space for Black and Latino people interested in STEM fields to close the gap between Silicon Valley and South (formally known as South Central) LA. Nipseyâs next venture was going to be buying a building to make it 100 percent affordable housing- taking a step forward in combating homelessness in his community.
He used his fame and his background for multiple attempts to curtail street violence and the animosity between street organizations long opposed to one another. This wasnât just a liberal framing of âstop the violenceââ but tied to an analysis that Black people had a common interest and a common enemy. The song âFâ Donald Trump,â put out during the election season, was one musical example of that â recorded alongside YG, a Blood, as well as several Mexican rappers, promoting class unity and militancy against white supremacy.
Nipsey was also evolving as an internationalist attempting to bring economic opportunities back to his homeland of Eritrea. Although he grew up with little connection to his fatherâs side, this was inspired by his desire to reconnect more with his African origins. His father organized and marched for Eritrean national liberation against apartheid and U.S. imperialism in the 70s.
Itâs understandable that many have expressed feelings of outrage and demoralization that his alleged murderer was a member of his own gang âset.â There is, understandably so, pessimism about improving the hood when there are some people in those environments who may take part in the murder of the emerging leaders attempting to build these communities. But here in the Justice Center and PSL, we believe in revolutionary optimism. I would like to share some lessons learned from the legacy of Nipsey Hussle, and why we must reject such pessimism.
Lessons from Hussleâs legacy
Genuine change comes from genuine love from people from the community. It does not matter if they are college educated, a reformed criminal, activist or in-between. Anyone with a vision for a better tomorrow has the capacity to contribute to the movement, and to become a spark for radical economic and political change.
Once a person knows who they are and where they came from, this can become a spark for all sorts of individual and collective transformation. Nipseyâs knowledge of his heritage helped him liberate himself from the self-destructive life of drug dealing and gangbanging to developing programs to enhance his community.
People pushing for the liberation of their communities are not perfect and may harbor prejudices. Everyone living under this capitalist, white supremacist, and patriarchal society has contradictions. This should not discredit the work they have done for their community; that doesnât âcancelâ your legacy. If youâve harmed others, you should still be held accountable for your actions. If an oppressed person who wants to make positive change and unite the poor holds bigoted views, it is the job of the movement to explain and show in practice why these views are an impediment to that unity; we know that the class struggle itself is the best teacher, and can quickly undo, in the matter of days, decades of bourgeois indoctrination.
Intercommunal violence doesnât simply stop because you are famous and attempting to change the community. As long as there is systemic oppression and untreated trauma, there will be members of oppressed communities who will commit violence and acts of oppression against their own community. Hurt people will hurt people.
Nipsey Hussleâs most well-known brand was around the metaphor taken from the name of his 2010 mixtape â The Marathon. I think itâs appropriate that we think of revolution in the same way.
In an interview on the Grammy Awards red carpet last year, Nipsey was asked to complete the sentence âIf I had a dream â¦â to which he replied âFor our people to step into their greatness collectively.â
May we continue to fight to make his dream a reality.
Rest in Power Nip."
Violence against Black women: learning from Black socialist feminists,www.liberationnews.org,"Rachel Domond, Roxbury resident",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.liberationnews.org/violence-against-black-women-learning-from-black-socialist-feminists/,"By Rachel Domond, Roxbury resident Apr 06, 2019 Founders of the Combahee River Collective Beverly Smith (second from left), Barbara Smith (second from right) and Demita Frazier (right) organized a protest in 1979 against a string of murders of Black women in Boston. April 1 marked the 40th anniversary of a protest against the âRoxbury Murdersâ of 1979. A crowd of 1,500 met in the Boston Common to protest the murders of seven Black women that had taken place over a three-month span in the Roxbury and Dorchester areas. As the crowd memorialized the seven victims, news arrived of an eighth. By May, the number of Black women murdered in the area climbed to 12. The mainstream media outlets failed to cover any of these murders. Much of the organized response to the murders was carried out by Bostonâs Combahee River Collective, a Black socialist feminist organization remembered today for its pioneering work in drawing connections between capitalism, racism and womenâs oppression. In addition to organizing the April 1 protest, the CRC created a pamphlet entitled Six Black Women: Why Did They Die? which was circulated on the streets, at the protest and beyond. The pamphlet challenged readers to analyze the systemic conditions that make Black women more vulnerable to violence on account of both race and gender: âIn the Black community the murders have often been talked about as solely racial or racist crimes. Itâs true that the police and media response has been typically racist. Itâs true that the victims were all Black and that Black people have always been targets of racist violence in this society, but they were also all women. Our sisters died because they were women just as sure as they did because they were Black.â Another tragedy in Boston The rampant violence against Black women across the country and locally in Boston is not a relic of the past. In late February, 23-year old mother Jassy Correia was found brutally murdered days after being abducted from a Boston nightclub while she celebrated her birthday. Some responses to Correiaâs murder focused on what she and her friends could have done to prevent the tragedy. Such responses, intentionally or not, place responsibility on the victims of such crimes, rather than on the men who commit them and the society which enables them. One proposed solution to the issue of violence against Black women is for âmen to protect their women.â However, the idea that any men are inherently womenâs âprotectorsâ reinforces the misogynist idea that women are weak and need to be protected. Under capitalism, there is massive economic inequality, and women (particularly women of oppressed nationalities) are disproportionately represented among the unemployed and poor. Working class women are therefore frequently forced to financially rely on men. This economic hierarchy â combined with deep-seated misogyny â makes women more prone to experience domestic and other forms of horizontal violence at the hands of men in their communities. According to a 2015 study by the Violence Policy Center, Black women are two and a half times more likely to be killed by men than white women are. In other words, Black women are often killed by Black men, as appears to have been the case for Jassy Correia. The struggle for Black womenâs liberation continues The prevalence of gendered violence and other forms of bigotry within our communities raises difficult challenges for the Black liberation struggle. As Black socialist feminists, the CRC offered a framework of how to advance our liberation struggle without either excluding the most vulnerable members of our communities or forsaking those who have internalized oppressive ideologies. In the 1977 Combahee River Collective Statement, members wrote: âAlthough we are feminists and Lesbians, we feel solidarity with progressive Black men and do not advocate the fractionalization that white women who are separatists demand. Our situation as Black people necessitates that we have solidarity around the fact of raceâ¦ We struggle together with Black men against racism, while we also struggle with Black men about sexism. We realize that the liberation of all oppressed peoples necessitates the destruction of the political-economic systems of capitalism and imperialism as well as patriarchy.â We must recognize that while white supremacy is a primary barrier to the freedom of Black people, it is not an isolated system. We will misunderstand, and even participate in each otherâs oppression without an analysis of how patriarchy, capitalism and white supremacy are intricately woven into society and into each other. Socialists and feminists within the Black community combat misogyny and predatory behavior because it is a matter of life and death for Black women. Black personhood is anything but a monolith, so the Black liberation struggle cannot advance with a monolithic understanding of oppression. Only an anti-sexist, anti-racist revolutionary socialist movement can win Black women our collective liberation; a future free of exploitation and violence!

If you want reparations, go after the actual families that benefited from slavery. It was not us. Read up on it you will find exactly their names, bloodlines, and how much money they still have. Be my guest. You will find they were of the mercantile class, were always involved with lucrative trade, and made a ton of money off the slave trade and cotton sales.

That might seem a false hope after the 2018 midterm elections, when more than 75 percent of Jews voted for Democratic candidates.
But Trumpâs unparalleled record on Israel, his family ties to the Jewish community, and the Democratsâ growing hostility to Israel and tolerance for antisemitism have clearly convinced Republican leaders that Jewish support is worth courting aggressively.
Prior to Trumpâs address, four former Democrats took the stage â all of whom had voted for Barack Obama at least once â to explain why they had each shifted their allegiances to the Republican Party.
Former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN), who was once a harsh critic of Trump, told the audience of about 2,000 that he had been wrong. Citing the traditional Passover song of âDayenuâ (âIt would have been enoughâ), in which the recurring theme is one of gratitude for each miracle performed during the Exodus from Egypt, Coleman cited the moving of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the withdrawal from the Iran deal, the recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington as great achievements that each, in themselves, would have merited a vote of thanks.
It is unclear whether Republicansâ effort will succeed. Many liberal Jews prioritize social issues like abortion above Israel, and the mainstream media â many of whom presented laughably slanted accounts of Trumpâs remarks â are sticking to their 2016 theme of describing Trump as a nascent antisemite.

In Las Vegas on Saturday, Donald Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition, organized by mega-donor Sheldon Adelson (who was seen at the event in his TRUMP yarmulke--I wish I was kidding), and essentially dabbled in the same anti-Semitic tropes that he and his party had condemned in Rep.

In Trump's Adderall-addled mind, Jews and Israelis are one and the same. So in his rambling speech, he assured these conservative Jews that he had stood with ""your prime minister"" in discussions of Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The embattled Netanyahu is simultaneously facing criminal charges and re-election . Election Day is April 9.
It was not the only time that Trump made this same conflation, which makes it seem less an inadvertent slip of the tongue and more a mindset of The Other .
It also happened at a point when Trump was railing against Democrats, who he accused of pushing âby far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history.â He then went on to warn that if Democrats were to be successful their âradical agenda could very well leave Israel out there all by yourselves.â Trump says the quiet part loud, tells the Republican Jewish Coalition that ""some of you won't like this, maybe, but I would love to see peace in the Middle East."" pic.twitter.com/ck1mW07i7j
â Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 6, 2019 This is hilarious moment. Trump starts asking how did âyouâ support Obama and the Democrats. Then folks in crowd starts saying, no weâre the Jewish Republicans. Weâre the Jewish Republicans! Sort of the âSir, this is an Arbyâsâ of revisionist Zionism. https://t.co/1kT5ZNuoTI
â Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) April 6, 2019 Trump to Jews: ""How the hell did you support President Obama? How did you do it? How'd you do it?"" People in the room remind him that they didn't, since they are the Republican Jewish Coalition. He says, ""You guys didn't, that's right.""
â Daniel Dale (@ddale8) April 6, 2019 Former senator Norm Coleman, chair of the Republican Jewish Coalition, is leading a Passover Dayenu (it would have been enough) in which Donald Trump replaces God. ""Had President Trump ONLY passed the largest tax cut in history: say it with me. DAYENU.""
â Daniel Dale (@ddale8) April 6, 2019 Shame on everyone at the Republican Jewish Coalition event who applauded and cheered Trump's rhetoric here. White nationalists in the U.S. said the same then about Jews fleeing the Nazis in the 1930s. https://t.co/3W8hpjaPcF

Trump then invoked Rep. Ilhan Omar, his intuitive sense of bigotry zeroing in on the perfect scapegoat for the audience. President Trump speaks to the Republican Jewish Coalition: ""And a special thanks to Rep. Omar of Minnesota. Oh, oh -- oh, I forgot. She doesn't like Israel, I forgot. I'm so sorry. Oh. No she doesn't like Israel, does she?"" pic.twitter.com/m40iUKPUfW

Given the death threat Rep. Omar received this week, this is a dangerous game that Trump is playing. A Trump supporter was just charged with making explicit threats against the life of @IlhanMN . That fact did not stop the president from using her as fodder for ridicule in his Republican Jewish Coalition speech in Las Vegas today. https://t.co/1S1wlNFotF

Trending There Is No âGod Problemâ: Part I
Last year I had the privilege of working as a youth rowing coach in Germany, spending six months along the beautiful Rhine River. I built friendships, regained my German fluency, and even got a state-recognized coaching license â all things of which I am very proud.
While these positive experiences helped make this sojourn one Iâll cherish for the rest of my life, there was one cross I had to bear: my conservatism. In a country where 90% of the populace sees Donald Trump as a threatening despot, U.S. visitors who enjoy making America great again endure mockery and disdain.
I remember entering the rowing club in early July, eager to start my new job. Already insecure because of my rusty German-language skills, I was introduced to my boss and several other coaches who would teach me the tricks of the trade. They greeted me cordially and shook my hand with signature German vigor. After a brief tour of the building, I returned to the lobby with my boss. It was time to head home for the day...or so I thought. As I stepped towards the exit, a middle-aged man called out from behind, âOh, hello Trumpy! So, youâre the new youth coach here from America?â Startled, I turned around and greeted my sarcastic new co-worker. I ignored his oh-so-clever remark and offered him a standard introduction. After a brief first chat, the man departed.
As he turned the corner, my boss shook her head. Still confused, I asked her why this man, whom I had never met, called me âTrumpy.â She informed me that the coaches had checked all of my social media accounts weeks before, and noticed that I had been president of my schoolâs Young Republicans chapter. Needless to say, they werenât fond of my leanings. Her warning followed: âWhile I donât personally care, people around here donât like Trump, so I would avoid the topic of politics as a whole while you are here.â View Cartoon
I heeded her message. Little did I know, âTrumpyâ would stick.
While I didnât take offense at this contrived nickname, there were other instances that annoyed me during my otherwise pleasurable stay.
One fall afternoon, I waved to the same assistant coach who coined my irksome sobriquet. He feigned shock at this innocent gesture, claiming that my greeting somehow resembled a âHeil Hitlerâ salute. âI donât know what happens in Trumpland, but we donât do that here in Germany anymore,â he smugly enlightened me. He apparently found this highly amusing.
I never knew a wave could be so triggering!
A few weeks passed, and I was chatting with the group of rowers, ages 11-14, whom I coached during a regatta. With youthful curiosity, they questioned me about life in America, and how our two cultures differed. I delighted in answering, happy to hear their thoughts and express mine. Overall, it was an easygoing, relaxed conversation with a kind bunch of Kinder .
By now, it was well-established (even among my pupils) that I was a Republican. So, there was great curiosity about this strange creature. At one point during our chat, a precocious girl of 13 inquired, âSo, why do you like Trump?â I explained, with appropriate simplicity (given their ages), why his policies impressed me, and why I plan to vote for his re-election in 2020. Her response stunned me.
âBut Mike, my teachers tell me he rose to power just like Hitler, and that the two are very similar in a lot of ways.â
Caught off guard, I tried my best to point out why this wasnât the case. They listened, fascinated by a new perspective. Some even agreed that the comparison was overblown. Ironically, these middle-schoolers displayed more maturity and open-mindedness than many of my adult co-workers. Recommended The Democratic Field Is A Rainbow Of Sameness Derek Hunter
In hindsight, I realized something: For these impressionable kids, my viewpoint was virgin territory. That should have come as no surprise: Harvardâs Kennedy School of Government conducted a study revealing that coverage of Trump by Germanyâs leading TV channel ARD was 98 percent negative over the first 100 days of his presidency. German news frequently airs my bilingual U.S. household; I can attest that it noticeably hasnât improved since. Educators and journalists have created a Trump-loathing echo-chamber whose impact I witnessed firsthand.
As a dual citizen born in DÃ¼sseldorf, I always will hold Germany dear to my heart. It is my second home, where I can visit friends and relatives (on my motherâs side) while learning about my heritage. That said, the nationâs uniform hatred of our president worries me. The âF**k Trumpâ mantra has become consensus, consequently rendering individual policy discussions obsolete.
I hope Germans realize this flaw. I look forward to a day when this successful nationâs adults exhibit the same willingness to listen as that group of children showed me.

Our friend Grover Norquist at Americans for Tax Reform is making a huge radio buy, including spots on Rush Limbaugh.
The latest version of the ad features President Trump loudly proclaiming that the âUnited States will never be a socialist country.â It then asks why we would ever import socialized medicines from countries that have socialized medicine? Drugs that can be purchased in those socialist countries (like Canada) for a fraction of what Americans are forced to pay. Apparently Grover has no problem with importing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of knock-off products from Communist China.
One has to wonder who is really paying for those ads? It might seem a bit self-serving and less credible if the ads were paid for directly byâ¦sayâ¦Big Pharma.
There are few business associations that have less credibility than PhARMA, the association that represents the big pharmaceutical companies. They engage daily in deceit and deception. They mislead consumers and policy makers about the amount their members actually spend on research. They would have us believe that research and development consume the lionâs share of their oversized profits. When it was discovered that they actually spend more on advertising and marketing than they do on research, they mumbled and changed the subject.
As you watch cable or network news tonight, just count the number of ads that tout the latest treatments for everything from psoriasis to lung cancer. To make it easier, just count the number of times you hear, âAsk your Doctor.â You will also note that they frequently feature researchers in white coats. They usually include disclaimers that their drug may cause drowsiness, constipation or even in rare circumstances, death. They never disclose the actual suggested retail price of their products or that their use may drain your bank account. View Cartoon
That might cause uncontrollable rage!
PhARMA perpetuates the myth that we have a free market for Rx drugs here in the United States. There is nothing free about our drug market. Once a drug company receives a patent for a compound, they have a monopoly. Monopolies donât compete. Monopolies concentrate on maximizing profits. Especially if they are selling things that are necessities, in many cases just to remain alive. Not surprisingly, even in cases where two companies have similar drugs, they donât compete on price. They employ what is euphemistically called tandem pricing. They raise prices in tandem. There is a war raging right now between competing treatments for psoriasis. But the war is being waged on the airwaves, not on pricing.
Drug companies do spend money on research and on trials to satisfy the FDA that the treatment is both safe and effective. They take risks and should be rewarded for those risks. Many other industries invest heavily in research and take big risks. Computer chip companies, for example. It costs a lot of money to develop the next generation of chips. But, chip companies canât sell their products to German customers for less than half of what they sell them to Americans. If they did, American customers would simply buy their chips from German suppliers. Thatâs how free markets work.
But, the pharmaceutical companies got the federal government to grant them protections against reimporting their products. Protections that no other industry enjoys. So, American consumers have no protection from their predatory pricing. We are just ducks in a barrel. Recommended Conservative Abroad: My Experience As A Trump Fan In Germany Michael Malarkey
Ely Lily recently announced they would introduce a generic version of their Humalog Insulin. Insulin is a lifesaving product that was first commercialized over 100 years ago. The new generic version will sell here for about $137 per vial, less than half the price of their branded Insulin. They neglected to mention that the same vial can be purchased in Germany for $55.
Try to think of other examples of where we allow monopolies to charge whatever price they want, especially for things essential to life. We certainly donât let the gas and electric utilities to charge whatever they want. Imagine the revolt if natural gas rates were three times higher in one state than the one next door. The leaders of the first state profess to believe in free markets as they accuse their neighbor of selling socialized gas. No amount of clever advertising would quell the angry constituents.
It is only a matter of time before We the People reject this socialist gas nonsense and demand that these rapacious monopolies be put on a shorter leash. For many afflicted Americans, that day cannot come too soon.

NEW YORK â A queer friend of mine from a haredi Orthodox background had posed a query publicly on social media. She had attended a conference on LGBTQ inclusion. There she learned a practice of certain Catholic priests who described going into gay bars in full clerical garb: They would sit in the bar, and when queer Catholics approached them, the priests would affirm Godâs love and their belonging place in the church. My friend asked her community of observant Jews, acknowledging that rabbis donât have any identifying clerical garb: When might Orthodox rabbis do the same?As an Orthodox rabbi myself, I was intrigued. I discovered a rainbow kippah online and decided to purchase it.It managed to garner attention the first day I wore it. A woman took a picture of me and motioned a thumbs-up. A homeless man on the subway who was begging for money approached, pointing to my kippah , and said, âNow I like that,â and bumped my fist. A man in high heels came up to me before getting off his stop and said, âThanks for the yarmulke.â I even had made my way to the headquarters of Chabad Lubavitch that very same day for a meeting and a Hasid asked me where he could find a kippah like mine. I surmised: The kippah works.But what is it symbolizing and is it enough?The kippah is a symbol of my commitment to God, to Torah and the Jewish people. To me, the rainbow kippah is also a symbol that God and Judaism love you no matter your sexual orientation.I understand that the plain reading of Leviticus considers homosexual sex a â toevah ,â often translated as an abomination. I understand that Jewish law views kiddushin , the ritual ceremony of marriage, as a legal structure between a man and a woman. I know and respect this.But I also believe that the Torah does not want human beings to live alone, and supports a covenantal relationship between parties as they build a faithful Jewish home. I know that Judaism has, for thousands of years, had a rich understanding of the diversity of gender identities. I know that the Torah affirms the God-endowed dignity of all human beings.In the recent film â Boy Erased ,â based off Garrard Conleyâs memoir describing his experience in a gay conversion program, a scene between a Baptist pastor father and his adult gay son has stayed with me. Conleyâs character says something along the lines of âIâve tried to change, God knows Iâve tried. I canât change. Now it is your turn.âIâve thought about how resonant that particular sentence felt. The onus of responsibility now rests upon those of us in religious leadership positions: to continue to make space, validate, humanize, empathize and support those who have long felt suppressed by our traditions, and not the aggrieved parties themselves.My own rabbinical school, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, which is a beacon of progressive traditionalism, recently informed its students and alumni that one of its fourth-year students, an openly gay man, will not be receiving ordination a few months shy of graduation after years of study at the seminary. Itâs a painful reminder that LGBTQ Jews still lack the ability to fully participate as equals in all facets of Orthodox life.That is why, going forward, I will be officiating wedding ceremonies for queer Jews.Iâm passionately committed to God, Jewish law, Torah and the Jewish people. These wonât be â kiddushin â ceremonies, but similar to the brit shutafin (covenantal partnership) ceremonies the visionary Rabbi Steven Greenberg, founder of Eshel , has been performing for years.I understand that for some, this may feel like a blatant break from tradition, and I know some of my teachers and the larger Orthodox community believe that this is crossing a line that should not be crossed.Yet I know that there is a small but growing number of Orthodox rabbis from across the Modern Orthodox spectrum who believe that this is where we have to be moving. I hope that in doing so as a community, queer Jews will see themselves as valued in the community and see that their rabbis are ready to celebrate their life choices of sacred covenantal marriage as well. It is not only about upholding the dignity of the human being, but upholding the dignity of the Torah itself, which emphasizes the need for loving partnership.A wedding day should be a joyous day for loving companions, as liturgy connotes, regardless of their sexual orientation. If the couple is choosing to live Jewish lives, build a Jewish home and raise Jewish children, our traditional rabbinate must seize the opportunity to welcome and work with these families at their most precious life-cycle moments. If we donât, we risk further alienation and falling into an abyss of religious irrelevance by denying these couples their rightful place of belonging.Shouldnât our Orthodox communities rush at the opportunity to keep as many Jews engaged in their Judaism? Is this the Torah and this its reward?We are long overdue for a new paradigm. I am humbled to be part of a new generation seeking to straddle the sacred tradition we inherit as well as the humanity before us.

Team Red, White and Blue's annual 'Run For One 5k' was held in honor of Marine Veteran Clay Hunt. Hunt suffered from PTSD and took his own life in 2011 at the age of 28.
The run is a local version of a nationwide effort to combat veteran suicides, with similar runs held across the county.
Cynthia Watts has been with the program for 13 years and says that, while things are getting better, spreading the word that help is available for veterans is crucial to saving their lives.
""Not only are you touching that veteran's life, but you're touching their family, their friends, the community, because we know that if one person were to end their life, it effects the entire community,"" said Watts, Case Manager at Marion VA.
The run in Marion started in 2012 and organizers say at that time it was small and only had a few people participate.

It's being pushed and promoted by the globalist-minded United Nations who are literally seeking to create a single global government headed up by the UN.
So that being FACT how can you honestly still believe anything they say?"
Why does god need such a big universe?,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120664.html,"Why does god need such a big universe? Advertisement Is god really that big that he needs such a huge universe ? Or is it for greed and ostentatious ness? The problem I see is that he has spread himself very thin to the point that he has lost control and cannot manage it properly and give his subjects the attention they deserve and need? Look at the Satan rebellion. Satan caught god totally by surprise. He never saw the rebellion coming until it was too late. In the process god lost 1/3 of his army. That's a huge loss from which he has never recovered. Satan escaped to this planet and it's still here and has taken full control and god cannot penetrate it to defeat it. Satan was teasing god with Job and killed his family. He was teasing Jesus offering him administrative positions on this planet. Until satan came down to earth god was interacting with Abraham and his Jewish friends . Now god can't even send prophets to relay his thoughts. Totally silenced.

A little helper,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120663.html,"A little helper Advertisement It would seem they couldn't poison fools fast enough with GMOs, hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, so Candida auris comes to the rescue. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/healt...auris.html Quote: Last May, an elderly man was admitted to the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital for abdominal surgery. A blood test revealed that he was infected with a newly discovered germ as deadly as it was mysterious. Doctors swiftly isolated him in the intensive care unit. The germ, a fungus called Candida auris, preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe. Over the last five years, it has hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela, swept through a hospital in Spain, forced a prestigious British medical center to shut down its intensive care unit, and taken root in India, Pakistan and South Africa. Recently C. auris reached New York, New Jersey and Illinois, leading the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add it to a list of germs deemed âurgent threats.â The man at Mount Sinai died after 90 days in the hospital, but C. auris did not. Tests showed it was everywhere in his room, so invasive that the hospital needed special cleaning equipment and had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it. âEverything was positive â the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,â said Dr. Scott Lorin, the hospitalâs president. âThe mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.â C. auris is so tenacious, in part, because it is impervious to major antifungal medications, making it a new example of one of the worldâs most intractable health threats: the rise of drug-resistant infections. ... There are different theories as to what happened with C. auris. Dr. Meis, the Dutch researcher, said he believed that drug-resistant fungi were developing thanks to heavy use of fungicides on crops. Dr. Meis became intrigued by resistant fungi when he heard about the case of a 63-year-old patient in the Netherlands who died in 2005 from a fungus called Aspergillus. It proved resistant to a front-line antifungal treatment called itraconazole. That drug is a virtual copy of the azole pesticides that are used to dust crops the world over and account for more than one-third of all fungicide sales. A 2013 paper in Plos Pathogens said that it appeared to be no coincidence that drug-resistant Aspergillus was showing up in the environment where the azole fungicides were used. The fungus appeared in 12 percent of Dutch soil samples, for example, but also in âflower beds, compost, leaves, plant seeds, soil samples of tea gardens, paddy fields, hospital surroundings, and aerial samples of hospitals.â Dr. Meis visited the C.D.C. last summer to share research and theorize that the same thing is happening with C. auris, which is also found in the soil: Azoles have created an environment so hostile that the fungi are evolving, with resistant strains surviving. This is similar to concerns that resistant bacteria are growing because of excessive use of antibiotics in livestock for health and growth promotion. As with antibiotics in farm animals, azoles are used widely on crops. âOn everything â potatoes, beans, wheat, anything you can think of, tomatoes, onions,â said Dr. Rhodes, the infectious disease specialist who worked on the London outbreak. âWe are driving this with the use of antifungicides on crops.â Dr. Chiller theorizes that C. auris may have benefited from the heavy use of fungicides. His idea is that C. auris actually has existed for thousands of years, hidden in the worldâs crevices, a not particularly aggressive bug. But as azoles began destroying more prevalent fungi, an opportunity arrived for C. auris to enter the breach, a germ that had the ability to readily resist fungicides now suitable for a world in which fungi less able to resist are under attack. We weren't content with Earth feeding us for free, we had to come up with innovations and poison it in order to hoard as much as we can possibly, even if we have to throw it away."

Advertisement ""It's Not The Economy, Stupid... It's The State!""
The number one problem of all public debate about politics and economics is the failure to name the state. If this would change, so would public opinion.
There is no shortage of examples. People talk about health care for all, solving climate change, providing security in old age, universal educational access, boosting wages, ending discrimination, and you can add to the list without end.
Thatâs one side.
The other speaks of national identity, protecting jobs, making us more moral, forming cultural cohesion, providing security against the foreign enemy, and so on.
Obfuscation
All of this, no matter how fancy the language, is obfuscation. What all of this really means is: put the state in charge. Whatâs strange is the unwillingness to say it outright. This is for a reason. The plans the politicians have for our lives would come across as far less compelling if they admitted the following brutal truth.
There really are only two ways to allocate goods and services in society: the markets (which rely on individual choice) and the state (which runs on compulsion). No one has ever found a third way. You can mix the two â some markets and some state-run operations â but there always is and always will be a toggling between the two. If you replace markets, the result will be more force via the state, which means bureaucratic administration and rule by force. If you reduce the role of the state, you rely more on markets. This is the logic of political choice, and there is no escaping it.
The above paragraph is the great truth of political economy. Iâve never seen any evidence to dispute it. And yet it is the great unsayable truth. Seasons of political rhetoric fly by with no frank discussion of what precisely this or that proposal would require of the state and how that will affect our lives, much less a serious analysis of the risks of making a problem worse by replacing market forces.
