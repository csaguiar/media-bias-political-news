How to govern a digitally networked world,www.socialeurope.eu,Anne-Marie Slaughter and Fadi Chehadé,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.socialeurope.eu/a-digitally-networked-world,"Because the internet is a network of networks, its governing structures should be too. The world needs a digital co-governance order that engages public, civic and private leaders. Anne-Marie Slaughter
Governments built the current systems and institutions of international cooperation to address 19th- and 20th-century problems. But in today’s complex and fast-paced digital world, these structures cannot operate at ‘internet speed’.
Recognising this, the United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres , last year assembled a high-level panel —co-chaired by Melinda Gates and the Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma—to propose ways to strengthen digital governance and cooperation. (Fadi Chehadé, co-author of this article, is also a member.) It is hoped that the panel’s final report, expected in June, will represent a significant step forward in managing the potential and risks of digital technologies.
Digital governance can mean many things, including the governance of everything in the physical world by digital means. We take it to mean the governance of the technology sector itself, and the specific issues raised by the collision of the digital and physical worlds (although digital technology and its close cousin, artificial intelligence, will soon permeate every sector). Fadi Chehadé
The issue is rapidly rising to the top of the global agenda. At this year’s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the leaders of Japan, South Africa, China, and Germany called for global oversight of the technology sector, while acknowledging the difficulty of designing a workable governance system.
Some business leaders also accept the need for digital rules and conventions. The Microsoft president, Brad Smith, has called for a ‘Digital Geneva Convention’ to protect citizens from peacetime cyberattacks, while the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, argues that the United States needs its own version of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation regarding personal data. Both recognise that a continued lack of norms will hit business growth and further erode trust in their companies’ stewardship of the digital world. Co-governance
Because the internet is a network of networks, its governing structures should be, too. Whereas we once imagined that a single institution could govern global security or the international monetary system, that is not practical in the digital world. No group of governments, and certainly no single government acting alone, can perform this task.
Instead, we need a digital co-governance order that engages public, civic and private leaders on the basis of three principles of participation.
First, governments must govern alongside the private and civic sectors in a more collaborative, dynamic and agile way. Secondly, customers and users of digital technologies and platforms must learn how to embrace their responsibilities and assert their rights. Thirdly, businesses must fulfil their responsibilities to all of their stakeholders, not just shareholders.
In the digital order we envisage, representatives of governments, businesses and civil society would form peer-to-peer, self-governing horizontal networks . A central hub would activate these groups to address specific digital issues—such as the use of facial-recognition data, the sharing of patients’ health records with insurance providers and hidden advertising aimed at children—and ensure that relevant experts are included.
Participants in these networks would co-design digital norms , or actionable rules and implementation guidelines that give companies and citizens clear incentives to co-operate responsibly in the digital world. These co-designers should produce the best possible solutions at internet speed, and make them available for anyone to adopt voluntarily.
In some cases, national or international authorities may adopt new laws and regulations to ensure that digital norms are implemented and enforced. But such ‘top-down’ actions should be only a last resort and would ideally use the co-designed digital norms as blueprints.
The central hub or clearing house would loosely coordinate the networks and ensure that the entire co-governance order operates according to principles of openness, inclusivity, subsidiarity, resiliency and innovation. Furthermore, the hub would serve as an exchange for different networks’ digital norms, thereby encouraging their spread and adoption. This would also help to increase cohesion and limit unnecessary duplication.
In time, the hub might actively help governments, businesses and user groups, as well as other relevant national and international organizations, to participate in the design—and, crucially, the adoption—of digital norms. But it would push resources and power to the participants rather than acting as a top-down authority.
Horizontal networks are a practical design for governing the digital world. At the same time, they draw heavily on the successes (and failures) of existing networks of national regulators, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , the Financial Stability Board and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Instead of spending another year debating the perfect digital governance system, it would be wiser to start with a functional and proven approach and adapt along the way.
The world urgently needs a workable digital governance system that serves the common good. If public, private and civic leaders do not act soon, we risk economic decline, faster weaponisation of digital technologies and further erosion of trust and security. The consequences of this failure would extend well beyond the digital world.

Liberia: Pres. Weah Nominates Judge Yussif Kaba as Associate Justice FrontPageAfrica,frontpageafricaonline.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/news/liberia-pres-weah-nominatee-judge-yussif-kabba-as-associate-justice/,"14 Share The selection of Judge Kaba (pictured) is intended to appease the Mandingo ethnic group which believes that Justice Ja’neh’s impeachment trial was a witch-hunt against them
Monrovia, Liberia – The President of Liberia, Mr. George Manneh Weah, has appointed Judge Yussif Kaba as Associate Justice to the Supreme Court of Liberia.
If Judge Kaba is confirmed by the Liberian Senate, he will replace the impeached former Associate Justice Kabineh Mohammed Ja’neh. Judge Kaba’s appointment was announced Monday, April 1, by the Executive Mansion.
Associate Justice Ja’neh was last Friday, March 29, impeached by the Liberian Senate, which concurred with the House of Representatives, which had earlier voted to impeach Justice Ja’neh last August 2018.
On Thursday, March 18, FrontPageAfrica broke the news that impeccable sources had told us that the judge of the Civil Law Court, Yousif Kaba, was tipped to be appointed and to subsequently join the Bench should Associate Justice Kabineh Ja’neh be impeached. The Executive Mansion has again confirmed what was reported nearly two weeks ago.
An Executive Mansion source had hinted FrontPageAfrica that a number of names of qualified and experienced judges had been submitted to the Office of the President, but Judge Kaba’s name was a priority on the list.
When FrontPageAfrica was hinted, it was further told that the President would swiftly make the appointment of Judge Kaba.
The selection of Judge Kaba is intended to appease the Mandingo ethnic group which believes that Justice Ja’neh’s impeachment trial was a witch-hunt against them. Related Posts"

What the Trump administration should do in Latin America to go after Hezbollah,thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/436849-trump-administration-latin-america-go-after-hezbollah,"What the Trump administration should do in Latin America to go after Hezbollah By Emanuele Ottolenghi, opinion contributor — 04/02/19 08:00 AM EDT The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill View Latest Opinions >>
On Friday, a Miami court sentenced Ali Nasreeddine Kassir , a Miami-based Lebanese businessman and suspected Hezbollah facilitator, who pleaded guilty to passport fraud and conspiring to commit money laundering totaling over $70 million. Kassir’s conviction is the opening salvo in a string of interconnected cases implicating alleged Hezbollah financiers Nader Mohamad Farhat and Mahmoud Ali Barakat, and their U.S.-based business counterparts. When combined, these cases involve money transfers worth hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system, allegedly for laundering criminal proceeds, including from drug trafficking, and terror finance.
In response to this clear threat to the integrity of the U.S. financial system, the administration has begun to ramp up its pressure against Hezbollah’s overseas networks, yet South American governments need to offer much more cooperation for Washington’s efforts to succeed.
Both Farhat and Barakat are from Ciudad Del Este, the Paraguayan city in the Tri-Border Area of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, or TBA. A recent Miami Herald investigative piece called Ciudad Del Este “a giant washing machine for Latin American drug profits, knockoff consumer goods and terrorist fund-raising.” Hundreds of tons of commercial goods clear customs there on a monthly basis, mostly flying from Miami on commercial cargo flights. ADVERTISEMENT
Last year, the Justice Department correctly labelled Hezbollah a Transnational Criminal Organization. Also, since January 2017, the Departments of Treasury and State jointly made dozens of sanctions designations against Hezbollah’s overseas networks. Yet in order for these actions — from investigations to sanctions — to have their maximum impact, the U.S. is reliant on the cooperation of regional allies to block monies and assets before Hezbollah’s financiers can move them out of reach. Local governments have been slow to act against Hezbollah networks, sometimes even flat-out denying their existence.
Given the risks of local inaction and, occasionally, even obstruction, the Trump administration needs to calibrate its strategy to encompass a number of tools that can concurrently exercise maximum pressure on both Hezbollah networks and their corrupt enablers.
First, the U.S. must convince its regional allies to take tangible measures to meet the challenge.
None of the three TBA governments has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. While Argentina has made important advances in this direction, Brazil and Paraguay, the two countries where Hezbollah financial networks are most active, lag behind. Such legislation is critical and President Trump Donald John Trump Colbert mocks Trump for 'oranges' gaffe Dem wins Trump district in swing-state Pennsylvania Trump says health care plan will be first vote after 2020 election MORE should use his prestige to urge his counterparts to take this step.
The recent, successful visit of Brazil’s new president, Jair Bolsonaro, to Washington has created the basis for a fruitful personal relationship between the two leaders. Trump enjoys similar warm relations with Argentinian president Mauricio Macri, and he should leverage these personal relationships to compel Brasilia and Buenos Aires to take action.
Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina also need new legislation to enhance investigative and preventive measures by intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. Once in place, this legislative framework would enable these governments to impose sanctions and conduct investigations jointly with the United States. Joint designations would send a strong message to the global financial system, and the freezing of assets related to the designated parties would be more comprehensive and effective.
The TBA governments should also work to contain the damage caused by leaks, or worse, the active obstructionism mounted by corrupt officials. That is why the United States must be prepared to act independently when partner governments refuse to cooperate, or when their actions are undermined by corrupt local officials.
U.S. criminal investigations, indictments, and successful prosecutions must, where possible, continue, with added resources allocated to relevant government agencies in order to increase the number of cases prosecuted and increase the rate of successful convictions. ADVERTISEMENT
This is necessary because in the TBA large investigations into alleged money laundering schemes with possible terrorist financing connections frequently fail to go to trial. Last November, Paraguayan newspaper ABC Color tied Hezbollah to the 2016 “ megalavado ” (“mega-wash”) investigation, which uncovered one of the largest money-laundering schemes in Paraguay’s history. It remains to be seen whether the alleged scheme benefited the terror group. Regardless, the U.S. State Department flagged the case as a sign of Paraguay’s failure to fight money laundering.
It has been more than two years since Paraguayan authorities conducted raids against the suspected perpetrators. The prosecutors in charge of the case have been replaced several times — including, most recently, over the past Christmas holiday. There have been neither indictments nor exonerations.
Finally, the United States should leverage existing sanctions legislation, not just to disrupt Hezbollah’s overseas networks, but also target those who facilitate Hezbollah’s networks through complicity, collusion, corruption and protection. In October 2018, President Trump signed into law the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act Amendments Act . This legislation augmented previous efforts by the U.S. Congress to expand the reach of U.S. financial sanctions against Hezbollah through the original Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act. Combined, this legislative framework presents a two-tiered threat to Hezbollah’s corrupt enablers in the TBA.
First, the legislation imposes secondary sanctions not only on known Hezbollah entities, but on those “determined by the President to be engaged in fundraising or recruitment activities for Hizballah.” While these activities are already prohibited by U.S. sanctions law, the secondary sanctions require the administration to sanctions “any foreign person that the President determines knowingly provides significant financial, material, or technological support to or for” Hezbollah fundraisers. This could include any Paraguayan, Brazilian, or Argentine individual or company that rents facilities to, provides banking services for, receives bribes from, or takes any other action that aides a person designated for fundraising or recruitment.
Second, the legislation authorizes the application of enhanced due diligence measures for US banks with respect to entire jurisdictions other than Lebanon — at the federal, state, or municipal levels — that “expressly consent to, or with knowledge allow, the use of their territory by Hizballah to carry out terrorist activities, including training, financing, and recruitment.” This means that if local politicians and bureaucrats in the TBA know about and disregard Hezbollah’s fundraising and recruitment in areas that they administer, the administration could subject the area itself to increased financial scrutiny.
The administration has an opportunity to utilize diplomacy, law enforcement actions, and sanctions designations to crack down on Hezbollah’s operations in the TBA, and Latin America more broadly. Doing so will not only limit Hezbollah’s operational capabilities, but defend the U.S. financial system against the drug profits and terrorist fund-raising that pervades that region.

UN warns nuclear war looms | TODAY.NG,www.today.ng,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.today.ng/news/world/warns-nuclear-war-looms-209297,"UN warns nuclear war looms By - April 3, 2019 alt=''/></a> alt=''/></a> alt=''/></a> alt=''/></a>
The United Nations warns that the threat of a nuclear weapon being used is now “higher than it has been in generations.”
The UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Izumi Nakamitsu, gave the warning on Wednesday in New York, at a meeting convened in support of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The meeting was convened by the UN Security Council at the UN headquarters ahead of the next conference to review the historic accord, scheduled for 2020.
Nakamitsu regretted that humanity now lived in a world defined by “competition over cooperation, and the acquisition of arms, prioritised over the pursuit of diplomacy.”
The NPT, which entered into force in 1970, represents the only multilateral binding commitment to the goal of disarmament by the countries which officially stockpile nuclear weapons.
The objective of NPT was to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapon technology, promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and disarmament overall.
Nakamitsu warned that the use of nuclear weapons, “either intentionally, by accident, or through miscalculation,” was one of the greatest threats to international peace and security.”
She added that “the potential consequences of a nuclear war would be global and affect all member states.”
The treaty, she said, was widely acknowledged as “the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation of nuclear disarmament.”
“Its role as a pillar of our collective security is likewise an accepted fact,” the nuclear disarmament chief said.
The durability of the NPT, which has lasted for almost half a century, cannot be taken for granted, she insisted.
She added that there was currently nothing to replace the disarmament and arms control framework which was foundational to the post-Cold War era.
Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano, while briefing the council, said the IAEA was facing several challenges, including the steady increase in the amount of nuclear material in circulation.
Other challenges facing the agency, he said, were the number of nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards (the system of inspection and verification of the peaceful uses of nuclear materials), and continuing pressure on the agency’s budget.
He told the council that monitoring the nuclear programmes of Iran and North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), were among the top items on the IAEA’s agenda.
In a statement released after the meeting, the Security Council announced a reaffirmation of its members’ support for the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The council reaffirmed a commitment to “advance the goals of the NPT as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.” "
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez allegedly jabs Jared Kushner over WhatsApp use,www.jpost.com,ILANIT CHERNICK,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/American-Politics/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-allegedly-jabs-Jared-Kushner-over-WhatsApp-use-585614,"1 minute read. b U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks to members of the media following a televised town hall event on the “Green New Deal” in the Bronx borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 29, 2019.

Congresswoman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has reportedly taken a jab at White House senior adviser Jared Kushner after allegations emerged that he was using WhatsApp to conduct official government business. In March, Democrat Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, accused Kushner of using the messaging app to discuss classified information in a letter to the White House. The Hill reported Ocasio-Cortez as saying that ""we are getting reports from the press and from a wide variety of sources that indicate that ... we are conducting foreign relations with folks with security clearances via WhatsApp,"" during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on White House security clearances. While addressing the hearing, the congresswoman claimed that ""every day that we go on without getting to the bottom of this matter is a day that we are putting hundreds, if not potentially thousands of Americans at risk. I mean, really. What is next? Putting nuclear codes in Instagram DMs?"" ""This is ridiculous,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, while calling on lawmakers to get to the bottom of these concerns and address the ""wrongdoings"" of the Trump administration when it comes to granting clearance. ""Everyday that there is an insecure line of communication that could be leaked, that could be hacked, that could be screenshot-ed without proper channels is a day that we are putting our national security at risk.” Last month, The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant Kushner clearance despite objections of national security officials. On Monday, Cummings released a memo, which quoted whistleblower Tricia Newbold, a long-serving government employee who has overseen the issuing of clearances for several senior White House aides. Newbold compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year but were eventually granted access after senior officials overruled those decisions. Cummings’ panel has been looking into security clearances issued to senior officials including Kushner.

New Right leader Naftali Bennett issued a fierce attack on the Zehut party of former Likud MK Moshe Feiglin on Wednesday at a Hebrew language conference in Tel Aviv that was sponsored by The Jerusalem Post Group, the parent company of the Ma'ariv newspaper and The Post.Bennett's attack came after Zehut started obtaining a similar amount of seats in polls as the New Right, taking votes away from the party of Bennett and Shaked. He used the speech and his answers to questions from Ma'ariv columnists to reach out to Feiglin's young voters in the religious Zionist movement. ""I say to each of them - Feiglin is a man with good intentions, but behind him are people on the Left as well as on the Right, and that is exactly the incident we had with Raful [former Tzomet Party leader Raphael] Eitan in 1992. The people he brought in dismantled our house. Every vote that goes to Feiglin brings the bulldozers closer to your houses. Do not vote to destroy your house.""Bennett accused Feiglin of being a ""almost a phenomenon of messianism."" He said Feiglin wrote two months before the 2005 Gaza disengagement that it would not happen.""A new generation has grown who do not know the old Feiglin, but this is the same book in a different cover,"" Bennett said. Mocking Blue and White leaders experience dealing with the Gaza Strip, Bennett said that ""generations of defense ministers and generals with 117 and 217 years of experience have been explaining to us that there is no solution.""He vowed that if appointed defense minister he would restore quiet to the South in what he called ""a very sophisticated air operation, in which we will not enter soldiers if there is no need.""

Blind and visually-impaired voters across the country will be able to cast their ballots in Tuesday’s general election without any assistance, courtesy of an Israeli-developed artificial vision device.There are approximately 24,000 Israelis registered as blind today, of whom 22,000 have the right to vote. A further 100,000 voters are visually impaired. Ahead of the hotly-contested vote, Jerusalem-based artificial vision device maker OrCam has partnered with the Central Elections Committee and the Center for the Blind in Israel in a pilot program seeking to enable every voter to exercise his democratic right while preserving the right to vote by secret ballot.OrCam’s MyEye 2 device is recognized as the world’s most advanced wearable artificial vision technology for people who are blind, partially sighted, have reading difficulties or experience reading fatigue. The device, mounted on any eyeglass frame, instantly and discreetly reads printed and digital text aloud, such as the paper ballots in the voting booth, and is simply activated by a pointing gesture or by following the wearer’s gaze.The Election Committee chose to implement OrCam’s technology at the ballot box after publishing an invitation to tender and examining a range of accessibility solutions.“This is actually the first time in the world that breakthrough technology will enable blind and visually-impaired people to exercise the right to vote independently and without being accompanied,” said OrCam co-founder, president and CEO Ziv Aviram.“Thanks to our cooperation with the Elections Committee, we will demonstrate how our groundbreaking artificial intelligence technology empowers the lives of tens of thousands of citizens. We hope that the world will adopt the pilot that the State of Israel is leading, and will enable independence for the blind and other visually-impaired people around the world.”The pilot program will be implemented at 12 polling stations, from Eilat in the south to Acre in the north, and in both Jewish and minority communities. Exact locations will be published on the Elections Committee’s website.When voting begins on Tuesday, blind and visually-impaired citizens can choose to vote at the polling station where they are registered, accompanied by an individual of their choice for assistance, or they can arrive at a specially-adapted polling station participating in the pilot program and vote using the OrCam device.Polling stations participating in the pilot will also enable voters to receive assistance from an individual of their choice instead of using the device, if necessary.OrCam was co-founded in 2010 by Aviram and Prof. Amnon Shashua, the co-founders of autonomous driving innovator Mobileye, which was acquired by Intel Corp. in August 2017 for $15.3 billion. The company’s MyEye technology is available in 25 languages and 40 countries.

A Twitter fan account for the singer Taylor Swift went viral after it was revealed that it was purportedly run by an Israeli woman who served time in prison for refusing to join the IDF.The young woman, who identified herself only as Na’ama, had been running a Twitter account for more than a year devoted to Swift. For the past two months it went silent, until Tuesday when the account sprung back to life. “As most of you know, I haven’t been very active in the past couple of months because I was in prison :/ I’m back now though :) more Taylor Swift updates coming soon!” the account @LegitTayUpdates posted on Tuesday. A fan replied: “omg why,” to which Na’ama responded: “I refused to join the IDF lmao,” using the internet slang abbreviation for “laughing my ass off.”That interaction quickly went viral, with the original tweet as well as screenshots of the exchange gaining tens of thousands of likes and retweets. | UPDATE|| As most of you know, I haven't been very active in the past couple of months because I was in prison :/ I'm back now though :) more Taylor Swift updates coming soon! — Taylor Swift Updates (@LegitTayUpdates) April 2, 2019 In a direct message exchange with The Jerusalem Post , Na’ama said the reaction since she was released from military prison on Tuesday has been overwhelming.“Once a screenshot of my tweet went viral, everything just sort of exploded,” she wrote. “People have reached out for more info, (former) friends of mine have blocked me and berated me for using my time as a “tool for attention”, people have offered my jobs, money, drinks, tours in their country, marriage...

The Jerusalem Post could not independently verify her story.“This story is kind of blowing up, and I don’t want it to have negative consequences on my friends or family or community,” she said.During the two months that Na’ama was purportedly in prison, a friend, Noya, posted regular updates from visiting days, including photographs of Na’ama’s handwritten notes while behind bars.On both her private and personal Twitter accounts after her release, Na’ama elaborated on her political views, the reason she went to prison and her plans for the future.“Free Palestine, throw Netanyahu in prison, and donate to the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund, who actually are confirmed to use at least 86% of their donations on the programs and services they deliver!” she wrote from the Taylor Swift fan account, which gained several thousand followers in just 24 hours.On her personal account, she joked about her time in prison and her family’s reaction.“Everyone’s congratulating me on going to prison man I can’t WAIT till my parents hear about this,” she tweeted. “Ya girl’s famous for being a pro-Palestine disgrace to her family, wow what a legacy!” Ya girl's famous for being a pro-Palestine disgrace to her family, wow what a legacy! https://t.co/2StgRH8H3F — Hello IDF pls don't arrest me again (@iknowplacesmp6) April 2, 2019 She also explained why she didn’t seek or receive an exemption from her army service: “I didn’t get a moral waver [sic] because they proved I wasn’t a true pacifist (I told them I’d punch a Nazi),” she wrote. “And you can’t choose to do National Service for no reason, you have to get a waver [sic]. I wasn’t gonna get married or turn Orthodox to get a waver [sic], so I did the time. As is the (f***ed up) law.”Na’ama also wrote that after voting in next week’s election for “whatever pro-Palestine party I feel like!” she intends to move to New York, stay with relatives and work in the film industry.So far, Taylor Swift herself has yet to weigh in.“I don’t expect it,” Na’ama told the Post. “I didn’t do or say any of this for a prize or a reward... I really don’t think me being a Taylor stan has anything to do with this.”

May now gambles on last-minute softer Brexit deal,euobserver.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://euobserver.com/brexit/144575,"British May has gambled on talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
Her decision could lead to closer EU relations and a second extension of the Brexit deadline.
Jeremy Corbyn (l) has said UK should stay in a permanent customs union with EU (Photo: European Commission) But fury inside her own party and from her Northern Irish allies could also prompt snap elections and a no-deal exit on 12 April.
May announced her gambit after seven-hour long, but inconclusive, talks with her cabinet ministers in London on Tuesday and after MPs rejected a series of Brexit proposals on Monday.
""Today I am taking action to break the logjam: I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to, to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal,"" she said.
""The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach ... that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the house for approval, and which I could then take to next week's European Council,"" May added, referring to an emergency EU summit in Brussels on 10 April.
""I've always been clear that we could make a success of no-deal in the long term, but leaving with a deal is the best solution,"" the prime minister said.
For his part, Corbyn agreed to hold talks on Wednesday.
""I recognise my responsibility,"" the leader of the left-wing Labour Party said.
The talks opened the door to a softer Brexit than that envisaged by May's Conservative party.
Corbyn has in the past said the UK ought to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU and to have the same relations with the single market as those it has now. He also wants workers' rights in the UK to be continuously aligned with those in the EU.
The new talks were greeted with caution by EU officials, who previously said they would need strong reasons to extend the 12 April deadline further.
""Even if, after today, we don't know what the end result will be, let us be patient,"" EU Council president Donald Tusk said.
The French and German foreign ministers, speaking to press from a UN meeting in New York, were more critical of the British confusion.
""We are five minutes past midnight and this should be known in London,"" Germany's Heiko Maas said.
""Honestly, it's sometimes difficult to follow,"" France's Jean-Yves Le Drian said on the twists and turns of the Brexit debate in London.
""Three years after their decision, it would be great if they had a clear position. Otherwise, a hard Brexit will have to take place in the coming days,"" he added.
But back in London, May's appeal to Corbyn was seen as a betrayal by the eurosceptic wing in her party, auguring a potential collapse of the government.
""You do find that leaders who decide to go with the opposition rather than their own party find their own party doesn't plainly follow,"" Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Tory MP who leads an anti-EU faction in May's party, said.
Boris Johnson, a Tory MP and former foreign minister, said a deal with Corbyn would make Brexit ""soft to the point of disintegration"".
The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government in Westminster, added: ""It remains to be seen if sub-contracting out the future of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn, someone whom the Conservatives have demonised for four years, will end happily.""
Meanwhile, if the Corbyn talks failed, May said she would put ""a number of options for the future [EU] relationship"" to ""a series of votes"" in parliament ""to determine which course to pursue.""
""Crucially, the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the house,"" she said on Tuesday.
But that failed to reassure business groups, given that parliament had failed to agree on any course of action over the past three years.
""The clock is still ticking, and avoiding a messy and disorderly exit from the EU is still the top priority for our business communities,"" Adam Marshall, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said after May spoke.

[Opinion] European elections - can the centre hold?,euobserver.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://euobserver.com/opinion/144553,"Last month the European Parliament criticised Slovakia and Malta for attacks on judicial independence and media freedom.
This underlines that in the upcoming European parliament elections, the real threat to the EU isn't going to come from fringe parties.
The Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) and the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) are going to grow, but they won't reach a majority by a long shot.
The trouble is going to come from within the mainstream - unless it is willing to rethink its alliances. Centrist political groups will still collectively hold a clear majority.
But that majority has some fishy elements.
The four largest political groups in the parliament all host national parties that have run into trouble for threats to baseline EU values.
And according to Politico's poll of polls data , almost all of those national parties are predicted to grow.
It's not just Hungary's Fidesz, sitting in the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), and Poland's PiS, sitting in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) , that have been targeted by parliament for dismantling constitutional checks and balances.
Romania's SPD, Malta's Labour Party (PL) and Slovakia's Smer have all been chided for interfering with judicial independence, systematic corruption, and/or threats to press freedom.
They're part of the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group.
Similarly, leadership of the Czech Republic's Ano has also been pulled up for corruption and conflicts of interest that risk endangering the country's democracy.
Ano sits in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (Alde), and so does the problematic Romanian government's junior coalition partner.
Each of the largest four political groups in the European parliament has tried to shield their 'problem children' from criticism during parliamentary votes.
That's only going to get worse when their share of seats grows.
Difficult future parliament It's going to become very difficult for the European Parliament to condemn serious violations of civil liberties in the future.
Especially if the likes of Fidesz, or Ano or the PL can count not only on the support of their group, but probably also the support of an enlarged Eurosceptic ENF and EFDD.
In a worst-case scenario, we could see the centre-right EPP team up with authoritarians, as has happened, for example, in Austria and Bulgaria.
The EPP has not ruled out collaborating with the EFDD and ENF.
The EPP could come together with the ECR and those anti-values parties from the S&D and ALDE groups, plus new parties like Spain's Vox and currently non-aligned parties like Hungary's Jobbik.
Such an unholy alliance could deliver a majority according to current polling data.
But there is hope.
Based on current polling data, anti-values MEPs can expect to claim no more than 30 percent of seats.
Which leaves 70 percent of the house belonging to MEPs whose parties nominally support - or at least have not openly contested - basic standards to protect the rule of law, democratic pluralism and fundamental rights.
But for this pro-values bloc to work together, mainstream political groups are going to have to kick out their illiberal members.
The EPP is taking steps on Fidesz , although it is important to keep up the pressure and ensure that the suspension and internal investigation are not merely an effort to stall a decision on expulsion until after the elections.
Follow EPP example? The S&D, Alde and the ECR should follow suit.
Otherwise centrists will end up giving parties with illiberal tendencies access to the heart of the European parliament's power and influence.
Liberties has developed a #Vote4Values: Elections Tracker 2019 to visualise for voters where anti-values MEPs sit in the European Parliament.
The tracker is based on data from Politico's poll of polls.
This would allow citizens to check if their preferred party is in bed with problematic parties from other countries. It could encourage voters to start asking political candidates why they are collaborating with parties attacking civil liberties.
And then we might see political groups in Brussels rethinking their membership or ruling out cooperation with particular problematic parties in advance of the election.
The tracker also visualises for users what kinds of pro-values coalitions MEPs could form, if the main political groups were to eject their troublesome members.
There are multiple possible pro-values coalitions.
There is no need for mainstream parties to hold themselves hostage to their rotten apples. Instead they can hold on to their values and rule in coalition with others that share them.

"Johnny Manziel, Other Players React To AAF Suspending Operations Halfway Through Inaugural Season",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/aaf-suspends-operations-midseason-amidst-dispute-leagues-finances-future-1384183,"The Alliance of American Football suspended operations Tuesday, only halfway through its inaugural season.
Bill Polian, one of the league’s co-founders, placed the blame on league owner Tom Dundon over financial matters and the future direction of the league.
""I am extremely disappointed to learn Tom Dundon has decided to suspend all football operations of the Alliance of American Football,"" Polian said Tuesday in a statement. ""When Mr. Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all.
""The momentum generated by our players, coaches and football staff had us well positioned for future success. Regrettably, we will not have that opportunity.""
The league that was set up to be a minor league for the NFL appeared to have trouble out of the gate. After the first week of the season, reports surfaced that AAF had run out of money and couldn’t make its payroll. The league disputed that claim and said it was an error with the payroll disbursement company the league hired, according to ESPN .
However, after that first week, Dundon, who owns the National Hockey League’s Carolina Panthers, pledged to commit $250 million toward the league. This led to Dundon’s role as league owner, the report stated.
The league averaged 400,000 to 500,000 viewers per game, according to ESPN. AAF got another shot in the arm when former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel signed with the AAF’s Memphis Express.
Once news hit Tuesday that the league would fold, Manziel went to social media and warned players that “the last check you got will be the last one that you get. No lawsuit or anything else will get you your bread. Save your money and keep your head up. It’s the only choice at this point unless something drastic happens.”
“Just the reality of this unfortunate situation.. great concept, good football on the field and fun for fans to watch. Just not enough money to go around which has been the main problem with “other” leagues for a long time,” Manziel said in another tweet.
Though fans of the AAF and some media reacted to the league's folding on social media, few of the AAF's players other than Manziel spoke about the league. San Diego Fleet defensive end Damontre Moore thanked his family through Instagram for their support.
Anthony Manzo-Lewis, a fullback for Memphis, said he was kicked out of his room and 17 hours away from home ""with a car full of belongings."" He tweeted: ""Unorganized is an understatement...kicked out of our rooms (that weren’t paid apparently) 17 hours away from home with a car full of my belongings and nowhere to go...#JoinTheAlliance @TheAAF @CharlieEbersol @TDCanes @espn @BleacherReport @aafexpress""
Weslye Saunders, a tight end for the Birmingham Iron, tweeted a photo of himself and his daughter, who ""finally got to see her daddy play!""
Former New York Jets linebacker Taiwan Jones, who played collegiately at Michigan State, said he ""literally dropped everything"" to sign with the Memphis Express on Monday night, less than a full day before the league folded.
ESPN reported that all players signed three-year contracts, but with no guarantee. Players were to receive $70,000 their first year, $80,000 the second year and $90,000 in the third. Polian said the league was set up as a minor league system to send players to the NFL. The co-founder said that’s still his mission.
""My thanks go out to all who made our football product so competitive and professional,"" Polian said in his statement. ""I am certain there are many among them destined for future success in the NFL and I look forward to doing all I can to help them in their quest.""
Steve Spurrier, who coached the Orlando Apollos, reminded reporters that his team was 7-1 and led the league in winning percentage. Therefore he claimed the Apollos as possible league champions.
""We're all disappointed, but on the other side, we got to be the champs, right?"" Spurrier told reporters. ""We're 7-1 and the next teams are 5-3. Some of us didn't get into the Alliance to advance our careers, but the players ... I'm more disappointed for all the players that believe, 'This is my chance to show people this, that and the other that I can play this game.'
""And a lot of them will get opportunities. They've shown enough.""

The despair Of The British nation. Wednesday, 3 April 2019 Disgusting, Dreadful Waste Of Humanity. Can There Ever Have Been A More Duplicitous, Evil Prime Minister? The death of democracy. May's family background ought to have her weeping and distraught at what she has just been handed on a plate. The beheading of our democracy. She should also but will not, weep in shame for her dance on behalf of her spiritual Mother, the EUSSR. Can there be such an arrogant, self entitled fool ever, in our history, as gross as this modern Salome, dancing before her Uncle, the UK Mandarin class? Oily Robbins, in my analogy, makes the perfect Uncle to May's dance. Remember her ugly sashaying of the last few months. Her movements as visually unpleasant and embarrassing as her character. Last evening, just before the daily orgy of self satisfied, deep state media we are now forced each day, to endure, May stood and spat out her demands for the head of John The Baptiste, in return for a dance of evil betrayal. To sit and watch as this unelected placement of a Prime Minister was foisted upon us as the face of treason, with but one job to do, destroy the United Kingdom, was terrible. To have been witness to a close on three year grotesque masquerade of deceit, masked by veils of transparent lies and nastiness, has been a period of utter shame. That millions this morning will rejoice at the gory head of John being handed on a plate to this excuse for a human being, smacks of the images beloved of ISIS and their cheering supporters of torture and decapitation. Disciples of that barbaric cult welcomed by this woman's tenure and her liberal, lying aides and guttersnipes. Stop just for a moment to look around at what we have become. Mass immigration of alien and backward brutality has destroyed our ability to offer fair sanctuary to more deserving victims of human cruelty. Christians many of them but also persecuted people from afar, now abandoned in favour of population replacement. A culture that admires misogyny, one that presides over child marriage, rape of mainly white children. A seething mass of malcontents rapidly changing our Country into the hell they left behind in their own war torn slums and carnage. To complain brings a howl of opprobrium and stupid labels of made up words. Islamaphobia for heaven's sake. ""Far right"" spat out as if ""Far left"" that led to Nazi holocaust ambition is to be lauded. Please. Drug wars, knife crime, murder now playground pastimes have all been accelerated in step with our 40 years of genuflection to the EUSSR's deep state excrement of a political dictatorship. May a perfect, self obsessed, Salome, no doubt, as she watched herself all over last night's media fest, orgasmic at the suffering the decapitation of our once proud democracy is causing a MAJORITY of her citizens. Never have I loathed a politician as I do she. Major's gaffe infested, ERM debacle, Gordon Brown's surly and gifted over a plate of pizza Premiership, were bad. Bliar's reign of warmongering, death wielding horror was pretty nasty. This woman tops them all. For almost three years she has colluded, conspired and flirted to satisfy her lust for the murder of decency and the crushing of Christian values. Her Husband's connections blatantly steeped in weaponry. Is his wealth and her lust for power and the gifts from her EU Uncle on platters, part of her deep seated horrific nature? I do remember a brief meeting with her in the early nineties. Just seconds in a short exchange gave me the creeps. Little did I know. What I know now is that in my lifetime, possibly forever, we shall never see again a more duplicitous, two faced gargoyle, dancing so unattractively before our rulers as she is doing to the EUSSR. Her orchestra the likes of Oily Robbins, Verhofstadt and now her new best friend and lover of terrorist methods, to slaughter decency and opposing views, Corbyn. Yesterday was darker than Dunkirk, more divisive than the blitz was unifying. The word betrayal doesn't come close. Shame an emotion she is a total stranger to. Her barren nature devoid of any empathy for the pain she causes. She was weaker than the French capitulation to Hitler. Her face a calm, smug air of my way or no way, beloved of all bullies. May she rot in hell. Along with every Uncle she has so desperately sought to please. The swamp just got ever more overcrowded. May she rot in Hell. Posted by"
Does Windmill Noise Cause Cancer? Donald Trump Renews Campaign Against Wind Power With New Claim,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-wind-power-windmills-noise-cancer-renewable-energy-birds-1384338,"On 4/3/19 at 4:30 AM EDT Share U.S. Donald Trump
President Donald Trump renewed his attack against wind power during a rambling speech at a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner on Tuesday, saying that wind turbines undermined property values, killed birds and even caused cancer.
The president, who doesn't acknowledge climate change and has staunchly opposed wind-generated power, often outlandlishly criticizes renewable technology as he lauds coal and other traditional fossil fuels. Scientists call Trump's opposition to renewable energy “ malicious ignorance .”
Trump’s most common line of attack on wind power is that the turbines kill birds—they do, but at a far lower rate than other energy sources—and that reliance on turbines (which he seems to confuse with windmills) would mean no electricity when there is no wind —an argument nullified by the existence of battery storage.
On Tuesday, he mocked wind power as part of an attack on his former presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, who proposed greater investment in wind turbines to reduce reliance on traditional fossil fuels and bring down carbon emissions.
“Hillary wanted to put up wind. Wind,” he told the crowd. “If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value.” He then introduced his newest argument, telling the audience, “And they say the noise causes cancer,” before mimicking the sound of a turbine as the crowd laughed and applauded.
There is no evidence that the noise of a wind turbine causes cancer. Anti-wind power groups have incorrectly claimed that the low-frequency noise—known as infrasound—given off by turbines can cause health problems including nausea, sleep loss and anxiety, among many other symptoms, The Atlantic explained.
No research has ever shown that harm came from such low frequencies, and no cancer of any kind has been linked to high levels of noise. Chemicals and patriculates released in the extraction, storage, transportation and burning of coal and other fossil fuels, however, have been associated with higher rates of cancer .
The graphic below, provided by Statista , illustrates projections for the generation of electricity from renewable sources in the U.S.

The president continued to lament the number of birds killed by the turbines. “And of course it’s like a graveyard for birds. If you love birds, you’d never want to walk under a windmill, because it’s a very sad, sad sight. It’s like a cemetery. We put a little statue for the poor birds.”
At a campaign rally in Michigan last month, Trump again attacked Clinton’s plans to expand America’s wind power infrastructure. “You know, Hillary wanted to put windmills all over the place. Let's put up some windmills. When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television darling, please. There's no wind, please turn off the television quickly,” the president said. “I know a lot about wind,” he added.
And at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Trump dismissed the effectiveness of wind energy as part of his attack on the Green New Deal. “When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric,” he claimed, incorrectly.
Despite Trump’s continued opposition, the U.S. wind energy industry is growing. According to the American Wind Energy Association , the industry supported more than 100,000 jobs in 2017 and provided 6.3 percent of the nation’s energy. The Energy Information Association said wind power was on track to surpass hydropower as the country’s largest source of renewable energy by 2019 .
President Donald Trump talks to reporters while welcoming NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the White House on April 2, in Washington, D.C. Trump renewed his attack against wind power during a rambling speech at a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner on Tuesday, claiming, without any evidence, that wind turbines undermined property values, killed birds and even caused cancer.

"Viral Video Shows Virginia Police Officer Telling Black Students That When 'Your Asses Turn 18, Then You're Mine'",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/video-virginia-police-officer-telling-black-students-when-your-asses-turn-18-1384308,"Police in Virginia have launched an investigation after a video emerged appearing to show a white officer telling black students “wait until your asses turn 18, then you’re mine.”
In the video shot on March 28, students stand outside Albert Hill Middle School when a Richmond Police Department car drives past and an officer shouts at the group.
Tenesha Calloway, the mother of one of the students addressed by the police officer, shared the video on Facebook. Calloway said the group was waiting outside the institution to attend an after-school program, when the officer made a U-turn and shouted: “What did you say?”. When one of the children replied nothing but stated they have the right to speak, he replied: “Wait until your asses turn 18, then you’re mine.”
The mother said she was “disgusted and disappointed” by the officer’s actions.
“My child and her friends have to walk to their after-school program and knowing that the police are making idle threats to them is unsettling,” she wrote. “I want to know who this officer is and I demand an apology and some form of reprimand to this officer.”
Cameron Hillard, an eighth-grade student at Albert Hill Middle, filmed the footage. In a YouTube video, the 13-year-old said she heard someone outside of her group say “f**k the police.”
Her mother Keisha Curry told NBC she hopes the incident will prompt a conversation between law enforcement, the state and parents.
Curry said she didn’t want the officer to be fired, but suggested he was not fit to patrol the streets.
Calloway told CB17.com: ""These are children, these are not adults, they weren't doing anything.""
Levar Stoney, the mayor of Richmond, said in a statement: “This type of behavior will not be tolerated by any employee of the City of Richmond. I trust that the Richmond Police Department will conduct a quick and thorough investigation and respond accordingly.
“This behavior is unacceptable. It reinforces stereotypes of our communities that are hurtful and damages the relationship between our police department and the citizens they are charged to serve.”
Richmond Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Richmond Police Department confirmed to NBC News the police officer is white, but did not reveal his identity.
""The Department takes these concerns very seriously,” he said. ""The officer in the video is currently being investigated by the Internal Affairs Division.""
The Richmond arm of the NAACP told CB17 it was investigating the incident.

Are ‘Married At First Sight’ Stars Kate and Luke Still Together or Divorced After Decision Day? Spoilers,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/married-first-sight-spoilers-kate-luke-2019-decision-divorce-1384090,"It’s arguably the moment Married at First Sight fans Kate Sisk and Luke Cuccurullo have been waiting for all season. The couple will decide if they stay together or divorced following the experiment. Kate and Luke have famously had a tumultuous relationship on the show, with Luke saying he’s not attracted to Kate and was “repulsed” by kissing her. Married at First Sight didn’t leak if Kate and Luke decided to stay together, though she did post mini-spoilers on their Instagram account before the show aired.
“I don’t ever want to be married twice,” Luke says in the preview. Kate looks like she might be pulling off her wedding ring, although she could just be twirling it. When they’re briefly shown sitting next to each other, Kate is frowning in the clip.
It would probably be safe to say that at least one couple decides not to stay together. Pastor Cal says while shaking his head, “I fight for marriages but not this time.” Most fans have assumed that it was Kate and Luke who he was talking about, but other couples—like Will Guess and Jasmine McGriff—have also struggled this season. Jasmine was shown crying in one of the preview clips. Kristine Killingsworth also expressed uncertainty about marrying Keith Dewar. Arguably the only couple who might definitely stay married is AJ Vollmoeller and Stephanie Sersen, but she too expressed doubt.
It’s arguably the moment ""Married at First Sight"" fans Kate Sisk and Luke Cuccurullo have been waiting for all season. The couple will decide if they stay together or divorced following the experiment. Kate and Luke have famously had a tumultuous relationship on the show, with Luke saying he’s not attracted to Kate and was “repulsed” by kissing her. Lifetime Some assumed relationship expert Jessica Griffin was accusing Luke of gaslighting Kate after she posted an Instagram message about the term. “Gaslighting: When your partner tells you something is X when you know it is Y,” she wrote March 7. “When someone attempts to gain power by psychologically manipulating you into questioning your own sanity. What do we do with gas lighters in a relationship? We break up with them.”
She added: “Gaslighting is one tactic that may be present in toxic or unhealthy relationships. Emotionally abusive relationships often include some form of gaslighting.”
Despite it looking to some like Luke and Kate have a toxic marriage, the expert explained she would never advocate for two people to stay in an unhealthy marriage—with or without cameras being around.
“People matter to me, more than anything else. Under no circumstances would I (or my dear colleagues for that matter) advocate for someone to stay in an unhealthy marriage, even for a TV show, and there have been a number of times in which my heart has broken for them,” she said. “These are real marriages and even if we express our opinion that it’s unhealthy, none of us can force a couple to separate, as frustrating as it is. Just like those who watch their friends go thru hard times in the real world, it’s hard to watch people hurting. For those reaching out regarding trauma or abusive relationships, please know there is help. There is hope.”
To find out if Kate and Luke are still together, don’t miss Married at First Sight Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on Lifetime.

Video: Stephen Colbert Mocks Donald Trump for His 'Oranges' of Mueller Investigation Gaffe: 'High Clementine We Do So',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/video-stephen-colbert-mocks-donald-trump-oranges-mueller-investigation-gaffe-1384321,"The host of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert poked fun at Donald Trump’s relationship with the English language, after the president struggled to pronounce the word ""origin.""
In his Tuesday monologue for the CBS show, Colbert talked about how Trump was asked by journalists whether the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller would be made public.
Trump said he would fight its release and that it was time to investigate the investigators of the two-year probe, which found no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.
President Donald Trump at the National Republican Congressional Committee Annual Spring Dinner on April 2, 2019, in Washington, DC. His mispronunciation of the word “origin” was the target of late night TV hosts. JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images Colbert introduced the clip of Trump’s questioning at the White House by saying, ""See if you can notice his small slip of the brain.""
The clip then showed the president saying, “I hope they now go and take a look at the oranges of the investigation.” Trump said “oranges” instead of “origins” another two times.
On cue, Colbert went into full pun mode, saying “Yes! Yes, sir! We must take a look at the 'Oranges of the investigation!' I say it is 'high clemen-time' we do so! The American people will not 'stand-gerine' for it any longer! We can vitamin C right through the lies! We tropi-can handle the juice!""
By now on a citrus-themed roll, he told a “knock, knock” joke in which the punchline was “orange you ashamed we have a president who can’t pronounce origins?”
The gaffe also provided rich pickings for Jimmy Kimmel Live , with the host joking that, “What happens is, he wakes up every morning, sees the color of his face and the rest of the day he has that word stuck in his head,” Mediaite reported.
The White House transcript later recognized Trump’s mispronunciation but spelt “oranges” in a different way, noting it as ""oringes.""
For the man who once said he had the "" best words "" it is the latest public mispronunciation by the president. Last month, he called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, “ Tim Apple .”
Trump later tweeted he used the moniker to “save time and words,” and said it was an example of how the “Fake News was disparagingly all over this, & it became yet another bad Trump story!”
But the president is more frequently mocked for spelling mistakes on Twitter, with possibly his most infamous example being “ constant negative press covfefe. ""

"Who Is Lori Lightfoot? Newly Elected Chicago Mayor Is First Black, Openly Gay Woman to Hold Office",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/lori-lightfoot-next-chicago-mayor-black-gay-woman-1384278,"The next mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, made Windy City history as the city's first black, female and openly gay mayor.
Outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel did not seek re-election, which left 14 candidates vying for the position. Among the candidates was William ""Bill"" Daley, whose brother and father had ruled Chicago for a combined 40 years.
Lightfoot, 56, a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, won more than 70 percent of the vote Tuesday night to claim victory over fellow Democrat Toni Preckwinkle in a runoff, according to NBC News. Lightfoot had not held public office before.
At her victory party on Tuesday night, just a moment before she delivered her speech to the crowd, Lightfoot exhaled and said, “Thank you, Chicago.”
“In this election, Toni and I were competitors, but our differences are nothing compared to what we can achieve together. Now that it’s over, I know we will work together for the city that we both love. Today, you did more than make history. You created a movement for change,"" Lightfoot said.
Preckwinkle, 72, was a former schoolteacher who had served on Chicago’s city council for nearly 20 years before becoming Cook County Board President in 2011.
Preckwinkle acknowledged that two black women vying for the top spot in Chicago was historic. ""This may not be the outcome we wanted, but while I may be disappointed, I'm not disheartened,"" said Preckwinkle, who called Lightfoot to congratulate her on the victory. ""For one thing, this is clearly a historic night. Not long ago, two African American women vying for this position would have been unthinkable.""
Both women have supported casino activity in downtown Chicago and both support changing to a graduated income tax that would draw more from wealthier citizens. Lightfoot promised to bring more transparency to City Hall, and bring investment to the city’s South and West sides.
NBC Chicago reported that Lightfoot had been endorsed by the Chicago Sun-Times, and the Chicago Tribune, as well as U.S. Representatives Jesus “Chuy” Garcia and Robin Kelly.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Praises Fellow Legislator Pramila Jayapal's Emotional Equality Act Speech: There's 'Power in Your Tears',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/ocasio-cortez-pramila-jayapal-twitter-video-equality-act-1384330,"On 4/3/19 at 3:04 AM EDT Share U.S. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lauded her colleague Representative Pramila Jayapal for showing emotion while sharing a personal story during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Equality Act.
Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, was moved to tears as she spoke about her gender nonconforming child during the hearing. The Equality Act would extend civil rights to all LGBT people in America and combat discriminaton against them.
“People often think strength is holding back tears, or that bravery is checking your life at the door for another day,” Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat , wrote on Twitter, sharing Jayapal’s tweet of a video showing her emotional speech.
“To me, bravery is the courage to be vulnerable in front of the world. &Strength can be finding the power in your tears. @RepJayapal, you were all power today.”
During the hearing, Jayapal said it occurred to her that what they were talking about is fear versus love and freedom.
“And I didn't intend to say this today, but—excuse me,” Jayapal said, fighting back tears during the committee hearing.
“My beautiful now 22-year-old child told me last year that they are gender non-conforming. And over the last year I have come to understand from a deeply personal mother's perspective—I've always been a civil rights activist. I've always fought for my constituents and communities to have equal rights.
“But from a mother's perspective I came to understand what their newfound freedom—it is the only way I can describe what happened to my beautiful child—what their newfound freedom to wear a dress, to rid themselves of some conformist stereotype of who they are, to be able to express who they are at their real core.
“And since this deeply impactful moment last year, my child, who has always done well in school, but has carried what a mother can only describe as a heavy burden of conflict in their own being, that I could not fully identify or help to express.
“Since this deeply impactful moment last year, my child's embracing of their non-conforming gender identity and all that it has allowed, all that it allows in terms of their creativity, their brilliance, their self-expression.
“The only thought I wake up with every day is, 'My child is free. My child is free to be who they are.' And in that freedom comes a responsibility for us as legislators to protect that freedom to be who they are and to legislate...our behavior towards all people in our society.” People often think strength is holding back tears, or that bravery is checking your life at the door for another day.To me, bravery is the courage to be vulnerable in front of the world. &Strength can be finding the power in your tears. @RepJayapal , you were all power today._ https://t.co/WiZ0FBPCWF — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 3, 2019 During @HouseJudiciary today, I shared why the #EqualityAct is so personal to me and my family.

"Cruise Ship Passenger, 71, Left in 'Absolute Agony' After Attack in Cafe",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/cruise-ship-new-zealand-attack-california-passenger-1384367,"On 4/3/19 at 4:16 AM EDT Share World crime
A 71-year-old American tourist on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship in New Zealand was hospitalized after someone assaulted him at a cafe during his vacation.
The unnamed California man was allegedly shoved to the ground at the Cockles Kitchen and Bar in Picton on Tuesday and left in ""absolute agony,"" a woman traveling with him told The Marlborough Express . He is suspected to have suffered a broken hip
""This is their first visit to the country, what a shameful welcome to New Zealand,"" the unnamed woman told the Express , adding that the group of eight companions have had to leave him behind at Wairau Hospital in Blenheim where he will have surgery.
""I don't know how he is going to get back to the ship,"" the woman said. ""The whole thing is just a mess…it's completely ruined the holiday.""
A spokeswoman for New Zealand police told Newsweek officers were called to the address on Auckland street at about 11.20 a.m. after a report of an assault.
""It appears one person was treated by ambulance, however the nature of injuries are not clear on our end. Police are making enquiries into the circumstances of the incident,"" she said, adding that police do not release the names of living victims.
Royal Caribbean did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Earlier in March, two women selling racist souvenirs in Picton were ordered to stop after offending tourists from cruise ships coming into the area.
Cathy Dalzell and Rata Steele were selling “golliwog” dolls , which are seen as caricatures of black people based on racist stereotypes, at a local market popular with tourists, New Zealand’s Stuff reported.
The Marlborough District Council asked the group running the market to stop the sale of the dolls to avoid further offense.
The women defended the offending dolls in a Facebook post. “We have been told that we can make white dolls but not gollys,” the women wrote on their ""Gorgeous Gollys"" Facebook page.
They said they had been selling the dolls for five years: “This is very sad as we are not selling them to upset people but more of a memory of innocent times when a carefully crafted colourful black faced doll was part of a fun, happy and healthy childhood.”
In February, two French cruise ship passengers were attacked in a violent robbery while sightseeing in Antigua. One of the passengers was stabbed.
According to the Antigua Observer , two young men were charged with aggravated robbery after allegedly targeting the two tourists from an MSC cruise ship.
Jacques Colbert, 72, and Christiane Marcelle Drouth, 62, were attacked at around 11 a.m. on February 1 as they explored the sites in Hatton.
Colbert was stabbed in the abdomen and the thieves made off with Drouth’s black leather handbag, the Observer reported.
The stabbing victim was taken to hospital but did not have life-threatening injuries and the bag was later recovered.

Scientists Strap Cameras to Sharks to Watch How They Hunt Their Prey,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/scientists-strap-cameras-sharks-watch-how-they-hunt-prey-1381668,"Footage shot from cameras attached to sharks has revealed how the animals charge through underwater forests to hunt for seals in areas previously thought to be inaccessible to the predators.
Compared to land animals, it's relatively difficult to study the behavior of underwater creatures in great detail. To gain a greater understanding of how great white sharks navigate kelp forests off the coast of South Africa as they track down Cape fur seals, scientists lured sharks to a research boat. They then strapped cameras with motion sensors to eight of the predators.
Past research shows sharks ambush seals at twilight as they travel from the land to sea. But scientists are interested in the seals and sharks who inhabit the waters of the Dyer Island Marine Reserve at the southern-most tip of Africa, because they act differently.
The seals have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. And Dyer Island is the only seal colony in South Africa where sharks appear in the daytime, said the authors of the new study published in the journal Biology Letters . It is believed this is because seals can hide from their attackers in the kelp.
The resulting 28 hours of footage showed how the huge animals, each measuring between 275 to 365 centimeters in length, moved through dense kelp forests to chase down their prey. The researchers noted down moments in the footage including when a seal could be seen, and when the sharks touched or moved between small gaps in the kelp. Of the total, seven sharks repeatedly moved in areas thick with kelp, and four touched kelp fronds or stipes.
Seals, meanwhile, reacted to the approaching sharks by trying to hide among the plants, blowing bubbles, or getting low down on the sea floor.
Oliver Jewell, a marine scientist and PhD candidate at Murdoch University, told Newsweek : “It was previously assumed that kelp was a barrier to white sharks, and it's only through these relatively newly developed tags that we were able to observe it is not. It's a great example of how technology is being used to change our perspectives on the behaviors of wildlife.""
Jewell, who has studied and tracked sharks previously, expected the animals to interact with the kelp to some extent but was surprised by how important the plant was to their hunting behaviors.
""[The video showed] all the sharks by the island went into it [the kelp] and then we got the interactions with the fur seals and the chase, which was amazing,"" said Jewell of the footage.
Collecting such footage is tough, admitted Jewell as he highlighted the limitations of the study.
“Even if you know where the sharks are, you need to get them close, you need to get these tags on safely, with a good POV angle, you need good visibility and then you need to get the tag back. And that's before you know if the shark is going to do anything interesting, most of the time they just swim.
“Our team have used these methods on white sharks at locations across the world but this remains some of the best footage we've ever captured.”
The team has used this technique on animals in a number of locations in California, as well as Cape Cod. Next, they'll harness the approach in Australia in an attempt to build a global catalog of foraging practices, said Jewell.
""This study is really the tip of the iceberg in terms of what more we can learn about these animals using this technology,"" he said.
Documenting how predators like sharks hunt their prey is vital if scientists are to gain a deeper understanding of how Earth's ecosystems work. Researchers in California, for instance, have studied why great white sharks gather in huge groups in a 160-mile section of the middle of the Pacific ocean between Baja California and Hawaii, in the spring and winter.
The area was thought to be void of prey, but scientists found a spot just above the darkness of the deep sea was populated by tiny creatures. These in turn attract animals which sharks prey on. Scientists have dubbed the spot the White Shark Cafe.

"Longest-Serving World Leaders: As Protests Hit Algeria and Sudan, Where Else Have Heads of State Stayed in Power?",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/longest-serving-leaders-algeria-sudan-1382591,"News that Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has agreed to end his two-decade reign amid weeks of protests came as his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-Bashir faced mass demonstrations against his own leadership of some 30 years. But that number is dwarfed by other heads of state around the world who have clung to power for generations.
Africa is no stranger to such lengthy terms of power. Nearly half of the top 15 longest-serving heads of state still in power hail from the continent. At the top of the list is Cameroonian President Paul Biya, who has served in this position or as prime minister since 1975 and Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who took power in a 1979 military coup.
That same year, Iran underwent its Islamic Revolution, bringing the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to the helm as supreme leader. After his death in 1989, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei—who was elected president eight years earlier in 1981—succeeded him and has remained in this highest-ranking position for 29 years, bringing his total time in power to 37 years.
Also in 1979, the Republic of the Congo's Denis Sassou Nguesso won the presidency and held on to it until being ousted in 1992. He retook power during a civil war five years later and has led the country ever since.

CANAL ALGERIE/AFP/Getty Images In Cambodia, Hun Sen has been prime minister since early 1985 and, about a year after him, Uganda President Yoweri Museveni first assumed his post. After Bashir and the outgoing Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev—who announced the end of his 29-year presidency last month, but will preside over his country's security council for the remainder of his life—was President Idriss Déby of Chad. The last two rulers in place for over a quarter of a century are Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, in power since 1992, and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, who became leader in 1993.
Europe has not been without its double-decade heads of state either, as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko won in 2015 his fifth term since 1994. He is followed by two-time Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who served from 1981 to 2003, and was elected again last year. He is the oldest of head of state at 93, a year older than the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II, who is the longest-serving head of state at an unparalleled 67 years, though her powers are largely ceremonial.
While former Cuban President Fidel Castro may still hold the title for longest-ever serving non-royal world leader of at least the past century with some 49 years under his belt, Latin America's current reigning heavyweight is fellow left-wing revolutionary Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. He was part of the ruling military junta that took over in 1979 and served first as president from 1984 to 1990, resisting a U.S.-backed insurgency, and then again since 2007.
Following him was another Cuban ally, Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea since 1998. Though not a member of the ruling Kim dynasty—now represented by supreme leader Kim Jong Un—the reclusive, nuclear-armed nation's nominal head of state is a member of an elite circle playing an influential role in both domestic and international politics.
Finally, Samoa's Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi has won five elections to keep his title as prime minister since 1998.

In a list largely dominated by men, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh emerged much later with a combined total of 15 years after serving from 1996 to 2001 and again since 2009. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has held her position since 2005, making her the longest-serving current head of an EU country.
The United States instituted a limit of two four-year terms to the presidency in 1951. The move was encoded in the 22nd ammendment, which was devised after former President Franklin D. Roosevelt won an unprecedented four elections, though he died shortly after assuming his fourth term in 1945. Born just one year later, President Donald Trump became the oldest individual to assume the U.S. presidency in 2016 at 70 and will fight for a second, final term next year.
Other leaders of major powers have more recently found ways to bypass restrictions on their rule. Vladimir Putin has led Russia as either president or prime minister in spite of his country's two-term limit by striking a role-switching agreement with Dmitry Medvedev, who currently serves in the latter position. In China, the ruling Chinese Communist Party voted last year to abolish presidential term limits in the country's constitution, paving the way for President Xi Jinping to lead indefinitely.

Donald Trump’s Reported Contender for Border Czar Wrote One of America’s Most ‘Mean-Spirited’ Anti-Immigration Laws,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-immigration-czar-kris-kobach-1383927,"President Donald Trump is reportedly considering adding a “border czar” to his administration, and the individual said to be at the top of the list of potential candidates is Kris Kobach—a Republican who helped author one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in recent history.
“In this administration, it does not surprise me at all. He exemplifies the view of this administration, which is contrary to American history because immigration is very much the story of success in this country,” Joyce White Vance, a former federal prosecutor, told Newsweek on Tuesday.
“Kobach is anti-immigration in the most mean-spirited way possible. And that’s clearly the policy that this administration has chosen to adopt towards immigrants,” Vance added.
According to an Associated Press report on April 1, the White House is looking for someone to spearhead the president’s immigration initiatives amid a surge in migrants crossing the southern border. On the shortlist of possible appointees is Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, and Ken Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia.
While both men are immigration hardliners, Kobach once lent a hand in the creation of Alabama HB 56. The 2011 law is seen as one of the strictest anti-immigration policies in the nation and was once heralded by state lawmakers as an initiative for people to “deport themselves.”
The law, officially titled the Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, was aimed at curbing illegal immigration. Its net effect was to make the state inhospitable to undocumented immigrants by essentially creating new immigration-related crimes.
Under HB 56, renting a house or giving a job to an “illegal” became a crime. It required state police officers to investigate or detain people based on a “suspicion” that they may be undocumented. Educators were also told to collect information regarding the immigration status of the students and their parents.
“That, of course, tamped down on school participation and school attendance,” Vance said. “If you’re a 7- or 8-year-old kid missing a year of school while that litigation went on, that’s a huge game-changer for the rest of your life. But that was what it was intended to do.”
Vance was serving as a U.S. attorney during HB 56’s passage and successfully challenged key provisions of the law in court in United States v. Alabama . The Obama administration essentially argued that the state could not create its own immigration law that is contrary to federal policy as it would be a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.
The law has continued to unravel as many of its most substantial provisions have been blocked in court.
Even Trump, whose administration’s “zero tolerance” practice resulted in hugely controversial family separations, couldn’t get on board with the idea of self-deportation for undocumented immigrants. After the 2012 election, he told reporters that the policy was “maniacal” and that it “sounded as bad as it was.”
The White House would not comment on whether Kobach is being considered for the immigration czar position or whether the administration supports this law.
But now, the president faces what his immigration agencies have deemed a “breaking point” at the U.S.-Mexico border. Last week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials reported that over 4,000 migrants were arriving per day. CBP chief Kevin McAleenan said it was just a “matter of time” before tragedy will strike at an immigration facility.
Kris Kobach, a Republican candidate for governor of Kansas, speaks at a rally with President Donald Trump at the Kansas Expocenter, in Topeka, on October 6, 2018. Kobach is reportedly on a shortlist to become the president’s “immigration czar.” Scott Olson/Getty Images Photographs also went viral showing hundreds of men, women and children trapped in parking lots at the border, prompting an immediate backlash by Democratic lawmakers.
“It's without a doubt a reflection of what white nationalism is doing to our country. As a country, we have to acknowledge that this is how people are being treated here and decide that we are better and we must do better,” Ilhan Omar, a freshman congresswoman, tweeted in response to the photographs. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared the sentiment and encouraged Americans to reflect ""on the course of action"" the country has chosen.
But Trump’s response was to threaten the closure of the southern border entirely. In a tweet last week, he said he was “not playing games” and that they would keep the border closed “for a long time.” The president also warned that he will cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Central American countries.
On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that he was ""ready to close"" the southern border ""if I have to close it."" The president also praised border patrol for their work but continued to call the country's immigration system ""maxed out.""
According to the Associated Press, a Department of Homeland Security official noted that “immigration czars” have been used in the past when there’s an “urgent need” for coordination among several federal agencies.
Kobach already has experience working in the Trump administration on the president’s election fraud commission, which was eventually disbanded. Recently, he has been working on the advisory board of WeBuildtheWall Inc., a nonprofit raising money to build the president’s long-promised border wall.
“Sometimes we need to all just need to take a step back and look at what’s really in the best interests of our citizens,” Vance said. “We obviously need comprehensive immigration reform in this country, but this sort of legislation is not the way to get there and Kobach’s policies are not what’s got the best interest of folks at heart.""

Evolution in Action: Lizard Gives Birth to Litter of Eggs and Live Young In First Recorded Case of its Kind,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/lizard-birth-eggs-live-offspring-evolution-1384384,"For most animals, reproduction is straightforward: Some species lay eggs, while others give birth to live babies.
But our recent research uncovered a fascinating mix between the two modes of reproduction. In an Australian skink, we observed the first example of both egg-laying and live-bearing within a single litter for any backboned animal. This suggests some lizards can “hedge their bets” reproductively, taking a punt on both eggs and live-born babies to improve overall survival chances for offspring.
Making reproductive leaps Most vertebrate species (animals with a backbone) fall neatly into one of two distinctly different reproductive categories.
Oviparous species are egg-layers. These eggs may undergo external fertilization—such as in spawning fish—or are fertilized and shelled internally, like those of reptiles and birds. Oviparous embryos rely on egg yolk as a source of nutrition to continue development until hatching.
In contrast, viviparous species are live bearers that carry their young to term. Some live-bearing species, including humans, support embryonic development internally via a placenta. Egg-laying is ancestral , meaning that modern live-bearers have descended from egg-laying ancestors.
Physiologically, the evolution of live birth from egg-laying is no mean feat. This transition requires a whole suite of changes , sometimes including the evolution of a placenta—an entirely new specialist organ—as well as loss of the hard outer eggshell, and keeping the embryo inside the body for a longer time.
Despite these complex steps, reptiles, particularly snakes and lizards, appear to be unusually predisposed to making the leap to live birth. This capacity has evolved in at least 115 groups of reptiles independently .
Having it both ways It’s easy to see why reptiles, as a group, are fascinating models for studying how live birth evolves from egg-laying.
Of particular interest are two Australian skinks that have both live-bearing and egg-laying individuals (known as being bimodally reproductive). These lizards are incredibly valuable to evolutionary biologists as they offer a snapshot into evolutionary processes in action.
The three-toed skink Saiphos equalis is one such species. Reproduction in S. equalis varies geographically : Populations around Sydney lay eggs, while those further north give birth to live young.
Whether individuals are live-bearing or egg-laying seems to be genetically determined: When researchers swap their environmental conditions (by moving them from one site to another), the females retain their original reproductive strategy .
Mothers know best Our latest research shows this lizard is intriguing in another completely unexpected way.
This is a three-toed skink hatching from an egg. Nadav Pezaro, Haifa University for the University of Sydney We observed a live-bearing female that laid three eggs, and then gave birth to a living baby from the same litter weeks later. We incubated two of the eggs, one of which hatched to produce a healthy baby.
This finding is remarkable for two reasons. First—as far as we are aware—this is the first example of both egg-laying and live birth within a single litter for any vertebrate.
A live-bearing female S. equalis in our laboratory colony laid three eggs, one of which hatched to produce a healthy baby. Camilla Whittington Second, in some cases, individuals may be capable of “switching” between reproductive modes. In other words, as laying eggs and giving birth each come with their own advantages and disadvantages, individuals may be able to “choose” which option best suits the current situation.
Closer look at eggshells To better understand this reproductive phenomenon, we investigated the structure of the egg coverings of these unusual embryos in minute detail (using an advanced technology called scanning electron microscopy.)
We found that in this litter, the egg-coverings were thinner than those of normal egg-laying skinks and had structural characteristics that overlapped with those of both egg-layers and live-bearers (which have thinner coverings that are greatly reduced).
How evolution works We still don’t know the trigger that caused this female to lay eggs and give birth to a live baby from the same pregnancy. However, our findings suggest that species “in transition” between egg-laying and live bearing may hedge their bets reproductively before a true transition to live birth evolves.
Being able to switch between reproductive modes may be advantageous, particularly in changing or uncertain environments. For example, extreme cold, drought or the presence of predators can be risky for vulnerable eggs exposed to the environment, meaning that mothers that can carry offspring to term may have the upper hand.
In contrast, lengthy pregnancies can be taxing on the mother, so depositing offspring earlier as an egg may be beneficial in some situations.
We suggest that other species in which live birth has evolved from egg-laying relatively recently may also use flexible reproductive tactics.
Further research into this small Australian lizard, which seems to occupy the grey area between live birth and egg-laying, will help us determine how and why species make major reproductive leaps.

"Root of US immigration problem is in Washington, says El Paso mayor",thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/436704-root-of-us-immigration-problem-is-in-washington-says-el-paso-mayor,"Email
El Paso, Texas, Mayor Dee Margo (R) said in an interview that aired Monday on ""Rising"" that the root of the immigration problem in the U.S. lies in the nation's capital.
""The symptom and the root cause is out of Washington D.C.,"" Margo told Hill.TV's Buck Sexton last week.
Margo pointed to legislation passed in 2008, which he said has made it easier for individuals to seek asylum at the southern border, which has put pressure on immigration authorities.
""There was a bill passed at the end of 2008 called the Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008, and it was designed when there were unaccompanied minors coming from Central America through Mexico to the United States,"" he continued.
""There was a fear on our part, it's very altruistic on our part in the United States which it should be, that they would be picked up by Mexican cartels, and used as drug mules or in human trafficking,"" he said. ""So we made it easier for those Central American nations to claim asylum, primarily for the children that were coming through, or the young people.""
""It was also I think amended in 2014, but that gives them basically unfettered ability to come into the United States, and claim asylum,"" he said. ""If you notice we're not having the problem with Mexico. There aren't Mexican immigrants coming north. It's only from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.""
Donald John Trump Colbert mocks Trump for 'oranges' gaffe Dem wins Trump district in swing-state Pennsylvania Trump says health care plan will be first vote after 2020 election MORE , who clashed with Margo over immigration earlier this year, pressed Democrats on Monday to work with Republicans to address U.S. asylum laws quickly.
The president sought to take action on immigration last week, threatening to shut down the U.S. border with Mexico, and directing the State Department to halt aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
Trump has long complained that the three Central American countries do not do enough to prevent migrants from coming to the U.S. in search of asylum. — Julia Manchester"
‘No Point in Pushing the Panic Button’: Mitch McConnell Says Health Care Plan is Off the Table Despite Obamacare Uncertainty,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/mitch-mcconnell-health-care-table-panic-button-1384099,"Despite the Trump administration saying the entirety of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, should be ruled unconstitutional, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that the GOP does not intend to create a comprehensive health care plan to replace the law, should it be struck down and render millions of Americans without insurance.
The president has claimed that Senate Republicans were devising a broad health care plan to replace the ACA following the Justice Department’s new stance advocating the entire law, not just portions, should be struck down. However, McConnell said that during a conversation with Trump on Monday, the senator “made it clear to him” that the Senate was “not going to be doing that.”
“We don’t have a misunderstanding about that. We will not be doing a comprehensive plan in the Senate,” McConnell told reporters.
He said Senate Republicans going forward will support efforts involving pre-existing conditions and lowering prescription drug prices. But a comprehensive plan was out of the question, McConnell added, because of previous failed attempts during the last Congress when the party controlled both chambers. McConnell noted health care was something the Republicans ""had the opportunity to address last Congress and were unable to do so.""
The president later “accepted that,” the Kentucky Republican continued, saying that he supported Trump’s intent to push a broader health care initiative after the 2020 elections.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks during a news conference following a weekly policy luncheon on April 2 in Washington, DC. Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images “The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words, it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House… The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare [sic].”
Due to a new Republican tax law in 2017, which eliminated the individual mandate penalty (a major pillar of the original health care law), a federal judge in Texas last year ruled the ACA in its entirety to be unconstitutional.
Previously, DOJ argued that only the requirements to cover patients with pre-existing conditions and to cover them at equal costs to healthier patients was unconstitutional. But in a new filing last week, the department went a step further, saying it supported the judge’s decision to rule the entire law unconstitutional and will not issue a challenge as it heads through the appeals process. The case will most likely make it to the Supreme Court.
Despite the wide-reaching implications that would result from the signature health care law being struck down by the Supreme Court, including knocking millions of people off their health insurance and no longer protecting people with pre-existing conditions, McConnell said Americans should not fear losing coverage in the immediate future. The majority leader said he believes the case will be tied up in the courts for the foreseeable future.
“There’s no point in pushing the panic button,” he said. “The court system takes a long time to resolve these issues.”
In addition to saying Republicans do not and will not have a plan to replace the ACA anytime soon, Democrats say they’re more than happy to campaign on the issue of health care heading into 2020. After all, they argue, it was a topic that aided in their takeover of the House in 2018.
“They do have a plan. Their plan is to repeal the ACA with no replacement,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut told reporters. “We will say those words every single day for the next year and a half.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said that by Trump and Senate Republicans saying they plan to hold out on addressing health care until 2021 amounts to the party having “no health care plan” and the “same-old song they’ve been singing—they’re for repeal but no replace.”

Joe Biden: Two More Women Come Forward With ‘Uncomfortable’ Touching Allegations: NYT,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-two-more-women-come-forward-with-uncomfortable-touching-allegations-nyt,"9 hours ago NYT: Two More Women Come Forward With ‘Uncomfortable’ Touching Allegations Against Joe Biden
Two more women have come forward with “uncomfortable” touching allegations against former vice president and potential 2020 contender Joe Biden, The New York Times reports. Caitlyn Caruso told the newspaper Biden put his hand on her thigh and hugged her for “a little bit too long” at a University of Nevada at Las Vegas campus event about sexual assault she attended when she was 19. Caruso, now 22, said she didn’t report the encounter but found it surprising that Biden—who took part in crafting the 1994 Violence Against Women Act—didn’t seem to understand physical boundaries. “It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” she told the Times . “These are supposed to be people you can trust.” D. J. Hill, a writer who met Biden at a 2012 fundraiser, said she and her husband were taking a picture with Biden when he started to move his hand from her shoulder to her back—making her “very uncomfortable,” the Times reports. Hill’s husband reportedly saw Biden’s arm and put a hand on Biden’s shoulder to interrupt the movement. At the time, Hill said she didn’t say anything about the incident. “Only he knows his intent,” she said. "

The Brexit Desperation Rises As The Betrayal Deepens,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-02/brexit-desperation-rises-betrayal-deepens,"Authored by Tom Luongo,
British parliament is now worse than a joke. And they have no one to blame but themselves.
As I watch the desperation of these people, obviously loyal to the European Union first and their constituents a distant fourth or fifth - after themselves, their party and any corporate lobbyists - it’s clear they don’t have any clue as to how to get out of the mess they’ve made for themselves.
Yesterday the British parliament again took over the business from the government and again was incapable of providing any direction to that government as to what kind or type of Brexit would be acceptable.
Mike Shedlock has a good run-down of the votes themselves if you are interested in what terminal virtue-signaling looks like. Mike thinks:
There will likely be one more round of “indicative votes” and also likely May’s Deal vs No Deal or the result of the indicative vote.
There are options left. Theresa May will try to steer this to the vote she wanted all along: My Deal or No Deal.
If she can achieve that, I suspect it will pass but it is by no means certain.
I agree with the first point but the real challenge is neither of the options he lays out, there’s a bigger problem as of today. It is the latest betrayal of Brexit by Oliver Letwin and Yvette Cooper who will try and ram through a long-extension bill on Wednesday to put off Brexit for an indefinite period of time.
It will be yet another amendment of the Article 50 law that is, for all intents and purposes, a travesty of British parliamentary history since these amendments to the law have not gone through the normal review process which could easily take more time than these traitors have to stop Brexit happening on April 12th.
They are searching for a way to find a solution that involves them winning voter support while betraying Brexit. Project Fear hasn’t worked and now we’re into Project Attrition.
The problem is there is no such solution.
And the reason for that is has nothing to do with a house divided, party politics or anything else.
It’s all about them.
Politicians are a feckless and cowardly lot. They exist only to get re-elected and retain the perks of the office.
This is especially true in Britain as so many of them are incapable of holding, in Nigel Farage’s words, “a proper job” where they provide something of value in exchange for their time.
They are only good at one thing: being members of parliament, conniving for their own advantage.
And this has disheartened many British people, who rightly see their MPs imposing their will over those who voted for them.
It reeks of arrogance and entitlement. But it also reeks of fear.
Watching this play out reminds me of something Lee Stranahan said to me in my talk with him last fall . He said people think politicians don’t care about what we think, but that that is not true.
Politicians care only about what we think. Their entire lives are spent checking the direction of the political winds to see what they can get away with.
And the reason Brexit is such a ‘cock-up’ is because MPs refuse to actually vote for what they want to do because they know what the backlash from voters will be.
Ignore the opinion polling, especially in Britain. As I’m fond of saying, “there are lies, damn lies, statistics and British polling.” If the MPs were so secure in their arguments that the “people didn’t know what they were voting for in 2016,” or “things change, let’s put this to another vote” they wouldn’t have voted down all forms of Brexit and all forms of Not-Brexit over the past three weeks.
They would have voted for something.
And that’s because the Remainer Tories are scared of losing their seats for betraying their mandate and so is most of Labour. The only ones who seem committed to their path are the Scottish Nationals, having put all of their eggs into the ‘IndyRef 2’ basket, hoping a 2nd referendum on Brexit will pave the way for a second one on Scottish independence.
That’s why the desperation is so thick right now. Letwin is a dyed-in-the-wook europhile, who has a history of stabbing Prime Ministers in the back (Poll Tax) for political gain and Cooper is simply angling for Jeremy Corbyn’s spot as leader of Labour.
Both are calculating that they can stop Brexit and win politically as the heroes who saved the country from a “No-Deal” Brexit. I’m sure they know just how much the U.K. would be punished in the short term by the financial markets, currency speculators, banksters and corporate raiders, standing behind them and their counterparts in Brussels.
The Davos Crowd in other words.
Remember, the mood at Davos this year was like a morgue. The oligarchs know they are fighting a defensive war now.
That is the plan at this point. To wear down opposition to their plans and blackmail the people into submission lest they lose trillions.
Don’t let the EU’s strong facade fool you. These people do not want a ‘no-deal’ Brexit anymore than my goats want steak for dinner. We already know this because we are into stoppage time on Brexit, handed out precisely because Theresa May went to them at the end of March with “No-Deal” in her back pocket.
But they have no other plan now . It’s more arm-twisting, desperation and hysteria. For now, it’s about the Letwin-Cooper amendment creating the illusion of cross-party support.
While Theresa May meets with Jeremy Corbyn to hash out what they can bring to the EU next week.
The EU wants the deal they dictated to Theresa May. She can’t deliver that. Now both will conspire to destroy both parties and betray Brexit.
In America, bipartisanship is just a euphemism for the two parties coming together to screw the people. That’s how we get everything bad in the U.S.
The same thing will happen here over Brexit.
Corbyn and May will lock horns and we’ll find out who is made of what. You know I think Theresa May is made of Gypsum, so all Corbyn has to do is access what’s left of his testosterone after a lifetime of selling it out to Marxism and Brexit will be over.
The likelihood now is that they will craft the worst possible compromise and try and sell that to both of their backbenchers.
Letwin and Cooper have set the stage with the legislation.
Now it’s up to Corbyn and May to bring it on home.
And in no case does “England Prevail.”

UK Condemns Trump's Recognition Of Golan Heights As Israeli Territory,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-02/uk-condemns-trumps-recognition-golan-heights-israeli-territory,"Speaking Tuesday in the House of Commons, Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a critique of US policy and stern rebuke to President Trump's recent controversial move to bestow formal US recognition on the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory.
Hunt's words, which he said represents long-standing UK policy, came during a question and answer session in reaction to a fellow Conservative MP member, who raised the “matter of the greatest regret that our allies, the United States, are in clear contravention of UN Resolution 497.”
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, file photo.
Hunt condemned Trump’s actions “with a heavy heart” because Israel was also “an ally and a shining example of democracy in a part of the world where that is not common… We want Israel is to a success and we consider them to be a great friend but on this we do not agree,” according to The Times of Israel .
Hunt agreed with Tory Grandee Nicholas Soames' perspective that the White House's signing into US law formal recognition of the disputed region previously wrested from Syria was ""illegal"" .
Soames said that “annexation of territory is prohibited under international law” and asked Hunt to “condemn unreservedly this breach of the rules-based order” .
Without hesitation Hunt declared he was “absolutely happy to do that,” and added :
“We should never recognize the annexation of territory by force… that has been one of the great achievements since the founding of the United Nations.”
Israel fully annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 after capturing it from Syria during the Six-Day War of 1967. The United Nations has never recognized Israeli annexation and settlement there, but has repeatedly condemned it.
President Trump’s reversal of half-century-old US policy was signed into effect on March 25 during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House, and cited Israeli security concerns as of paramount importance.
Trump had tweeted days prior that ""it is time"" for the US to ""fully recognize Israel's sovereignty"" over the Golan Heights .
""After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel's Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability,"" Trump stated, first marking the dramatic reversal of US policy which had historically alongside global international allies seen the Golan as occupied territory.
Netanyahu, for his part, welcomed the move as he has for years declared Israel would ""never give it up"".
After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2019 But as Tuesday's words from the UK foreign minister confirm, in practice Trump's act of recognition will change little internationally as well as in terms of the on the ground strategic reality.
However, it could have far-reaching diplomatic reverberations, putting further distance between Washington and European capitals amid the ongoing standoff over Europe's intent to skirt renewed US sanctions on Iran after Trump's dumping the 2015 Obama-brokered nuclear deal, or JCPOA.

Soccer Star Moise Kean Blamed by Teammate After Suffering Racial Abuse,www.newsweek.com,Dan Cancian,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/moise-kean-racist-chants-juventus-serie-cagliari-1384377,"A soccer player who suffered 90 minutes of racist abuse has been blamed by a teammate for his role in the incident.
Juventus forward Moise Kean was targeted throughout the game by Cagliari fans on Tuesday night. He had the last laugh, however, as he put the Italian champions 2-0 up just five minutes from time to seal a win away from home.
The 19-year-old celebrated by standing in front of the Cagliari supporters with his arm outstretched, prompting a vitriolic response from the home fans and more abuse.
Cagliari captain Luca Ceppittelli was among the players who rushed Kean away to safety and pleaded with the home fans to stop the racist chanting, but he appeared to be hit by a missile thrown from the crowd.
An announcement over the stadium speaker warned fans that the game could be suspended if the chanting persisted.
However, Kean’s teammate and captain Leonardo Bonucci suggested the 19-year-old had himself to blame for the reaction of the supporters.
“Kean knows himself too that he could have done something else,” Bonucci, who scored Juventus’ first goal, told Sky Sport Italia.
“There were racist boos after Kean’s celebration and [Blaise] Matuidi got angry but I think the blame is 50 and 50. Kean made a mistake and the fans made a mistake.
“Saying that, we know that we have to be an example and we’ll look forwards, because we all have to grow, us players too, also in these things.”
Matuidi was also subject to abuse and shortly after Kean's goal he appeared to threaten to walk off the field. The Frenchman, who last season claimed he was victim of racial abuse at the same stadium, then took to Facebook to express his contempt for the fans who targeted him and Kean because of their skin color.
“Today I experienced racism during the match,” he wrote.
“Weak people try to intimidate with hate. I am not a hater and can only be sorry for those who set bad examples. Football is a way to spread equality, passion and inspiration and this is what I am here for. Peace.”
Italian soccer has long had problems with racism. While the number of incidents has declined in recent years, the issue has not been eradicated yet.
Teams whose fans have been found guilty of racist chanting can be fined, forced to close sections of their stadium and even have to play games behind closed doors, depending on the gravity of the incident.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri suggested it was time for the authorities to clamp down harder on the perpetrators.
“I won’t justify what happened, as usual there were idiots and there were normal people,” he told The Associated Press. “We need to find them and kick them out of the stadium [...] there are ways to do that, if they want to they can do it.”

First pop-up library service for CBD in Manners St - Scoop News,www.scoop.co.nz,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1904/S00099/first-pop-up-library-service-for-cbd-in-manners-st.htm,"First pop-up library service for CBD in Manners St Wednesday, 3 April 2019, 3:22 pm Press Release: Wellington City Council
Wednesday 3 April
Wellington Mayor, Justin Lester, today announced the return of library services to the CBD with a new pop-up space set to open in Manners Street.
“Manners Street is an ideal location to provide convenient services right in the heart of our city. I am thrilled we have been able to quickly secure this site for the first in what will be a network of library services across the CBD.
“The new library services pop-up will share 12 Manners Street with the Council service centre, that was already planned for the site. It will be great for people to have access to a range of services under the one roof. Both services will open in late May,” says the Mayor.
At the pop-up, customers will be able to browse and borrow a range of popular and new items, pick up reserves, and return books and other library resources. Self-service options will be available and Library staff will be on hand to answer questions, process payments, register new customers, and provide support and advice on the wide range of online content available through our eLibrary.
It is anticipated the pop-up service hours will include late nights and weekends.
A small range of seats for reading, study and work, along with free WiFi and some printing, photocopying and internet access facilities will also be available.
“Work to set up the pop-up service is already underway. There are lots of moving parts to manage – first we need to complete a fit-out, set up our IT infrastructure, select which parts of our collection will be available, and work with our staff.
“We know Wellingtonians want more access to library services in the CBD and this will take some time. Since the closure of the Central Library, in addition to locating suitable pop up spaces, we’re also working to find innovative ways we can partner with other providers to quickly offer other services like internet access, printing, WiFi, and research services at CBD locations,” says the Mayor.
Councillor Fleur Fitzsimons, who holds the Community Facilities portfolio, says Council has also increased capacity in our branch network of 11 community libraries.
“Central Library staff are being relocated throughout our branches, to provide additional hands on deck as well as increased opening hours at some libraries,” she says.
The Manners Street pop-up is just the first in what will be a network of library services residents can access across a range of CBD locations. Details of other pop-up locations and services will be announced in the coming weeks.

(Reuters picture) KOBE: Lionel Messi is the best player ever and Barcelona owe their success to their evolution to a more direct style from a possession-based passing game, the club’s former player David Villa has said.
Barcelona currently have an eight-point lead in La Liga over Atletico Madrid ahead of Saturday’s showdown between the sides and also face Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-final this month.
Messi has been central to Barcelona’s success, scoring 42 goals across all competitions and proving the side’s talisman time and again.
He will turn 32 in June but Villa, who played alongside the Argentine forward at Barcelona for three years, does not see him slowing down.
“It is difficult to be surprised with Leo,” Villa, who now plays for Vissel Kobe in Japan, told Reuters in an interview.
“He is the best. He has always shown everybody in the world that he is the best… Every game that you can watch him is a pleasure.”
For those who have seen Messi during his 15-year career at Barcelona, there was no doubting his place in the pantheon of footballing greats, Villa said.
“Obviously (there were) Pele, Maradona, players like (Johan) Cruyff. I didn’t have the opportunity to watch them like I watched Messi every day, every game… But, for me, Messi is the best,” said Villa.
“He is good in everything that he does.”
Barcelona have adapted their style of play since the ‘tiki-taka’ days under Pep Guardiola, playing in a faster, more-direct fashion currently.
Villa, who won the Champions League with Barca in 2011, lauded the changes made in the pursuit of success.
“I am very happy with the things that we did when we played in Barcelona, with the style that we had, the trophies that we took,” said Villa, who left Barcelona for Atletico in 2013.
“Soccer is changing every day and you need to accommodate yourself and your team to the things that happen in the moment. I think that it is a different Barcelona but at the same time a great team as well.”
Despite the time difference, Villa said he will be keenly following Saturday’s contest between two of his former sides at the Nou Camp. TAGS"
"IGP must answer Suhakam’s allegations, say families",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Ainaa Aiman,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/03/igp-must-answer-suhakams-allegations-say-families/,"IGP must answer Suhakam’s allegations, say families By - April 3, 2019 4:45 PM Lawyer Gurdial Singh Nijar (right), representing the family of Pastor Raymond Koh, says IGP is ‘almost directly implicated’ by Suhakam’s findings.
KUALA LUMPUR: The lawyer representing the family of Pastor Raymond Koh has urged Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun to answer allegations that the Special Branch, which he headed then, had been involved in the abduction of Koh and Amri Che Mat.
The Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) had earlier today held the Special Branch responsible for the disappearance of Koh in February 2017 and Perlis-based activist Amri in late 2016.
Saying that Fuzi was “almost directly implicated” by Suhakam’s findings, Gurdial Singh Nijar urged him to come clean regarding the involvement of the police in their disappearances.
“He appears, in my respectful view, directly involved, not in the abduction but as head of the Special Branch, which has been named as having abducted or responsible for the abduction of both Pastor Koh and Amri,” Gurdial told reporters.
The Sukaham inquiry, chaired by commissioner Mah Weng Kai, had concluded that both Koh and Amri had been victims of “enforced disappearances by agents of the state, namely the Bukit Aman Special Branch”.
The inquiry, which ran for more than one year, had called nearly 60 witnesses to testify.
Gurdial, who said he was also speaking on behalf of Amri’s family, added that there was no basis to impugn the decision as the evidence to support it was “overwhelming”.
“Now, it is left to the home ministry to implement the recommendations,” he said.
Among the recommendations by Suhakam is the setting up of an independent task force, with members appointed by the attorney-general, to reinvestigate both cases.
The commission said members of the task force should also have no current or prior involvement with criminal investigations into both cases, or any connection with the E2 Division of the Special Branch in Kangar, Perlis or Bukit Aman.
They should also be free of any links to the Perlis religious authorities, Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (Jakim) or Selangor Islamic Religious Department (JAIS).
Gurdwar said abductions of such nature should not occur in a civilised society.
“There must be repercussions. The authorities must take immediate action and identify the officers involved,” he said.
He said the whole inquiry would be left “hanging” if Suhakam’s allegations were not answered.
“There have been inquiries before where there was no follow-up action, but this is too serious a case not to do anything about it.
“Investigations must not only be seen to be done but actually carried out,” he said. TAGS"

ABU DHABI: The United Arab Emirates will make its own checks on any fixes for the Boeing 737 MAX before permitting the grounded jet to resume flying in its airspace, a senior aviation regulatory official said on Wednesday.
The MAX has been grounded globally since last month following two fatal crashes in five months involving the same aircraft type, killing 346 people.
Boeing has said a software update to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system, which is under scrutiny after the deadly nose-down crashes, would be submitted in the coming weeks.
“Based on their corrective action plan we will validate that plan independently and maybe cooperate with other entities in Europe and based on that if we feel comfortable we will decide [if we lift the grounding],” General Civil Aviation Authority Director-General Saif Mohammed al-Suwaidi told Reuters at an industry conference in Abu Dhabi.

KUALA LUMPUR: Suaram adviser Kua Kia Soong has called on the prime minister and the attorney-general to ensure the release of Amri Che Mat and Pastor Raymond Koh who, a Suhakam inquiry found, were abducted by the Special Branch.
He also echoed the call for action against those responsible for the duo’s enforced disappearance.
The New Malaysia, he said, must never tolerate enforced disappearances, largely used by military dictatorships and banana republics.
Kua said the finding of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, better known as Suhakam, that Amri and Koh, who vanished in 2016 and 2017 respectively, were victims of enforced disappearance “is the most serious indictment against the Malaysian police to date”
The human rights activist noted in a statement that Suhakam had also concluded that the perpetrators were members of the Special Branch.
“Throughout the years since the enforced disappearance of these men, the police and the home ministry have maintained an unacceptable nonchalance. They have consistently refused to acknowledge that they played any role in the abduction and/ or whereabouts of the disappeared persons. Now they have been fingered as the abductors of these two hapless men.
“Those in the Special Branch, the IGP (inspector-general of police) as well as the home ministry who ordered the abductions must be brought to book.”
Enforced disappearance refers to the arrest, detention or abduction of a person, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the fate of that person. In this case, Suhakam has concluded that the Special Branch perpetrated the crime.
“Enforced disappearance is frequently used as a strategy to spread terror within society. The feeling of insecurity and fear it generates is enormous for the close relatives of the disappeared, and also affects communities and society as a whole. Those most at risk include human rights defenders, relatives of those already disappeared, key witnesses and lawyers,” Kua said. TAGS"

(Reuters pic)
MANILA: Growth in developing Asia could slow for a second straight year in 2019 and lose further momentum in 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Wednesday, warning of rising economic risks from a bitter Sino-US trade war and a potentially disorderly Brexit.
Developing Asia, which groups 45 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is expected to grow 5.7% this year, the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook report, slowing from a projected 5.9% expansion in 2018 and 6.2% growth in 2017.
The 2019 forecast represents a slight downgrade from its December forecast of 5.8%. For 2020, the region is forecast to grow 5.6%, which would be the slowest since 2001.
“A drawn out or deteriorating trade conflict between the People’s Republic of China and the United States could undermine investment and growth in developing Asia”, Yasuyuki Sawada, ADB’s chief economist, said in a statement.
The lender also cited uncertainties stemming from US fiscal policy and a possible disorderly Brexit as risks to its outlook because they could slow growth in advanced economies and cloud the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy.
“Though abrupt increases in US interest rates appear to have ceased, for the time being, policymakers must remain vigilant in these uncertain times,” Sawada said.
China’s economy will probably grow 6.3% this year, the ADB said, unchanged from its December projection, but slower than the country’s 6.6% expansion in 2018 despite recent government stimulus measures including more tax cuts and increased state spending on infrastructure.
Growth in the Chinese mainland is projected to cool further to 6.1% in 2020. Beyond trade risks, the ADB said China’s growth will also be retrained by restrictions on shadow banking, which is expected to limit credit expansion even as fiscal stimulus provides some offset.
“I should emphasise although the government would like to stabilise growth, it wouldn’t want to push up the growth rate as in previous years when you saw a big stimulus package, like in the period of 2008-2009,” said Jian Zhuang, senior economist at ADB in Beijing.
Chinese banks may still remain reluctant to lower lending costs for companies partly on worries of rising risks of corporate defaults in a slowing economy.
The central bank could take further actions, such as cutting the benchmark 1-year lending and deposit rates, the ADB said.
China has set its 2019 economic growth target at 6 to 6.5%.
By region, South Asia will remain the fastest growing in Asia Pacific, with the ADB predicting an expansion of 6.8% this year – lower than its previous forecast of 7.1% – and 6.9% next year.
From an estimated 7% growth in 2018, India’s economy is projected to expand at a faster pace of 7.2% in 2019 and 7.3% in 2020, the ADB said, as lower policy rates and income support to farmers boost domestic demand.
This year’s growth forecast for Southeast Asia was trimmed to 4.9% from an earlier estimate of 5.1%, as the Manila-based lender expect Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Thailand to grow slower than previously thought.
Next year, Southeast Asia is predicted to grow 5%.
Citing stable commodity prices, the ADB lowered its average inflation forecast for developing Asia to 2.5% this year from 2.7% previously, and it is expected to remain subdued at 2.5% in 2020. TAGS"

BANGALORE: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will work more closely with Interpol as part of ongoing efforts to combat corruption in the sport, the governing body said on Wednesday.
Alex Marshall, ICC’s general manager of its anti-corruption unit, met Interpol officials in Lyon last week to seek closer working relations, it added.
“The ICC has an excellent relationship with law enforcement agencies in a number of countries but working with Interpol means we are connecting with their 194 members,” Marshall said in a statement.
“Our focus is on education of players and prevention and disruption of corruptors. Where our enquiries reveal criminal offences have been committed, we will refer this to the relevant law enforcement organisations and this makes Interpol an important partner for us.”
Cricket has suffered a series of corruption cases in recent years.
In 2011, Pakistan’s Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found guilty of taking bribes to fix part of a test match against England in a case that prosecutors said revealed rampant corruption at the heart of international cricket.
Earlier this year, the ICC had granted Sri Lankan cricketers a 15-day amnesty to report previously undisclosed information relating to corruption in the sport.
It was followed by former captain and chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya being handed a two-year ban for refusing to cooperate with any investigation conducted by its anti-corruption unit. TAGS"

(AFP pic)
MANILA: Philippine journalist Maria Ressa, whose news website is critical of President Rodrigo Duterte, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the first of a series of criminal charges she says are government attacks.
Ressa has been arrested twice in six weeks by Philippine authorities, prompting international criticism and allegations she is being targeted for her work.
She entered her plea in a Manila court to four tax evasion charges stemming from a 2015 bond sale that raised money from a US-based investor for the news site she co-founded, Rappler.
If found guilty she could face up to 10 years behind bars on each charge.
The site has taken a tough stance on Duterte’s signature narcotics crackdown that has killed thousands of alleged drug dealers and users, but also cast a critical eye on his leadership and controversial public statements.
“I’m hoping for justice,” Ressa told reporters after the court hearing. “I still say all of these cases are politically motivated.”
Ressa was arrested in her Manila office in mid-February on an online libel charge and was released on bail the next day.
She was again taken into custody on Friday, this time for allegedly violating the Philippines’ strict rules prohibiting foreign ownership of media with a 2015 investment from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar’s Omidyar Network.
The Philippines’ corporate regulator revoked Rappler’s business licence last year over the investment, but the site continued operating as it appealed the case in the courts.
After her second arrest, the United States urged the Philippines to quickly resolve the case against Ressa, who holds Filipino and US passports, and allow her and Rappler to “operate freely”.
“The freedom of expression is a cornerstone of any truly democratic society and a fundamental freedom recognised by both the United States and the Philippines,” a State Department spokesperson said.
Duterte has in speeches lashed out at Rappler and other critical media outfits, including the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper and broadcaster ABS-CBN.
He threatened to go after their owners over alleged unpaid taxes or block the network’s franchise renewal application. TAGS"

(AFP pic)
The world’s southernmost coral reef has been hit by bleaching this summer, Australian scientists said Wednesday, as they warned rising sea temperatures from climate change were affecting even the most isolated ecosystems.
The corals off Lord Howe Island – some 600km offshore from Sydney – were affected by elevated temperatures this summer, despite escaping severe bleaching that damaged the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 and 2017.
“It’s a canary in the coal mine we are seeing bleaching at this very isolated southernmost reef, which is worrying,” Associate Professor Bill Leggat of the University of Newcastle told AFP.
“It’s just another indicator that climate change is affecting everywhere around the world. Here is a reef that is 600km from the mainland and we are seeing bleaching there in a lovely, beautiful ecosystem.”
Leggat and other scientists from several Australian universities and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found severe bleaching of up to 90 percent at Lord Howe’s inshore, shallow lagoon reefs.
Deeper-water corals in the marine park, which contains species not found anywhere else and like the Barrier Reef is a World Heritage site, were still “looking quite healthy” having mostly escaped the bleaching, Leggat said.
Leggat said increasing baseline temperatures caused by climate change, and local factors such as elevated temperatures in the area this summer, caused the bleaching to occur.
The scientists are set to return to Lord Howe in the next few months to find out if some corals have been so severely bleached they can’t recover.
Bleaching occurs when abnormal environmental conditions, such as warmer sea temperatures, cause corals to expel tiny photosynthetic algae, draining them of their colour.
Corals can recover if the water temperature drops and the algae are able to recolonise them.
However, swathes of coral at the Barrier Reef – the world’s largest living structure – died or were damaged in the unprecedented successive events in 2016 and 2017.
Coral reefs make up less than 1% of Earth’s marine environment, but are home to an estimated 25% of ocean life, acting as nurseries for many species of fish. TAGS"

(Reuters pic)
BANGKOK: Thai police summoned a prominent anti-junta politician on Wednesday to answer a sedition complaint, a police document showed, a charge rising star Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit called politically motivated after a disputed election.
The sedition complaint – the second criminal case opened against Thanathorn since he formed the Future Forward Party last year – dates back to 2015 and was filed by the army, a police official told Reuters.
The progressive, youth-oriented Future Forward Party made a surprisingly strong showing in the March 24 election, coming in third with 6.2 million votes.
It was still unclear which party could form a government after the election, the first since a 2014 army coup. Final results may not be clear for weeks.
Future Forward has joined an opposition “democratic front” alliance that will try to form a government and block junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha from staying in power.
Thanathorn, 40, is accused of breaking article 116 of the Thai criminal code, the equivalent of sedition, and article 189, for assisting others who committed a serious crime, the police summons showed.
He could face up to nine years in prison if found guilty.
Thanathorn will have to report to the Pathumwan police station in central Bangkok on Saturday.
“I don’t know what the charges are yet but it is obviously politically motivated,” Thanathorn told Reuters.
The complaint against Thanathorn was filed by the army in 2015 over his involvement in helping anti-junta protesters that year, a police officer told Reuters on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
“The emergence of Thanathorn … isn’t a threat to the nation. It is a threat to the army that is hostile towards democracy and the people,” Thanathorn told reporters.
The hashtag “#SaveThanathorn” was a top Thai trend on Twitter on Wednesday, resurfacing from February when he met prosecutors about a cybercrime charge over a speech he made on Facebook criticising the junta in July.
Prosecutors will decide on April 26 whether to put him on trial for the cybercrime charge.
The Thai military government dismissed the idea that the police action on Wednesday was politically motivated, saying that the summons related to a national security matter.

KUALA LUMPUR: Genting Bhd’s indirect units Resorts World Las Vegas LLC (RWLV) and RWLV Capital Inc today priced their offering of US$1 billion (RM4.08 billion) at a 4.625% coupon rate.
It has been issued to part-finance the development of the Resorts World Las Vegas casino and integrated resort in Nevada.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Genting said the 10-year notes, due 2029, had been offered and sold in the United States (US) only to qualified institutional buyers and only to certain non-US persons in offshore transactions outside the US, in reliance on registration requirement exemptions and Regulation S under the US Securities Act of 1933.

KUALA LUMPUR: There is no law that says foreign donations are exempted from taxes, says tax expert Veerinderjeet Singh.
He said the only donation exempted from tax is from parents and loved ones as these are considered as gifts and have nothing to do with services rendered.
“If someone gets a donation, but not from parents or a child, the question arises: why did you get it?” he said on the sidelines of a conference titled “Malaysia Baru’s Tax Reform Agenda – What’s Next?” here today.
He added that if the funds had gone to a political party, it would be viewed from a different perspective.
“If a party received it, it would not be taxable. It is taxable if the funds were divested into property and such. But when an individual receives it, that’s different,” he said, adding that it is important to establish the main purpose of the donation and its origin.
Veerinderjeet was answering questions on former prime minister Najib Razak’s reported RM1.5 billion tax bill, and an alleged RM2.6 billion donation from Saudi Arabia.
Earlier, Inland Revenue Board CEO Sabin Samitah said in his speech that tax on foreign donations or income is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. TAGS"

(Reuters pic)
CHRISTCHURCH: The pre-dawn quiet of New Zealand’s South Island is shattered by the crack of a bullet from Noel Womersley’s Finnish Tikka T3 rifle, followed by the shot thudding into the skull of a cow he is targeting, one of three.
For 14 years Womersley has worked at “home kill,” shooting beasts for small farmers and cutting them up, but tough new gun laws to be adopted after the nation’s worst mass murder by a lone gunman will require him to surrender another of his guns.
“Guns are a way of life for me, really,” says Womersley, 48, who received his first firearm, a .22-calibre rifle, for his 12th birthday, and now hunts with his 15-year-old daughter.
“It’s pretty much what I live and breathe. I (shoot) on the weekends for fun and then I do it during the week for a job.”
As the first beast slumps, he rapidly draws back and pushes forward his rifle bolt, firing again and then a third time.
In seconds, three cattle are dead on the damp ground. He gathers his knives and begins to cut them up.
“I shoot animals, I don’t shoot targets. I shoot food,” says Womersley.
Wearing black overalls and gumboots for protection against the gore, he pushes the cattle on their sides, removes heads and hide and uses a hoist to load the carcasses on his refrigerated truck.
Womersley was on a similar job in the hinterland beyond Christchurch on March 15, when a man in combat gear entered the city’s Al Noor mosque, and then another, and turned his high-powered military-style weapons on unarmed worshippers.
“I didn’t really comprehend it was real. I thought it was like a movie, or something that’s happened overseas,” Womersley says, adding that he had been shocked to discover after work what had unfolded just a few kilometres away.
Fifty people were killed and scores wounded, prompting an outpouring of support for the nation’s bereaved Muslim community, and a swift crackdown on guns.
The semi-automatics used in the attack will be banned, with exemptions for working hunters, and tougher licensing rules are on the drawing board.
A wide swathe of New Zealand’s quarter-million gun owners, who account for about 1.5 million weapons, say they accept there must be change after the tragedy.
“I think the gun laws were too slack…the laws gave this bad man a gun,” says Womersley, who owns eight or nine guns, stored in a safe in the garage of a home decorated with game heads. “He ruined it for everyone. Not everyone is like that.”
As part of a new national firearm buyback scheme, he expects to hand in one military-style AR-15 assault rifle, a type of weapon used in the Christchurch massacre.
“I don’t think we need military-style weapons in our society. I definitely don’t need them in my job,” he says. “It’s like driving around in a Ferrari, you don’t need it.” TAGS"

(AFP picture)
BENGALORE: Former captain Alastair Cook believes England have an “outstanding chance” to lift the World Cup on home soil, having built a squad full of proven match winners.
Eoin Morgan’s top-ranked side enter the tournament as the one of the most consistent teams in the format and their quest for a first 50-overs title begins against South Africa at The Oval on May 30.
Since their shock group-stage exit from the 2015 World Cup, England have been particularly strong at home, winning 30 of their 42 ODIs while losing only nine.
“England have an outstanding chance,” Cook, who retired last year from international cricket, told Sky Sports.
“This is first time going into a World Cup England have such a settled squad. Everything looks great from the outside, they have every option covered.”
England failed to cope with raised expectations at the 2017 Champions Trophy when they lost to eventual winners Pakistan in the semi-finals.
Cook is positive such blips can only make a team mentally stronger.
Since the start of last year, England have come out on top in bilateral ODI series against World Cup holders Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India.
“They had that blip in the (2017) Champions Trophy, where they lost in the semi-final to Pakistan when they were favourites, but you need those lows to be able to grow as a side,” he added.
“They are favourites. This is a great opportunity for Eoin (Morgan) and the guys to play some fantastic cricket.
“There are match winners throughout the squad, there are batsmen that can win games on their own, and over the last six or eight months the bowling has really come on. I think they are going to win it.” Reuters TAGS"
Brent nears US$70 as oil prices rise for fourth day,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2019/04/03/brent-nears-us70-as-oil-prices-rise-for-fourth-day/,"Brent nears US$70 as oil prices rise for fourth day By April 3, 2019 3:41 PM Oil prices rise for fourth day (Reuters picture) TOKYO: Oil prices rose for a fourth day on Wednesday, pushing Brent towards US$70 a barrel as support from OPEC-led supply cuts and US sanctions overshadowed a report showing an unexpected rise in US inventories.
Brent futures rose 36 cents, or 0.5%, to US$69.73 a barrel by 0554 GMT, after earlier reaching US$69.87, the highest since Nov. 12, the last time they traded above US$70.
US West Texas Intermediate crude rose 26 cents, or 0.4%, to US$62.84 cents a barrel, earlier rising to US$62.90, the highest since Nov. 7.
“The production cuts by OPEC+ are providing a nice backdrop here for higher prices and until we see US production reassert itself, the easier move is higher for oil,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Oil prices have been supported for much of 2019 by efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-affiliated allies like Russia, known as OPEC+, who have pledged to withhold around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply this year.
Supply from OPEC countries hit a four-year low in March, a Reuters survey found earlier this week.
Oil production from Russia fell to 11.3 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, but missed the country’s target under the deal.
“We assume that OPEC crude oil production will average 30.1 million bpd in 2019 … down from 31.9 million bpd in 2018,” BNP Paribas said in a note, reducing an earlier forecast for this year by 200,000 bpd.
Three of eight countries granted waivers by Washington to import oil from Iran have cut the imports to zero, a US official said on Tuesday, adding that improved global oil market conditions would help reduce Iranian crude exports further.
Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the United States would continue to pressure Venezuela’s oil industry and those who support it with economic sanctions, citing world oil prices as low enough to allow for the measures.
Venezuela’s state-run energy company, PDVSA, kept oil exports near 1 million barrels per day in March despite US sanctions and power outages that crippled its main export terminal, according to PDVSA documents and Refinitiv Eikon data, Reuters reported later in the day.
US crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories drew, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday.
Official numbers from the US Department of Energy (DoE) are due out later on Wednesday.
“As long as we don’t see a major build with the DoE crude oil inventories, we could see a clean move higher,”Moya said. TAGS"

PETALING JAYA: Lynas Malaysia has hit out at a parliamentary caucus to monitor the plant’s operations in Gebeng, Pahang, for failing to turn up for a briefing on its operations despite being invited to do so.
The company’s managing director Mashal Ahmad said they invited all members of the parliamentary caucus – chaired by the DAP’s Wong Tack – to visit its plant.
They also invited Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin.
But to date, Mashal said, all except one member of the “caucus” have either declined or not responded to their hand-delivered invitations.
“This is disappointing as many assertions made by the committee are incorrect and we wish to ensure that all members have access to the facts. This contrasts with the diligent, scientific approach of the Pakatan Harapan government’s Review Committee, appointed by the minister in 2018.”
Mashal went on to say that the Review Committee visited the Lynas Malaysia facility and held meetings with management, scientific experts, community members and groups opposed to Lynas. Mashal Ahmad.
Following this, he said, the Review Committee found Lynas Malaysia’s operations were of low risk and compliant with relevant regulations, and that the residue storage facilities were being operated in a proper manner.
Recently, Yeo and Entrepreneurial Development Minister Redzuan Yusof were involved in a spat over Lynas, with the latter saying the government would allow the plant to continue operating.
Yeo, meanwhile, said the government had formed a task force to facilitate the return of waste to Australia and that Lynas needed to ship out its waste as a pre-condition for the renewal of its licence.
Yesterday Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the Cabinet had yet to discuss the disposal of waste by the rare earths miner but said that whatever was determined by the Cabinet would be the official decision. TAGS"

KUALA LUMPUR: The sale of the Equanimity, the superyacht allegedly purchased with stolen 1MDB funds, to Genting Malaysia Bhd for US$126 million (RM514 million) is the best price the casino operator could offer, Lim Guan Eng said.
Labelling the sum a “big amount”, the finance minister, however, admitted that they had wanted more for the luxurious yacht.
“But if this is the best price we can get based on an open tender, I think we have to accept this is the best price we are going to get,” he told reporters at the Dewan Rakyat lobby.
Lim, however, was supportive of the sale as the government had paid over RM14.2 million to maintain the “Equanimity” – currently anchored in Langkawi – from last August to March this year.
Earlier today, it was reported that Malaysia would sell the superyacht to Genting Malaysia Bhd in the first major asset sale by Putrajaya to recover billions lost from the fund.
The superyacht is among assets allegedly bought by fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, and his associates with money taken from the state investment arm, US and Malaysian investigators have said.
Jho Low allegedly paid US$250 million for the 91m yacht, which has an interior clad in marble and gold leaf, a spa and sauna, a 20m swimming pool, a movie theatre and helipad.
Putrajaya put up the luxury yacht for sale in October, setting a minimum price tag of US$130 million, but had struggled to find a buyer at that price.
Attorney-General Tommy Thomas said the government negotiated directly with Genting Malaysia and, as a result, would save US$4.4 million in agent’s commission. TAGS"

(AFP pic)
TOKYO: Australia’s under-fire coach Michael Cheika insisted on Wednesday the Wallabies will come out firing at this year’s Rugby World Cup, despite a wretched year of results.
The two-time champions won just four of 13 Tests last year, but Cheika – who led Australia to the 2015 final – once again shrugged off criticism.
“We will be in good shape when we need to be,” he said at the Australian embassy in Tokyo.
“It’s going to be an open World Cup for sure – not just because of how the teams have performed leading up to here, but also because it’s in Japan.
“It’s going to be very different, a different atmosphere at the games,” added Cheika, whose side have slipped to sixth in the world since he steered them to the 2015 World Cup final.
“We’ve got a bit to do before then, but the players can’t wait and the lucky ones who get picked can’t wait to get on the plane.”
Australia take on Fiji in Sapporo on Sep 21 in their Pool D opener, before facing Six Nations Grand Slam winners Wales, Uruguay and Georgia.
World Cup winners in 1991 and 1999, the Wallabies have done little in the run-up to this year’s tournament to suggest they can capture a third title.
But Australia’s new director of rugby Scott Johnson last week expressed confidence that Cheika’s players were “not a million miles off” being able to get on a roll and upset the favourites.
“We have as much chance as anyone else,” said Johnson. “Our rugby DNA is acumen and skill, and ‘Cheik’ has got great drive, great passion to get a team going good.”
‘Hard decisions’
Cheika had his players running up steep hills in a punishing January fitness camp to knock them into shape for a brutal World Cup year.
However, with bitter rivals New Zealand again the team to beat as they chase an unprecedented third successive World Cup, Australia are dealing with backroom changes after the sacking of attack coach Stephen Larkham.
“There were changes on and off the field I think we needed to make to get the best possible outcome,” said Cheika, who last month hit out at his “over-dramatic” critics.
“Sometimes you’ve got to make hard decisions – they’re very difficult but it was the right thing to do to move us into a space where we could get a different outcome.”
Cheika appeared relieved when journalists steered questions away from the Wallabies by asking for his thoughts on the demise of the Tokyo-based Sunwolves, who were axed from Super Rugby six months before Japan hosts the World Cup.
“Personally I’m very disappointed,” said the 52-year-old.
“They play good rugby, they’re entertaining – and that’s what we do. We’re there to entertain and give people value for money so I think it’s very disappointing they’re (no longer) involved.” TAGS"

SHAH ALAM: The investigating officer in Muhammad Adib Mohd Kassim’s case told the inquiry into the fireman’s death today that the authorities are still looking for the suspects who attacked the fire truck in the Seafield temple riot last year.
Lew Keng Joe from the Subang Jaya police headquarters said they are seeking assistance from the police intelligence services to track down these individuals.
“We are still investigating the matter. There are images of those who attacked the FRT, but the quality is low which is making it hard for us to identify them,” he said, referring to the fire rescue tender vehicle.
The FRT had reversed after it was attacked and hit the medical van behind it.
Lew was responding to conducting officer Faten Hadni Khairuddin who had asked whether action was taken against the individuals who attacked the fire truck.
He said he had received several videos of the attack but that the police forensic team could not obtain any clear images of the suspects.
Although 12 individuals were arrested, he added, they could not be arrested again after the police reclassified Adib’s case as murder.
“We cannot arrest anyone twice for the same case. I think the family’s consul also knows this,” he said to lawyer Yahaya Othman, who is representing Adib’s family.
Lew also said the statement of witness Narresh Rajandran was inconsistent as the latter had made changes to how he found Adib unconscious.
“He told me three times he was the first person to find Adib lying unconscious.
“However, he later said it was Suresh who found Adib first,” he said, referring to contractor Suresh Surunariani.
“I have to look at the investigation again,” Lew added.
The inquest was called by the government amid conflicting claims on the cause of Adib’s death.
Adib was part of a response team sent from the Subang Jaya fire and rescue station on Nov 27 last year to the temple area in answer to a call that cars had been set on fire. He died at the National Heart Institute on Dec 17. TAGS"

The problem with Malaysia is that we like to set high ideals, put up slogans, have great ambitions and draw inspiration from the successes of other countries. We looked East, essentially to Japan and Korea, during their heydays. We now want to look to China too and again I think it is due to its recent progress in various fields.
We also like to talk about virtues such as hard work, trustworthiness, and knowledge which are important ingredients in determining success.
But Malaysia’s Achilles heel has always been its lack of cogent and concerted action. We have lots of words, but very little deeds. We are full of ambition, but the values we inculcate on the ground portray a very different story.
We fail to achieve much because we are unprofessional in our thoughts and actions. We routinely condone laziness, forgive incompetence and unethical behaviour, and practise double standards to the hilt. Once we reach this stage, shamelessness becomes a non-issue.
Our successive failures are either covered up or bailed out without any lesson learned or new action taken. Just look at the numerous projects that have been run to the ground – from running an airline to car manufacturing to the state of education. Instead of meditating over our failures, we feel proud as if we have done nothing wrong. Today, we are once again trying to indulge in grandiose stuff without thinking much of our own work culture and capability.
Other countries became tigers and dragons quietly, sometimes with much help from the Malaysian diaspora seeking opportunities elsewhere. We make lots of noise but have not accomplished much.
We have always come up with excuses that our people are inexperienced and handicapped and therefore we need a head start and special assistance to succeed. But we fail to realise that the world does not owe us a living. When are we going to earn our own upkeep?
In the course of many years, the crutch mentality has crystallised and become pervasive. It has become the biggest contributor to laziness, lack of professionalism, incompetence, condonation, bailout, and unfettered sense of entitlement. Today, it is the single biggest factor that causes the gradual loss of dynamism and competitiveness of our country.
We tell our people to be independent, honest, hardworking, and resourceful but the reality we see on the ground is very different. We see easy money and unfettered support and bailout of our imprudent actions.
In the name of creating a more equitable society, we have unwittingly promoted a work culture that is totally not in sync with the spirit of competition and self-reliance.
I find it contradictory to talk about hard work, trustworthiness and knowledge on one hand, but then go on to reward laziness, incompetence and dishonesty on the other.
We must be utterly biased or dense not to see the inherent contradictions prevailing in our society today. We urge, plead, beg and scold our people to work hard and to be independent, but sadly this is just a farce. The reality is we protect, pamper, spoil and shelter them without end.

Study says prostate cancer death rates stabilising globally,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/03/study-says-prostate-cancer-death-rates-stabilising-globally/,"Study says prostate cancer death rates stabilising globally By - April 3, 2019 3:05 PM In the US, a decline in the use of a controversial diagnostic test had resulted in lower prostrate cancer deaths.
WASHINGTON: Death rates from prostate cancer – the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men – have stabilised or declined in dozens of countries since the turn of the century, the American Cancer Society reported Tuesday.
In 33 of 44 countries surveyed, the incidence of prostate cancer had stabilised in the last five years for which data was available – and in seven countries, it was down, the report found.
Only four of the countries surveyed, including Bulgaria, saw an increased incidence of prostate cancer, it said.
“In the most recent five years of data examined, prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates are decreasing or stabilising in most parts of the world,” the study’s author MaryBeth Freeman said.
Prostate cancer deaths were down in 14 countries surveyed and stable in 54 others. Only three countries experienced a rise in prostate cancer deaths, according to the study findings, which were presented Tuesday at a conference in Atlanta.
The United States had the biggest drop in prostate cancers, which Freeman attributed to a decline in the use of a controversial diagnostic test that identified too many non-dangerous tumours.
The incidence of prostate cancers rose in the US during the 1980s and early 1990s when the PSA, or Prostate-Specific Antigen, blood test became widely available.
The test is imprecise, however, and yields too many false positives. It identifies higher than normal levels of PSA, a protein produced by the prostate, which could be a sign of cancer but is more often a symptom of other diseases.
Moreover, some prostate cancers are not aggressive and do not grow enough to pose a risk.
A false positive, on the other hand, can have harmful consequences for the patient: anxiety, complications linked to biopsies or anti-cancer treatments.
In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force, an expert panel that reviews the effectiveness of preventive clinical services, advised against use of the PSA test.
In 2018, it revised the recommendation to say that taking the test should be an “individual” decision for men 55 to 69. At 70 and after, it advised against its use. TAGS"

With them are their children (standing, from left) Amirah Che Mat, Esther Koh and Jonathan Koh.
KUALA LUMPUR: The wives of Pastor Raymond Koh and Amri Che Mat are longing to be reunited with their husbands and hopeful that they are still safe after an inquiry into their disappearance said the two men were abducted by the police Special Branch.
Amri’s wife Norhayati Mohd Ariffin said she was relieved at the findings announced by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam), confirming what she had been told by a police informant last year.
But still, she wonders if she will ever see her husband again.
“That’s what I want to ask, even though now we know that Suhakam had named Bukit Aman’s Special Branch as the party involved. Will they be returned to us?” Norhayati told reporters today after attending the final panel inquiry into Amri and Koh’s disappearances.
Amri, who co-founded an NGO called Perlis Hope, has been missing since Nov 24, 2016.
There have been suggestions that he was targeted over his alleged leanings towards Shia Islam, the school of thought branded as “deviant” by Malaysian Islamic authorities.
Koh was abducted from his car by a group of more than 10 men on Feb 13, 2017.
CCTV footage showed at least three black vehicles were involved in the abduction. Many speculated that his abduction might have been connected to his alleged attempts at spreading Christianity, although his family has dismissed such claims.
Norhayati said she and Koh’s wife, Susanna Liew, were waiting for closure.
“What is our status? Are we widows? My children who are still young, are they orphans?” she asked.
The school teacher said after going through more than two years of grief, she was even ready to accept that her husband had died.
“We are always thinking of the worst. Was he tortured? What happened? I just want to know,” she told FMT.
Meanwhile, Liew is hopeful that their husbands will be returned safe and sound.
“We want justice and truth to be revealed because until today, we don’t know what actually happened to our husbands and why they were taken,” she said.
She said they would allow the attorney-general and authorities time to take action based on the findings and recommendations of the inquiry.
“If nothing is done, then we won’t have any choice. This would force us to maybe take a civil suit against the Special Branch or individuals involved,” she said.

"Question marks over Sikh woman’s conversion, says group",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Predeep Nambiar,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/03/question-marks-over-sikh-womans-conversion-says-group/,"Question marks over Sikh woman’s conversion, says group By April 3, 2019 2:58 PM Sikh Naujawan Sabha Penang branch adviser T Harjinder Singh (right) with branch president Hardeep Singh.
GEORGE TOWN: A Sikh-interest group says question marks remain over the reported deathbed conversion of a Sikh woman who was given a Muslim burial earlier this week.
T Harjinder Singh, the Penang branch adviser of Sikh Naujawan Sabha (SNS), said the medical report of K Surinder Kaur, 37, showed that she was unconscious from the time she was brought in to the hospital.
“Our question is, if she really converted before her death, where did it take place? And if it was at the hospital, how was it done?
“We are not against her wish to be Muslim, or trying to instigate anything. We are merely concerned over the way she was converted and whether it was genuine,” he said.
Surinder died at the Penang Hospital on Monday from brain injuries sustained in an assault by a man claiming to be her lover.
She was accorded Islamic burial rites at the request of her immediate family, all of whom are Muslim.
Surinder’s brother was said to have declared in a police report that she converted to Islam before her death, but her name is not in the state register of converts, neither is her religion stated as Muslim on her MyKad.
Harjinder said the Penang mufti’s office called them in for a meeting today and told them that Surinder had converted to Islam two weeks ago, based on her brother’s explanation to the office after her death.
He said SNS had had a “fruitful and positive” meeting with the mufti’s office, and that the mufti is eager to meet them this Friday.
He also said they had reached an understanding that if it is found that Surinder did not convert to Islam, her body will be exhumed and given a Sikh cremation by SNS.
Harjinder said the mufti’s office would meet with Surinder’s family soon to ascertain the details of her conversion.
Although SNS and the local gurdwaras (Sikh temples) do not keep records of local Sikhs, he said, based on the accounts of extended family members and friends, neither Surinder nor her immediate family members ever showed up at the temple.
“They were largely disconnected from our community. But all matters concerning Sikhs concern us,” he said.
“If Surinder did not convert when her immediate family members converted, there is a fair chance that she might be a Sikh after all.” TAGS"
"MP wants IGP investigated over Amri, Koh abductions",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,FMT Reporters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/03/mp-wants-igp-investigated-over-amri-koh-abductions/,"MP wants IGP investigated over Amri, Koh abductions By - April 3, 2019 2:38 PM Charles Santiago wants the government to investigate all other police officers complicit in this crime and to declare the cases as enforced disappearances.
KUALA LUMPUR: Describing Suhakam’s finding that the police had abducted Amri Che Mat and Pastor Raymond Koh as “the most chilling news I have read in a while”, MP Charles Santiago called for the inspector-general of police Fuzi Harun to be investigated.
The Klang MP also wants the government to investigate all other police officers complicit in this crime and to declare these cases as enforced disappearances.
He said the case showed clearly that an Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC) must be set up without delay, adding “we cannot allow the police to ‘police’ themselves anymore”.
This morning, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission or Suhakam as it is better known, held the Special Branch responsible for the disappearance of both Amri and Koh. Perlis-based activist Amri went missing in late 2016 while Koh was seen being abducted by several men in broad daylight in February 2017.
Santiago said Suhakam’s conclusion that both Amri and Koh were victims of forced disappearance “officially makes the country a police state”, noting that the Special Branch was “supposed to protect us”.
Saying enforced disappearance was a crime against humanity, the DAP MP added: “It’s clear that the retiring police chief, Mohamad Fuzi Harun, was hiding information about the disappearances of Pastor Koh and Amri despite their families going through hope and despair.
“This is heinous and Fuzi must be investigated for covering up this violation of human rights and crime under international human rights law.”
He said Fuzi must also come clean as to the whereabouts of both men and also that of Pastor Joshua Hilmy and his wife Ruth Sitepu who disappeared in November 2016.
“These kidnapping have raised fears of religious vigilantism in the country as Pastor Joshua, a Malay Muslim who converted to Christianity, had been suspected of attempting to convert Muslims to Christianity.”
Santiago noted that Amri had been accused of spreading Shia Islam, an accusation denied by his wife, and that Koh was investigated by Islamic authorities for attempting to convert Muslims when they hosted a party with Muslim attendees at a church.
“Abducting these people is a grave violation of police powers. The police have no right to place them outside the protection of the law and if needed should have charged them in an open court instead.”
It was time, therefore, to set-up the IPCMC which was mooted 14 years ago.
“Each of us needs to feel safe in our country. We need to believe that the police have our backs; that they will protect us. But we don’t. Suhakam’s report will further erode public perception of the police and rightfully so.”
He also called on the government to start initiating the ratification process of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. TAGS"

Lori Lightfoot Elected Mayor of Chicago: First Black and First Openly Gay Woman to Hold the Office!,apicciano.commons.gc.cuny.edu,Anthony Picciano,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://apicciano.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2019/04/03/lori-lightfoot-elected-mayor-of-chicago-first-black-and-first-openly-gay-woman-to-hold-the-office/,"
Former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot defeated a longtime political insider yesterday to become Chicago’s next mayor. She is the first black woman and openly gay person to lead the Windy City. As reported by the Associated Press.
“Lightfoot, who had never been elected to public office, easily defeated Toni Preckwinkle, who served in the City Council for 19 years before becoming Cook County Board president. Preckwinkle also is chairwoman of the county Democratic Party.
Lightfoot promised to rid City Hall of corruption and help low-income and working-class people she said had been “left behind and ignored” by Chicago’s political ruling class. It was a message that resonated with voters weary of political scandal and insider deals, and who said the city’s leaders for too long have invested in downtown at the expense of neighborhoods.
Chicago will become the largest U.S. city to have a black woman serve as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20. She will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U.S. cities, including Atlanta and New Orleans and will be the second woman to lead Chicago.
Lightfoot, 56, and her wife have one daughter.
Brian Johnson, CEO of Equality Illinois, said the civil rights organization for lesbian and gay people was “thrilled” with the outcome.
“This victory is historic, and it is also an undeniably proud moment for the LGBTQ community,” Johnson said.
Lightfoot emerged as the surprising leader in the first round of voting in February when 14 candidates were on the ballot to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who decided against running for a third term.
Lightfoot seized on outrage over a white police officer’s fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald to launch her reformer campaign. That was even before Emanuel announced he wouldn’t seek re-election amid criticism for initially resisting calls to release video of the shooting.
“I’m not a person who decided I would climb the ladder of a corrupt political party,” Lightfoot said during a debate last month. “I don’t hold the title of committeeman, central committeeman, boss of the party.”
Preckwinkle countered that her opponent lacks the necessary experience for the job.
“This is not an entry-level job,” Preckwinkle has said repeatedly during the campaign. “It’s easy to talk about change. It’s hard to actually do it. And that’s been my experience — being a change maker, a change agent, transforming institutions and communities.”
Joyce Ross, 64, a resident of the city’s predominantly black West Side who is a certified nursing assistant, cast her ballot Tuesday for Lightfoot. Ross said she believes Lightfoot will be better able to clean up the police department and curb city’s violence.
She was also bothered by Preckwinkle’s association with longtime Alderman Ed Burke, who was indicted earlier this year on charges he tried to shake down a restaurant owner who wanted to build in his ward.
“My momma always said birds of a feather flock together,” Ross said.
Truly Gannon, a 39-year old mother of four who works as a dietitian, said she wasn’t bothered by stories that portrayed Preckwinkle as an insider aligned with questionable politicians like Burke. She supported Preckwinkle, based on her experience.
“I’m not sure Lightfoot would be able to handle the job like Preckwinkle,” she said.
The campaign between the two women got off to a contentious start, with Preckwinkle’s advertising focusing on Lightfoot’s work as a partner at Mayer Brown, one of the nation’s largest law firms, and tagging her as a “wealthy corporate lawyer.”
Preckwinkle also tried to cast Lightfoot as an insider for working in police oversight posts under Emanuel and police oversight, procurement and emergency communications posts under Mayor Richard M. Daley.
In one ad, Preckwinkle criticizes Lightfoot’s oversight of the emergency communications in 2004 when a fire killed four children. A judge ordered Lightfoot to preserve 911 tapes after questions were raised about how the emergency call was handled. The ad notes some of the tapes were destroyed, prompting the judge to rebuke Lightfoot. The ad sparked a backlash from the family of three of the children killed, with their sister accusing Preckwinkle of trying to take advantage of her family’s tragedy.
Lightfoot also responded by scolding her opponent for being negative while also airing ads pointing out Preckwinkle’s connection to powerful local Democrats, including one under federal indictment.
Preckwinkle spent much of her time during the campaign answering for her ties to Chicago’s political establishment. She and her supporters asserted her rise to Democratic Party leadership did not hinder her ability to oppose policies promoted by the city’s ever-powerful mayors.
“My whole career has been about change, and change is action and results, not simply words,” said Preckwinkle, who asserts her experience makes her better positioned to lead a city with financial problems and poorer neighborhoods that are racked by gun violence.
Despite the barbs on the campaign trail, the two advanced similar ideas to boost the city’s deeply troubled finances, which include an estimated $250 million budget deficit next year and billions in unfunded pension liabilities.
Both candidates expressed support for a casino in Chicago and changing the state’s income tax system to a graduated tax, in which higher earners are taxed at a higher rate — two measures lawmakers have tried for unsuccessfully for years to pass.
Lightfoot said that as mayor, she would focus on investing in neighborhoods on the West and South Sides and bring transparency and accountability to City Hall. She added she also wants to restore people’s faith in government.”
Congratulations to Mayor-Elect Lightfoot!"

Schultz is contemplating an independent bid for president launched a tour in January for his most recent novel,”From the bottom up.”
Cassandra Vallianos of Sunrise, Florida, claims even though she’s about the no-call record, she received two unsolicited text messages promoting his own appearance. Vallianos says that she thinks she and Republicans were targeted if their registrations did not record a party taste.
Schultz spokeswoman Erin McPike on Monday called the litigation meritless. She stated that attempts to promote the tour and no messages were shipped without permission. Latest News"
