Having said that, the reason Americans are being forced to get their kids vaccinated and the high incidences of these types of illness once thought to have been significantly diminished is because of our non enforcement of laws regarding immigration. There was a time that legal immigration only allowed the healthy to come into America, now the Liberal Left wants Welcome Centers for all illegal immigration regardless of who they are or if they carry a communicable disease. The Liberal Left proclaims to do this for compassionate reasons - yeah right. The real reason is they want their vote so they can stay in power. Do they care by promoting this type of lawlessness at the boarder that they are encouraging parents to send their children unaccompanied so they can be raped, abused, and possibly killed all so they can eventually follow their child into the US. The Liberal Left sees this population as useful votes, like a toy that is entertaining, but discarded when no longer beneficial."

Colorado bill to allow teen voting fails over worries about process and legality,www.coloradoindependent.com,Sandra Fish for Chalkbeat Colorado,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/04/02/colorado-bill-to-allow-teen-voting-fails-over-worries-about-process-and-legality/,"Colorado bill to allow teen voting fails over worries about process and legality By
Colorado high school juniors and seniors won’t get to vote in school board elections , after lawmakers expressed concerns over constitutional and transparency issues.
The House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee voted 8-1 Tuesday to postpone House Bill 1243 indefinitely, effectively killing the bill. It would have allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote for school board members, members of the State Board of Education and in elections to increase school district taxes or to issue debt for construction.
“I really do believe in this policy,” said state Rep. Jovan Melton, an Aurora Democrat. “All of that fits within what we can do in the legislature. What I’m afraid of is the process of this bill and whether or not it’s constitutional.”
He suggested asking voters to approve a constitutional change allowing the younger voters.
The Colorado County Clerks Association and Colorado Association of School Boards opposed the measure.
Pam Anderson, executive director of the clerks association, said the privacy requirements for new teen voters would conflict with transparency needed to ensure elections are fairly conducted.
“The last thing we want is to erode the confidence in our electoral process,” Anderson said.
Matt Cook of the school boards association said the bill “seems a step too far,” noting that many school boards in the state have advisory councils or even student board members. And he questioned whether students would be able to understand the impact of tax initiatives they vote on when they don’t pay property taxes.
But lawmakers heard from numerous young people and community members asking lawmakers to support the bill.
Tay Anderson, a candidate for the Denver Public Schools board who lost his first run two years ago when he was 19, was among them. He quoted the late rap artist Tupac Shakur to support his viewpoint: “It’s time for us as a people to start makin’ some changes.”"
"Colorado was set to repeal the death penalty this year. What went wrong? Anguish, anger and frustration as the state's fifth repeal effort in a dozen years crumbled",www.coloradoindependent.com,Alex Burness,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/04/02/death-penalty-repeal-canceled/,"
A few weeks ago, in preparation for what she knew would be an emotional debate on the state Senate floor over whether to repeal Colorado’s death penalty, Sen. Julie Gonzales crafted a speech making her case for abolition. She wrote about why she believes the death penalty is an “abhorrent and terrible” practice. She explained why she would vote for the repeal bill — legislation she co-sponsored — in spite of her regret over the bill’s rushed introduction, a process that wounded her colleague, Sen. Rhonda Fields, whose son’s killers now sit on Colorado’s death row.
On Tuesday morning, Gonzales stood on the floor of the Senate and gave a version of that speech. But, instead of explaining why she was voting for abolition, she tearfully explained why she was pulling it. The effort to repeal the death penalty during this session was ended.
“I’m going to give (the bill) a dignified death, not a torturous one,” Gonzales said.
The collision of the political and the personal — and the anguish, anger and frustration that resulted — derailed a bill once seen as near-guaranteed to pass this year. Communication breakdowns, a fumbled rollout, and, critically, four wavering Democrats led to the bill’s demise. Despite a 19-16 Democratic majority in the Senate, abolitionists simply couldn’t rally the votes.
In recent days, Gonzales said, she and her co-sponsor, fellow Denver Democrat Angela Williams, spoke several times with Senate Majority Leader Steve Fenberg and Senate President Leroy Garcia about how to proceed. The choice: bring the bill to the floor for a vote and risk a likely defeat, or pull it altogether and launch a new, more careful repeal effort next year.
Gonzales said she, Fenberg and Garcia preferred to wait. Williams argued that it should go to the floor for a vote. Overruled, she chose not to stand with her co-sponsor on the Senate floor as Gonzales announced they were pulling the bill.
“I did not agree with that course of action,” Williams said. “I wanted it to go through the process just like any other piece of legislation.”
She also said she was “very disappointed” in an interview Fenberg gave The Independent on Friday, in which he said he wouldn’t bring the repeal bill to a vote unless he knew he had the 18 votes it needed to pass.
Gonzales was equally unhappy, saying she was blindsided by Williams’s plan for rolling out the bill in early March — that she found out on a Friday about a sequence of events that was to begin the next Monday.
“Sen. Williams showed a deep disrespect to our colleagues at multiple points through the process,” Gonzales said, adding that Williams’s decision not to join her on the floor “was but one of the signs of disrespect during this process.”
Gonzales said that among the other signs was that Williams failed to solicit Fields’s input on the bill, which was introduced in the Senate, celebrated in a press conference and debated in a committee hearing on three consecutive days — an unusually swift timeline for any bill.
“I consider that a 1-2-3 punch,” Fields, the only Democrat who announced they’d vote against the bill, said at the time.
Gonzales said that after her speech Tuesday, she spoke with Fields.
“We were both kind of crying,” Gonzales said. “I told her, ‘Senator, you know I’m going to bring this bill back next year.’ She laughed and she said, ‘I know.’”
Next year’s repeal effort, which will be the sixth in Colorado in about a dozen years, will lead with the kind of “respect and conversation” that this year’s process lacked, Gonzales said.
She and Williams agree that the bill needs another chance in 2020.
“Absolutely,” Williams said. “I’ve already pulled the title.”
But Williams and Gonzales are unlikely to work together as the lead sponsors of next year’s bill.
“She should check her facts,” Gonzales said, “because I’ve already pulled the title.”
Silence from the swing votes
Though the sponsors disagreed on Tuesday’s course of action, they share at least one common source of ire: the four swing-vote Senate Democrats whose respective hang-ups over the bill produced the uncertainty that ultimately killed the repeal.
Those swing voters — Sens. Jessie Danielson, Joann Ginal, Tammy Story and Nancy Todd — were never forced to reveal their positions on the bill because no vote was ever cast. But each, according to several sources, said they were deterred at least in part by the rollout of the bill and its impact on Fields.
Ginal and Story, Williams said, “committed to me” about two weeks ago that they would vote for the bill. Both Ginal and Story have indicated in town hall meetings and conversations with abolitionists that they oppose the death penalty.
“They verbally told me, ‘yes,’” Williams said.
Gonzales and Williams questioned the idea that the botched process could offend the four swing voters to the point that, a month after the bill’s introduction, they remained undecided — at least in public.
“I think the process is something that people are hiding behind because they don’t want to share what their votes are,” Williams said. “This bill has been on the calendar almost 30 days. We heard people talk about the process, so we slowed it down.
“There are people in this chamber who say they’re so progressive, but you don’t want to vote on this progressive issue? … Everyone’s walking around here talking about how progressive they are. Well, it was put to the test.”
Gonzales said she went out of her way during March to give her colleagues as much time as they needed to come to peace with how they’d vote on the bill. The planned floor debate and vote was postponed nine times between March 11 and April 1. But she’s skeptical of those who still might say they’re hung up on the process.
“I’m not going to play politics with the issue” by forcing a vote, Gonzales said. “So let’s remove all doubt. If you have process concerns, we’ll do it next year. And we’ll do it right.”
In the hours following the bill’s shelving, as was the case in the days leading up to it, none of the four swing voters were willing to explain their thinking.
When The Independent approached Danielson to ask for an interview, she said she was too busy to talk about it — the same response she’d given when asked on Friday.
“Maybe another day,” she said Tuesday, quickly turning away.
By phone Friday, Story said she was running errands, so the timing wasn’t great for a conversation about the death penalty.
Approached at her office Tuesday, Story said she couldn’t talk because she had to get somewhere, but offered that The Independent could check with her staff to try to schedule an interview for later in the day. Her staff never followed up.
Around 11:20 a.m. in the basement of the Capitol, shortly after Gonzales delivered her speech, Ginal said she only had a few minutes, not enough time to do justice to such an important issue.
“I plan on talking about it, but not this quickly,” Ginal said. She agreed, however, to be interviewed later on Tuesday — then never returned a text and call.
Todd was the only one among the four who welcomed a conversation. She’s a Capitol veteran, termed out next year. She’s voted twice on previous death penalty repeal efforts — one vote for it, another against it. Her mixed feelings, she explained, stem from the fact that all three men currently on Colorado’s death row resided in her district. She’s also close to Fields.
But, like the other three swing voters, Todd would not reveal what her position was on this year’s bill.
“I did decide. I’m not going to tell you,” she said. “I don’t think it matters at this point.”
Todd added, “It’ll matter next year. So come back and ask me next year.”
Fields said she didn’t lobby Danielson, Ginal, Story or Todd. Williams said she doesn’t believe that.
“I can’t confirm” Fields tried to sway them, Williams said, “but I suspect so.”
“If she says she doesn’t believe it,” Fields responded, “she needs to go directly to the source.”
Lawmakers on both sides of the issue professed at various points to have no idea how the swing voters were leaning, though some were convinced Danielson was a “no.”
Abolitionists are resolved to be more thoughtful in 2020.
“The way we treat each other needs to be as important as the policy itself,” Gonzales said.
Fields agrees, and said of the repeal bill she knows is coming back, “Bring it on.”"
Littwin: Is Uncle Joe Biden really ready to apologize for Biden being Biden?,www.coloradoindependent.com,Mike Littwin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/04/02/littwin-biden-pelosi-trump-touching-metoo/,"Littwin: Is Uncle Joe Biden really ready to apologize for Biden being Biden? By
The question now being hotly debated in Democratic circles is whether Uncle Joe Biden is too creepy — or, at minimum, too handsy — to run for president.
What’s beyond debate is that this can’t be the way Biden had hoped to launch what would be his third run at the presidency, which may shut down before it can even begin.
Biden obviously knew this issue would emerge. He has been extremely public about his handsiness, after all. He must not have known, though, that two women would come forward before he had even entered the race to accuse him of what is being called “inappropriate touching.” If it were only that.
For years, it has just been Biden being Biden — a genuine family man who’s, uh, just a little tactile, as his defenders put it. But in the #MeToo era, is that good enough? The touching, in one case, allegedly involves smelling the woman’s hair before kissing her head, and, in another, of uninvited nose rubbing. When the question is whether to believe the women — particularly given the chance for political mischief in a presidential race — it’s hard not to believe them. I mean, who would possibly invent a nose-rubbing incident?
The basis for Biden’s appeal — and he’s leading in all the early polls — is that he’s the charming, roguish elder statesman, the one who can, despite his longstanding tendency to gaffe, unify the party, bring back the white working-class vote and thereby rid the country of the reprobate residing in the White House.
You can argue — as many, in fact, are arguing — that Biden, 76, is an avuncular, old-line, big-hearted, empathetic Irish pol who slaps backs, rubs shoulders and offers big hugs the way politicians did back in the day. And that, in any case, he is an equal opportunity embracer, hugging any and all he meets, male or female, regardless of race, creed, age and political persuasion.
All that may be true. The problem for Biden is that the argument kind of falls apart when you add in hair sniffing and nose rubbing, which I’ve never seen any pol, old or otherwise, engage in. It may not be sexual harassment — in fact, neither woman has accused him of that — but it is, well, weird.
So, is Biden — who most agree is a good and decent person who has admirably handled far more than his share of personal tragedy — a harmless flirt or, in the #MeToo era, is there no longer any such thing as harmless flirt? However you answer that question, I don’t think it’s the one that matters.
One glance in the direction of the confessed pussy grabber in the White House tells us that hair smelling is probably not disqualifying for the job. But Biden’s best card to play in countering Trump is his common decency in a contest where he would be the easy winner. So, the question for Biden is why, so late in his long career, he still didn’t have any idea that uninvited nose rubbing would be, well, off-putting. And just as important, why would Biden, even now, think that a semi-apology (while not exactly admitting anything) would do — saying only that he’s sorry if anyone was made to feel uncomfortable because that was never his intent.
Lucy Flores, then a Nevada legislator who was running for lieutenant governor, claimed that back in 2014 Biden put his hands on her shoulders, inhaled her hair and then gave her a long kiss on the head. “My brain couldn’t process what was happening,” she said. “I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused.”
Biden’s response, in part: “In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support, and comfort. And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.”
As Nancy Pelosi — who is close to Biden and whose grandchildren, she said, love him — put it: “To say, ‘I’m sorry you were offended’ is not an apology. It’s ‘I’m sorry I invaded your space.’ She added that “what’s important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it.”
The second person to allege space invasion was Amy Lappos, who described to the Hartford Courant what she said was a 2009 encounter with Biden: “It wasn’t sexual, but he did grab me by the head. He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.”
In a later statement, Lappos said, “Referring to this type of behavior as ‘simply affection’ or ‘grandpa-like’ or ‘friendly’ is ridiculously dismissive and part of the problem. Saying ‘ But Trump…. ’ is dangerous and sets the bar for [D]emocratic men far below where it should be.”
Biden has been in politics, as he would say, literally forever. He first won election to the U.S. Senate at age 29. He first ran for president in — wait for it — 1988. He has had an interesting career, to put it mildly. A lot of stands that he took over time — on abortion, on credit cards, on the Iraq war — don’t play well in 2019. But in 1994, he put forward the Violence Against Women Act. And while serving as Barack Obama’s vice president, he pushed Obama into saying he endorsed same-sex marriage. He has evolved, as good politicians do.
But he’s probably most vulnerable for his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings, which he chaired, and the hours of hostile questioning of Anita Hill, who had accused Thomas of sexual harassment. That became a story again when Christine Blasey Ford was testifying in the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing.
Biden has said over the years that he owes Hill an apology for how she was treated. He recently said he wished he “could have” done something different in her case. What he should have said, of course, is that he wished he “would have” done something different.
Worse for Biden, Hill says that Biden has never actually apologized to her. She told Elle magazine that “It’s become sort of a running joke in the household when someone rings the doorbell and we’re not expecting company. ‘Oh,’ we say, ‘is that Joe Biden coming to apologize?’”
And this is where Biden finds himself as he decides, finally, whether to run in 2020. It’s one thing to have to apologize. It’s another to be the candidate leading the polls who begins his presidential run while on apology tour for not having apologized well enough."
House panel advances bill softening sentences for drug possession Sentencing reforms come as Colorado lawmakers consider ways to curb opioid epidemic and reduce prison population,www.coloradoindependent.com,John Herrick,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/04/02/drug-felony-possession-reform/,"House panel advances bill softening sentences for drug possession Sentencing reforms come as Colorado lawmakers consider ways to curb opioid epidemic and reduce prison population By
Colorado lawmakers are moving ahead with drug-possession sentencing reforms as part of a broader effort to curb the opioid epidemic and drive down the state’s prison population.
“We know that addiction is a public health issue,” said Rep. Leslie Herod, a Democrat from Denver who is sponsoring the bill. “We need to get people to the right place. And just putting someone in (the Department of Corrections) for simple possession is not doing that.”
The House Judiciary Committee Tuesday afternoon passed the bill, HB-1263 , 8-3.
Possession of highly addictive drugs such as heroin and methamphetamine is a felony under Colorado’s Uniform Controlled Substances Act . The bill would make possession of less than two grams of these drugs a misdemeanor, and would also apply to fentanyl, MDMA, LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. Possession with the intent to sell would still be a felony.
The reforms come as the state’s 22 prisons reach 99 percent capacity. Driving the prison population growth is a rise in the number of criminal filings in district court, which have more than doubled since 2012.
Drug felons make up the largest share of new admissions to prison , according to data from the Department of Corrections. About 74% of the state’s roughly 20,000 inmates have moderate to severe substance use disorders, according to the Department of Corrections , and about 985 are addicted to opioids. The department offers practically no medication-assisted treatment for people who have an opioid use disorder until their release.
Supporters hope the reforms will help more people get into treatment and prevent more people addicted to drugs with criminal records from having to struggle to find housing and employment.
Opponents of the bill say county jails will need extra money to house people who would otherwise be sentenced to prison. About 100 people are currently serving prison sentences for class 4 felony (or low level) drug possession, according to the Department of Corrections.
Lawmakers in 2013 passed reforms that allow people facing certain felony drug charges to have them reduced to misdemeanors upon the successful completion of treatment. Many refer to this process as a “carrot” that incentivizes people to complete treatment. Some opponents worry the sentencing reforms would take away that incentive.
Five states have reclassified all drug possession cases from felony to misdemeanor — California, Utah, Connecticut, Alaska and Oklahoma.
The bill comes as Colorado lawmakers work on a number of other criminal justice reforms this session, including eliminating cash bail for low-level offenses and making it easier to release inmates on parole.
The bill now heads to the finance and appropriations committees before it goes to the House for an initial vote."

Three Reasons Why Facebook’s Zuckerberg Wants More Government Regulation – OpEd,www.eurasiareview.com,MISES,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/03042019-three-reasons-why-facebooks-zuckerberg-wants-more-government-regulation-oped/,"By MISES
By Ryan McMaken*
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants more government regulation of social media. In a March 30 op-ed for the Washington Post, Zuckerberg trots out the innocent-sounding pablum we’ve come to expect from him:
I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators. By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what’s best about it — the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms.
But what sort of regulation will this be? Specifically, Zuckerberg concludes “we need new regulation in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.”
He wants more countries to adopt versions of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.
Needless to say, anyone hearing such words from Zuckerberg should immediately assume this newfound support for regulation is calculated to help Facebook financially. After all, this is a man who lied repeatedly to his customers (and Congress) about who can access users’ personal data, and how it will be used. He’s a man who once referred to Facebook users as “Dumb F-cks.” Facebook lied to customers (not be confused with the users) about the success of Facebook’s video platform. The idea that Zuckerberg now voluntarily wants to sacrifice some of his own power and money for humanitarian purposes is, at best, highly doubtful. (Although politicians like Mark Warner seem to take it at face value .)
Fortunately for Zuckerberg, thanks to the economic realities of government regulation, he can both support government regulation and enrich himself personally.
Those who are familiar with the effects of government regulation will not be surprised to hear a billionaire CEO throw his support behind it. Large firms with dominant market share have long made pace with government regulation because it often helps these firms create and solidify monopoly power for themselves.
Specifically, there are three ways that regulation will help Facebook. One: Regulations Will Give Facebook More Monopoly Power
Many Facebook critics like to claim that Facebook is a natural monopoly. That is, they think Facebook is so dominant in the marketplace, that it can use its supposed market power to keep out competitors. We’re told that Facebook has so many users, no serious competition will ever be possible.
But remember MySpace? People used to say exactly the same thing that that social media platform. A recently as 2007, The Guardian was asking “ Will Myspace ever lose its monopoly ?” Xerox corporation was once a tech powerhouse, as well. It has now all but disappeared .
Obviously, the answer to the Guardian’s question is “yes.” But we’re now hearing about how Facebook is a monopoly. The reality, however, is that unless governments artificially erects barriers to entry, no firm can expect a safe place as a dominant firm. Other firms with new ideas will come along, threatening the older firm’s dominance.
The answer to this problem, from the point of view of a firm like Facebook, is to make things for expensive and difficult for smaller startups and potential competitors.
Facebook knows that if government regulations of tech firms increase, the cost of doing business will increase. Larger firms will be able to deal with these additional costs more easily than smaller start ups. Big firms can access financing more easily. They have more equity. They already have sizable market share and can afford to be more conservative. Large firms can absorb high labor costs, higher legal costs, and the higher fixed costs brought on by regulation. A high-regulation environment is an anti startup, anti-entrepreneurial enviuronment. Two: Zuckerberg and Facebook Will Help Write the New Rules
In an earlier age, many might have taken Zuckerberg’s new proclamation as sincere. Fortunately, we live in a cynical age, and even a beat reporter at Mashable knows how this game is played. Mashable’s Karissa Bell writes :
It may seem obvious that Zuckerberg’s proposal is self-interested, but it’s important to remember that his ideas are, of course, designed to help Facebook….
And by touting the social network’s existing work around political advertising and content moderation, Facebook has an opportunity to determine the rules the rest of the industry will also have to abide by.
Part of the reason Zuckerberg has made peace with the idea of government regulation is the knowledge that Facebook will be one of the most powerful groups at the negotiating table when it comes to write the new regulations. In other words, Facebook will be in a position to make sure the new rules favor Facebook over its competitors.
This is a common occurrence in regulatory schemes and is known as “regulatory capture.” When new regulatory bodies are created to regulate firms like Facebook and other dominant firms, the institutions with the most at stake in a regulatory agency’s decisions end up controlling the agencies themselves. We see this all the time in the revolving door between legislators, regulators, and lobbyists. And you can also be sure that once this happens, the industry will close itself off to new innovative firms seeking to enter the marketplace. The regulatory agencies will ensure the health of the status quo providers at the cost of new entrepreneurs and new competitors.
Moreover, as economist Douglass North noted , regulatory regimes do not improve efficiency, but serve the interests of those with political power: “Institutions are not necessarily or even usually created to be socially efficient; rather they, or at least the formal rules, are created to serve the interests of those with the bargaining power to create new rules.”
After all, how much incentive does the average person have in monitoring new regulations, staying in touch with regulators, and attempting to affect the regulatory process? The incentive is almost zero. The incentive for regulated firms, on the other hand, is quite large.
Not only will a small start up lack the resources and political pull to challenge Facebook in the rule-making sphere, but those small firms won’t be be large enough to be considered important “stakeholders” on any level. Thus, Facebook will continue to wield more power than its smaller competitors through its regulatory power. Three: It Will Limit Facebook’s Legal Exposure
Another big benefit of regulation for Facebook will be the potential for using government regulation to limit Facebook’s legal liability when things go wrong. Bell continues:
By offloading decisions about harmful content, privacy rules, and elections onto third-parties, Facebook may not have to take as much of the heat when mistakes are made.
Put another way, Facebook canb protect itself form both the legal and public-relations repercussions to itself when it uses its platform to delete the posts and visibility of users with whom Facebook employees disagree.
As FTC commissioner Brendan Carr put it, Facebook’s proposed regulatory agenda would allow it to “outsource[e] censorship.” Not only would this put the federal government in a position to be directly determining which opinions and ideas ought to be eliminated from tech platforms, it would also allow Facebook to pretend to be an innocent third party: “Don’t blame us for deleting your posts,” Facebook could then say. “The government made us do it!”
Moreover, regulation can be employed by firms like Facebook to shield the firm from lawsuits. Potentially, in the marketplace, Facebook could be sued for using its platform to endanger domestic abuse victims, or victims of suicide. Whether or not the firm should be found guilty of such things would be complex legal questions decided on a case-by case-basis. However, regulation can be used to circumvent this process entirely, and serve the interests of large, abusive firms.
This phenomenon was explained by Murray Rothbard in the context of building regulations:
Suppose, for example, that A builds a building, sells it to B, and it promptly collapses. A should be liable for injuring B’s person and property and the liability should be proven in court, which can then enforce the proper measures of restitution and punishment. But if the legislature has imposed building codes and inspections in the name of “safety,” innocent builders (that is, those whose buildings have not collapsed) are subjected to unnecessary and often costly rules, with no necessity by government to prove crime or damage. They have committed no tort or crime, but are subject to rules, often only distantly related to safety, in advance by tyrannical governmental bodies. Yet, a builder who meets administrative inspection and safety codes and then has a building of his collapse, is often let off the hook by the courts. After all, has he not obeyed all the safety rules of the government, and hasn’t he thereby received the advance imprimatur of the authorities?
Let’s apply this to the tech industry: Firm A is a new startup which has developed a way to make money in a way that satisfies consumers, and does not expose them to any unwanted harassment, de-platforming, or violations of privacy. Meanwhile, Facebook (Firm B) continues to use its dominance in the regulatory process to keep in place costly regulations that prevent new startups from making much headway. These same regulations, however, continue to allow privacy violations, and other abuses up to a certain threshold established in by regulators.
Thus, the outcome is this: Firm A is unable to deploy its new, inventive, non-abusive model at all because regulatory costs are too high. Meanwhile, Facebook can continue to endanger and abuse some users because regulations allow it. Moreover, Facebook enjoys greater immunity form lawsuits because it complies with regulations.Thus consumers are denied both the benefits of the new startup and legal remedies from suing Facebook for its continued abuse.
In short, Zuckerberg’s pro-regulation position is just a pro-Zuckerberg position. By further politicizing and regulating the internet, policymakers will assist large firms — and their billionaire owners — in crushing the competition, and ensuring the public has fewer choices.
