Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings dies at 97 Bill Maher defends Biden: 'He's not Harvey Weinstein or R. Kelly' MORE on Friday, saying allegations against the likely 2020 Democratic presidential candidate of inappropriate touching are not as ""f---ing serious"" as the sexual assault claims against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein or R&B singer R. Kelly. Maher said during the monologue for his show ""Real Time"" that he felt Americans are getting ""a little nitpicky."" ""I mean, of course no one likes to be touched unwantingly, and women get a lot more of that than men, but the first person who brought this up said he made her feel 'gross and uneasy.' You know what makes me feel 'gross and uneasy'? A second Trump term."" Maher continued as the crowd applauded. ""He’s not Harvey Weinstein or R. Kelly. He’s more like the TSA. And it’s getting ridiculous. A woman who came forward today said she was touched by one of his speeches,"" Maher said of the former vice president. Several women have come forward in recent days to accuse the former vice president of touching them inappropriately or in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. Biden previously addressed the women's accounts in a video shared Wednesday on social media. While he did not issue an apology, he pledged to adjust his behavior. ""Social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it,"" Biden said in the video. ""I hear what they’re saying. I understand it. I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility, and I’ll meet it."" In his first public appearance since the allegations became public, Biden on Friday referenced the controversy with a pair of jokes. Speaking at an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers conference, Biden told attendees that he had received permission to hug the union leader and to put his arm around a child he invited up on stage.
Asked about the allegations following his speech, Biden again did not apologize for his actions.
""I’m sorry I didn’t understand more,"" Biden said . ""I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman. So that’s not the reputation I’ve had since I was in high school, for God’s sake.""
Biden later appeared to address the jokes, telling reporters after his speech that he did not intend to ""make light of anyone's discomfort.""
""It was not my intent to make light of anyone’s discomfort,"" Biden told reporters. ""I realize my responsibility is to not invade the space of anyone who is uncomfortable.""
Biden, 76, is widely expected to enter the presidential race in the coming weeks."

The same could be happening here. Trump can't do much because pretty much everyone is against him. The Democrats hate him. Many in his own party don't like him.

Regarding his inflamitory rhetoric; Trump likes stirring up the idiots in the Media. Considering their sloppy and obvious partisanship, this is hardly surprising, and nothing more than they deserve.
I think the 'Emergency' of the Mexican border is a good deal less bogus than open border advocates might like to believe. That Presidents from Reagan on have been kicking that can down the road makes it more urgent rather than less. Until the laws on immigration are changed we have a moral obligation to keep illegal immigrants out, becaue when in they are subject to all manner of exploitation....and the only way to get the laws changed is to enforce them so that the people they would inconvenience have reason to get off their fat rears and raise a fuss.
It strikes me that, rhetoric aside, Trump has gone to Congress rather more often than his immediate predecessor, Jug-Ears the Magic African-American. Now that the enemies of the country have seized the House that may cease. We'll see."

Americans Should Impeach Presidents More Often 7.16.17 6:00 am
War Protests Iraq War Afghanistan Barack Obama George W. Bush Democrats Fang Zhe/Xinhua News Agency/Newscom Party in the Street is a deceptively cheery title for an autopsy. In this book, the social scientists Michael T. Heaney and Fabio Rojas dissect the remnants of ""the second most significant antiwar movement in American history"" after Vietnam—the post-9/11 effort to restrain the American war machine.
In the years after the September 11 attacks, Heaney and Rojas write, peace activism became ""truly a mass movement"": From 2001 through 2006, there were at least six anti-war demonstrations that drew more than 100,000 protestors, ""including the largest internationally coordinated protest in all of human history"" in February 2003.
The authors brought teams of researchers to most of the largest national protests from 2004 to 2010, and gathered reams of survey data from more than 10,000 respondents. Early on, they noticed substantial overlap between anti-war agitation and affiliation with the Democratic Party. That ""party-movement synergy"" helped the war opposition to expand dramatically during the administration of George W. Bush. It also, eventually, contained the cause of its undoing under Barack Obama. ""Once the fuel of partisanship was in short supply,"" Heaney and Rojas note, ""it was difficult for the antiwar movement to sustain itself on a mass level.""
The book begins with a scene from the anti-war campaign's height: Saturday, January 27, 2007, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The occasion was a rally organized by United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), the leading anti-war coalition during the Bush years. An estimated 100,000 protesters turned out to ""tell the new Congress: ACT NOW TO END THE WAR!"" In a fit of irrational exuberance, several hundred protesters actually tried to rush the Capitol while the crowd chanted ""Our Congress!"" at the police officers blocking their way.
On that sunny winter day, the movement's legions looked ready to convert their ire into genuine policy change. In the 2006 midterms, not three months before, Democrats had taken control of Congress for the first time since 1994, in large part because of national discontent with the Iraq War. As Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D–Calif.), put it from the podium: ""We have an antidote to this insanity...It is what you sent us to do last November!"" The following Monday, UFPJ unleashed 1,000 grassroots activists on the Hill to swarm their representatives, demanding they support withdrawal resolutions and join the ""Out of Iraq Caucus.""
But that rally turned out to be the high-water mark; the tide soon receded and within a few years the sea itself dried up. ""At exactly the time when antiwar voices were most well poised to exert pressure on Congress, movement leaders stopped sponsoring lobby days,"" the authors recount. From 2007 to 2009, ""the largest antiwar rallies shrank from hundreds of thousands of people to thousands, and then to only hundreds.""
The collapse was precipitous enough to undermine the old saw that ""every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket."" The movement won no major policy victory, and its remnant had no spoils to divide. ""Antiwar Groups Battle for Survival,"" Politico was reporting by 2010: ""Just a few years ago, some groups raised millions of dollars in donations and mobilized legions of supporters...now, UFPJ—which had a full-time, paid staff and a budget of more than $1 million—relies on volunteers working without a headquarters and with less than $100,000 to spend.""
Party in the Street 's epilogue features a 2013 snapshot of a glum cadre of middle-aged peace activists carrying anti-drone signs outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The book went to press shortly after President Obama launched America's latest war in the Middle East, against ISIS (a group that rose up in the chaotic and violent power vacuum left by previous wars). Despite Tomahawk missiles raining down on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border, ""the mass constituency of the U.S. antiwar movement has gone home,"" Heaney and Rojas conclude.
True enough: On August 8 the war against ISIS reached its one-year mark. If any of the remaining peace groups staged a rally for the occasion, they didn't muster enough protesters to make it into the mainstream press. Still, the activist website FightBack!News claims that ""over 60 people"" joined an anniversary protest in Minneapolis, and ""several large commercial truck drivers passing by laid on their horns and waved in solidarity.""
There's nothing happening here; why that is, is all too clear. The ""antiwar movement demobilized in response to Democratic victories,"" Heaney and Rojas explain. Hordes of activists left the field in the midst of President Bush's Iraq War ""surge"" and votes by congressional Democrats to fund it via supplemental appropriations. What Party in the Street shows, in sometimes exhausting detail, is a mass ""demobilization not in response to a policy victory, but in response to a party victory.""
The chart [below], taken from the book, tracks the movement's decline as measured by media coverage during the relevant period. At the protests' Bush-era peak, self-identified Democrats made up 36 to 54 percent of the protesters; after 2009, their presence plummeted to the 20 percent range. ""When Democrats stopped turning out, the movement could no longer achieve critical mass.""
Source: Party in the Street
Beginning in 2009, the Democratic Party had a nearly filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, and the presidency was in the hands of a man whose candidacy caught fire when he promised to ""turn the page"" on Bush-era ""deciderism"" and ""dumb wars.""
""So,"" Heaney and Rojas ask, ""did these antiwar voters get what they bargained for?"" Hardly: There was ""more continuity than change"" in the war policies pursued by the Bush and Obama administrations. As president, Obama stuck to the Iraq withdrawal timetable negotiated by the Bush team, breaking his campaign-trail pledge to have the troops home 20 months earlier. He also ordered an Afghan ""surge"" on a much larger scale than his predecessor carried out in Iraq; more than 1,500 U.S. troops died in Afghanistan during Obama's first term, nearly three times the toll over Bush's eight years. ""The differences between the administrations are subtle,"" the authors write, adding that ""at worst, the Obama administration was somewhat more bellicose"" than the GOP alternative would likely have been.
That's unduly charitable, it seems to me. After all, by the time Obama hit the dais in Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, he'd already launched more drone strikes than ""war president"" George W. Bush managed during his two terms. Since then, Obama has racked up more than seven times as many drone strikes as Bush, including the remote-control execution of an American citizen—and has launched two ""wars of choice"" without a shred of authorization from Congress. In his recent speech defending the Iran deal, President Obama burnished his hawkish bona fides by pointing out that, so far, he'd bombed at least seven countries.
One suspects that this wasn't quite what your earnest neighbor had in mind back in 2008 when he pasted that ""Hope"" bumper sticker on his Prius. Nor was it the outcome envisioned by the hordes of activists who marched against war during the Bush years. Nonetheless, the peace activists have made their peace with the war-waging president.
""Partisan identification tends to be stronger and longer-lasting than movement identification,"" Heaney and Rojas explain. After 2006, ""Activists were increasingly compelled to choose between their identities. 'Am I a Democrat? Or am I an antiwar activist?' It became difficult to be both."""

Barack Obama George W. Bush War On Terror Foreign Policy Surveillance Book Reviews It seems ages ago now, but there really was a time when some civil libertarians held out hope for Barack Obama's presidency. If elected, this former constitutional law professor might be ""our first president who is a civil libertarian,"" Jeffrey Rosen enthused in The New York Times in March 2008. On inauguration night in 2009, defense lawyers at Guantanamo Bay actually formed a celebratory conga line, chanting ""rule of law, baby!""
They and many other Obama optimists woke up to a hell of a hangover, one that's lasted six years. The president has launched more than six times as many drone strikes as George W. Bush; ordered the remote-control execution of an American citizen; continued and expanded dragnet domestic surveillance programs based on a secret interpretation of the PATRIOT Act; and launched two undeclared wars.
The question Michael Glennon asks at the outset of his important new book, National Security and Double Government, is: ""Why does national security policy remain constant even when one President is replaced by another, who as a candidate, repeatedly, forcefully, and eloquently promised fundamental changes in that policy?""
His answer is altogether darker and more radical than you'd reasonably expect from a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee legal counsel and current international law professor at Tufts. Glennon argues, in essence, that the national security state has become a runaway train and that presidential elections are contests that determine who gets to pretend he's driving.
Glennon takes the book's central metaphor of ""double government"" from the 19th century British essayist Walter Bagehot, longtime editor of The Economist. In 1867's The English Constitution, Bagehot described how real power in the British government had quietly shifted from one set of institutions, the monarchy and House of Lords, to another: the prime minister, the cabinet, and the House of Commons. By the late 19th century, Britain had become a ""concealed republic"" with only the outward trappings of a monarchy.
The United States is moving in the opposite direction, Glennon argues. As power has shifted toward the permanent national security and intelligence bureaucracies, we face an ""emergent autocracy"" in the guise of a democratic republic. We've ""moved beyond a mere imperial presidency,"" he writes, ""to a structure of double government in which even the President exercises little substantive control over the overall direction of US national security policy.""
We're used to the idea that Congress has ceded most of its formal powers over national security policy to an aggrandizing chief executive. But it's counterintuitive, to say the least, to suggest that government's chief executive isn't really in charge. That's likely why the two standard explanations for otherwise inexplicable policy continuity focus on the president as the main protagonist.
The first such explanation is what Glennon terms ""the rational actor model,"" the idea that we get the national security policies we do because these are the national security policies we need, given the threats we face.
This is the account preferred by Harvard Law School's Jack Goldsmith, a former head of the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration, who serves as something of a foil for Glennon. As Goldsmith once put it, ""The presidency invariably gives its occupants a sober outlook on problems of national security.""
Sitting in the Oval Office and getting a faceful of President's Daily Briefs tends to concentrate the mind, the story goes, so it's no surprise that when confronted with new information about the dangerous world we live in, Obama changed his mind about the substantive correctness of his predecessor's counterterrorism policies. Goldsmith quotes Jack Kennedy's observation that it's ""much easier to make the speeches than it is to finally make the judgments.""
The second conventional explanation for policy continuity is what Glennon calls the ""government politics model."" This emphasizes factors like the content of the president's character and the political pressures brought to bear on the presidency.
Maybe, for example, what the Daily Brief really concentrates the president's mind on is political self-preservation. He becomes ever more aware that he's going to be held personally responsible if a bomb goes off anywhere in the country, particularly if he's a liberal Democrat whose foes are eager to paint him as a soft-on-terror McGovernite.
Of course, it's insane to hold any elected official personally responsible for providing seamless protection to a country of over 300 million people; all the surveillance and drone strikes in the world can't begin to meet that boundless responsibility. But as Obama's onetime national security adviser James L. Jones put it: ""Who wants to be the guy that says we don't need [these powers] anymore and then three weeks later something happens?""
Glennon offers another explanation, one that has been overshadowed by the conventional wisdom's focus on the president as decider in chief. Policy continuity is better understood through the ""organizational behavior model,"" he says, which looks to a ""Trumanite network"" of managers in the military, intelligence bureaucracies, and law enforcement ""who are responsible for protecting the nation and who have come to operate largely immune from constitutional and electoral restraints."" Glennon calls them ""Trumanites"" because of our 33rd president's role in founding the CIA, the modern Defense Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Agency (NSA).
Though Glennon doesn't describe his thesis in terms of public choice theory, it echoes that discipline's insight that institutions are run for the benefit of the people who run the institutions. For the Trumanites, Glennon explains, ""benefits take the form of enlarged budgets, personnel, missions; costs take the form of retrenchments in each."" Witness the vast archipelago of intelligence facilities-nearly three Pentagons' worth of office space-that have been erected in greater Washington, D.C., since 9/11.
Security bureaucracies may sometimes resist new missions ""seen as undercutting their culture or efficiency,"" but they will reliably err on the side of overprotection and threat inflation. ""The fundamental driver of Trumanite power has been emergency,"" Glennon writes, and so ""the network thus has little incentive to identify or eliminate the ultimate source of threats (e.g., unwanted intervention in the internal affairs of other nations).""
The national security state is becoming an autonomous, self-perpetuating entity, Glennon warns. It sets the table for elected officials' choices and increasingly dictates terms to them. The permanent bureaucracy basks in the ""glow"" of Madisonian institutions, drawing legitimacy from the illusion that elected officials are in charge. But while the buck may stop with the president, the real power resides with the Trumanites.

Trump Turns One 1.18.18 9:30 am
Americans Should Impeach Presidents More Often 7.16.17 6:00 am
Executive Power Good luck making sense out of what Americans tell pollsters. According to the Pew Research Center, fewer than one in five of us trusts the federal government. Gallup says that nearly three-quarters of us consider our leviathan ""the biggest threat to the country in the future."" Yet by equally overwhelming margins, Gallup shows Americans agreeing that ""the United States has a unique character because of its history and Constitution that sets it apart from other nations as the greatest in the world.""
Apparently, we're disgusted and frightened by our government as it actually operates. And yet we're convinced that we've got the best system ever devised by man.
On both counts, no voting bloc is more convinced than American conservatives. Few go quite as far toward constitutional idolatry as former House Majority Leader Tom Delay, who earlier this year proclaimed that God ""wrote the Constitution."" But the superiority of our national charter, with its separation of powers and independently elected national executive, is an article of faith among conservatives.
So it's about time for some consti tutional impiety on the right. F.H. Buckley answers the call in his bracing and important new book, The Once and Future King . Buckley, a professor of law at George Mason University and a senior editor at The American Spectator , is unmistakably conservative. But that doesn't stop him from pointing out that America isn't so damned exceptional—or from arguing that the revered Constitution has made key contributions to our national decline.
In the conventional narrative, Buckley writes, ""our thanks [must] go to the Framers, who gave the country a presidential system that secured the blessings of liberty."" A ""nice story,"" he says, but one that ""lacks the added advantage of accuracy.""
First off, we're hardly ""the freest country in the world."" As Buckley points out, his native Canada beats the United States handily on most cross-country comparisons of political and economic liberty. In the latest edition of the Cato Institute's Economic Freedom of the World rankings, for example, we're an unexceptional 17th. Meanwhile, as Buckley points out, the Economist Intelligence Unit's "" Democracy Index "" ranks us as the 19th healthiest democracy in the world, ""behind a group of mostly parliamentary countries, and not very far ahead of the 'flawed democracies.'""
There's a lesson there. While ""an American is apt to think that his Constitution uniquely protects liberty,"" the truth ""is almost exactly the reverse."" In a series of regressions using Freedom House's international rankings, Buckley finds that ""presidentialism is significantly and strongly correlated with less political freedom.""
In this, Buckley builds on the work of the late political scientist Juan Linz, who in a pioneering 1990 article, "" The Perils of Presidentialism ,"" argued that presidential systems encourage cults of personality, foster instability, and are especially bad for developing countries. Subsequent studies have bolstered Linz's insights, showing that presidential systems are more prone to corruption than parliamentary systems, more likely to suffer catastrophic breakdowns, and more likely to degenerate into autocracies. The Once and Future King puts it succinctly: ""there are a good many more presidents-for-life than prime-ministers-for-life."" Maybe what's exceptional about the United States is that for more than 200 years we've ""remained free while yet presidential.""
Relatively free, that is. The American presidency, with its vast regulatory and national security powers, is, Buckley argues, rapidly degenerating into the ""elective monarchy"" that George Mason warned about at the Philadelphia Convention. Despite their parliamentary systems, our cousins in the Anglosphere also suffer from creeping ""Crown Government""-""political power has been centralized in the executive branch of government in America, Britain, and Canada, like a virus that attacks different people, with different constitutions, in different countries at the same time,"" he writes.
But we've got it worse, thanks in large part to a system that makes us particularly susceptible to one-man rule. As Buckley sees it, ""presidentialism fosters the rise of Crown government"" in several distinct ways. Among them: It encourages executive messianism by making the head of government the head of state; it insulates the head of government from legislative accountability; and it makes him far harder to remove. On each of these points, The Once and Future King makes a compelling-and compellingly readable-case.
""The character of the presidency is such,"" the British journalist Henry Fairlie wrote in 1967, ""that the majority of the people can be persuaded to look to it for a kind of leadership which no politician, in my opinion, should be allowed, let alone invited, to give. 'If people want a sense of purpose,' [former British Prime Minister] Harold Macmillan once said to me, 'they should get it from their archbishops.'""
Presidential regimes invite executive dominance by combining the roles of ""head of state"" and ""head of government"" in one figure. ""As heads of government,"" Buckley writes, ""presidents are the most powerful officials in their countries. As heads of state, they are also their countries' ceremonial leaders,"" and claim ""the loyalty and respect of all patriots."" Where parliamentary systems cleave off power from ceremony, presidential ones make the chief executive the living symbol of nationhood: the focal point of national hopes, dreams, fears, and occasionally fantasies. In February 2009, author Judith Warner took to her New York Times blog to confess that ""the other night I dreamt of Barack Obama. He was taking a shower right when I needed to get into the bathroom to shave my legs."" Warner's email inquiries revealed that ""many women—not too surprisingly—were dreaming about sex with the president.""
Buckley notes that ""Britons tend not to chat with David Cameron in their dreams,"" which presumably rules out soapy frolicking as well. Nor do Brits tend to look to the prime minister for a sense of national purpose or as a cure for spiritual ""malaise."" Prime ministers are ""more likely to be figures of funâ€¦or the butt of slanging matches during Question Period in the House of Commons."" Indeed, the parliamentary practice of Prime Minister's Questions, in which the chief executive is regularly and ruthlessly grilled by the opposition, goes a long way toward explaining why there's no such thing as the Cult of the Prime Minister.
Presidents can isolate themselves in a cocoon of sycophants, even putting protesters in ""Free-Speech Zones,"" where their signs can't offend the liege. And the exaggerated ceremony of the office ""tends to make criticism of a president seem like lese-majeste, "" as Justice Samuel Alito learned when he dared mouth the words ""not true"" while Obama was pummeling the Supreme Court in his 2010 State of the Union address.
""Thin-skinned and grandiose"" characters do better in presidential regimes, Buckley writes, whereas ""delusions of Gaullist grandeur are fatal for Prime Ministers."" In the U.K., they have to face the music in person each week. The aforementioned Harold Macmillan admitted that the very prospect used to make him physically sick.
The prime minister's Question Time is but one facet of the superior executive accountability offered by parliamentary systems, Buckley argues. Such systems, he maintains, also do a better job of restraining executives' proclivity for launching wars.
It's a counterintuitive claim. In the U.K., warmaking is a royal prerogative exercised by the prime minster, and parliamentary approval is optional. In the U.S., Congress has the power to declare war and the power of the purse, which Jefferson looked to as an ""effectual check to the Dog of war.""

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH:
Pro Baseball has existed for 150 years.
Roll that figure around on your tongue, Bunky.
One hundred fifty years.
All 30 teams will wear special ""MLB 150"" patches on their uniforms this season in honor of the 150th anniversary of the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first openly all-salaried professional baseball team.
It's a game that grew up with the country in ways that other sports did not, a game that came to teach us about race and social class, and a lot of other social issues that had nothing to do with the infield fly rule.
It's also a game that's helped teach us both about history, and the ability of this country to keep growing, keep evolving.
America's game, in so many of the important ways.
* LeBron will not be in the postseason for only the second time in his NBA career.
* The only way to deal with the over-the-top salaries in professional sports these days is not to deal with it.
* I don't believe in horoscopes, but read mine every day. Go figure.
* What is the chance of super freshman Zion Williamson going back to Duke next year? No chance. None.
* And is there a more odious phrase in college sports than ""one and done?""
* QUIZ OF THE WEEK: Who are the two male college basketball coaches with the most Final Four appearances? (Answer near the bottom of the column.)
* LINE OF THE WEEK comes from sports writer Joel Sherman in the New York Post: ""At the corner of unacceptable and intolerable, the Yankees lost a season-opening series to the Orioles.""
* ""From the outside: My Journey Through Life and the Game I Love,"" by Ray Allen, with Michael Arkush,"" is worth it.
* How talented is James Harden? He averages 36 points a game in the NBA. That's how talented.
* Brittany Spears reportedly has 56.4 million Twitter followers.
* How bad are the Knicks? As of Friday morning, they were 40½ games out of first place. That's how bad.
* R.I.P. Joe Bellino. And if you don't know who he is, Bunky, do a little football research.
* Despite being 150 years old, there's no truth to the rumor that the pace of baseball was better then than it is now.
* Or maybe there is.
* It's almost a decade since the Yankees last won a World Series, if you're trying to keep track of these things.
* Kentucky reportedly has given John Calipari a lifetime job, after UCLA just made a run at him.
* The word is there are people in New York who believe Sam Darnold is about to become the best quarterback in the AFC East. Are they just delusional, or flat-out bonkers?
* Looking for a new crime novelist who writes like a dream? Check out ""The Wife,"" by Alafair Burke, the very talented daughter of the great novelist James Lee Burke.
* Baseball in cold weather is very close to torture.
* Scandals come, and scandals go, but big-time college basketball keeps getting bigger and bigger.
* I never saw a better left-handed swing than Fred Lynn's.
* This from the Associated Press: Rhode Island, West Virginia, Mississippi and Pennsylvania are ""all failing to collect the taxes they were counting on with legalized sports gambling.""
* Just when you thought you've heard it all, along comes the news that journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, 36, has signed a two-year contract with the Dolphins.
* What, Doug Flutie wasn't available?
* Hats off to the recently retired Art Martone, the onetime sports editor here at The Journal who had been running the show at NBC Sports Boston for the last 9½ years.
* Can the Red Sox have a do-over?
* When Duke becomes a ""one and done"" school, what is the message to college basketball?
* Or is there simply no pretense anymore?
* Memo to Joe Biden: the unofficial rules have changed, about touching women, and you better change with them, or you soon will be yesterday's news.
* QUIZ ANSWER: John Wooden and Mike Krzyzewski with 12 each.
* It's going to take me a while to get my head around ""Beto.""
* One of the newest words in baseball supposedly is ""biomechanics.""
* And when you figure out what it means, Bunky, let me know.
* The Rolling Stones have postponed their June 8 concert at Gillette Stadium so Mick Jagger, 75, can recover from a heart-valve replacement procedure.

Hillary Clinton Executive Power War But she says at least one interesting thing in the book.
On her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq War , Secretary Clinton writes: ""I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. ... But I still got it wrong.""
What a strange formulation! Was then-Senator Clinton dissociated from her own mental state in the post-9/11 fog of war? ""I thought I had acted in good faith,"" but … I later found out my motives were base and mercenary?
Well, as the lady herself noted some 20 years ago, it's not easy to figure out ""who we are as human beings in this post-modern age.""
""What difference, at this point, does it make?"" you might ask. Actually, Clinton's role in the worst foreign policy disaster in 30 years is highly relevant to her fitness for higher office.
In her October 2002 speech on the resolution, Senator Clinton declared: ""the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt,"" among them, the vitality of Saddam Hussein's nuclear program and his record of harboring al Qaeda . But she wasn't interested enough in the facts to bother reading the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq–portions of which cast serious doubt on those claims.
After her vote, Clinton embarked on a decade-long journey of self-discovery on Iraq. In 2004, she declared, ""I don't regret giving the president authority,"" It wasn't a vote to go to war, anyway.
In 2008, she accused ""Meet the Press'"" Tim Russert of getting all ""Jesuitical"" when he pointed out that the measure she voted for said ""Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002"" right there at the top. Still, Clinton maintained, ""it was a sincere vote at the time""; now, however, she's not so sure.
I can't help Clinton in her Boomerish quest for authenticity, but her vote seems entirely consistent with her record. In her long career, she's rarely met a war she didn't like—or a constitutional limit she deems worth respecting.
In 2007, asked by reporter Charlie Savage about the limits of presidential war powers, candidate Clinton replied: ""the Constitution requires Congress to authorize war. I do not believe that the president can take military action—including any kind of strategic bombing—against Iran without congressional authorization .""
It's hard to credit that answer as ""sincere."" As first lady, Clinton played a key role in convincing her husband to bomb Serbia without congressional approval. For eight months after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, she refused to speak to her husband, until, in March 1999, she phoned him with a directive to attack.
""I urged him to bomb,"" she later explained.
As secretary of State, she urged President Obama to bomb Libya, congressional authorization be damned. If the results haven't been particularly pretty, at least Clinton got some amusement out of the war. Upon hearing that Gadhafi had been killed by a rebel mob, she cracked, ""we came, we saw, he died.""
I shed no tears for the ""mad dog of the Middle East ,"" but given that he slipped this mortal coil while being sodomized with a combat knife, that seems a little callous. At least we could hope for a secretary of state with a dash more decorum, one who avoids the rhetorical stylings of Julius Caesar.
But Clinton is to the Imperial manner born. And if she realizes her ambitions in 2016, she won't have to urge anyone else to bomb.

Obama Is Right on Clemency for Non-Violent Drug Offenders,reason.com,Gene Healy,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2014/04/29/obama-is-right-on-clemency-for-non-viole,"Last week, leading conservatives raised the alarm about yet another terrifying instance of ""presidential lawlessness"" from President Obama .

Americans Should Impeach Presidents More Often 7.16.17 6:00 am
Barack Obama Drug Policy Obama Administration Drug War Executive Power Marijuana On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced new criteria for clemency petitions: they'll prioritize applications of ""non-violent, low-level offenders"" who would have received ""a substantially lower sentence"" under current law; have served at least 10 years; lack ""a significant criminal history""; and ""have no history of violence"" before or during imprisonment.
""A gross abuse"" of power, cries National Review's Andy McCarthy , ""making a mockery of his core constitutional duty to execute the laws.""
""This is lawlessness,"" Charles Krauthammer fumed on Fox News. ""Why can't the president obey the Constitution?""
About that Constitution: Article II, section 2 gives the president ""power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States.""
""The benign prerogative of mercy,"" the Supreme Court has said, ""is unlimited except in cases of impeachment"" and ""cannot be fettered by any legislative restrictions.""
I've never before felt compelled to defend Obama on a sweeping use of executive power, but he's on firm legal ground here—and, as even Krauthammer admits, the president has a point on the merits.
So what's all the conservative caterwauling about? For McCarthy, the clemency initiative represents the execution of Obama's whims: an illegitimate use of the pardon power by an administration that (allegedly) ""does not like the federal narcotics laws."" Channelling the Constitution's framers, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tells us they'd be appalled by this ""alarming abuse of the pardon power,"" which they only intended ""to be used on a limited, case-by-case basis.""
But Obama is hardly the first president whose policy preferences have informed his use of the power. Upon taking office, Thomas Jefferson freed political dissenters convicted under the Sedition Act, which he deemed a ""nullity as absolute and palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall down and worship a golden Image."" (It seems safe to say he didn't like the law.) Woodrow Wilson, whose veto of the National Prohibition (Volstead) Act was overridden by Congress, issued hundreds of pardons for alcohol-related offenses during his tenure.
It's true that the framers viewed the pardon power as a way to mitigate the criminal law's severity on ""a case-by-case basis,"" lest, as Hamilton put it in Federalist No. 74 , ""justice …wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.""
But the constitutional text doesn't limit the power's use to individual cases, and in the same essay, Hamilton argues that blanket pardons could help ""restore the tranquility of the commonwealth"" in cases of insurrection. That's how our first president used the power several years later, after putting down the Whiskey Rebellion. It is ""consistent with the public good,"" Washington told Congress, ""to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit.""
Indeed, as law professors Charles Shanor and Marc Miller explain in a 2001 article, ""at least a third of all United States presidents [starting with] the earliest administrations, have used systematic pardons,"" granting clemency to whole classes of offenders, groups as diverse as pirates, Confederate rebels, Mormon bigamists and wartime draft dodgers.
At more than a trillion dollars and incalculable human costs, our four-decade war on drugs has helped give us an incarceration rate that's unrivaled—and unenvied—in the Western world.
As professors Shanor and Miller note: ""one of the most common uses of systematic pardons in U.S. history has been to heal the wounds of war at home.""

Congress Executive Power Obama Administration Republican Party House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) is leading the charge. In March, he released an updated white paper on ""The Imperial Presidency,"" and helped shepherd the adroitly acronymed ENFORCE the Law Act (for ""Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments"") through the House.
The bill, which tries to compel the courts to rule on issues like the president's repeated flouting of Obamacare deadlines, was necessary, Cantor insisted, because ""the president's dangerous search for expanded power appears to be endless.""
I've long argued that the right should rediscover its historic skepticism toward executive power, so the Republicans' new tune should be music to my ears. But while it's got a nice beat, I'm not sure I can dance to it.
For one thing, the GOP 's latest legislative nostrum won't force President Obama to care about his duty to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."" As the Cantor report describes it, the ENFORCE the Law Act ""mandates that the courts set aside their own court-created standing rules and... prevents courts from using procedural excuses"" to avoid ""important separation of powers cases.""
In other words, it subverts separation of powers principles in an attempt to enforce them. The courts are unlikely to comply.
What's more, the Cantor Report mixes legitimate concerns with bogus and trivial ones: It condemns the administration's ""extraordinary step"" of refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in the courts and ""leaving that job to Congress."" There's nothing especially ""extraordinary"" about that; President George H.W. Bush and President Clinton , among others, refused on occasion to defend statutes they considered unconstitutional, something the presidential oath arguably requires.
Also among the president's imperial sins, per the report: Obama ""refused to abide by a statute requiring his State Department ""to record  Israel ' as the place of birth on passports for U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem."" Cantor fails to mention that it was President George W. Bush who first refused to abide by that requirement -- correctly, according to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which struck it down last year.
The GOP's latter-day anti-imperialists are absolutely right that Obama's ""royal dispensations"" in the areas of health care and immigration undermine the rule of law.
Still, surely his administration has provided more terrifying examples of executive unilateralism than the refusal to deport otherwise law-abiding people whose parents brought them here as children and the decision to delay the implementation of a scheme the GOP’s denounced as socialism.
In his imperial parade of horribles, Cantor finds room for ""withholding critical information about counterfeit goods""–but says nothing about major executive power abuses like illegal wars and dragnet domestic surveillance .
There's a reason for that. Rep. Cantor, truth be told, is rather sweet on the Imperial Presidency. As he sees it, the problem with Obama's Libyan war wasn't its lack of congressional authorization–it was that the president wasn't aggressive enough. Cantor's for a more aggressive approach to Syria , a more aggressive approach to Iran --a more aggressive approach to aggression. He's even given to quoting President Lyndon Baines Johnson 's foreign policy wisdom.
And when Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) moved to defund the National Security Agency 's bulk collection of innocent Americans' calling records, Cantor threatened to kill the bill on a procedural technicality.
Ninety-four House Republicans later voted to end the program; Cantor wasn't among them. On these core Imperial Presidency concerns, the GOP rank-and-file are better than their leadership. They could use a better standard bearer.

George W. Bush Bush Administration Election 2016 Hillary Clinton Republican Party And people say they’re out of ideas.
“Many if not most” of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney's biggest donors are courting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , the Washington Post reported Sunday ; the “vast majority” would back him in a nomination fight, according to one top fundraiser. Jeb, brother and son to presidents 43 and 41, respectively, hasn't yet made up his mind: “the decision will be based on Can I do it joyfully?'”
If he can, he's stranger than he seems, and maybe not the sort of fellow we want to trust with nuclear weapons .
Still, Jeb seemed pretty jubilant last fall, at a Philadelphia event, where he and Hillary Clinton , the odds-on favorite for the Democratic nod in 2016, “basked in a mood of bipartisan bonhomie.” Bush was there to give his potential 2016 rival the National Constitution Center's ""Liberty Medal."" ""Hillary and I come from different political parties, and we disagree about a few things,"" he joked, ""but we do agree on the wisdom of the American people -- especially those in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina .""
Bundlers are loose in the realm; the battle for the throne is shaping up as House Bush vs. House Clinton, and winter is coming . Oh joy.
In America, any child ""may become president, and I suppose it's just one of the risks he takes,"" two-time Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson once cracked. But we run a bigger risk of getting someone with a famous last name. Since I became aware of politics, sometime around the start of the Iranian hostage crisis, either a Bush or a Clinton has been on a major-party presidential ticket in all but the last two races; 2016 would make it eight out of ten. And consider the irony that one of the main figures standing athwart another Bush-Clinton race is Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., himself the scion of a minor political dynasty.
The Founders wisely barred the federal government from granting ""titles of nobility"" (though they may have been too quick to dismiss ""corruption of blood"" as grounds for political disqualification). Still, they recognized that ""there is a natural aristocracy among men,"" as Thomas Jefferson put it to John Adams in 1813, ""the grounds of this are virtue and talents.""
Neither Jeb nor Hillary, one suspects, is quite what Jefferson had in mind. Like his brother ""43,"" Jeb is given to anti-Jeffersonian tropes about the dangers of ""neo-isolationism"" and ""American passivity"" in foreign policy . Hillary thinks it's the president's job to be ""commander in chief of our economy,"" and she's rarely met a war she didn't like, including the Iraq debacle , which she voted for before she was against it.
Alas, political dynasties are hardly a new development in American life. They may even be unavoidable: some intriguing recent research focusing on the prevalence of certain surnames in high-status positions suggests as much.
It may be that the best we can do is what Adam Bellow calls ""meritocratic nepotism,"" an ideal that balances ""the privileges of birth"" with ""the iron rule of merit"": connections can get you the job, but you’d better not screw it up.
If so, then we shouldn’t look for Kennedys and Roosevelts, Bushes and Clintons to fill the presidency. Whatever its faults, the Harrison presidential dynasty, William Henry (nine) and grandson Benjamin (23), did less damage than its more-famous rivals: ""Tippecanoe"" barely lasted a month after his interminable Inaugural Address. And the Tafts — President William Howard (our 31st) and son Robert as a senator — resisted the 20th century drive toward imperial presidencies.
If nepotism's our fate, we should go for better nepots.

Executive Power Newspapers If you’ve been losing sleep over the genius glut in American punditry, rest easy. That threat’s a long way off.
To narrow the choices and give this pudding a theme, I've decided that 2013's malicious listicle will focus on the perverse affinity for executive power of our alleged "" Thought Leaders ."" In a year when presidential incompetence and power lust ruled the headlines — when record numbers of Americans feared big government — the leading lights of the American commentariat clamored for more presidential power. Go figure.
5. Amitai Etzioni, “ Why It Should Be Harder to Impeach a President ,” The Atlantic (May 16)
Early on in President Obama's summer of scandal eruptions, communitarian honcho Amitai Etzioni was incensed that anyone dared invoke the I-word. After all, the president likely “did not know diddly squat” about IRS harassment of the Tea Party .
Only a constitutional amendment making it harder for Congress to impeach the president could save us, Etzioni insisted. But since we manage fewer than one presidential impeachment per century, how much harder could it be?
4. Maureen Dowd, “ Barry's War Within ,” the New York Times (Sept. 7)
MoDo routinely uses her space at the Times to work through her daddy issues : Why can't President Obama be “ the strong father who protects the home” instead of an aloof “professorial president”?
In this column, Dowd's father figure disappoints her once again. Instead of “hurl[ing] a few missiles, Zeus like,” at Syria , Obama had been contemptibly weak: “When it came time to act as commander in chief, he choked,” reverting to “Barry, president of the Harvard Law Review.” Apparently, only a legalistic sissy would ask Congress to authorize a war.
3. Norman Podhoretz, “ Obama's Successful Foreign Failure ,” Wall Street Journal (Sept. 8)
But Obama only looks weak, according to neoconservative godfather Norman Podhoretz. Going to Congress was part of his sinister Kenyalinskyite plan to destroy US hegemony. Even when he golfs, he’s hellbent on the ""erosion of American power.”
2. Richard Cohen, “ The NSA Is Doing What Google Does ,” Washington Post (June 10)
The Post's Cohen greeted the revelation that the administration had been secretly collecting data on millions of innocent Americans with a spurt of bile against leaker Edward Snowden , that “cross-dressing Little Red Riding Hood.”
“No one lied about the various programs disclosed last week,” Cohen declared. Instead of Snowden being remembered as an heroic whistleblower, “[h]istory is more likely to forget him. Soon, you can Google that.”
In his very next column , Cohen had to issue a correction. He “was not aware” that director of national intelligence James Clapper had blatantly lied to Congress about NSA spying. That column, urging the president to bomb Syria, contained yet another glaring error, praising the “NATO bombing campaign in 1999 that ended the bloodshed in Bosnia.” It was Kosovo, actually. Cohen could've Googled that .
1. David Brooks, “ Strengthen the Presidency ,” New York Times (Dec. 12)
“It's a good idea to be tolerant of executive branch power grabs,” said David Brooks (a conservative writer for the Times) in this year's winner . What's more, Brooks writes, “[t]his is a good moment to advocate greater executive branch power because we've just seen a monumental example of executive branch incompetence: the botched Obamacare rollout.”
If that sentence confuses you, it's OK. Not all of us have what it takes to be thought leaders.

Libya is certainly the tertium quid, and that was the case even before Gaddafi took over.
But change is afoot over North Africa, and likely positive, for a change.
Tunisia is actually the closest thing we have in the Arab world to a functional democracy. It has taken a while to get back on its feet after getting rid of Ben Ali in 2011, but it still has a residual Islamist problem (courtesy of the ""Arab Spring"") and its economy, once quite robust, will be on the road to recovery for a while to come.
Algeria will be under new management after two decades of Bouteflika's autocracy masquerading as ""democracy"". What the Algerians will get is still to be determined. But they don't want Islamists, and they want a strong and workable central government. They might get military rule. But they keep their Islamists under control.
The King of Morocco is the closest thing we have to a medieval sultan these days. The country is a strong US ally and like Tunisia and Algeria has little time for Islamists. Right now its partnership with Spain to control immigration has broken down and the place is flooded with African migrants. Maybe the elections in Spain the end of this month will change that and the old partnership will be revived.
All of these three North African countries have strong central governments and effective police and security forces. They are very different from Middle East or Subsaharan countries in this respect. And, as noted earlier, they are all very different from Libya, which has been a regional security concern since the fall of Gaddafi. They will welcome a change for the better in Libya."

Illinois Senate Bill 7 to legalize and commercialize passed out of committee this week as a “shell bill”. The sponsor said they are still working on the language for the bill and will file an amendment by the end of April.
Preliminary recreational cannabis plan – SB 7
Illinois State Senator Heather Steans (D-Chicago) said she and other stakeholders are looking to allow people 21 and older to have a little more than an ounce at a time. They are also considering proposals to add three new licenses to the state’s existing medical marijuana program’s cultivation and dispensary licenses.
“So keeping the cultivation centers in place, but adding a craft grow license for a smaller footprint that could be loaded more flexible and have smaller capital entry requirements, a processing license, a transportation license and then the dispensary license,” Steans said .
A state-regulated cannabis marketplace in Illinois would open up potentially lucrative business opportunities for growers, sellers and other ancillary businesses.
. . . Lawmakers have also talked about making sure there’s diversity among those who have legal pot industry licenses, including efforts to get communities and groups that have been most affected by the prohibition of the drug involved in the legal industry.
. . . Lawmakers are still discussing whether the bill will allow adults to grow their own cannabis at home, Steans said. Law enforcement groups have raised concerns about a possible provision to allow five plants per household. “There is discussion about maybe limiting that to just medical patients, which certainly may be an easier way of enforcing it, ” Steans said.

NOTE: With the expansion of the medical marijuana program, almost anyone could register for medical marijuana and then grow it!
State Senate passes SB 2023 for marijuana and banking
Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs has championed the bill, which would bar the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation from going after banks and credit unions that serve cannabis-related businesses, according to a statement from the treasurer’s office.
. . . While marijuana has been legalized in a growing number of states – for medical use, recreational use or both – the drug is still considered a controlled substance by the feds, making it illegal for banks to do business with the cannabis industry. Read more

What to Teach Your Children About Gender,illinoisfamily.org,David E Smith,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://illinoisfamily.org/homosexuality/what-to-teach-your-children-about-gender/,"What to Teach Your Children About Gender 04.05.19 PRINT Written by Peter Heck I got thinking the other day that I probably needed to start paying attention to some of what I was writing for others to read. Here’s what I mean: I wrote a couple times recently about former tennis great Martina Navratilova, a woman who came out of the closet as a gay athlete long before it was culturally cool to do so, who was plowed over by the tidal wave of transgenderism in our culture. Martina voiced her opposition to having to compete against a biological male in a woman’s sport just because he says he thinks he’s a female. And while I wrote about that to draw attention to the hostility transgender ideology has for the entire construct of biological sex (something that provides the foundation for homosexual ideology), I realized that I needed to take heed myself. If it’s a tidal wave in the culture, I’m not going to be spared as it washes ashore. So, what am I doing to prepare not just myself but my kids? Beyond that, how can I prepare when this revolutionary movement is happening quicker and with more extreme manifestations than anyone predicted? There’s only one answer: Christianity. Actual Christianity. Biblical Christianity. Christianity that teaches submission to God’s will, not our own. That’s why I was so excited to see this piece by Dan Doriani that outlined the three basic principles that we Christians need to be ingraining in our children’s heads every day, without hesitation, without fail. First, God created all things. And in so doing, He chose to create humanity male and female. Doriani does an admirable job pointing out that much of what we think about gender is socially constructed. Wearing ties and tuxes as men versus wearing dresses and rompers as women is totally arbitrary. It is socially constructed by our culture. Differences like an affinity for cooking or sports are also socially constructed and many times boys will cross over into “girl” activities and vice versa. We should point this all out to our children as we encourage them to express themselves freely in their interests and hobbies. But when it comes to sexual identity, the Word and the world it informs is clear:
Activities like giving birth and nursing are creational, not social. Reproduction is basic to how God designed us. People are male or female in every cell of the body, in both nerves and hormones—not in the reproductive organs alone. Secondly, Doriani stresses the importance of teaching our children that their bodies are gifts, not a problem. While sin is a problem and it has impacted our bodies in negative ways, our bodies have been given to us by God for our use. Doriani writes,
Parents, help your children appreciate that they are fearfully and wonderfully made ( Ps. 139:14 ). Tell and show them that God enables their bodies to do marvelous things. We can run and shout. We can be still. We can dance, sway, and sing. Parents, let your children see you performing acts of dexterity and skill—making music, juggling and drawing, throwing and catching, making and fixing.
This is particularly important in the age of video games and iPads. Finally, the author encouraged us to help our children see the gifts God has given each of us to use for His glory. Doing all these things help kids develop a healthy and well-adjusted understanding of the relationship between our physical bodies and our metaphysical minds:
Our culture constantly tells us to “Follow your heart” to find our identity by looking within. The Bible never says, “Follow your heart.” In fact, Jeremiah 17:9 makes it plain: “The heart is deceitful.”
True, we may question roles that family and society have thrust upon us. Yet it is good, not evil, to find our place in the world through the body God gives us. If we believe in the sovereignty and goodness of God, we tell our children this truth applies to them. Amen. Standing athwart the rising tide of sexual insanity in the culture, our children need to cling to something reliable, fixed, and unmoving. Here’s a good place to start.

Why Donald Trump Is Terrified of Running Against Joe Biden,www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/06/why-donald-trump-is-terrified-of-running-against-joe-biden.html,"Why Donald Trump Is Terrified of Running Against Joe Biden 1.4k Subscribe Print Flipboard
Even though Joe Biden is being attacked from within his own party for excessive public displays of affection, Donald Trump still fears the popular former vice president more than any other Democrat.
White House aides have said t hat the president worries Biden would win his home state of Pennsylvania if the two run against each other, as well as other northern “rust belt” states that Trump won in 2016. If that happens, then Trump’s chances of winning reelection will be slightly above zero.
His advisers have tried to make Trump feel better by saying that Biden will get pushed to the left during the Democratic primaries as he fights progressive candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.
When that happens, Trump has been assured, Biden will not be as attractive to “mainstream” voters and thus is not likely to win states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin.
But it doesn’t appear that Trump is buying these arguments. In fact, it’s starting to look like the president is terrified at the prospect of having to face off against Biden in 2020.
Trump is obsessed with polling and knows that Biden currently beats him by nearly nine points in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.
The clearest sign that Trump sees Biden as his biggest threat is when he said to reporters yesterday: “I don’t see Joe Biden as a threat.” Then he added:
“I think he’s only a threat to himself. He’s been there a long time. His record’s not good. He’d have to run on the Obama failed record.”
When Trump says things like that you know he’s really worried. He’s conveniently forgetting that Obama was very popular with the American and left office with an approval rating of 60 percent .
Trump, by contrast, has struggled for the past two years to keep his approval rating above 40 percent.
Trump may talk big but his fear of Biden is shared by many other Republicans. Top GOP strategists said in December that they’d much prefer Trump to run against Warren, Cory Booker, or Sanders, who they believe they could paint as far-left radicals.
Expressing the worries of many within his party, one GOP strategist said about Biden:
“He wreaks calmness and normalcy, which I feel like people crave over the chaos of the Trump administration.”
Biden’s history of invading personal space might hinder his presidential bid, but it’s not likely when his probable opponent has a history of sexual assault and extramarital affairs with porn stars.
In his typical awkward fashion, Biden is trying to clean up his mess before making a formal announcement for the presidency. He’s given several explanations while maintaining that his intentions were pure.
He appeared at a meeting of the electrical workers union and made jokes about how he had received “permission” to hug two people—giving the impression that he treated the entire controversy as a joke.
After the event, he told reporters that he would “have to change somewhat how I campaign,” but never made an actual apology for what he did to make women uncomfortable.
“I’m not sorry for any of my intentions,” he added. “I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done.”
By failing to apologize he has taken a page out of Donald Trump’s playbook. Biden thinks his lengthy liberal record in politics has earned him the right to hold his head high. He has said often that he has the best track record of accomplishment of any other possible Democratic candidate.
Biden has also said that he is the most qualified candidate when it comes to experience, such as foreign affairs and getting domestic legislation passed.
Certainly Trump and his GOP advisers know this is true.
After the electrical workers event, Trump felt he had to lash out at Biden and make some head-scratching comments which made him appear frightened and defensive.
“I’ve employed thousands of Electrical Workers,” he tweeted on Friday. “They will be voting for me!”
Nobody knows what Trump was referring to, but the tweet did highlight his insecurity at the prospect of running against the former vice president.
As polls continue to show that Biden is a top contender, and as more Democrats see him as having the best shot at defeating Trump in 2020, Trump’s fear of Biden will continue to grow. Conservatives interviewed at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month overwhelmingly see Biden as the greatest threat to Trump’s reelection bid.
As additional legal threats around Donald Trump continue to come from every direction, the president will likely likely become more and more worried that he will lose in 2020 (and thus lose his protection from being indicted).
As this happens, we can expect to see not only more bizarre behavior from Trump, but more attacks on Joe Biden as well."

President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to prioritize the confirmation of his IRS chief counsel nominee -- even ahead of Attorney General Bill Barr -- as Democrats prepared to go after the president’s tax returns.
Trump asked McConnell on Feb. 5 to fast-track the confirmation of California tax lawyer Michael Desmond, the New York Times reported, raising questions about whether Trump was motivated to get ahead of Democratic threats to obtain his tax returns from the IRS. Earlier this week, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., formally asked the IRS to turn over six years of Trump’s tax returns under a tax code provision that allows the panel to request the tax information of any filer. Advertisement:
Desmond previously advised the Trump Organization on tax issues before the president was elected, Bloomberg reported last year. A spokesperson for Desmond told the outlet that he assisted with “a discrete reporting matter for a subsidiary company that was resolved with no tax impact.”
Desmond also worked with William Nelson and Sheri Dillon at his private practice, Nelson and Dillon now serve as tax counsels for the Trump Organization.
It appears that McConnell did not act on Trump’s request, moving to confirm Barr first before Desmond was confirmed two weeks later, on Feb. 27. The request suggests that Trump may have been more concerned about getting ahead of the tax return requests than about the Mueller report, which Barr is overseeing. A source told the Times that Trump told the majority leader that Desmond was frustrated with the delay of his confirmation and was considering withdrawing from consideration.
It’s unclear whether or how Trump believes that Desmond can protect his tax returns from being released. Under a 1924 law , the Ways and Means committee has the power to request “any return or return information specified” from the IRS and does not provide the Treasury Department a way to fight the request.
The request to McConnell, however, shows that Trump has a key interest in fast-tracking nominees that he believes could help him personally even as he has left roughly one of every five top administration jobs unfilled.
Barr’s nomination came after he submitted an unsolicited memo to the Justice Department arguing against the basic premise special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe. Advertisement:
Trump’s recently-confirmed IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, who himself owns a stake in two $1.1 million rental units at Waikiki Trump International Hotel and Tower in Hawaii, according to the Wall Street Journal , wrote an op-ed in Forbes arguing that Trump should not release his tax returns.
Trump has said that Democrats will have to go through his “lawyers” to obtain his tax returns and has repeatedly claimed that he would not release the returns himself because he is “under audit.” But the White House has no clear recourse under the law to block the release and Neal has rejected the claim that being under a supposed audit would preclude the returns from being released.
Former longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen dismissed the idea that Trump is under some sort of never-ending audit in his testimony to Congress last month and suggested it was all a ruse to keep him from facing potential penalties and bad press.
“What he didn’t want is to have an entire group of think tanks that are tax experts run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces, and then he’ll end up in an audit, and he’ll ultimately have taxable consequences, penalties and so on,” Cohen said. “I presume that he is not under audit.” Advertisement: Igor Derysh

CNN’s Gloria Borger this week talked with multiple former business associates of President Donald Trump, who all explained why he has a habit of lying about everything he does.
Borger starts off by talking to former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res, who reveals that Trump planted a fake story about Princess Diana looking for an apartment in Trump Tower back in the 1980s as a way to hype up sales for the building. Advertisement:
“That didn’t happen?” Borger asked Res.
“No,” Res replied. “But it made the papers.”
While this kind of lie might seem harmless, Trump’s constant stream of untruths often ended up coming back to haunt him and those who trusted him, as was the case of the failed Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City.
Architect Alan Lapidus, who worked for Trump in the past, told Borger that the New Jersey Casino Control Commission actually shut down one third of Trump Taj Mahal’s slot machines on its opening day because they didn’t work properly.
“To shut down a third of the slots on opening day was both humiliating and financially disastrous,” he said.
Undeterred by this, Trump found a way to lie to the public about why so many slot machines had to be taken offline — and he told TV host Larry King that the machines were shut down because they got overheated from too many people using them. Advertisement:
“Truly, he would just lie about everything,” said former Trump Plaza Casino manager Jack O’Donnell. Brad Reed"

Is ‘Mayor Pete’ too good to be true? – ThinkProgress,thinkprogress.org,sports.yahoo.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thinkprogress.org/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-residents/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,"Advertisement Is ‘Mayor Pete’ too good to be true? No, say Buttigieg's constituents in South Bend, Indiana. He's the real deal. Addy Baird Twitter Apr 6, 2019, 8:00 am SHARE Facebook Twitter Email SMS WhatsApp Share
One Democrat in the race seems serious about governing, and it’s not Bernie Sanders All the best policy ideas in the world won't matter if they can be vetoed by Mitch McConnell or Neil Gorsuch.
“People are interested in pouring money in because they’re impressed by Pete,” Williams-Preston said. “It’s brought a lot of dollars into our community. So that’s all good.”
At 37, Buttigieg is barely old enough to run for the White House (the Constitution sets a minimum age of 35 to be elected president). He is the first openly gay person to run for a major party nomination, and one of the youngest people ever to run for president. The youngest presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan, was 36 when he assumed the presidency in 1891.
Advertisement Residents of South Bend describe Buttigieg as lively and engaged, brilliant yet approachable, data-driven and laser-focused. He is credited with helping revitalize the rust-belt town, once an automotive manufacturing hub. Buttigieg said during his “State of the City” speech last year that one downtown initiative helped attract $90 million in investment to the area.
Despite his achievements and accolades, Buttigieg is punching well above his weight as he tries to vault from mayor of a small, Midwestern city (population 102,000) to the White House.
South Bend residents were surprised — but not displeased — when he announced in January that he was planning to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Jacob Titus, 26, was almost rhapsodic when speaking about Buttigieg’s qualities. He’s a local photographer who got the coveted gig of shooting the cover for the mayor’s best-selling memoir, Shortest Way Home .
Titus said he is most struck by Buttigieg’s inquisitive mind. “He’s incredibly curious,” he said, adding that most of their time during the photo shoot “ was spent with him asking questions about what’s going on around town, recognizing that he has kind of a limited view, particularly that we kind of operate in different worlds.”
Titus added: “He’s always looking for the kind of unexpected or underground things that a mayor probably shouldn’t know about.”
Is Pete Buttigieg the future of the Democratic Party? The South Bend mayor would be the first millennial — and openly gay — president of the United States.
On the strength of Buttigieg’s $7 million first-quarter fundraising performance, the millennial mayor has gone from affable outsider to serious presidential contender in the eyes of some political observers.
Advertisement Once viewed as a dark horse, he not only has been hauling in a hefty number of donations, but garnering glowing media coverage and defying expectations in the polls as well.
Buttigieg trails some better known Democratic candidates in the polls, but he saw the largest jump in favorability ratings of any Democratic presidential candidate over the past two months, one survey found. A Morning Consult poll earlier this week found Buttigieg’s favorability rating jumped by 11 percentage points since the poll began tracking the popularity of 2020 Democrats in early February.
Adam DeBeck has met the mayor several times at local luncheons and at an event at Holy Cross, the college where DeBeck works as an alumni-relations director. “As a mayor, Mayor Pete has been someone who is consistently approachable…It’s weird to make eye contact with your local mayor and feel like you’re talking to your favorite musician or rock star,” DeBeck, 34, said with a laugh.
Buttigieg was able to bring “civic pride” back to South Bend by spearheading an effort to revitalize downtown, DeBeck said, attracting new development and beautifying the cityscape. Buttigieg’s campaign did not comment for this story.
Williams-Preston is the rarest of South Bend residents: Someone whose admiration of Buttigieg is tempered with equal amounts of criticism. The mayor’s laser-focused approach to development resulted in him steamrolling over some of the city’s less fortunate inhabitants and residents of color, she said.
In late 2011, Williams-Preston, who is African American, and her husband decided to buy some local properties, a move they saw as an exciting investment in the neighborhood in which she had grown up. Not long after, her husband fell seriously ill, plunging the family into financial distress.
Before they knew it, they were also facing tens of thousands of dollars in code-violation fines from the city, which had just embarked on its “1,000 homes in 1,000 days” project — an initiative championed by Buttigieg to end the blight of abandoned homes. The effort was criticized for overly aggressive code enforcement that disproportionately impacted less wealthy neighborhoods and those with large minority communities.
“It’s not like there’s this nefarious plot to destroy people of color and move them out… but when we move forward with development, we often start displacing poor people and people of color,” said Williams-Preston, a teacher who’s now a South Bend City Council member, and is also making a run to succeed Buttigieg as mayor.
“I found it wasn’t just happening to me, it was happening to a lot of my neighbors in this community,” Williams-Preston said.
“Mayor Pete” who has generally been written about in elegiac terms, is beginning to feel the first inklings of negative press after weeks of glowing media coverage. Stories this week zeroed in on a controversy early in his administration, when he fired the city’s black police chief — a move he now says he regrets.
Some African Americans, including Williams-Preston, suggest he might not always have been as sensitive as he should be to the needs and concerns of South Bend’s black residents.
Recent news reports faulted Buttigieg for his use of the term “All Lives Matter” during a speech a few years ago, rankling members of the local African-American community, for whom the term “Black Lives Matter” has become a rallying cry in the fight against racial injustice.
On Thursday, he told a gathering at the National Action Network in New York, that he now realizes that his remarks “actually wound up being used to devalue what the Black Lives Matter movement was telling us.”
Buttigieg added: “That is the contribution of Black Lives Matter and it’s a reason why, since learning about how that phrase was being used to push back on that activism, I’ve stopped using it in that context.”
But even his hometown detractors — including African Americans in South Bend like Williams-Preston — expressed admiration for his work there and for his trajectory since announcing his presidential bid.
Williams-Preston said she even predicted his ascent. “I said, ‘You know what, you could literally be the president of the United States someday,” she recalled, recounting a conversation with the mayor.
Being on the stump in early caucus and primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Buttigieg means less time at home in South Bend, but residents say that’s okay.
“I would love to see how he does when it gets down to the primaries. I think he can get that far. He’s definitely someone that I’m supporting,” said Michelle Aranowski, a 41-year-old insurance specialist in South Bend.
“He’s making all this headway. He’s kind of like a celebrity now. It’s really weird. He’s like everywhere you turn.”
“I’m just proud of it, you know?” Aranowski gushed. “That’s my mayor.”

The New York Times’s Investigation into Rupert Murdoch and His Family!,apicciano.commons.gc.cuny.edu,Anthony Picciano,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://apicciano.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2019/04/06/the-new-york-timess-investigation-into-rupert-murdoch-and-his-family/,"
The New York Times has just published a series of articles describing “Rupert Murdoch and his family’s role in destabilizing democracy in North America, Europe and Australia.” Using 150 interviews on three continents, the Times digs deeply into the media mogul and his empire’s influences on prime ministers, media titans, and of course our own president. Here is an excerpt:
“Rupert Murdoch, the founder of a global media empire that includes Fox News, has said he “never asked a prime minister for anything.”
But that empire has given him influence over world affairs in a way few private citizens ever have, granting the Murdoch family enormous sway over not just the United States, but English-speaking countries around the world.
A six-month investigation by The New York Times has described how Mr. Murdoch and his feuding sons turned their media outlets into right-wing political influence machines that have destabilized democracy in North America, Europe and Australia.
Here are some key takeaways from The Times’s investigation into the Murdoch family and its role in the illiberal, right-wing political wave sweeping the globe. The Murdoch family sits at the center of global upheaval.
Fox News has long exerted a gravitational pull on the Republican Party in the United States, where it most recently amplified the nativist revolt that has fueled the rise of the far right and the election of President Trump.
Mr. Murdoch’s newspaper The Sun spent years demonizing the European Union to its readers in Britain, where it helped lead the Brexit campaign that persuaded a slim majority of voters in a 2016 referendum to endorse pulling out of the bloc. Political havoc has reigned in Britain ever since.
And in Australia, where his hold over the media is most extensive, Mr. Murdoch’s outlets pushed for the repeal of the country’s carbon tax and helped topple a series of prime ministers whose agenda he disliked, including Malcolm Turnbull last year.
At the center of this upheaval sits the Murdoch family, a clan whose dysfunction has both shaped and mirrored the global tumult of recent years.
The Times explored those family dynamics and their impact on the Murdoch empire, which is on the cusp of succession as its 88-year-old patriarch prepares to hand power to the son whose politics most resemble his own: Lachlan Murdoch.
A key step in that succession has paradoxically been the partial dismemberment of the empire, which significantly shrunk last month when Mr. Murdoch sold one of his companies, the film studio 21st Century Fox, to the Walt Disney Company for $71.3 billion.
The deal turned Mr. Murdoch’s children into billionaires and left Lachlan in control of a powerful political weapon: a streamlined company, the Fox Corporation, whose most potent asset is Fox News. Mr. Murdoch nearly died last year, making the succession question an urgent one.
Succession has been a source of tension in the Murdoch family for years, particularly between Mr. Murdoch’s sons Lachlan and James.
His two sons are very different people. James wanted the company to become more digitally focused and more politically moderate, while Lachlan wanted to lean into the reactionary politics of the moment.
The brothers have spent their lives competing to succeed their father, and both men felt as if they had earned the top job. When Mr. Murdoch decided to promote Lachlan over James, it was Lachlan who delivered the news to James over lunch, souring the already poor relationship between the men.
James briefly quit the company in protest. But he was lured back by a carefully crafted compromise that put Lachlan in charge but allowed James to save face by maintaining the public illusion that he was the heir.
But all of these succession plans — as well as the lucrative Disney deal — were thrown into chaos last year when Mr. Murdoch broke his spine and collapsed on a yacht.
He was rushed to a hospital, and appeared to be so close to death that his wife, the model Jerry Hall, summoned his children to say their goodbyes.
Mr. Murdoch survived, but his brush with death only highlighted the instability in his family — and at the heart of his empire. The Murdoch empire has been a cheerleader for the American president and helped overthrow an Australian prime minister.
Mr. Murdoch’s media outlets have promoted right-wing politics and stoked reactionary populism across the globe in recent years.
During the 2016 campaign, the Fox News host Sean Hannity advised the president’s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to be on the lookout for ex-girlfriends or former employees of Mr. Trump lest they cause him trouble, according to two people who know about the interactions (Hannity denies offering such advice). Mr. Cohen was later sentenced to three years in prison for paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.
The Murdoch empire has also boldly flexed its muscles in Australia, which was for many years Lachlan’s domain.
In Australia, Lachlan expressed disdain for efforts to fight climate change and once rebuked the staff at one of his family’s newspapers, The Australian, for an editorial in support of same-sex marriage (He says through a representative that he is in favor of same-sex marriage). He also became close to the politician Tony Abbott, whose 2013 election as prime minister was given an assist by Murdoch newspapers.
The Murdoch family changed Australian politics in 2016 when it took control of Sky News Australia and imported the Fox News model. They quickly introduced a slate of right-wing opinion shows that often focused on race, immigration and climate change. The programming became known as Sky After Dark.
Last year, Mr. Turnbull and his staff accused Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch of using their media outlets to help foment the intraparty coup that thrust him from office in August. Mr. Turnbull, a moderate and longtime nemesis of his friend Mr. Abbott, was replaced by the right-wing nationalist Scott Morrison.
The Murdochs have denied any role in Mr. Turnbull’s downfall. James Murdoch thought Fox News was toxic to the company.
James Murdoch became disillusioned with the family empire in the years before Lachlan emerged as heir. He came to see Fox News, in particular, as a source of damaging ideological baggage that was hobbling the company’s efforts to innovate and grow.
But Lachlan and Rupert did not share that belief. When Roger Ailes, the chief executive of Fox News, was ousted in 2016 amid a sexual harassment scandal, James wanted to revamp the network as a less partisan news outlet. He even floated the idea of hiring David Rhodes, a CBS executive.
His proposals went nowhere. Lachlan and Rupert opposed any change to what they saw as a winning formula and decided to stick with Fox’s incendiary programming.
But James believed he had seen firsthand the damage that outlets like Fox News were doing to the company.
He was the face of the Murdoch empire in Britain during a 2010 attempt to take over British Sky Broadcasting, in which the company owned a minority stake.
That bid was blown to pieces by the 2011 phone hacking scandal, which forced James and his father to appear before Parliament to explain why their employees hacked into the voice mail of private citizens, including a dead 13-year-old girl. The scandal forced the Murdochs to abandon their bid for Sky.
Five years later, facing pressure from digital rivals like Netflix and Amazon, the family made a second bid for Sky. James again acted as the empire’s public face. The bid again collapsed in a humiliating scandal.
This time it centered on the culture of Fox News, where sexual misconduct allegations and millions of dollars in secret settlements led to the departure of Mr. Ailes, the star host Bill O’Reilly and Bill Shine, an executive who later went to work for President Trump.
The behavior of Mr. Hannity, who used his show to spread conspiracy theories about the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member named Seth Rich, also fed concerns in Britain over the ethics of the company.
After months of review by regulators — and scrambling inside 21st Century Fox — the British government issued a withering rebuke to the Murdochs last year.
Not only did Britain block the company’s bid for Sky, it also ruled that no member of the Murdoch family could serve at Sky in any capacity, including on its board. At the time, James was serving as Sky’s chairman.
It was a deep humiliation that convinced James once and for all that the family empire could not survive its own politics and culture. Lachlan instead saw it as validation of his belief that James, having failed to acquire Sky once, had been the wrong man for the job.
Either way, by putting a much-needed revenue stream permanently outside the family’s grasp, it helped make the sale of 21st Century Fox inevitable. The Disney deal worsened a family rift.
James and Lachlan were bitterly split over the prospect of selling 21st Century Fox to Disney. James pushed hard for the deal, which was completed last month, and Lachlan fiercely opposed it.
Lachlan vociferously opposed the deal because it substantially shrank the company he returned from Australia to one day lead, people closer to his brother said. He felt so strongly that at one point he warned his father he would stop speaking to him if he continued to pursue the deal. Mr. Murdoch ignored that threat. (Lachlan denied making the threat.)
Lachlan’s opposition was also fueled in part by his suspicion that his brother’s judgment had been clouded by personal ambition, people closer to Lachlan said. He thought James was willing to sell 21st Century Fox for less than it was worth because he wanted the deal to include a job for himself at Disney.
The deal transformed Disney into a media colossus, and a job there might have enabled James to position himself as a successor to its chief executive, Robert A. Iger. It would also let him escape the family company, its political baggage and the prospect of working for Lachlan.
The two brothers clashed over everything. When James wanted to respond to President Trump’s 2017 travel ban with a statement reassuring their company’s Muslim employees, Lachlan strenuously resisted. When James bought their father’s Beverly Hills mansion for $30 million, Lachlan, who had also wanted the house, got so upset that their father gave him some of its antique furniture. James thought he had bought that, too.
During the Disney negotiations, Mr. Murdoch grew concerned enough that James’s ambitions might interfere with the deal that he decided to assure Mr. Iger that it was not conditional upon Disney’s hiring his son. In the end, the sale went through, but James did not get a job. Today, the two brothers are barely on speaking terms. Three of the Murdoch children wanted out, and Lachlan might too.
After the Disney deal, the commitment of Mr. Murdoch’s children to what remains of his media empire has been called into question.
The Disney deal made all of them an enormous amount of money: Mr. Murdoch received $4 billion and his children received $2 billion each. As executives at 21st Century Fox, Lachlan and James got an additional $20 million in Disney stock plus golden parachutes worth $70 million each.
Mr. Murdoch had structured his companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corporation, so that the Murdoch Family Trust held a controlling interest in them. He held half of the trust’s eight votes, and the remaining four were divided up among his four adult children. They were barred from selling those shares to outsiders.
James struck out on his own at the end of 2018. To make a more complete break with the company, he and his sisters Elisabeth and Prudence offered to sell their shares to Lachlan.
Mr. Murdoch embraced the idea and urged Lachlan to buy out his siblings. Then father and son would own the company together.
Bankers drew up documents to execute the sale, but Lachlan backed out; he said that it was not financially doable, though the decision raised questions about his commitment to the company.
People close to James said they believed Lachlan was not sure he wanted to stay at the company after the Disney deal was complete. They said he might even want to go back to Australia.”
This is an incredible piece of journalism that exposes Rupert Murdoch and his family’s hunger for power and influence.

You and fellow movement conservatives are in the minority now, and apparently destined to continue that way. You may suppose that, well, Democrats will do it if we don't, so it's war. That deprives you of the best weapon you can deploy against Democrats if, after assembling sufficient political power, they try what you suppose.
To be forthright, my objections are partly motivated by dismay at what I predict an overtly partisan right wing judiciary would do. But my dismay about that is not nearly so strong as my horror at the thought of a nation without a useful judiciary, which we all will get if right wingers continue to cheer on Trump and McConnell in efforts to make the judiciary partisan, and left wingers retaliate in kind, as they surely would.
I try to imagine what could make sense of your motivations—assuming you can see as clearly as anyone else that in this nation's history neither the left nor the right has ever held power for more than a few decades, at the longest. Given that, the only reasonable way to understand your advocacy is to suppose you intend to establish permanent right wing tyranny, based on minority rule.

Is ‘Mayor Pete’ too good to be true?,thinkprogress.org,Addy Baird,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thinkprogress.org/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-residents/,"Advertisement Is ‘Mayor Pete’ too good to be true? No, say Buttigieg's constituents in South Bend, Indiana. He's the real deal. Addy Baird Twitter Apr 6, 2019, 8:00 am SHARE Facebook Twitter Email SMS WhatsApp Share
One Democrat in the race seems serious about governing, and it’s not Bernie Sanders All the best policy ideas in the world won't matter if they can be vetoed by Mitch McConnell or Neil Gorsuch.
“People are interested in pouring money in because they’re impressed by Pete,” Williams-Preston said. “It’s brought a lot of dollars into our community. So that’s all good.”
At 37, Buttigieg is barely old enough to run for the White House (the Constitution sets a minimum age of 35 to be elected president). He is the first openly gay person to run for a major party nomination, and one of the youngest people ever to run for president. The youngest presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan, was 36 when he assumed the presidency in 1891.
Advertisement Residents of South Bend describe Buttigieg as lively and engaged, brilliant yet approachable, data-driven and laser-focused. He is credited with helping revitalize the rust-belt town, once an automotive manufacturing hub. Buttigieg said during his “State of the City” speech last year that one downtown initiative helped attract $90 million in investment to the area.
Despite his achievements and accolades, Buttigieg is punching well above his weight as he tries to vault from mayor of a small, Midwestern city (population 102,000) to the White House.
South Bend residents were surprised — but not displeased — when he announced in January that he was planning to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Jacob Titus, 26, was almost rhapsodic when speaking about Buttigieg’s qualities. He’s a local photographer who got the coveted gig of shooting the cover for the mayor’s best-selling memoir, Shortest Way Home .
Titus said he is most struck by Buttigieg’s inquisitive mind. “He’s incredibly curious,” he said, adding that most of their time during the photo shoot “ was spent with him asking questions about what’s going on around town, recognizing that he has kind of a limited view, particularly that we kind of operate in different worlds.”
Titus added: “He’s always looking for the kind of unexpected or underground things that a mayor probably shouldn’t know about.”
Is Pete Buttigieg the future of the Democratic Party? The South Bend mayor would be the first millennial — and openly gay — president of the United States.
On the strength of Buttigieg’s $7 million first-quarter fundraising performance, the millennial mayor has gone from affable outsider to serious presidential contender in the eyes of some political observers.
Advertisement Once viewed as a dark horse, he not only has been hauling in a hefty number of donations, but garnering glowing media coverage and defying expectations in the polls as well.
Buttigieg trails some better known Democratic candidates in the polls, but he saw the largest jump in favorability ratings of any Democratic presidential candidate over the past two months, one survey found. A Morning Consult poll earlier this week found Buttigieg’s favorability rating jumped by 11 percentage points since the poll began tracking the popularity of 2020 Democrats in early February.
Adam DeBeck has met the mayor several times at local luncheons and at an event at Holy Cross, the college where DeBeck works as an alumni-relations director. “As a mayor, Mayor Pete has been someone who is consistently approachable…It’s weird to make eye contact with your local mayor and feel like you’re talking to your favorite musician or rock star,” DeBeck, 34, said with a laugh.
Buttigieg was able to bring “civic pride” back to South Bend by spearheading an effort to revitalize downtown, DeBeck said, attracting new development and beautifying the cityscape. Buttigieg’s campaign did not comment for this story.
Williams-Preston is the rarest of South Bend residents: Someone whose admiration of Buttigieg is tempered with equal amounts of criticism. The mayor’s laser-focused approach to development resulted in him steamrolling over some of the city’s less fortunate inhabitants and residents of color, she said.
In late 2011, Williams-Preston, who is African American, and her husband decided to buy some local properties, a move they saw as an exciting investment in the neighborhood in which she had grown up. Not long after, her husband fell seriously ill, plunging the family into financial distress.
Before they knew it, they were also facing tens of thousands of dollars in code-violation fines from the city, which had just embarked on its “1,000 homes in 1,000 days” project — an initiative championed by Buttigieg to end the blight of abandoned homes. The effort was criticized for overly aggressive code enforcement that disproportionately impacted less wealthy neighborhoods and those with large minority communities.
“It’s not like there’s this nefarious plot to destroy people of color and move them out… but when we move forward with development, we often start displacing poor people and people of color,” said Williams-Preston, a teacher who’s now a South Bend City Council member, and is also making a run to succeed Buttigieg as mayor.
“I found it wasn’t just happening to me, it was happening to a lot of my neighbors in this community,” Williams-Preston said.
“Mayor Pete” who has generally been written about in elegiac terms, is beginning to feel the first inklings of negative press after weeks of glowing media coverage. Stories this week zeroed in on a controversy early in his administration, when he fired the city’s black police chief — a move he now says he regrets.
Some African Americans, including Williams-Preston, suggest he might not always have been as sensitive as he should be to the needs and concerns of South Bend’s black residents.
Recent news reports faulted Buttigieg for his use of the term “All Lives Matter” during a speech a few years ago, rankling members of the local African-American community, for whom the term “Black Lives Matter” has become a rallying cry in the fight against racial injustice.
On Thursday, he told a gathering at the National Action Network in New York, that he now realizes that his remarks “actually wound up being used to devalue what the Black Lives Matter movement was telling us.”
Buttigieg added: “That is the contribution of Black Lives Matter and it’s a reason why, since learning about how that phrase was being used to push back on that activism, I’ve stopped using it in that context.”
But even his hometown detractors — including African Americans in South Bend like Williams-Preston — expressed admiration for his work there and for his trajectory since announcing his presidential bid.
Williams-Preston said she even predicted his ascent. “I said, ‘You know what, you could literally be the president of the United States someday,” she recalled, recounting a conversation with the mayor.
Being on the stump in early caucus and primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Buttigieg means less time at home in South Bend, but residents say that’s okay.
“I would love to see how he does when it gets down to the primaries. I think he can get that far. He’s definitely someone that I’m supporting,” said Michelle Aranowski, a 41-year-old insurance specialist in South Bend.
“He’s making all this headway. He’s kind of like a celebrity now. It’s really weird. He’s like everywhere you turn.”
“I’m just proud of it, you know?” Aranowski gushed. “That’s my mayor.”

INDIANAPOLIS — Jason Tatum scored 22 points and Gordon Hayward added 21 in his return to Indianapolis on Friday night, leading the Boston Celtics to a crucial 117-97 victory over the Pacers.
The Celtics broke a tie with Indiana for the No. 4 seed in the East and essentially took a two-game lead in the chase for homecourt advantage because they won the season series, 3-1 — giving them the tiebreaker, too. Boston also is building postseason momentum with three straight wins and five in their last six games.
Indiana's two-game winning streak ended. Myles Turner led the Pacers with 15 points and seven rebounds, while Domantas Sabonis and Tyreke Evans each scored 12.
But the Celtics exposed some problems that could become major concerns for the Pacers when the teams likely meet in a first-round, best-of-seven series, starting next weekend.
They repeatedly broke down Indiana's defense — and it showed right from the start.
They jumped to a 10-3 lead out of the gate and opened the second quarter with seven straight points to turn a 27-24 deficit into a 31-27 lead.
It was only the start. An 8-0 run made it 52-40 and when the Celtics scored the final four points of the half, they led, 58-47.
Indiana didn't counterpunch much in the second half, either. Wesley Matthews opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to eight. When Tyreke Evans made one of two free throws with 4:50 left, the Pacers were within 74-65.
Boston answered with a 12-3 run to make it 86-68 and the Pacers never recovered.
Tip-ins
Celtics: Hayward went 9 of 9 from the field and 3 of 3 at the free-throw line. He also had four rebounds in his homecoming. ... Kyrie Irving had 17 points and six assists, while Al Horford, Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris each scored 11 points. ... Baynes also had 11 rebounds. Tatum and Horford each had seven rebounds. ... The Celtics won despite playing without Jaylen Brown (back spasms). ... The Celtics shot 52.2% from the field.
Pacers: Wesley Matthews scored 10 points after missing the previous two games with a strained right hamstring. ... Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday each scored 11 points and Thaddeus Young had 10. ... Indiana was 10 of 23 on 3s and shot 41.3% from the field. ... The Pacers suffered their worst road loss of the season at Boston and their third-worst home loss this season to the Celtics. ... Point guard Darren Collison missed his third straight game with an injured groin.
Up next
Celtics: Head home to play Orlando on Sunday.
Pacers: Host Brooklyn on Sunday, chasing a second straight season sweep. "
Congressional Oversight At The Heart Of America's Democracy,crooksandliars.com,The Conversation,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/congressional-oversight-heart-americas,"Derek W. Black , University of South Carolina
President Donald Trump increasingly acts as though he believes he can ignore Congress and set wide-ranging national policies on his own.
He has, for instance, recently taken unilateral steps to cut off foreign aid to countries he says are sending too many migrants to the United States. He wants to redirect some of the Pentagon’s budget to building the border wall that Congress rejected. His administration has separated families at the border, rolled back student loan protections and energy efficiency standards, and reportedly blocked AT&T Inc.’s US$85 billion acquisition of Time Warner .
Congress has responded by scheduling hearings and requesting documents from the administration. So far, Trump has largely dismissed this congressional oversight as “ presidential harassment ” and attempted to resist by claiming executive privilege exempts him from oversight.
In his State of the Union address, Trump went so far as to say that “if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.”
As a constitutional law scholar , I’m certain that the answer to who wins this fight is clear.
Presidential power to override Congress is limited to a very small set of circumstances. As for everything else, the Constitution empowers Congress to set the nation’s course and keep it on track through oversight.
Congress can eliminate almost every federal agency in the country or, instead, redirect agencies’ efforts toward building homes for the poor and require daily reports on progress toward that goal. As long as the votes are there in Congress to pursue a course of action, presidents can’t do much about it. Carrying out laws
Oversight allows Congress to ensure the executive is properly carrying out the laws as Congress intends.
The Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank, has created a new “oversight tracker,” which shows that Congress is doing this across a wide range of issues and agencies: energy, education, immigration, commerce, civil rights, rule of law, ethics and more. ↓ Story continues below ↓
Congress is asking the administration important policy questions. Are adequate rules, resources and incentives in place to reunite families who have been separated at the border ? Are the nation’s anti-trust laws being used to achieve political rather than legal ends? Are student loan providers being held accountable for their failure to treat students fairly? Why have energy efficiency improvements slowed down or reversed?
All federal agencies, commissions and offices that presidents direct were created by Congress . Congress has created more and more federal agencies over time, and increased the scope of the executive branch’s authority. But the power of individual presidents remains constitutionally limited to the powers that Congress gives them. A January 2019 Cabinet meeting. AP Photo/Evan Vucci Operating within limits
George Washington only had four Cabinet officials . Lincoln had seven .
The executive branch remained small until the early 20th century, when the Great Depression led Congress to expand and create various agencies to deal with the economy, poverty and unemployment.
In the 1960s and ‘70s, Congress expanded the executive branch to its approximate current shape and size, adding agencies like Housing and Urban Development , Transportation , Energy and Education . Since then, the number of federal employees has hovered around 2 million .
Their immediate boss has always been the person in the Oval Office. But the Constitution still demanded that these executive agencies and their staff operate within the limits Congress set. Congress cannot delegate lawmaking to the president or any other executive officer or agency. Legislators cannot, for instance, leave it to the president to singlehandedly figure out what type of behavior to criminalize or how the nation should spend taxpayer dollars.
The Supreme Court has explained that Congress must establish rules that point agencies in the right direction, even if Congress wants those agencies to exercise discretion implementing the law.
None of this is to suggest that presidents lack significant power.
Without agencies enforcing the law under the president’s leadership, federal laws would be nothing but ink on paper. And in our increasingly complex world, Congress needs agencies to fill gaps in the law.
Congress, for instance, can prohibit the release of pollutants that make the air unsafe to human health. But if lawmakers are not confident that they have discovered all the unsafe pollutants or the precise level at which they pose a risk, they can direct agencies to assess those issues further as science develops and regulate accordingly.

The important lesson for today is that the vast majority of federal power lies in the hands of legislators , not presidents.
Save the most central functions of the executive – law enforcement, managing the Treasury, foreign affairs and the military – presidents only have the power and agencies that Congress gives them. Holding agencies accountable
No matter how much power Congress bestows upon presidents and agencies, that power is constrained by the continuing and final checks the Constitution gives Congress.
Presidents may nominate agency heads, ambassadors and federal judges at their discretion, but senators confirm or reject them. Equally important, the president’s constitutional power to make those appointments only covers high-ranking officials.
Congress can, on a case-by-case basis, choose who will appoint inferior officers and limit the president’s ability to remove them. For instance, to address ethical breaches by the executive branch following Watergate, Congress passed legislation establishing an independent counsel , an official which a special court rather than the president or attorney general would appoint for the sake of impartiality.
Congress also sets all the agencies’ budgets on an annual basis and dictates how they will spend their budgets. In short, lawmakers wield enormous authority over the presidency and they may ask for almost anything they want.
The people can fire Congress every two years, but they rely on their representatives to hold the White House accountable all the time. Americans need Congress to make sure presidents and their staff are enforcing the law in ways that meet the public’s needs.
Ultimately, the executive branch – like Congress – works for the people, not presidents.

The visit comes two weeks after the Christchurch terror attack, which prompted a shortening of Ms Ardern’s visit to a single day, meeting Mr Xi and Premier Li Keqiang. Read more "
