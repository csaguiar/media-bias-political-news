SALT LAKE CITY (AP) "" Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are preparing for more changes as they gather in Utah for a twice-yearly conference to hear from the faith's top leaders.
Church President Russell M. Nelson has implemented a host of changes in his first year at the helm, including the surprising repeal Thursday of policies that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled people in same-sex marriages as sinners eligible for expulsion.
Nelson and other church leaders are expected to speak at the two-day conference that begins Saturday in Salt Lake City. It brings nearly 100,000 people to watch five sessions in person and millions more watch live broadcasts and livestreams.
Nelson, 94, ascended to the presidency in January 2018 after nearly three decades in a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve that helps the president lead the faith.
He has already launched a campaign calling on people to stop using the shorthand names ""Mormon"" and ""LDS,"" severed the faith's ties with the Boy Scouts of America after a century, revised how leaders handle closed-door interviews with young people and changed rules to allow missionaries to speak with their families more often.
Church leaders don't always announce new initiatives or make church news at the conference, but Nelson's busy tenure so far has members and onlookers on high alert.
Nelson has made several changes to church operations designed to improve the religious experience for an increasingly global membership that has more than half of its 16 million members outside of the U.S.
He shortened Sunday worship by one hour"" two hours instead of three "" and shifted the emphasis to home-based worship. The switch was a significant one for Mormons, who since 1980 had been expected to attend all three hours each Sunday to be considered active members of the faith.
He also has ordered a new hymn book, made structural changes to how local congregations function and revised a sacred temple ceremony to give women a more prominent role. "

MANILA, Philippines (AP) "" An Indonesian hostage held by Muslim militants in the southern Philippines swam his way to freedom but another drowned while a Malaysian was shot in the back while escaping, officials said Saturday.
The two Indonesians and the Malaysian separately escaped while Philippine marines were attempting to rescue them on Simusa island in southern Sulu province in the last two days, regional military spokesman Lt. Col. Gerry Besana said.
The dramatic escapes leave at least three more hostages in the custody of the Abu Sayyaf, which is blacklisted by the United States and the Philippines as a terrorist organization due to its brutal history of bombings, ransom kidnappings, extortion and beheadings. The remaining captives include a Dutch bird watcher, Elwold Horn, who was kidnapped by the militants in 2012, and two Filipinos.
One of the Indonesians, Heri Ardiansyah, was plucked from the waters by marines on board a gunboat while they recovered the body of his companion, Hariadin, who drowned. The marines gunned down three Abu Sayyaf captors who were trying to chase the two Indonesians at sea, military officials said.
The Malaysian, who was identified by the military as Jari Bin Abudullah, was shot by the militants when he ran away Thursday as marines tried to rescue him and engaged his captors in a gunbattle. Government forces surrounded Simusa island, where a small community thrives near mangroves , to hunt down the remaining Abu Sayyaf gunmen.
The Malaysian was airlifted to Zamboanga city, where he was in critical condition in a hospital, military officials said.
The three hostages were kidnapped off Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island in December last year and taken by speedboat to Sulu, the predominantly Muslim and poverty-wracked province where a few hundred Abu Sayyaf have survived in the jungles despite frequent military offensives.
Army troops on Friday clashed with about 80 Abu Sayyaf gunmen in Sulu's mountainous Patikul town in a fierce but brief gunbattle that left three soldiers and four militants dead and several wounded on both sides, the military said.
The rebels belong to an Abu Sayyaf faction led by commander Hajan Sawadjaan and aligned with the Islamic State group. Sawadjaan is the main suspect in the bombing of a Roman Catholic cathedral during a Mass that killed 23 mostly churchgoers and two suspected suicide attackers on Jan. 27 in Sulu's capital town of Jolo.

"Ogunbowale, Irish overcome UConn, try for 2nd straight title",www.providencejournal.com,"Doug Feinberg, The Associated Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190406/ogunbowale-irish-overcome-uconn-try-for-2nd-straight-title?rssfeed=true,"Ogunbowale, Irish overcome UConn, try for 2nd straight title Doug Feinberg, The Associated Press Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 12:29 AM Apr 6, 2019 at 12:30 AM
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) "" This time, Notre Dame needed Arike Ogunbowale a lot earlier.
A year after Ogunbowale hit an amazing pair of buzzer beaters in the Final Four, the Irish star rushed to the rescue early in the fourth quarter.
Ogunbowale scored 14 of her 23 points in the final period, leading a rally from a nine-point deficit with eight minutes left to help the defending champion Irish beat UConn 81-76 Friday night for a return trip to the title game.
""I don't think it was any mystery you know who was going to be taking the majority of their shots in the fourth quarter,"" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. ""It's the way they've always played since Arike's been there. She still has to make those shots and she did. She's an almost impossible matchup 1-on-1.""
The Irish will face Baylor for the crown Sunday night, trying to become the fourth different school to win consecutive championships "" UConn, Tennessee and Southern California have done it.
Baylor beat Oregon 72-67 in the first semifinal, setting up a rematch of the 2012 national championship game the Lady Bears won 80-61.
This game between the Huskies and the Irish was a rematch of last season's Final Four classic that Notre Dame won on a last-second shot by Ogunbowale. This one "" the latest chapter in the greatest rivalry in women's basketball over the past decade "" provided a fitting encore.
Irish coach Muffet McGraw celebrated by dancing a little jig at midcourt after this comeback victory.
Notre Dame (35-3) trailed 64-55 with 7:52 left before scoring 13 of the next 16 points to take a 68-66 lead on Ogunbowale's short jumper with 3:56 left. The teams then traded the lead five times over the next few minutes with Jessica Shepard hitting a jumper from the foul line with 1:27 left to put the Irish ahead 75-74.
After Crystal Dangerfield missed a drive down the lane, Ogunbowale hit two free throws to give the Irish a three-point advantage with 58.3 seconds left. On UConn's next possession, Brianna Turner came flying out of nowhere to block Napheesa Collier's layup attempt and then Ogunbowale hit two more free throws to make it a five-point game.
""My only mindset was that UConn's season was going to end tonight no matter what it took,"" Turner said. ""If I was going to get a rebound, scoring, boxing out, playing hard D, we were going to get the win.""
Katie Lou Samuelson scored 20 points "" all in the second half "" for the Huskies (35-3).
""Obviously you know we're incredibly disappointed that we didn't win the game, but we played a great team and they played really, really well when they had to,"" Auriemma said. ""We still had a chance. We just weren't good enough tonight to do it. They were better than us tonight.""
The star matchup between Ogunbowale and Samuelson never got going in the first half. Ogunbowale scored just two points before the break, Samuelson was shut out.
Samuelson was the first to hit in a big way, scoring 15 points in the third quarter. Her three foul shots with a second left gave UConn a 54-52 lead.
The Huskies' lead kept growing before the Irish rallied in front of a sellout crowd of 20,062. Ogunbowale had 14 points in the fourth quarter.
These two teams have had a habit of playing on the game's biggest stage. UConn and Notre Dame have now played seven times in the national semifinals or title game since 2011 "" the Irish hold a 4-3 advantage.
There has been a different vibe around UConn this season. Unlike the previous two years, they don't have the burden of a record winning streak or an unbeaten season. Heading into their showdown with rival Irish on Friday night, the Huskies had already lost two games this season and didn't have, as Auriemma put it, ""the fear of losing.""
UConn had never lost three straight years in the Final Four until now.
The Huskies jumped out to a 13-4 lead behind strong play from Collier and a stellar defensive effort as the Irish missed 14 of their first 16 shots. The Irish closed the opening period with an 8-3 burst to only trail by four after one quarter.
The Irish continued its run and took a 22-18 lead on a putback by Ogunbowale. It was her only basket of the first half as she went 1 for 7 from the field.
""She just got off to a slow start in a lot of ways. She feels like she has to carry us because she's the leading scorer,"" McGraw said. ""I thought she settled in at halftime. Her teammates really help her. They continue to encourage her and she came alive in the second half.""
The teams then traded the lead over the rest of the half with the Christyn Williams' jumper in the lane just before halftime giving the Huskies a 30-29 advantage.
REPLACEMENT OFFICIAL
Official Michol Murray slipped in the first quarter opposite the UConn bench with 4:54 left and after trainers came over to check her knee, they took her back to the locker room in a wheelchair. Standby official Gina Cross took over. It's the first time in the history of the Final Four that the standby official had to enter the game according to the NCAA. Official Lisa Jones, who refereed the first game, was brought back to serve as the new standby.
TIP-INS
Samuelson and Collier finished their career with 4,743 points which is the highest combo for a pair of classmates in school history. ... This was the 50th meeting between the schools and UConn holds a 37-13 lead in the all-time series.

Popular Thai party leader answers junta sedition summons,www.providencejournal.com,The Associated Press,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190406/popular-thai-party-leader-answers-junta-sedition-summons?rssfeed=true,"Popular Thai party leader answers junta sedition summons Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 12:01 AM
BANGKOK (AP) "" The leader of a popular new Thai political party that ran a strong third in last month's elections met with police Saturday to hear criminal charges of sedition against him filed by the ruling military junta.
Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit was greeted by a crowd of around 300-400 supporters chanting ""Keep fighting, Thanathorn!"" as he arrived at the Pathumwan police station in Bangkok to answer a police summons on a complaint of sedition and assisting criminals filed by a junta officer. The charges carry a maximum prison sentence of up to nine years.
He said earlier this week that the legal action against him is politically motivated and expected. He said he would comment after his meeting with police.
Police Gen. Srivara Ransibrahmanakul, deputy chief of police, said on Wednesday that the charges against Thanathorn stem from his role in a student demonstration on June 24, 2015. He said the case had stalled because of several reshuffles in positions of the responsible officers.
Thailand has been led by a military government since a coup in 2014 and the ruling junta has kept a tight lid on dissent. It has slapped criminal charges against critics while some had been detained for up to weeks for ""attitude adjustment"" sessions at military bases in efforts to change their views.
The coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, became junta chief and prime minister and is now seeking to lead the next government after a party backing his reappointment won the most popular votes, according to preliminary results of the March 24 elections.
The Future Forward Party positions itself as youth-oriented and is deeply opposed to the military rule. Its strong showing in the elections has made them a target for the military and its supporters. Several criminal complaints and protests to election authorities have already been lodged against Thanathorn and his party.
The election results are due to be ratified by May 9. Meanwhile, political parties are in a race over which side will be able to gather enough support to form the next government. "

WASHINGTON (AP) "" The Latest on President Donald Trump and the border (all times local):
11:25 p.m.
President Donald Trump has made a dramatic appearance at his privately owned golf club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
Trump landed in Marine One, making an unannounced visit to his Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles, as guests and members took photos and videos of his arrival.
The White House says that Trump is having a ""private dinner"" at the club, but is not providing any other details.
Trump did not divest his business holdings upon taking office, and continues to profit from his real estate holdings, including his golf courses.
The visit comes as Trump is facing a new showdown with congressional Democrats, who are seeking his tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, as they look to examine the president's finances.

President Donald Trump is still thinking about winning heavily Democratic California in 2020.
Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by over 4 million votes in the 2016 election. But he told a crowd at a private Beverly Hills fundraiser Friday that he thinks he can pull off a win next year.
That's according to Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel, who attended the event, where photos with the president were going for $50,000.
Steel says Trump told the crowd it's a bad time to be a socialist in America's thriving economy, an obvious dig at his potential Democratic rivals.
And Trump got a big round of applause talking about his administration's decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Steel says.

President Donald Trump is attending a roundtable and fundraiser for his re-election Friday evening in Beverly Hills.
The Republican National Committee says 170 people are at the event at the home of health care executive and GOP donor Lee Samson. The fundraiser benefits the RNC's ""Trump Victory"" joint account with Trump's campaign. The RNC is not disclosing the amount raised at the event.
According to Federal Aviation Administration flight restrictions, Trump will then pay a visit to his private golf club outside Los Angeles in Palos Verdes, California.

House Democrats have filed a lawsuit aimed at preventing President Donald Trump from spending more money than Congress has approved to erect barriers along the southwestern border.
Democrats say Trump's attempt to transfer billions of dollars from several programs to wall construction violates the Constitution, which gives Congress control over spending. The 45-page complaint was filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls Trump's act a ""brazen assault"" on the Constitution.
Congress approved just under $1.4 billion for work on border barricades. Trump has asserted he can use his powers as chief executive to transfer another $6.7 billion to wall construction.
Attorneys general from 20 states, plus environmental and progressive groups, have filed other lawsuits aimed at blocking the transfers.

President Donald Trump is showcasing a section of border wall that separates the United States and Mexico.
Trump visited the section of fencing in Calexico, California, on Friday and declared that ""it looks great"" and was ""better, faster, less expensive"" than other barrier options.
The fence Trump is touring is a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) section that was a long-planned replacement for an older barrier, rather than new wall.
The White House says the barrier is marked with a plaque bearing Trump's name and those of top homeland security officials.
The new 30-foot-tall, 2.25-mile-long barrier replaced fencing that was made of hrlicopter landing mats from the Vietnam War.

President Donald Trump is downplaying the claims of people seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Trump says: ""I look at some of these asylum people. They're gang members. They're not afraid of anything.""

Trump says the administration is making progress in building a border wall and says he expects ""close to 400 miles"" to be completed within the next two years.
The fence that Trump is touring in Calexico is a two-mile section that was a long-planned replacement for an older barrier, rather than new wall.
Trump says of the border wall, ""We've done a lot, we've renovated a lot.""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has denounced President Donald Trump's comments about getting rid of the asylum system. The governor issued the strong criticism in a statement Friday as the president arrived in California to visit the U.S.-Mexico border.
Newsom says that since its founding, the United States has been a refuge and safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression and violence.
The governor says the president's rhetoric disregards the Constitution, the justice system ""and what it means to be an American.""
In comments at the White House as he left for California, Trump urged Congress ""to get rid of the whole asylum system because it doesn't work."" Trump's administration has been pushing Congress to pass legislation that would tighten asylum rules.

I do not own a Pit Bull, but I have friends that do, and I have interacted with them frequently. I have also observed them around children of all ages, and they are extremely affectionate and protective over the little ones.
I personally am a huge fan of Rottweilers. I have three from the von Evman kennels and also three of their offspring. My oldest female, Katy, is the most wonderful animal I have ever seen or known. Whoever says animals do not have souls have not spent enough time around dogs. But, I digress; Rottweilers are constantly, and often intentionally mischaracterized as ""viscous"" animals.
However, ALL large dogs can be very aggressive, if not properly socialized beginning when they are weaned from their mothers. Some breeds are the poster children for the uninformed/misinformed/ignorant/chickenschitt campaign against certain breeds of dogs.
Much like the discussion whereas we must have a license to drive, or to own a firearm, or a certification to be an electrician, or a welder, but any idiot can have a child, regardless of how unprepared for parenthood they may be with predictable catastrophic results guaranteed; also any idiot can get a Pit Bull (or Rottweiler, Staffordshire Bulldog, Husky, German Shepherd, etc...) puppy, throw some food at it, tie it up to a tree or cable, and then wonder why it's aggressive and dangerous.
I apologize for the wordy response, but this is a subject near and dear to my heart. No, absolutely not should we ""eradicate"" Pit Bulls from existence, because they can be wonderful, fantastic, companions and protectors. My Rotties are not only pts and protectors, but are also herding animals for my cattle. But, I would wholeheartedly support a law to restrict ownership of certain breeds ONLY to persons who can either pass a certification exam, or pay to take the classes and then get certified.
There are no bad dogs at birth, my friend, they are made that way by bad (ignorant or intentionally making them aggressive) owners.

Revisiting Chernobyl,kottke.org,Tim Carmody,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://kottke.org/19/04/revisiting-chernobyl,"Revisiting Chernobyl posted by Tim Carmody Apr 05, 2019
I’ve spent the last few years fascinated by the Chernobyl disaster. This fascination partly grew out of my interest in the Flint Water Crisis, which was directly compared to Chernobyl in a story I wrote about it . (One of the things people forget is that Chernobyl poisoned the water table for a huge region.)
“ Looking Again At Chernobyl ” reviews two books: Midnight In Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World’s Greatest Nuclear Disaster , by Adam Higginbotham, and Manual For Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future , by Kate Brown.
The similarities with Flint start in the opening paragraph: Catastrophes happen when a large system gets so out of sync with its environment that a tiny tweak can crash it to the ground. It’s happened to oil rigs, spacecraft and mines. Afterward, committees blame the people who did the tweaking. But what matters is how the system became unstable and crashed, the atmosphere that caused it and the aftereffects. In these two books about the April 1986 explosion of the No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, “Midnight in Chernobyl” focuses on the first and second, “Manual for Survival” on the third.
It’s probably fair to say that we’ve spent the last thirty years acting as if we don’t live in a post-Chernobyl world.
Robert P. Crease, the reviewer, seems most taken with Higginbotham’s book:
Adam Higginbotham’s “Midnight in Chernobyl” is a gripping, miss-your-subway-stop read. The details of the disaster pile up inexorably. They include worn control rod switches, the 2,000-ton reactor lid nicknamed Elena, a core so huge that understanding its behavior was impossible. Politicians lacked the technical knowledge to take action, while scientists who had the knowledge feared to provide it lest they lose their jobs or lives…
The explosion occurs less than 100 pages into this 366-page book (plus more than 100 pages of notes, glossary, cast of characters and explanation of radiation units). But what follows is equally gripping. Radio-controlled repair bulldozers became stuck in the rubble. Exposure to radiation made voices grow high and squeaky. A dying man whispered to his nurse to step back because he was too radioactive. A workman’s radioactive shoe was the first sign in Sweden of a nuclear accident 1,000 miles upwind. Soviet bigwigs entered the area with high-tech dosimeters they didn’t know how to turn on. Investigations blamed the accident on six tweakers, portrayed them as “hooligans” and convicted them. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (Unscear), which is to radiation studies something like what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (I.P.C.C.) is to assessing human-induced climate effects, struggled to make sense of changing and confusing information.
Brown’s book is trying to do something very different, and Crease finds it correspondingly more complicated to evaluate:
Kate Brown’s “Manual for Survival” has a different style and emphasis. Its aim is to be an exposé of the attempts to minimize the impact of Chernobyl. The disaster was less an accident, says Brown, a historian at M.I.T., than “an exclamation point in a chain of toxic exposures that restructured the landscape, bodies and politics.” Unscear’s publications were cover-ups, and radiation-related maladies are “a dark horseman riding wild across the Chernobyl territories.” Brown undertook the book so as not to become “one of those duped comrades who found out too late that the survival manual contained a pack of lies.”
Around 2014, Brown began interviewing people in the affected areas, and sought measurements of radioactivity in such things as wool, livestock and swamps. Her stories are affecting, yet it is hard to evaluate memories and anecdotes. It is also hard to evaluate measurements. These are meaningful only within the tangled web of factors that radiation epidemiologists consider — including type and time-span of dose, pathways through the body, susceptibility of individual tissues and background radiation — as well as health issues like alcohol, obesity and stress.
Brown deserves credit, though, for wading into these murkier waters, because the murky waters is where we are. Part of reckoning with Chernobyl means admitting everything we don’t know. We don’t know the full health effects of the disaster. We don’t know how many people died. We don’t know how many lives were lost to neglect and cover-up. We don’t know how many could have been saved.
Part of what it means to actually live in a post-Chernobyl world is to accept that our most vital infrastructure is always threatened; that the threats it poses are always disproportionately affecting a society’s most vulnerable citizens; and that its threats are always downplayed by a society’s most powerful and directly responsible members, out of ignorance and fear.
That’s the lesson of Chernobyl. That’s the lesson of Flint. That’s the lesson of the future, which it never seems to hesitate to teach. More about..."
The History of Italics In Type,kottke.org,Tim Carmody,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://kottke.org/19/04/the-history-of-italics-in-type,"The History of Italics In Type posted by Tim Carmody Apr 05, 2019
I don’t know the author or typographer behind The Temporary State. There’s a contact address that reads “B. Tulskaya ul. 2-571, Moscow, Russia, 115191.” But Mx. Tulskaya (if that’s indeed the author) has made an outstanding pocket history of the use of italics in type , partly to defend against the fact that The Temporary State’s fonts do not use an italic typeface.
I knew, for instance, that Venetian printer Aldus Manutius is generally credited with introducing italics into European print (partly, the histories say, to imitate Latin handwriting, and partly as a space-saving device). I did not know that after other printers began to copy Manutius’s use of italics, the Venetian Senate granted Aldus exclusive right to use them.
I knew that Italian futurist poet and manifesto-writer Filippo Marinetti championed a wide range of typographic innovations; I did not know (or had forgotten) that he wished to reserve italic type for “a series of similar and swift sensations,” while bold would be used for the imitation of heavy tones, and so on. A kind of emotional functionalism in type. It is strange, how Marinetti in his call for revolution against “the Poetry Book” doesn’t see any problem with italics. Somehow, Roman numerals are an issue, but the use of highly decorative imitation of a 16th century pretty handwriting is a futuristic expression, not part of the “typographic harmony” ensemble. It is even stranger, that he doesn’t address the application of italic itself, as his idea of highlighting the page with «3-4 colors and 20 different typefaces» is very close to how the use of italic is regulated in the Chicago Manual. The only difference is: where Marinetti suggests «20 different typefaces», Chicago suggests only one — italic. So, seemingly to achieve Marinetti’s idea all that is needed is to diversify the means of text highlighting. And it’s not like there are no alternative typographic traditions, which could be used to substitute the italic.
Much of the article is devoted to this; how you can achieve the typographic effect of italics (emphasis, foreign words, titles, etc.) without using italic type. Here the examples are legion. In German blackletter, foreign words (especially in Roman languages) would be put in Roman type, while emphasized words or phrases would be in boldface. In Cyrillic printing, especially in the Soviet period, you see “sperrsatz,” or wide spacing, to denote emphasis.
Bauhaus, following the German blackletter tradition, forsook italic typesetting altogether, opting for a combination of boldface, sperrsatz, and fonts of different sizes, all of which achieve the effect of italics without the pretense of adopting an old Latin handwriting style.
Since few social media networks support bold and italic typesetting, it’s interesting to think about the range of ways users still suggest italics or the effect of italics.
There’s pseudo-Markdown, in the form of
*italics*"

Rees-Mogg is in the wrong here, the EU is not forcing the extension upon the UK, if it happens it will be because of a request by the UK. The real problem seems to be Theresa May, who promised strong and stable leadership and in two years did not prepare for the worst (a no-deal Brexit), did not create consensus for the best solution according to her, and has spent the last year or so making promises she then breaks, destroying any trust in her and her leadership, on both sides of the Channel. But guess who chose her as leader? The Conservatives, the same party Rees-Mogg is a leading figure of. It’s not the EU’s fault the UK does not have the courage, conviction or readiness to leave without a deal so the UK is not at all entitled to stay in and act in bad faith.

Mr. Rees-Mogg will probably get one more chance to significantly influence the Brexit process. That would be in case that mr Corbyn puts a motion of no confidence forward next week, which seems quite probable to me. Mrs May has meanwhile made clear that she will not allow a public vote on a possible deal supported by Labour. I think mr Corbyn is much too clever to agree with any compromise she might offer, just because of that. He would loose support of most (potential) Labour voters, mainly among the young! He will also not fall into the trap to committing on indicative votes. He will tempt her in the negotiations to divert from her position as much as possible. At the last minute, my guess is Monday morning, he will tell her that Labour could agree with what she offers, but only if it is put to a public vote. What she will have offered by then will make the right wing Conservatives very angry with as probable consequence that indicative votes, if they are held next week, will result in another government defeat. That would be the time for mr Corbyn to put forward his no confidence motion again, which might now receive the support of most ERG members, possibly rallied by mr Rees-Mogg, that at that moment so badly want another leader, that they are willing to risk new elections.

Dear friends, As a former member of the IPU, it is a pleasure to greet the 140th Assembly of the Interparliamentary Union, which comes so soon after our time together at your parliamentary hearing in New York in February. I welcome your focus in Doha on education for peace and the rule of law, and on advancing our joint efforts to counter and prevent terrorism and violent extremism. These are just some of the many challenges on which the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union enjoy fruitful cooperation. Parliaments play vital roles as defenders of democracy, agents of accountability, and crucial links between the local and the global, bringing the concerns of people into the international arena. Today we need you more than ever to help build a fair globalization, to combat rising intolerance and to advance gender equality and the representation of women in parliament. In the face of climate change, the most important systemic risk facing humankind, we need you to help increase ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance. I will convene a Climate Action Summit in September, and I count on your support. And at this time of declining trust in political establishments, parliamentarians and the United Nations have a shared duty to show that multilateralism can deliver progress and solutions. As a former parliamentarian myself, I have felt the weighty responsibility of representing people and trying to advance their aspirations. Today I am committed to ensuring a strong parliamentary voice in the work of the United Nations. Thank you for your commitment and partnership. I wish you fruitful discussions."

His Excellency President Ouattara, Her Excellency, the First Lady, Former Heads of State [there are too many to here this evening to name], Ibrahim Laureates , Honorable Ministers, Mo Ibrahim Foundation Board Members, Colleagues, friends, brothers and sisters, Future leaders of tomorrow, Dear Mo, Thank you for convening this event and giving us a reason to gather such an amazing group of leaders and young people from all corners of Africa and the world. Dear friends, I am honoured to join you here at the world-renowned Ibrahim Governance Weekend. I can think of no better way to start than with this special tribute to Kofi Annan. The film we have just seen captures Kofi in all his multifaceted glory – the diplomat, the mentor, the quietly forceful speaker, the compassionate human being. It was hard to pick from among the highlights, but I was especially struck by the young woman who said that Kofi had “opened my eyes for the first time to how far and promising the way could be for an African”. That is a standard to which we should all aspire. Mo, I know Kofi was your guest at the governance weekend two years ago, and that he contributed greatly to the work of your Foundation and Prize Committee. He was, as you said upon his passing last August, “a comrade in arms in the fight for better governance and rule of law in Africa”. Thank you for bringing us all together in his honour tonight, and for focusing this weekend on some key challenges that engaged Kofi across his life -- youth, migration and leadership. We are privileged to have Kojo Annan here with us. Dear Kojo and cherished members of the Annan family, let me express once again our condolences on your loss – which was also, so painfullly, the UN’s loss and the world’s loss. Kojo, you saw the outpouring of love and admiration last September at the memorial ceremony we held at United Nations Headquarters in New York. The General Assembly Hall was filled to capacity with people but most importantly with memories. And in the days that followed, as world leaders took the podium for the annual General Debate, leader after leader voiced their sadness at his passing, their appreciation for his achievements, and their high regard for his service to the world. Kojo, thank you for continuing to sustain Kofi’s legacy through the Kofi Annan Foundation. For the United Nations, Kofi was the right person at the right time. We all recall the turmoil of the immediate post-cold war period. But the end of the ideological rivalry between the superpowers also created a renewed sense of opportunity for what our Organization could do and be for the world’s people. Kofi grabbed the moment with gusto. He set many initiatives in motion. Understanding that governments cannot, by themselves, address today’s global challenges, he opened the doors of the United Nations to new partners, from the private sector and civil society to the academic and philanthropic communities. Strongly committed to human dignity, he supported the establishment of the International Criminal and nurtured what became the breakthrough concept of the responsibility to protect people from grave violations of human rights. And as a firm believer in multilateral action, he pushed the Organization to tackle big challenges, such as HIV/AIDS. With these steps and so much more, the United Nations became a hub of dynamism and hope, embodied by Kofi himself. And even when the international community failed or fell short, he did not hesitate to study and admit what went wrong in order to fortify the United Nations for the future. For me, if I may, Kofi was a touchstone, a guide, an inspiration as an African and as a person of the world. In a very real sense, one can draw a straight line from his tenure as Secretary-General to the role I fulfill today. The articulation of the eight Millennium Development Goals – yet another breakthrough -- occurred on Kofi’s watch, under his close direction. The Goals became a rallying point for the development community and a framework that produced tangible improvements in millions of lives. I worked on the Goals in Nigeria, including on education and other aspects. Eventually, one thing led to another, and I ended up having the privilege of serving Kofi’s successor as Secretary-General and working with Member States and people around the world to shape the 2030 Agenda, including the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Now, in my current role as Deputy to Secretary-General António Guterres, I spend my days pressing for the implementation of those goals – and I feel the spirit of Kofi looking over my shoulder and urging me on. He understood the mutually reinforcing relationship between peace, development and human rights – and the 2030 Agenda is indeed the heir of the vision that animated so much of Kofi’s work as Secretary-General. Even after his retirement from the UN, he did not finish his service to the world. He did not retire from retirement; a joke he and his dear friend Madiba laughed about amongst themselves. His expertise and deep knowledge were leveraged and deployed for meditating conflicts around the globe in Kenya, Syria and Myanmar. He spoke to young people in Zimbabwe and marched in South Africa. He went where he was needed, and everywhere he went he brought solutions. Kofi’s wisdom and counsel were sought out constantly until the very end. I have been touching on Kofi’s substantive contributions. Let me say a word about Kofi the person. He was courageous and kind, humble and humorous. It was said often that Kofi “knew everyone”, by virtue of his long career and many postings, including in human resources. Many are the staff members who can recall an unexpected telephone call asking after their well-being, or that of their family. Many are the staff members who remember meetings at which opinions were welcome from all, regardless of level. But whether or not one knew Kofi personally, a distinct bond encompassed all, forged by his awareness — unique among Secretaries-General — of staff aspirations, frustrations and responsibilities. As Secretary-General Guterres said at Kofi’s funeral in Ghana, “Kofi Annan was the United Nations and the United Nations was him”."

I leave Libya with a deep concern and a heavy heart. I still hope it will be possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli. The United Nations remain available to facilitate any political solution able to unify the Libyan institutions. Whatever happens, the UN will remain committed, and I will remain committed, to support the Libyan people. Libyans deserve peace, security, prosperity and the respect of their human rights."
Dopey Joe: We Should All Be Uncomfortable,spectator.org,Larry Thornberry,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/dopey-joe-we-should-all-be-uncomfortable/,"
My favorite Bidenism is, “When the stock market crashed, President Roosevelt got on television” and reassured the nation. Joe Biden, who was a Delaware senator then, dropped this jaw-dropper in 2008 during an interview conducted by the perky Katie (of the Arlington, Virginia Courics). For those who think I’m making this up, watch, listen and be amazed:
Recent government school graduates may be excused for committing a knee-slapper like this. But Biden is my age, so he went to school when history was still being taught. He has no excuse for not knowing that the stock market crash, which preceded the Great Depression, took place in October of 1929 when Herbert Hoover was president and television had not yet been invented.
Of late, the mainstream media, print and broadcast, have been dining out on “Creepy Joe” stories. These are centered on complaints by a series of women claiming to have been made “uncomfortable” by Biden getting into their space, smelling their hair, rubbing their shoulders, and, my favorite, rubbing a woman’s nose. The film that goes along with these stories shows Biden doing dopey (but not lascivious) things that may well have made anyone uncomfortable.
But then Joe has always been a dopey guy, doing dopey but usually harmless things you wouldn’t expect from anyone else. This is why even people who don’t agree with his politics and policies — standard left-wing talking points — still like him personally. And he certainly has his entertainment value. When he finally stops being coy and announces that he’s running, he can at the same time announce his campaign slogan: Dopey Stuff R Us.
Joe has promised to quit smelling women’s hair and kissing them without invitation, and he’ll probably stick with this because he wants to be president. (God forbid.) So women can be more comfortable that they won’t be tripping over Joe in a way they don’t like. But every Americano should be very uncomfortable with a would-be president as ignorant as Joe Biden, who flogs crack-pot left policies, and who slanders conservatives and every sensible policy.
Hair-smelling and uninvited nose-rubbing may not be the least of Joe’s sins. But they’re way down an impressive list of things American voters should be uncomfortable with when it comes to Joe Biden. It’s well past time that Joe started enjoying that generous government retirement package he’s entitled to (notice I didn’t say earned) since he’s been idling on the public payroll since before Studebaker went broke. Maybe he could spend some of his new leisure learning American history."

DELEGATION SAYS IT’S ‘HIGH TIME’
U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, and Congressman Don Young have added their support for legislation to protect states, like Alaska, that have legalized marijuana.
Sens. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) reintroduced bipartisan legislation, The Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act , to remove the threat of federal intervention and prosecution in states that regulate marijuana use and sales.
Reps. David Joyce (R-OH) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) reintroduced the STATES Act in the House.
The bill aims to ensure states’ right to determine how they want to regulate marijuana within their borders.
Murkowski said that the act balances the interests of states that want to regulate pot for recreation or medical uses, and those that do not. “It establishes that stringent state marijuana regulatory regimes, like those which exist in Alaska, have supremacy over federal drug control laws,” she said.
“At the same time, it does not impair the effectiveness of federal marijuana prohibitions in states that have elected not to legalize,” Sen. Murkowski said. “By reinforcing that the states have supremacy when it comes to marijuana regulation, we are eliminating confusion, and more importantly empowering and protecting states’ rights.”
Sullivan called it an urgent matter of states’ rights: “The STATES Act – legislation supported by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle – offers a state-based solution to areas where state and federal marijuana laws are in conflict, including issues relating to production, sale, distribution, and enforcement, and longstanding challenges surrounding banking and the lack of access to financial institutions for marijuana-related businesses.”
Congressman Don Young is the co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus and has been supporting states’ rights in cannabis policy for years, “and it is high time Congress acts to get the Federal government out of the way,” he said. “Frankly, our archaic laws urgently need to be reformed. I am proud to be cosponsoring the STATES Act because it not only helps defend states’ rights — a central promise of our Constitution — but protects the decision made by my constituents to legalize recreational marijuana in Alaska. As more states continue to reform their cannabis laws, the Federal government must keep up to provide stability to entrepreneurs, financial institutions, patients, and others. I am pleased that Alaska’s Congressional Delegation is now united on this issue, and I pledge to keep working with friends on both sides of the aisle to bring our laws into the future.”
BILL DETAILS Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) so that – as long as states and tribal nations comply with a few basic protections – its provisions no longer apply to any person acting in compliance with State or tribal laws relating to the manufacture, production, possession, distribution, dispensation, administration, or delivery of marijuana. Continues to apply the following federal criminal provisions under the CSA by prohibiting: Endangerment of human life while manufacturing a controlled substance; and Employment of persons under age 18 in marijuana operations. Prohibits the distribution of marijuana at transportation safety facilities such as rest areas and truck stops. Bars the distribution or sale of marijuana to persons under the age of 21 other than for medical purposes. Instructs the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on the effects of marijuana legalization on traffic safety, including whether states are able to accurately evaluate marijuana impairment, testing standards used by these states, and a detailed assessment of traffic incidents. Addresses financial issues caused by federal prohibition by clearly stating that compliant transactions are not trafficking and do not result in proceeds of an unlawful transaction. Contains common-sense guardrails to ensure that states, territories, and tribal nations regulating marijuana do so in a manner that is safe and respectful of the impacts on their neighbors.

UA Prez: Time to close UAA teaching programs,mustreadalaska.com,Suzanne Downing,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://mustreadalaska.com/ua-prez-time-to-close-uaa-teaching-programs/,"Latest comments Steve-O / April 5, 2019
This is an area where cuts can and should be made. If the UA system can still provide an accredited degree using university resources from other locations then this is a no brainer and should be done across the board, not just for the teaching program. Get rid of the incompetent people who allowed this program to lose accreditation, since their jobs are no longer needed at UAA. Time for UA to responsibly use the money that is given to them. Reply / Elizabeth / April 6, 2019
I agree. Consolidation makes sense and duplicate programs seem to be a waste of money. Students have so much opportunity now with distance education. Classes could still be offered at the various campuses but have only one program. Professors can travel, teleconference, live feed, podcast etc etc. I found it a bit surprising that there were three separate schools of Ed at the three main campuses and each one has its own administration, structure and credentials. Why? It is all UA. Streamline and consolidate. Reply / JMARK / April 5, 2019
Talk about a profile in cowardice. I guess we have come quite a ways from the “we will make this right” declarations of several weeks ago. I wonder what, if any, programs at UAF and UAS will be recommended for termination?
Or will ALL proposed cuts fall on UAA?
Me thinks that the Prez should start exploring his career options in the telephone industry, which was where he was working before landing at the UA. Mike Prax / April 5, 2019
You are free to assume the responsibility of providing these services if you wish. (You are also fee to encourage your friends to help you provide those services.) But the President of the University is responsible for managing public resources, so I commend him for this recommendation and encourage the Board of Regents to adopt it. JMARK / April 5, 2019
I recommend taking a look at the University President’s letter at the link provided.
The first sentence of the third paragraph of the letter does not make any sense. The words “place committed” are jibberish. Not a good performance by a university president.
Beyond that, my perception is that much of the proposed action is smoke-and-mirrors, with folks from both UAF and UAS pretending like they are teaching courses offered at those institutions but that actually happen at UAA. Frankly, if I was with an accreditation organization, I would see this for what it is — and it ain’t honest. Reply / DK / April 5, 2019
Johnson is a jerk. The UA system is suffering and needs to be overhauled with the universities being split from each other. Watch the student stampede to other states, Washington, Oregon, Idaho. Johnson has run the whole university into the ground and it will only get worse as long as he is where he is. Time for the Governor to Fire the idiot. The Legislature just approved more for the university than the cuts would show. In other words, no cuts. Reply / Elizabeth / April 6, 2019
That is one idea I had not thought about. Although it seems to me it would make more sense to stream line and consolidate programs and not duplicate, yet keep our three main campuses. Many, if not most states have multiple state university campuses. We are a ‘small big’ state and three separate unrelated universities may be too costly. Reply / Dennis in Delta / April 5, 2019
With out getting to far into the weeds, it seems like a well thought, rational solution, given the current situation. From my understanding, UAS and UAF will send teachers to Anchorage to teach the accredited programs to students in Anchorage. And viola! problem solved. The only thing in limbo that I can see are students who took unaccredited UAA classes are left holding the bag, or will UAS/UAS count those classes as credit upon transfer to UAS/UAF? Reply / Ponderer / April 6, 2019
Big steps are clearly necessary. But the data shows spending at UAF of about $32K per student. UAA is just short of $17K. UAS, without a big sports program or campus police force is even less, though relatively expensive for students to access and live off campus. Online courses help, but are not automatically more effective or cheaper without the kind of scale you get at Western Governors University or the other big online universities that invested millions in new digital capabilities over decades. So simply moving programs to UAF may take us in the wrong direction. The UA overhaul that is needed includes the attention to benchmarks Director Barnhill called out in Senate Finance, and must answer the fundamental “why” question without resorting solely to the terms “flagship” and “research.”"

Former Border Patrol agent Jason Piccolo in an interview that aired Friday on ""Rising"" called for more special agents at the southern border to target drug smugglers and human traffickers.
""It's a multifold process,"" Piccolo, who also worked as a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Hill.TV's Krystal Ball and Buck Sexton on Thursday.
""You're going to need not only to help the countries down south, but you're also going to need special agents to disrupt and dismantle the narcos smuggling and human trafficking organizations,"" he continued.
""You can't just do with reactive enforcement at the border. You need actual special agents that are going to actually go after where it hurts these organizations in their pocketbook, their money,"" Piccolo said. ""That's the only way you're going to stop the flow of smuggling.""
Piccolo's comments come as the Trump administration aims to combat what it calls a crisis at the southern border.

"U.S.-Mexico border delegation hears from immigrant women stuck in Nogales, tours border wall and Sonoran Desert",www.fightbacknews.org,Fight Back,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.fightbacknews.org/2019/4/5/us-mexico-border-delegation-hears-immigrant-women-stuck-nogales-tours-border-wall-and-sonor,"U.S.-Mexico border delegation hears from immigrant women stuck in Nogales, tours border wall and Sonoran Desert By staff | Read more articles in Immigrant Rights The Mexico side of the border wall with graffiti reading: ""no wall will detain our dreams of justice"" (Fight Back! News/staff)
Nogales, Sonora, Mexico - The second day of the Legalization for All Network delegation to the U.S.-Mexico border on March 31 was intense and emotional. The delegation divided into three groups for the day, which allowed them to gain a wider range of experiences.
One group of delegation members crossed the U.S.-Mexico border into Nogales to visit the organization HEPAC (Hogar de Esperanza y Paz - Home of Hope and Peace) and hear testimonies from women fleeing horrific situations and trying to seek asylum in the U.S. Another group accompanied the humanitarian organization Tucson Samaritans deep into the Arizona desert to leave water for immigrants walking through remote areas and to see the border wall. And another volunteered with the Inn Project, an organization in Tucson that provides support and shelter for immigrants released by ICE in Tucson.
Nogales: Two sides of an unjust wall, harrowing testimonies
The guide for the group crossing the border in Nogales was a member of the indigenous Tohono O'odham Nation, whose land is on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border and who have been harshly impacted with flagrant violations of their sovereignty by increasingly imposing border militarization. The delegation learned about the O’odham people’s struggles for sovereignty and how that is inseparable from the struggle for immigrant rights and against border militarization.
The group that crossed into Mexico went through the border crossing in Nogales, which divides Nogales, Arizona from Nogales, Mexico. Until relatively recently, this border was much more fluid, with people crossing back and forth regularly and the two cities bearing the same name more united. Now a massive inhumane wall, which the Trump administration recently garnished with razor wire on the U.S. side, cuts the two Nogales in half.
Before crossing the border, the delegation first walked along the U.S. side of the border wall. On the U.S. side of the border, the wall is sterile and imposing. When President Trump ordered the National Guard to the border in 2018, they added coils of razor wire all along the U.S. side of the wall. Border Patrol trucks are ever-present, driving around and parked near the wall, always watching. There are towers above watching with technology. The imposition of a wall in the middle of the two cities makes a deep impression.
After walking along the U.S. side of the wall, the group drove through the Nogales border crossing into Mexico. When entering Mexico there was no wait or hassle. Once across, the group walked along the Mexico side of the wall. The difference was stark.
While the U.S. side was sterile and threatening, the Mexican side had a feel of defiance. From graffiti saying things like “paz,”“chinga la migra!” and “Palestina Libre, boicot Israel” to murals painted on the wall slats, to an art installation and memorials for Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez - a young person shot to death by U.S. Border Patrol agents on the Mexico side of the wall - there was vibrance, spirit, resistance and life. And no razor wire.
After seeing the wall, the group went to visit HEPAC, an organization based in a Nogales neighborhood that does humanitarian work there and also helps people who are stuck in Nogales hoping to get to the U.S. to apply for asylum. HEPAC’s mission is “to create a healthy community in Nogales, Mexico where citizens do not feel that their only choice for survival is to risk their lives in the desert in an attempt to immigrate to the United States.” They are a nearly-all volunteer operation that provides daily meals and a playground for neighborhood kids, as well as youth and adult education classes, a community garden, a water purification system, and a women’s cooperative. In addition to these things, they provide shelter for women and children who are attempting to enter the U.S. to ask for asylum, but who are blocked by the Trump administration’s policy in violation of international law, which is blocking people in Mexico for long periods rather than allowing them to request asylum right away.
At HEPAC, the delegation met with about a dozen women and their children hoping to request asylum in the U.S. One after another, they told us their harrowing stories of what they’re fleeing in their homes in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and southern Mexico. Nearly all told of children or other family members murdered by street gangs or cartels, threats or experiences of sexual abuse, or receiving death threats themselves before deciding to run for their lives with nothing but the clothes on their backs. They also spoke of a culture of impunity where they knew reporting their situation to the government or police would either be useless or potentially crease more problems for them, since the police and government themselves are penetrated by organized crime. Hearing their stories one after another was like a repeated punch to the gut, every word piercing through Trump’s lies and mischaracterization of immigrants as a criminal threat rather than what they are - people fleeing from the poverty, violence and organized crime that has taken over their countries due to decades of U.S. government economic and military policies.
The strength of these women who are fighting for their futures and their children’s futures despite the horrors and threats both behind them and in front of them was incredibly inspiring. One woman from Honduras had traveled north with the Honduran caravan in January. After giving her emotional testimony, when asked about songs sung on the caravan, she smiled and started singing the song they sang as they walked their way through Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico - a song of strength and defiance that was punctuated with a chorus of “Fuera Joh!” This is a reference to corrupt U.S.-backed Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández (“JOH”) who is widely blamed for a culture of impunity and doing nothing to improve the unbearable situation that forces mass migration from the country. The whole room lit up and clapped along as she sang the caravan’s song of hope and defiance.
When the delegation attempted to reenter the U.S., the experience was very different than entering into Mexico. The line was hours long, and when arriving at the border, Border Patrol officers took everyone’s passports, then came back and ordered everyone out of the vehicle while being instructed to leave all cell phones in the van. Everyone was then led into a small locked jail-like waiting room with no bathrooms. Border Patrol did not explain why this was happening or how long it would go on. After a relatively short time everyone was released, but with no explanation about why they were singled out for a vehicle search.
In the desert with the Samaritans
The group that did not cross the border and accompanied the Tucson Samaritans into the desert also had an intense day. They started early in the morning on a day-long ‘border orientation’. This included seeing the border wall from the U.S. side, where a Tucson Samaritans member showed them the various phases of the border wall that were built in waves from the 1980s to the present. With each addition to the wall, immigrants seeking to cross the border are driven further into the unforgiving desert, increasing injuries, trauma and deaths.
The group also learned how Tucson Samaritans tracks the ever-changing immigrant trails through the desert to determine where to leave water so that immigrants don’t die from dehydration. In the course of their humanitarian work it is not uncommon for them to find remains of people who died trying to cross the border. The group encountered a memorial marking the spot where a immigrant had died.
The group accompanying the Tucson Samaritans had to pass through Border Patrol checkpoints well within the borders of the United States, where they were asked about their immigration status. This is the reality that people who live in southern Arizona face daily - living in a militarized zone where they have to cross through checkpoints, there are constant surveillance towers, drones and helicopters circling overhead, and where Border Patrol trucks are ever-present. The desert border orientation made clear that the effects of border militarization are not just felt in Mexico, but inside the United States as well, with immigrants dying in the unforgiving desert and whole communities living under what amounts to military occupation.
Support for immigrants who ICE dumps off in Tucson
Another delegation member spent the day in Tucson with The Inn Project, a church-based project where immigrants with children come for food, rest and other relief after being processed by ICE and approved to pursue asylum. When someone in ICE custody is approved to pursue an asylum claim, ICE simply releases that person on the streets of Tucson without any way to get in touch with anyone or get to where they need to go. This is where the Inn Project steps in, taking immigrants in and giving them support until they are able to make arrangements for a place to stay and how they will get there. This is often in another city or state. The work of The Inn Project reflects the chaotic reality of ICE detention and U.S. immigration policy overall - even immigrants who are approved to seek an asylum claim are simply left to their own devices, leaving humanitarians and activists to deal with constant urgency and crises as ICE releases people. Like most of the efforts supporting immigrants, the Inn Project is held together by volunteers and they are always in need of help.
U.S. immigration policy: Trauma and injustice
The second day of the Legalization for All border delegation was extremely impactful and exposed the raw reality of the injustice of U.S. immigration policy. This was true seeing the destructive reality of the border wall and border militarization on border communities. It was true in Nogales, Mexico, speaking with women and children being delayed or blocked from even requesting asylum in the U.S. It was true in the unforgiving Sonoran Desert in Arizona, where immigrants are forced to cross and risk death in the desert due to increased border walls and militarization in more urban areas. And it was true in Tucson, where immigrants who are allowed to pursue an asylum claim are simply dumped on the street by ICE. The second day of the delegation made an emotional impact and exposed the depth of the injustice in immigration policy. But all was not depressing. Delegation participants were also deeply inspired by the grassroots organizations doing everything they can with few resources in the face of these towering injustices to respond to this human rights catastrophe and stand up for basic human dignity and justice for people forced by circumstances to leave their countries."

News, staff)
Tampa, FL - The Tampa Bay chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) held a rally April 3 to stand against the U.S.-Mexico border wall and demand protections for immigrant students at the University of South Florida (USF). One of these protections is non-deputization of campus police to enforce immigration policy. The event featured a mock border wall, symbolizing the recent attacks on immigrants by the U.S. government.
“USF needs to stand by its undocumented and immigrant students to make its claims of diversity true. USF has to become noncompliant with federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and that, in part, means having a policy of non-deputization of USFPD,” said Tampa Bay SDS member Taylor Cook.
Members and supporters of Tampa Bay SDS were met with opposition by supporters of Trump’s border wall, as well as USF administrators, who allowed the counter-protesters to express their hate speech, including sexist slurs. However, SDS members combatted the interruption by continuing their rally and pushing their support for immigrants and undocumented students through chants.
While chanting, “Border wall, tear it down,” students were invited up to the mock wall to bring it down. The Trump supporters fell quiet as SDS members and other students united against the border wall.
“As we see attacks on immigrants around the country, USF is silent and continues to provide students’ personal information to federal agencies such as the DHS and FBI. They still do not put protective measures in place to help these students,” said Tampa Bay SDS member Will Blake.
Tampa Bay SDS continues to stand up against attacks on immigrants, as well as quiet administrators who refuse to protect their immigrant and undocumented students. Array"

Fight Back News Service is circulating the following message from Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) to the Communist Party of the Philippines.
Dear Comrades,
It has been 50 glorious years since the Communist Party of the Philippines founded the New People’s Army, and Freedom Socialist Organization sends our warmest greetings to your commanders and fighters on this significant occasion. From modest beginnings, the New People’s Army has grown into a mighty force that is establishing red political power in the countryside and carrying forward the national democratic revolution with a socialist orientation. We wish you every success. Your struggle is our struggle.
We condemn U.S imperialism for the crimes it has committed and continues carry out in the Philippines. We demand that the U.S. government end all aid to its puppet President Duterte and withdraw its troops at once.
The people’s war spearheaded by the New People’s Army, and led by the Communist Party of the Philippines, is an inspiration to progressive and revolutionary people everywhere, including in the U.S. In a world that the imperialists and their lackeys seek to dominate, the people’s war in the Philippines illuminates a road to liberation.
On this important occasion, we also take note of the critical role played by Jose Marie Sison, who took the lead in the refounding of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People’s Army. A brilliant Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Sison has made huge contributions that extend well beyond the shores of the Philippines, to the entire world revolutionary movement.
The people of the Philippines and those of the U.S. face a common enemy – the Wall Street bankers and bosses, who have bought-and-paid-for politicians in Washington DC and Manila. Every advance in the revolutionary process in the Philippines hastens the demise of our common oppressor, and we bear that in mind as we build a revolutionary movement in the U.S.
Our future is bright. Nothing can hold back our struggles for liberation and socialism. Victory is certain.
Long Iive the New People’s Army!
Long live the Communist Party of the Philippines!
Long live the unity between the people of the Philippines and the people of the U.S.! Array"

News/staff)
St. Paul, MN - On April 4, 80 people gathered at the Minnesota State Capitol building to honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and to use his words to analyze the militarism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Both MLK and NATO are connected to the date of April 4.
On April 4, 1967, Dr. King delivered his “Beyond Vietnam” anti-war speech at the Riverside Church in New York City. He would tragically be assassinated exactly one year later, on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee.
On April 4, 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed marking the inception of the military alliance known as NATO.
The program began on the capitol steps with songs by Sister Brigid McDonald, introductory words by Sue Ann Martinson and Mel Reeves, a bell ringing by Veterans for Peace, and a eulogy to Reverend King by Bishop Richard D. Howell Jr. of Shiloh Temple.
Martinson, a member of Women Against Military Madness, opened the event: “Martin Luther King called Vietnam a symptom of a deeper malady of the American spirit. Today we have another symptom, Venezuela. He predicted that we would be marching and attending rallies without end unless a significant change in American life and policy took place; now we have endless wars and in the case of Venezuela an attempted coup with a threat of war.” She added, “We are addressing two silences today, one is the silence around the ‘Beyond Vietnam’ speech and its anti-militarism, pro-peace message at formal programs about Dr. King such as they have on Martin Luther King Day. The other is the silence around the breadth and extent of U.S./NATO bases worldwide.”
Inside in the capitol rotunda the crowd heard two main presenters: University of Minnesota Professor August Nimtz on the civil rights legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., and Major (Ret.) Todd E. Pierce on NATO.
Interspersed throughout the program were readings from the “I Have a Dream” and “Beyond Vietnam” speeches by local elementary and high school students.
The event was sponsored by the Minnesota Peace Action Coalition, Veterans for Peace Chapter 27 and Women Against Military Madness. Array"

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party is leading to Sunday’s municipal elections that he has depicted as a struggle for Turkey’s survival, but may get rid of control of the capital from the vote that’s regarded as a trial of his support towards a sharp economic downturn.
Erdogan party gained 46% of the votes from the elections with more than half of the more than 194,000 ballot boxes counted, based on state broadcaster TRT. The main, secular-oriented resistance party has 30.5 percentage. Get alerts:
On the other hand, the opposition is leading from the capital, Ankara, with 49.5 percent of their votes, based on TRT, at a setback for Erdogan whose ruling party and its predecessor have held that the mayoral seat for 25 decades. Erdogan’s party seemed to be holding Istanbul although the competition’s candidate narrowed the gap. The voting was marred by election violence which killed at least four people and wounded dozens of others across Turkey. Unofficial results were expected.
Economic prosperity provided previous election victories to Erdogan and his celebration. However, the party faces the chance of losing mayoral seats in the elections occurring in hundreds of districts, 51 capitals and 30 towns as Turkey grapples with a double-digit inflation rate a diminished money and food prices.
The stakes of these contests were brought with all the deaths of two members of this Felicity Partyand also a rival of the president of the Justice and Development Party. The pioneer, Temel Karamollaoglu of felicity, alleged a polling station volunteer and a celebration observer were shot by a relative of a ruling party candidate.
The killings were not caused by”easy animosity,” but happened as soon as the volunteers attempted to enforce the law requiring ballots to be indicated privately voting booths instead of out in the open,” Karamollaoglu tweeted.
Speaking to reporters afterwards he voted, Erdogan stated that he was unhappy about the deaths and did not need them to turn into a reason for”a coughing or a judgment involving political parties.” Two individuals were killed in fighting in the southern town of Gaziantep.
Fights related to elections in a number of provinces also produced dozens of injuries reported. At least 21 people were hurt from brawls within the election of local administrators in Diyarbakir province, Anadolu stated.
The precise causes of these conflicts remained cloudy. Election campaigning was highly polarized, with officers and Erdogan utilizing rhetoric.
Sunday’s elections have been also an first test for Erdogan because he won re-election below a system of government that gave the presidency expanded powers.
Erdogan’s ruling party has renewed a alliance with the country’s nationalist party to increase votes. Opposition parties also coordinated strategies and put candidates forward under alliances in a bid to maximize the chances of unseating members of the Justice and Development Party, known in Turkish from the acronym AKP.
Ankara was considered their race’s principal battleground and opinion polls indicated the candidate Mansur Yavas, of the opposition alliance, could finish AKP and its predecessor’s principle.
Mehmet Ozhaseki, A government environment ministry, conducted under the banner of Erdogan and his allies. The ruling party accused his opponent Yavas of forgery and tax evasion. Yavas says he’s the victim of a work effort.
Another closely watched mayoral election is currently in Istanbul.
Erdogan appointed former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to operate against opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu in the Istanbul mayor’s race.
Before the elections, Erdogan campaigned tirelessly for AKP’s applicants, framing the elections happening across Turkey as issues of”national survival” In addition, he depicted the economic woes of the country as strikes by enemies overseas as well as at home.
Gonul Ay, 38, said she voted for Yildirim and the ruling party in Istanbul because of his experience.
“I searched for the AKP for continuity and so that their services persist,” the homemaker said. “God willing, this catastrophe and chaos is going to be fixed and we’ll see healthy, happier days”
Volkan Duzgun, 32, said he voted for opposition candidate Imamoglu.
Erdogan’s party has threatened to not accept election results when pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party candidates who have terror connections triumph.
From the pro-Kurdish party in nearly 100 municipalities, elected mayors have been substituted by Erdogan’s government since 2016, alleging the officials had connections to Kurdish militants and installing in their location government-appointed trustees.
The pro-Kurdish party is seeking to win back the offices. However, it strategically sat out critical races in important cities, including Istanbul and Ankara.
Since the previous elections in 2014, Turkish citizens have gone to the polls in five unique elections. In last year’s presidential and parliamentary elections, Erdogan garnered 52.6 percent of the votes along with his party and its civic ally won 53.7% of the parliamentary vote.

Proposed Hong Kong extradition law changes spark concerns,www.dailypolitical.com,Jeff Wilder,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/05/proposed-hong-kong-extradition-law-changes-spark-concerns.html,"DIMCOIN (DIM) Achieves Market Capitalization of $2.39 Million Proposed Hong Kong extradition law changes spark concerns Proposed Hong Kong extradition law changes spark concerns - Filed Under - by Jeff Wilder
Business and human rights groups are expressing concern over unjust prosecution and changes to the extradition law that would allow suspects to be routed to mainland China of Hong Kong, where they might be subject to torture.
They say the move could damage the appeal of the Asian financial hub . Get alerts:
Such extraditions are currently limited by hong Kong to authorities with which it has extradition agreements that are existing or to other people on an individual basis under a law passed before the semi-autonomous territory’s handover to Chinese rule in 1997. China was excluded due to concerns over its poor record on liberty and individual rights. However, adjustments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal aid in Criminal Matters Ordinance would enlarge the scope to the transfer of suspects into China and remove the right to scrutinize individual extradition decisions registered by the chief executive of Hong Kong of the legislature.
Countless members of the beleaguered pro-democracy camp of the city marched on Sunday afternoon.
“The number of people turning speaks loads about the worries of Hong Kong people,” Alan Leong, chairman of the Hong Kong Civic Party, told participants.
Police put the number of participants although participants stated at least.
In a statement issued Sunday, Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, stated,”These changes would increase the danger of human rights activists and other people critical of China being extradited to the mainland for further research on fabricated charges”
“The amendments would tarnish Hong Kong’s reputation for the principle of law, and ought to be scrapped,” Richardson said, adding that the legal modifications could place Hong Kong individuals”at risk of torture and unfair trials”
These concerns were reflected in a letter to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam written by Human Rights Watch in Addition to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor and also the local branch of Amnesty International.
The groups warned that fear of extradition to China — which routinely uses trumped-up rates of tax evasion or other economic crimes to penalize political leaders — could stifle civil society and freedom of speech in Hong Kong, in which civil liberties are already under attack from pro-Beijing groups. Many people linked using a Hong Kong publishing house that made novels also have emerged in Chinese police custody after being abducted, together with a prominent business person.
Contrary to China, Hong Kong is subject to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as”customary global law,” which”prohibit returning individuals to places where there is a real risk of torture and other ill-treatment, unfair trials, and other severe human rights violations,” the letter said.
Separately, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong issued a letter stating its members”continue to have serious concerns” about the planned changes, saying that they would”reduce the allure of Hong Kong to global companies contemplating Hong Kong as a base for regional operations”
“Hong Kong’s global reputation for its rule of law is its own priceless treasure,” said the letter.
