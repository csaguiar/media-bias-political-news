Iran mulls plans to build naval port in Syria,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iran-mulls-plans-to-build-naval-port-in-syria.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

The Islamic Republic of Iran was allegedly invited by the Russian Federation to setup a fortified base at the Hmeimim Airport and another in the port-city of Tartous , professor Sami Moubayed , a prominent Syrian historian, wrote in the Asia Times on Friday.
According to Moubayed, the Russian tenure at the Hmeimim Airport is open-ended, with many of the neighborhoods near the installation have already been leased by Iran.
This may cause a problem for the Russians because the Iranian presence near their airport may encourage the jihadist rebels to attack the area.
Furthermore, an Iranian port on the Mediterranean may prompt Israel to step up their attacks in Syria, especially with Lebanon being so close to the Syrian coast.
“A permanent Iranian presence in Latakia could limit and possibly obstruct Russian surveillance and intelligence gathering, jam their radio-electronic technology, and jeopardize Russian air-defenses, aircraft, and the lives of military personnel,” Moubayed said.
The possibility of an Iranian naval base in Latakia seems may possess merit, as the Islamic Republic reportedly sent an official request to the Syrian government last February.
As mentioned above, Iran’s presence on the Mediterranean may increase tensions with Israel, but it may also provide a solution to the ongoing U.S. sanctions, which have prevented the Islamic Republic from accessing this sea.
“Everyone wants a Silk Road nowadays, and ports are a good place to start,” professor Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma told the Asia Times.
“Iran dreams of building a strong regional economy based on trade, highways and pipelines that cross from Iran to the Mediterranean. Helping to build up Syrian ports is only one element in a much larger vision of prosperity and shared interests. Most important will be the day that Iran can sell its oil and gas to Europe by transporting across Iraq and Syria,” Landis added.
Iran has yet to issue an official statement regarding this alleged move.

Fake News After Mueller—Not Even Fake Apologies For The Collusion Hoax,www.therussophile.org,David Stockman,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/fake-news-after-mueller-not-even-fake-apologies-for-the-collusion-hoax.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Allow me to start with a question: Has anyone seen any of the main newspapers and networks who went after Donald Trump for 3 years accusing him of colluding with “the Russians”, apologize to either Trump, or to their readers and viewers, for spreading all that fake news now that Robert Mueller said none of that stuff was real, that they all just made it up?"

ANOSINO /near Moscow/, April 6. /TASS/. Amendments to Russia’s constitution are generally possible but there is no need for them at present, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has told reporters.
Medvedev was asked to comment on State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin’s proposal saying that the lower house of Russia’s parliament should take part in the process of forming the cabinet, which demands amending the Constitution.
“I want to underscore that neither corrections nor fundamental changes in the current constitution, which I said about in the article on the 25th anniversary of the constitution, are needed,” Medvedev said. “The constitution is an instrument designated for the long term in conditions of a sustainably developing country,” he added.
“Nonetheless, both society and the political system are developing which might arouse questions about re-adjusting the functioning of certain power institutions. It is absolutely normal,” he believes.

“The Moscow-Tokyo flight was evacuated after an anonymous bomb threat,” he said. “The threat came from Ukrainian radicals. All the required measures have been taken,” he said.
TASS was told at Domodedovo that the airport had been put on a higher security alert.
“Standard security procedures are envisioned in case of anonymous threats. This incident was not an exception. After the information came, additional measures have been taken along with law enforcement agencies to ensure security,” the press service said.

Former South Carolina Sen. Ernest ‘Fritz’ Hollings Dies at 97,www.therussophile.org,MEG KINNARD The Associated Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/former-south-carolina-sen-ernest-fritz-hollings-dies-at-97.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
COLUMBIA, S.C.—Ernest F. “Fritz” Hollings, the silver-haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U.S. Senate, died early Saturday. He was 97.
Hollings, whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, retired from the Senate in 2005, one of the last of the larger-than-life Democrats who once dominated politics in the South.
He had served 38 years and two months, making him the eighth longest-serving senator in U.S. history.
Nevertheless, Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term. The senior senator was Strom Thurmond, first elected in 1954. He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest-serving senator in history.
In his final Senate speech in 2004, Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election, calling money “the main culprit, the cancer on the body politic.”
“We don’t have time for each other, we don’t have time for constituents except for the givers. … We’re in real, real trouble.”
Hollings was a sharp-tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate, but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped.
He sometimes blamed that failure on his background, rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation.
However, South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s.
Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958. He built a national reputation as a moderate when, in his farewell address as governor, he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University.
“This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina’s choice, a government of laws rather than a government of men,” he told lawmakers. Shortly afterward, Clemson was peacefully integrated.
In his 2008 autobiography, “Making Government Work,” Hollings wrote that in the 1950s “no issue dominated South Carolina more than race” and that he worked for a balanced approach.
“I was ‘Mister-In-Between. The governor had to appear to be in charge; yet the realities were not on his side,” he wrote. “I returned to my basic precept … the safety of the people is the supreme law. I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed.”
In the Senate, Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers. He chaired the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees.
But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble. He once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the “senator from the B’nai B’rith” and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-California, as “wetbacks.”
Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Early in his Senate career, he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina, one of the poorest states in the union.
Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam, but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory.
Hollings, who made three trips to the war zone, said he learned a lesson there.
“It’s a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time,” he wrote in his autobiography, warning that America is now “repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq.”
Despite his changed views, Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government.
In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities, helping lay the groundwork for the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, feeding program.
A year later, his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book “The Case Against Hunger.”
In 1982, Hollings proposed an across-the-board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit, a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid.
He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act. Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm-Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget.
Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq.
In his later years, port security was one of his main concerns.
As he prepared to leave office, he told The Associated Press: “People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment. I never, ever lived that way. … I’m not trying to get remembered.”
He kept busy after the Senate helping the Medical University of South Carolina raise money for the cancer center which bears his name and lecturing at the new Charleston School of Law.
Hollings’ one political defeat came in 1962 when he lost in a primary to Sen. Olin Johnston. After Johnston died, Hollings won a special election in 1966 and went to the Senate at age 44, winning the first of his six full terms two years later.
Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on Jan. 1, 1922. His father was a paper products dealer but the family business went broke during the Depression.
Hollings graduated from The Citadel, the state’s military college in Charleston, in 1942. He immediately entered the Army and was decorated for his service during World War II. Back home, he earned a law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1947.
The next year, he was elected to the state House at age 26. He was elected lieutenant governor six years later and governor in 1958 at age 36.
As governor, he actively lured business, helped balance the budget for the first time since Reconstruction and improved public education.

Mourners bid farewell to veteran actor Mashayekhi,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/mourners-bid-farewell-to-veteran-actor-mashayekhi.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Iran has bid farewell to Jamshid Mashayekhi, one of its most renowned movie stars who died on April 03 at the age of 85.
Thousands of people from every walk of life attended a mass funeral in the capital Tehran to pay homage to the celebrated actor. Mashayekhi began his career in theater in 1957. During his six-decade-long career, he acted in nearly a hundred films and some sixty TV series.
Mashayekhi rose to fame in 1980s when he played several lead roles, including famous Iranian painter Kamal-ol-Molk in a feature film and Reza the gunman in highly popular TV series Hezar Dastan. He won the best-actor award for Kamal-ol-Molk from Iran’s International Fajr Film Festival in 1985.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran and Iraq are keen to expand their cooperation in the fight against terrorism and smuggling while seeking stronger ties in the power, gas and oil sectors.
“Border cooperation to fight terrorism, narcotics and smuggling will become stronger between the two countries,” Rouhani said at a joint press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi in Tehran on Saturday.
He added that Iran was ready to continue the export of electricity, gas and oil to Iraq.
He emphasized that Tehran and Baghdad had managed to take good steps in recent months towards the expansion of financial and banking relations and hoped that both sides would further boost ties in this regard during an upcoming visit by the governor of the Central Bank of Iran, Abdolnaser Hemmati, to Baghdad.
“We have plans to expand trade volume between the two countries to $20 billion in the future and we hope that we will reach this point within the next few months or years,” Rouhani said.
He also expressed hope that work on building a railway linking the two countries would begin soon.
In March, the United States granted Iraq a 90-day waiver for the second time to let Baghdad continue energy imports from Iran which is under US sanctions.
“While this waiver is intended to help Iraq mitigate energy shortages, we continue to discuss our Iran-related sanctions with our partners in Iraq,” a State Department official was quoted as saying on March 20.
The administration of US President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran in November, months after he withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers, but has granted waivers to several buyers, including Iraq, to meet consumer energy needs. The sanctions had been lifted against Iran as part of the nuclear deal.
Elsewhere in the presser, the Iranian president hailed deep-rooted and growing relations between the two countries and expressed hope that visa-free travel for both nations would lead to further expansion of relations.
Back in March, senior officials of the two countries signed five memoranda of understanding for the expansion of bilateral cooperation in various economic and healthcare sectors in Baghdad during a visit by Rouhani to Baghdad.
The two sides agreed on the construction of a railroad link between the Iranian city of Shalamcheh and the Iraqi city of Basra as well as visa facilitation for investors and businessmen. According to the visa agreement, starting in early April 2019, the two countries will issue visas to each other’s nationals free of charge.
Iran plays leading role in Iraq’s peace, stability: Abdul-Mahdi
The Iraqi prime minister, for his part, said Iran had played a leading role in the fight against terrorism and the promotion of peace and stability in Iraq and called for further development of mutual relations.
Abdul-Mahdi added that enhanced economic, security, trade and oil cooperation would lead to good achievements not only for Iran and Iraq but also for the entire world.
He stressed the importance of promoting peace in the Middle East and solving the Yemeni crisis through political means and said Iraq was firm to counter any threat by any country against Iran.

East Jerusalem al-Quds permanent capital of Palestine: Rouhani
Meanwhile, addressing a joint meeting between the high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi delegations, Rouhani said Iran regarded East Jerusalem al-Quds as the permanent capital of Palestine.
“We consider any move which would run counter to this as in contravention of history and regulations of the United Nations and condemn it,” the Iranian president added.
Undoubtedly, the Golan Heights is part of the Syrian soil which has been occupied by the usurpers and nothing can distort this historical fact, he pointed out.
Back in December 2017, Trump officially declared the disputed city of Jerusalem al-Quds as Israel’s capital , despite warnings from around the world that the measure risks triggering a fresh wave of violence in the Middle East.
In May 2018, the United States officially announced the opening of its new embassy in Jerusalem al-Quds , despite warnings from around the world that the measure risked triggering a fresh wave of violence in the Middle East.
In March, Trump formally recognized Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, a border area the Tel Aviv regime seized from Syria in 1967.
In March, President Trump formally recognized Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, a border area the Tel Aviv regime seized from Syria in 1967.
“This was a long time in the making. Should have taken place decades ago,” Trump said while signing a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian territory.
Elsewhere in his remarks in the meeting of the high-ranking delegations, Rouhani said the development of Tehran-Baghdad ties in the fields of electricity, energy and railway would serve the two nations’ interests and added, “We should make plans for the expansion of preferential tariffs and free trade between Iran and Iraq.”
He also expressed Iran’s readiness to share its experience with Iraq in technical and engineering services, including the construction of houses, power plants and dams.

Biden: 'I'm not sorry for anything that I have ever done',www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/biden-im-not-sorry-for-anything-that-i-have-ever-done.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Former US Vice President Joe Biden has said that he’s not sorry for his past actions that some women have said were inappropriate, as the potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate faces a growing crisis.
“The fact of the matter is I made it clear that if I made anyone feel [uncomfortable], I feel badly about that. It was never my intention. Ever,” Biden said on Friday, a day after three more women accused Biden of inappropriate touching.
Asked again if he was sorry for his actions, Biden refused to apologize for his actions.
“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more,” Biden told reporters. “I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman. So that’s not the reputation I’ve had since I was in high school, for God’s sake.”
The additional allegations were reported by The Washington Post on Thursday, bringing the total number of women who have brought forward complaints about Biden since last week to seven.
Biden released a video on Wednesday, promising to be more “mindful and respectful” of women and said his touching was all about making a “human connection.”
“It’s just who I am,” Biden says in the video posted on Twitter. “I’ve never thought of politics as cold or antiseptic.”
But he says he understands the culture in the US has shifted and so should his behavior. “I get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying. I understand,” Biden says. “I’ll be much more mindful.”
The string of accusations began after Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada state Legislature, accused Biden of “demeaning and disrespectful” behavior when he allegedly kissed the back of her head.
The accusations have prompted some Democrats to question whether the 76-year-old is too out of step with his own party to run a successful 2020 presidential campaign.
Biden has a reputation for awkwardly touching the wives, mothers or daughters of senators during swearing-in ceremonies, and he came under criticism for massaging the shoulders of then defense secretary Ash Carter’s wife in 2015.
On Friday Biden told reporters that he did not intend to “make light of anyone’s discomfort.”
“It was not my intent to make light of anyone’s discomfort,” Biden said after the speech. “I realize my responsibility is to not invade the space of anyone who is uncomfortable.”
Biden has long been touted as a serious rival for President Donald Trump in the upcoming vote, but the touching allegations have seriously undermined his chances to run a forceful presidential campaign.
Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct by several women, has taunted Biden repeatedly in recent days. On Thursday he shared a doctored video that mocked Biden over the allegations.
On Friday, Trump said he doesn’t view Biden as a threat to his reelection chances.
“I don’t see him as a threat,” Trump told reporters. “I think he’s only a threat to himself.”

Libya’s Haftar forces say they have been targeted by airstrike south of Tripoli,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/libyas-haftar-forces-say-they-have-been-targeted-by-airstrike-south-of-tripoli.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Forces of the so-called Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Libya’s strongman Khalifa Haftar, say they have been targeted by an airstrike south of Tripoli, as they are pushing forward to seize the capital, where the internationally-recognized government is based.
The North African country has been divided between two rival governments, the House of Representatives, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, and the internationally-recognized government of Fayez al-Sarraj, or the Tripoli-based unity Government of National Accord (GNA). Haftar is presumably loyal to the one in the east.
The eastern forces, led by Haftar, have launched an offensive to capture the capital and oust the GNA, an internationally-condemned move that would bring the conflict to a potentially dangerous new phase and a possible civil war.
The LNA media office said in a statement on Saturday that a military plane, reportedly taken off from the city of Misrata, conducted the airstrike “in the al-Aziziya region,” some 50 kilometers south of Tripoli. Forces in Misrata are mostly loyal to the GNA.
“We strongly condemn the air raid,” said the statement.

Meanwhile, forces loyal to the GNA arrived in Tajura, a coastal suburb of Tripoli, from their base in Misrata.
On Thursday, the eastern forces fully seized Gharyan town, located about 100 kilometers south of Tripoli, and on Friday they captured the former Tripoli International Airport.
Earlier Friday, forces allied to the GNA had pushed back Haftar’s forces from a key checkpoint less than 30 kilometers from Tripoli.
The United Nations has already voiced its deep concern regarding the outcome of the soaring conflicts for the African nation, strongly urging Haftar to halt his forces’ advancement toward the capital.
UN insists to hold national conference
Additionally on Saturday, the UN said that it was determined to hold Libya’s national conference on possible elections on time despite the current surge of fighting.
The world body aims to hold a conference in the southwestern town of Ghadames on April 14-16 to weigh elections as a way out of Libya’s factional anarchy.
“We know that holding the conference in this difficult time of escalation and fighting is a difficult matter. But we are determined to hold it on time unless compelling circumstances force us not to,” said Ghassan Salame, a senior UN envoy, in a press conference in Tripoli.
Furthermore, the G7 foreign ministers on Saturday warned Haftar to desist from his thrust on the capital, threatening the GNA there, or face possible international action.
Libya has been the scene of increasing violence since 2011, when former dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled from power after an uprising and a NATO military intervention.
His ouster created a huge power vacuum, leading to chaos and the emergence of numerous militant outfits, including the Takfiri Daesh terrorist group.

Russiagate: A Moral Reckoning is Due,www.therussophile.org,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russiagate-a-moral-reckoning-is-due.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Renee Parsons
With Russiagate, the Democrats created some powerful karma to answer for; especially for the likes of Rep. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, (D-Calif.), both of whom persist in the mindless search for the Holy Grail. After cheating Bernie out of the nomination in 2016, the Dems had not yet learned their karmic lesson when they lost the Presidential election. The Mueller Report is but the latest of that karmic reckoning.
There is no pride in being one of those who “got it right” that there was no evidence, not a scintilla of material fact to prove collusion between the Trump campaign and the dastardly Russians. As the country has been torn asunder by a two year politically tainted investigation begun with no evidentiary standard and no probable cause, there is little satisfaction to be gained.
That being said, I am royally pissed off at all the players who supported this unprecedented farce as an attack on the country’s rule of law. How could the autocratic digital giants, the intel community (which missed 911), the already discredited MSM and the pathetically trivial Democratic party think they could get away with lie after lie? Because they counted on the Democratic rank n file and other hypnotized Americans to believe anything they are told – repeat a lie often enough and the masses will own it.
The determination of no new indictments and no collusion is little cause for celebration in that the country should not have had to endure the extended anguish of an insistent, irrational, near-hysterical drumbeat generated by the MSM and Democrats as co-conspirators. It is fair to say that all participants were consciously aware that they were repeatedly lying to the American public just as it is highly probable that Special Counsel Robert Mueller who was appointed in May, 2017 knew well before the 2018 mid-term elections that allegations of collusion and obstruction were unsubstantiated.
Now that the Report into the Investigation on Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election has been delivered, all can rest assured that the American system of government works, that the checks and balances did their job and that American democracy survived another close call.
As a result of the hyperventilating hubris, the word ‘collusion’ has now become an empowered part of the lexicon. There is now an implicit warning for any candidate, or indeed any citizen, to be wary with whom they speak, be wary of their associations, to not fraternize with just anyone and to be ultra sensitized to meeting with any potential adversary, even in the legitimate interests of diplomacy.
In addition, without the political will to do so, there will be little initiative for PTB (powers that be) to undo the new generation of intense political repression and censorship initiated by Russiagate that can be traced directly to HRC’s loss in 2016.
Two weeks after that election, the Washington Post, long believed to be a CIA asset, combined allegations that Russia exploited American online platforms “critical of the US government” with the now discredited creation of ‘fake news’ that 200 American websites were “peddlers of Russian propaganda.”
As Attorney General William Barr quotes from the Mueller Report :
The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors had successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations and publicly dessiminated those materials throughout various intermediaries including Wikileaks.”
This statement is in direct contradiction with Bill Binney , former NSA Technical Director for Analysis and co-founder of NSA’s Signal Intel Center who conducted independent forensic research. Binney concluded that the data was ‘leaked by a person with physical access to the DNC computer” and that the “DNC data was downloaded to a storage device and transported to Wikileaks, like on a thumb drive or cd rom.”
While neither Mueller, any Congressional committee nor the FBI ever contacted Binney regarding his findings, the DNC refused to turn over their computer to the FBI for forensic testing. After the full Mueller report is publicly available, Binney’s feedback promises to be enlightening.
As some Democrats and MSM continue to spin the illusion of a pending obstruction of justice charge, Barr’s letter relying on the Mueller Report is clear – the “Report identifies no actions that constitute obstructive conduct” and that ‘evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime,” therefore, there is no proof ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ that obstruction occurred. Legalese 101 says that obstruction cannot be alleged if no crime was committed but when did proof or evidence ever make a difference to the co-conspirators. Review of the Mueller Report itself will provide further details.
It was the unverified Steele dossier that provided the FBI with the basis for its submission to the FISA Court that Russian collusion had occurred and in order to obtain the necessary warrants (four of them) to spy on the Trump campaign; specifically US Naval Academy graduate, the hapless Carter Page. Prior to its FISA Court submission, the FBI knew that the Dossier was a bogus document. We know that the HRC campaign and the DNC funded Fusion GPS firm to get the dirt on Trump. Fusion then brought in Christopher Steele who put together a salacious piece of garbage that the FBI took and ran with.
The dossier was then circulated by Obama CIA Director John Brennan and publicly released by BuzzFeed and CNN in January, 2017. Former Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper provided ‘inconsistent information’ to the House Intelligence Committee that he “flatly denied” any media discussions regarding the dossier and then “subsequently acknowledged discussing the dossier with CNN’s Jake Tapper” and perhaps others.
CNN (Tapper, Carl Bernstein, Evan Perez and Jim Sciutto) went on to win White House Correspondents Association’s 2018 Merriman Smith Award for outstanding reporting with the Judges noting that the “depth of reporting demonstrated in these remarkable and important pieces, and the constant updates as new information continued to be uncovered showed breaking news reporting at its best.” The WHCA gathers annually to “celebrate the First Amendment and the crucial role of journalism in informing and protecting the public.” BuzzFeed, which broke the original story, did not share in the $2500 award.
In reality, the award apparently struck other WHCA members as unusual, considering the entire story took little actual reporting and instead relied on leaks from Brennan and Clapper.
There should be enough shame to go around but there appears to be no evidence of a conscience or the need to pay a karmic debt among any of the perpetrators.
In the aftermath of Mueller, Judicial Watch has filed an FOIA suit to obtain the records of communication between Brennen, Clapper and CNN including all documents related to the dossier.
In a September, 2016 text message from FBI attorney Lisa Page to Peter Strock, she relates the preparation of talking points to brief FBI Director Jim Comey on the efforts to bring down Trump. In that same message, Page adds that “POTUS wants to know everything we are doing.”
The question arises whether the usual mealy-mouth Republican establishment and a previously compromised FISA Court will step up and better protect the Constitution than they have in the past?

The Libyan Nation Army (LNA) reached the outskirt of the country’s capital, Tripoli, on April 6 after imposing control of the towns of al-Zahra, al-Sa’adiyah and Ayn Zarah, according to the UAE-based Sky News Arabia TV. Click to see full-size map
LNA units are currently stationed 10km south of Tripoli’s city center. The army launched Operation Flood of Dignity two days ago to liberate the city from the Libyan Government of National Accord (LGNA) and its militants.
A day earlier, the LNA captured the Tripoli International Airport following fierce clashes with pro-LGNA forces. In order to stop the army’s attack, the LGNA air force begin conducting airstrikes on LNA gatherings.
Pro-LNA sources said that one of the airstrikes killed four civilians in the town of al-Aziziyah. In response to this crime, the LNA imposed a no-fly zone over the western part of the country and threatened the LGNA with a strict response if the airstrikes continue.
“Our response will be very harsh on these terrorists in order to insure the protection of civilians,” a short press released by the LNA media office reads.
The LNA will not likely storm the city center of Tripoli before securing its new positions in its outskirt. This could take few days, if not weeks.

Written by Finian Cunningham ; Originally appeared on strategic-culture.org
Kurdish fighters have been used by the US to ostensibly defeat the remaining Islamic State holdouts in eastern Syria. But what is emerging is not a final defeat of the terrorists, more a redeployment to further destabilize the Arab country.
Potentially, the Kurds could wind up not with the regional autonomy they desire, but as part of a rebranded American dirty war army whose ranks include the very terrorist the Kurdish militias have been successfully battling against.
President Donald Trump has been lately crowing about how US-backed Kurdish forces have wiped out the IS self-proclaimed caliphate around Baghouz in eastern Syria. “They’re losers… they’re gone tonight,” he boasted about supposedly vanquishing the jihadists.
However, things are not that clear-cut. Syria’s envoy to the United Nations Bashar al Jaafari dismissed Trump’s victory celebrations as a “bluff”. He said that IS was not defeated in areas under US control, but rather were being shunted off to various camps for retraining.
There are credible reports that thousands of jihadists who surrendered or were captured in the fighting around Baghouz have since been relocated by US forces to its military base at al Tanf near the border with Iraq and Jordan, as well as to nearby refugee camps such as Rukban, where some 40,000 detainees are held. Suspiciously, the Americans are refusing international access to these camps, even for UN humanitarian relief agencies. As Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pointed out recently, the detention centers are being used by the Americans as a pretext for illegally occupying Syrian territory.
We can also add the purpose of clandestine military recruitment for US proxies.
Despite Trump’s announcement four months ago that US military was pulling out of Syria, there seems no sign that his plan is being implemented. That’s why Moscow reacted angrily to Washington’s demand for Russian troops to leave Venezuela. The Kremlin responded testily that the US should first deliver on its promise to withdraw from Syria, where its forces are illegally present unlike Russian personnel in Venezuela under bilateral agreement.
In Syria’s supposedly post-war scenario what seems to be happening is the US seeking to find a way to reconfigure its destabilizing intervention in the Arab country. The past eight years of US-sponsored covert war has failed in its objective for regime change against President Bashar al Assad, who is allied with Russia and Iran. What the US is aiming to do now is keep military footprints in the country, effectively annexing swathes of territory, especially in the oil and gas-rich eastern region around the Euphrates River.
That accounts for why supposedly defeated enemy terrorists are being retrained by US special forces at al Tanf. They are reportedly being tasked with capturing the oil and gas fields in Deir ez-Zor province as well as production infrastructure in Homs province.
This puts the Kurdish forces in an invidious position. There is little doubting the courage and fighting ability of the Kurdish men and women who make up the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and its spearhead YPG militias. The Kurds have managed to liberate up to 30 per cent of Syria’s territory in the northeast and east from the IS jihadists. They have dealt a decisive blow to the residual caliphate at Baghouz. American air power augmented the Kurds in their offensive.
But what the US is maneuvering to do is to combine the defeated jihadists with the Kurds in order to push its agenda for breaking up Syria and controlling its eastern mineral-rich resources.
The Special Monitoring Mission to Syria reports that IS militants captured by the SDF are being redeployed by the Americans for seizing oil and gas production facilities.
Still another crucial objective for Washington is to control the Deir ez-Zor east-west corridor from Iraq to Damascus so as to contain Iranian presence in Syria.
This is the context for Trump’s brazen declaration recognizing Israel’s annexation of Syria’s southern Golan Heights. Washington’s game plan is to keep Syria destabilized and fragmented, partly to appease Israel and partly for the US’s own imperial designs for dominance in the region.
In this insidious US maneuvering, the Kurds face a potentially treacherous situation. They have been well armed and supported by Washington, but are finding they are being used like a disposable asset. The Kurds may have calculated that accepting Washington’s patronage in recent years was a way to earn political capital for building a future separate independent Kurdish state. What seems to be emerging, however, is that the Americans only intend to exploit the Kurds as a fighting force to do its dirty work of breaking up Syria – in the same way that the Americans have covertly used jihadist terror groups in other parts of Syria.
The Kurds have been very effective in routing IS in the latter’s remaining strongholds in eastern Syria. But the result is the Kurds are being used as a recruitment agency for the Americans to redeploy the “defeated” terrorists in its ongoing covert war against the Syrian state.
There are signs, though, that the Kurds are well aware of the treacherous danger in dealing with Washington. When Trump made is troop withdrawal announcement, there were palpable concerns among the Kurds about being betrayed to the mercy of Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to send his military forces into Syria to crush the SDF and YPG militia whom Ankara views as “terrorist” affiliates of its own separatist Kurdish movement, the PKK.
It’s not clear if the US will implement a withdrawal of its estimated 2,000 troops in Syria. There are indications it won’t happen, despite Trump’s claims. Nevertheless, the surprise announcement was enough to undermine Kurdish confidence its patron. With the result that Kurdish leaders have begun reaching out to the Assad government in Damascus in the hope of dialogue producing a future federal arrangement.
The Kurds have reportedly requested Russia to mediate with the Syrian government.
Kurdish forces have not heretofore been at war with the Syrian Arab Army. They share the same common enemy of IS and assorted jihadist terror groups.
In the past, President Assad has rebuffed Kurdish aspirations for regional autonomy. But apparently, Damascus has shifted to be more open on forming a new federal constitution for Syria in which the Kurds would gain important regional independence – in a way analogous to the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq.
In this fateful political triangle that the Syrian Kurds find themselves, they would be advised to throw their lot in with the Damascus government. If a mutual pact could be established that would bring the two major chunks of Syria’s territory back into territorial integrity.
If, on other hand, the Kurds accede to Washington’s nefarious agenda, they run the risk of losing independence and being eviscerated from exploitation in endless dirty-war machinations by the Americans. An ominous sign is that after bravely fighting to rout IS, the Kurdish militia are being set up to form a devil’s bargain with the same terrorists – to satisfy Washington’s geopolitical interests.
The Kurds would do well to remember a cynical maxim in Washington, whereby the US “does not have allies, only interests”.

On April 6, one civilian was killed in a rocket attack on the government-held part of the northern Hama countryside. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said that the attack targeted the towns of al-Karim, al- Aziziyah and al-Rasif.
No group has announced its responsibility for the attack so far. However, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its radical allies are known for conducting such attacks on a daily basis.
The SANA said that the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) responded to the attack by striking militants’ hideouts and vehicles in the towns of Jarjnaz, al-Tamanah, Kafr Nabl and Tramla in the southern Idlib countryside

According to pro-opposition sources, the SAA carried out its attack with the BM-27 Uragan and BM-30 Smerch heavy rocket launchers. The BM-27 has a range of 37km, while the more advance BM-30 can hit targets 90km away. Both systems can launch cluster rockets armed with anti-tank munitions.
The situation around Idlib could escalate further in the upcoming few hours. Russian warplanes may carry out a new wave of airstrikes to deter the militants, similar to what happened a day earlier .

"Iran launched a Shahab-3 ballistic missile, by Danny Danon",www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iran-launched-a-shahab-3-ballistic-missile-by-danny-danon.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L150xH113/arton205959-9edaf.jpg
I write to inform you, yet again, of another clear and alarming violation of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) by the Iranian regime in the domain of ballistic missile activities.
Israel can now confirm that, on 23 February 2019, Iran conducted another ballistic missile test in the area of Garmsar. This test was conducted to experiment with a new and destructive variant of the Shahab-3 ballistic missile.
The test constitutes a blatant violation of resolution 2231 (2015), as it passes the annex B threshold, has a striking range of more than 300 km and is capable of carrying a payload of more than 500 kg (Missile Technology Control Regime Category I). These missiles are designed to and are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
This alarming development occurred only two weeks after Iran launched a Safir satellite launch vehicle from the Imam Khomeini Space Center, on 6 February 2019 (see S/2019/168 ), and just one month after Iran launched a Simorgh satellite launch vehicle, on 14 January 2019 (see S/2019/62 ). Iran’s escalation of such dangerous activities reflects its complete disregard for the international community’s urgent insistence that the regime refrain from all types of missile activity.
I would like to point out that, in my latest letter to the Security Council on this topic ( S/2019/168 ), specifically with regard to the launch of the satellite launch vehicle on 6 February, I noted that the transport erector launcher that was used in the 6 February launch “is identical to the one used to launch Shahab-3 missiles”. I also reiterated that, “Although Iranian officials describe this activity as intended for civil space research and development, the reality is that these actions are dual-use and constitute another stage in Iran’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles”. The latest launch of this new and advanced Shahab-3 variant amplifies this point.
The 23 February launch is just the latest demonstration of Iran’s continued advancement of its ballistic missile programme, which it does not intend to cease. It occurs against the backdrop of Iran’s continued violation of numerous Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 2231 (2015), 2216 (2015), 1701 (2006), 1559 (2004) and 1540 (2004). Iran has become the largest proliferator of ballistic and other missile technologies to Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Gaza, delivering these capabilities into the hands of non-State and terrorist actors and destabilizing the region.
I call on the Security Council to join those who have already taken measures to curb the threat of Iranian missiles.
I should be grateful if you would have the present letter distributed as a document of the Security Council.

US DoS : Maximum Pressure Campaign on the Regime in Iran,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/us-dos-maximum-pressure-campaign-on-the-regime-in-iran.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L150xH113/arton205965-b07d4.jpg MAXIMUM ECONOMIC PRESSURE
The U.S. sanctions have cut off Iran’s access to billions of dollars in oil revenue and are driving its exports lower than ever before. Since last May, 1.5 million barrels of Iranian crude have been taken off the market and purchases of Iranian crude will soon be at zero. Starting with the re-imposition of our sanctions on November 5, 2018, Iran’s access to revenue from the sale of crude oil was immediately restricted. Overall, our sanctions have denied the regime direct access to as much as $10 billion in oil revenue since May 2018. More than 20 countries that were once regular oil customers of Iran have zeroed out their imports. Three jurisdictions that were granted waivers in November are already at zero. The Trump Administration has designated over 970 Iranian entities and individuals in more than 26 rounds of sanctions – more than any other Administration in U.S. history.• Just last week a vast network of front companies based in Iran, the U.A.E., and Turkey was sanctioned for procuring and transferring more than a billion dollars and euros to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.• We have designated Evin Prison, where the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps maintain permanent wards to hold political prisoners, and subject prisoners to brutal tactics.• In response to ongoing censorship activities by the regime, we have designated the IRGC’s Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization, Iran’s Supreme Council for Cyberspace and the National Cyberspace Center.• We have also sanctioned more than 70 Iran-linked financial institutions and their foreign and domestic subsidiaries. SWIFT has disconnected every sanctioned Iranian bank from its system and even disconnected the Central Bank of Iran. More than 100 corporations have exited the Iranian market, taking with them billions of dollars in investment. The Iranian economy is in a tailspin because of the regime’s poor policies, its continued commitment to terrorism, and our targeted pressure. The rial has lost two-thirds of its value, reports indicate Iran is in a recession, and inflation has hit a record 40 percent. Iran’s total trade has declined by nearly 25 percent since March 2018. INCREASING DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT
Europe has pushed back against Iranian terror activity. After a foiled bomb plot in Paris and a thwarted assassination plan in Denmark last year, the European Union in January sanctioned Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security and two of its agents for their roles.
Countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Albania, and Serbia, have acted on their own to address the threat of Iranian terrorism, whether by recalling Ambassadors, expelling Iranian diplomats, denying landing rights to Mahan Air, or eliminating visa-free travel.• Germany recently announced its decision to deny Mahan Air landing rights.• Panama issued a Presidential Decree to pull registration and de-flag Iranian vessels following the United States’ exposure of an oil-for-terror network.• Albania expelled Iran’s Ambassador to Tirana and another Iranian diplomat for involvement in thwarted terrorist plots. The United States, along with the U.K., France, and Germany, continue to hold Iran accountable for defying its international obligations. Our countries expressed strong concern to the UN Secretary General following Iran’s launch of a medium range ballistic missile in December and its attempted satellite launches in January and February. These launches and others defy UN Security Council Resolution 2231. The EU Foreign Affairs Council’s conclusions in February underscored its concern regarding Iran’s ballistic missile program, support of terrorism in Europe, human rights conditions in Iran, and the regime’s ongoing role in regional conflicts. RESTORING DETERRENCE
We have exposed the lethal aid that Iran is sending to militants in Yemen, Bahrain, and Afghanistan; including ballistic missiles, attack UAVs, and explosive boats. Representatives of over 70 countries toured the Iran Materiel Display, seeing clear and tangible evidence that Iran is sending weapons to its militant partners, which were used to attack international shipping and civilian infrastructure in the Gulf. We are continuing to disrupt the Qods Force’s illicit shipments of oil, which benefit terrorist groups like Hizballah as well as the Assad regime. More than 75 tankers involved in illicit shipping schemes have been denied the flags they need to sail.
The United States continues to build the partner capacities of several regional nations to defend themselves against the threats posed by Iran.

Is America losing its grip on world economy? 5 big defeats for US financial interests abroad,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/is-america-losing-its-grip-on-world-economy-5-big-defeats-for-us-financial-interests-abroad.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Donald Trump made it a banner promise of his presidency to stop the US being abused as the world’s “piggybank”– but not all foreign powers seem to be cowed into submission by his assertive style of foreign economic policy.
The United States remains the world’s second-biggest exporter after China, but these five cases show that it can’t always get its own way – even among its allies. Is this a consequence of Trump’s personal abrasiveness, a period of painful adjustment before as the giant rouses, or perhaps a harbinger that the rest of the world no longer needs America as much as it used to? No US alternative to Huawei
Washington tried to scare other Western countries into dropping a Chinese telecoms giant from supplying 5G network equipment, claiming Beijing could capture any data transferred through Huawei devices “at will.” But both Germany and the UK refused to bar Huawei from participating in tenders, with Berlin publicly rebuking Washington by saying that it has its “own security standards.”
Also on rt.com Merkel on Huawei: Germany won’t exclude 5G providers just because they come from China
The impact will be massive: the super-fast network will power not just telephones and computers, but likely any piece of sophisticated electronic equipment in your home for years to come.
Did Washington fail because the case made by its officials appeared to be based entirely on evidence-free hypotheses, to follow other red scares of various hues? Or was it because the US has no 5G provider of its own to match up with the might of Huawei, on which countries around the world have become increasingly reliant? Brussels sets trap for tech giants
The EU led a futile crusade to dismember Microsoft in the 1990s, but the assault on American tech giants by European lawmakers both in Brussels and through national governments is on an entirely different scale.
From trying to regulate Facebook and Twitter’s content monitoring to Amazon’s tax practices to harrying Google for abusing its dominant position and levying a record $5 billion fine, the European Union has set itself up for years in the courtrooms against the American giants’ legal teams.
Also on rt.com Pompeo urges France not to tax American tech firms as competition with China heats up
Ironically, with its hunt for Russian trolls and fake news, the US has done more than any other country to tarnish the image of its own companies, meaning that almost any measure against them, however punitive or unrealizable, will be met with no resistance from the public. Uber not (always) welcome
If the battle against the EU is a grand strategic campaign, the difficulties faced by US peer-sharing companies like Uber and Airbnb are more akin to a street-by-street city battle, and for every new market they have cracked, a lucrative one wipes out their business at the stroke of a single vote or edict.
Also on rt.com Madrid taxi drivers block city center as they step up anti-Uber protest (VIDEO)
Uber is currently locked out from markets as diverse as China, Turkey, and much of the European Union, while new labor regulations elsewhere could lessen its advantage versus traditional cab providers. Meanwhile, Airbnb struggles with pushback in many of the world’s most popular destinations, including Paris, Barcelona, Los Angeles and Japan.
Worst of all, rather than being regarded as innovations that make life easier – which they often do for the end consumer – these unicorn disruptors are increasingly being treated as law-skirting, employee-abusing parasites. Nord Stream 2 goes ahead
The US is betting on liquefied natural gas (LNG) becoming the world’s top fuel by the end of the next decade. But to propel itself to the top of the new export industry, which requires heavy investment in infrastructure for a product that is not always competitively priced, the US has had to use all of its economic and lobbying prowess.
So every one of the dozens of times Donald Trump – with backing from draconian Senate legislation – has insisted that Germany must abandon its Nord Stream 2 project with Russia, he has not just been fearing the Kremlin’s hold over Berlin, but propping up American LNG exporters. Germany has held firm, preferring to divorce house heating from politics and US interest.
Also on rt.com Full stream ahead: RT takes a peek at progress on construction of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline
And now a 10 percent tariff imposed by China – which is something of a running theme here – has also resulted in the postponement of the construction of at least one major facility in the US. Washington will argue that this is a hitch on its way to unstoppable domination of a boom industry, but the road ahead for American interests will be full of unexpected obstacles, many of them self-inflicted, others inevitable. S-400 v F-35
The US, the top global weapons exporter, has long been able to rely on its supplies to military allies as a reliable income stream. Which is why the American suspension of its F-35 supplies to Turkey – in protest against its purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system – provokes concerns that go beyond the monetary.
If more allies – particularly non-NATO states such as Saudi Arabia – drop their cast-iron loyalty to American weapons and look for options that are better value for money, this could force the US government to spend even more money propping up its successful but complacent giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing (which has other problems of its own recently).
Also on rt.com Washington’s Patriot offer wasn’t favorable to us, we’re sticking with Moscow’s S-400s – Erdogan
More concerning still is that while NATO countries continue to lag in their defensive spending, the countries where defense budgets are ballooning fastest, China, India and Russia, are either not dependent on American supplies, or actively opposed to them. Whereas 25 years ago it looked like all of the major economies would eventually join America’s world order, it now looks like the other hemisphere is forging its own path."
SOS: 5G Roll-out Endangers Every Person on Planet Earth,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/sos-5g-roll-out-endangers-every-person-on-planet-earth.html/,"Wireless Radiation: Stop the 5G Network on Earth and in Space, Devastating Impacts on Health and the Environment
But why are the power elite and their Deep State lackeys so determined to roll-out 5G without any safety testing whatsoever and prior to receiving the mandated public feedback?
Because only after they flip the switch on 5G will the ‘all-important’ Internet of Things (IoT) be viable. The current 4G paradigm simply cannot support the planned for IoT as the power generation is far to low.
This fact alone is the major driving force behind the truly insane 5G roll-out. Were the promoters of this national catastrophe-in-the-making to understand the profoundly perilous and far-reaching repercussions they would abort the 5G deployment if only to save their own lives.
Yes, 5G is really that scary… and more. Hence, we have designed the imperative Florida Strategy. The Florida Strategy
Because of the highly contentious 2020 election cycle, the basic strategy to shut down the 5G roll-out is to use the battleground state of Florida as ground zero
There are several reasons why Florida was chosen for this epic 5G-busting project. First and foremost there is this little, yet highly, potent factoid: *Every POTUS candidate on every side of the political spectrum knows that whoever wins Florida sits in the Oval Office. Florida’s 29 electoral votes are that vital to any presidential candidate.
Therefore, the immediate and primary purpose of this statewide endeavor is to make 5G the biggest campaign issue of this election cycle…and every level—federal and state, city and county.
But why Florida—really?
Because many people move here to have fun in the sun and get healthy and enjoy a wholesome retirement. Were they to realize that 5G will wreck their retirement like there’s no tomorrow, they will rebel and especially AT THE BALLOT BOX.
In order to foment this “Residents Revolution” against the Big Telcoms, the political establishment and the 5G vested interests, our game plan is to force each and every candidate, at ever level, to take a firm position for or against the illegal deployment of 5G.
This strategy will especially be used to push every POTUS candidate into their respective 5G corner. Each candidate will be given the opportunity to show that they are either with the Anti-5G Movement or against us.
The bottom line here is that whoever does not stand with We the People against the rapid 5G roll-out is against US —all of US! Execution & Logistics
Here’s how we’re doing it in Florida … which can then be duplicated in every other state. Folks in each state are highly encouraged to make this advocacy project their own, particularly in order to poignantly appeal to the sensibilities of the residents. Each state has their own hot-button issues, especially where it concerns emerging public health threats.
Our first objective is to organize a whistle-stop tour of the state whereby an anointed anti-5G candidate is selected to spearhead the tour which our crowdfunding will financially support. This candidate for elective office can come from any level, but a POTUS candidate would be preferred such as a strong-third party contender.
This highly 5G-educated individual will conduct a high-profile tour around the peninsula of Florida hitting all the key cities that are the most vulnerable to 5G implementation. For example, these are some of the urban areas that will be targeted by both our whistle-stop tour and our 5G multi-media campaign kit. Miami, Tampa-St. Pete, Orlando, Jacksonville, Clearwater, Pensacola, Tallahassee, Gainesville, Sarasota, West Palm Beach, Boca Raton,Fort Lauderdale, Daytona, Vero Beach, Jupiter, Fort Meyers, Naples,Panama City, Destin, St. Augustine, Melbourne, Port Saint Lucie,St. George Island, and the Keys.
Prior to this commencement of this 5G awareness-raising tour, a comprehensive multi-media campaign kit will be created and made digitally available to every resident in the state.
For those without Internet access, this excellent video will be made available as a CD at no charge for anyone who requests it: The Single BEST Video on the Internet Today Exposing the 5G Global Calamity The Real Plan
Let’s face it: the elected representatives and government officials who are directly responsible for the 5G roll-out do not work for the voters. In point of fact, they work for the many powerful moneyed interests who are behind the 5G juggernaut.
In light of this stark reality, the only real leverage that We the People have is to hold their feet to the fire, especially where it concerns direct threats to our health, safety and well-being.
THAT WOULD BE 5G. What greater threat to all of humanity is there than 5G?! 5G Dangers: Scientific Research Papers Delineate EMF Biological Effects and Cellular Damage
Therefore, we will use the 2019-2020 campaign season to vet the candidates based on 5G— first, second and third. In this way, their stated stance on 5G will either be a political poison pill or super-steroid for their candidacy.
At the end of the day, this nation must come to grips with what is essentially a military deployment of 5G. And the 2020 campaign cycle presents the perfect opportunity for the body politic to shut down 5G, once and for all.
Toward that end, we are looking for advocates willing to do only what they can do — or want to do. The following email address is dedicated strictly to this Florida initiative. Please feel free to contact us if this project resonates with you or your families or friends, and you have something to offer the advocacy movement.
For advocates who want to follow the execution of our strategy here in Florida, the following website will be continually updated with the latest initiatives and accomplishments. POTUS Race
In spite of the fact that this endeavor is focusing on Florida, our real aim is to hijack the race for POTUS nationwide. However, we must first demonstrate clear competency here so as to prove that this approach can work—QUICKLY
In an effort to launch this multi-pronged strategy, our anti-5G campaign will directly confront the major candidates first, and then the party nominees after they are finalized.
For example, here’s an open letter that has already been sent to President Trump, his family and key staff members. 5G CATASTROPHE: Mr. President, you leave us no choice!
For those who are still on the fence, the preceding letter ought to convey just how serious and unstoppable this anti-5G movement has already become. There has never been such a fierce and furious movement grown so fast, and the power elite know it.
Ultimately, we will coalesce into people-powered juggernaut strong enough to derail the 5G freight train that left the station without an iota of consent of We the People . Conclusion
If we are effective at making anti-5G roll-out the most radioactive campaign issue throughout this election cycle, there’s no question that it can be successfully terminated—FOREVER!
Not only that, the newly built anti-5G advocacy movement can then be directed to shutting down the chemtrails and especially the geoengineered weather warfare now occurring regularly nationwide.
Just how committed are we to completely halting the deployment of 5G? This Alt Media platform, along with several partnering sites, have made this vital project our central mission until Election Day. Here’s a previously published SOTN statement that makes clear our firm intention and indomitable determination. Material and Financial Support
Many folks have been asking how they can help. We have taken no donations until now.
However, we are entering a much more labor and material-intensive phase of this quickly growing enterprise.
Starting this April, the following PayPal account is being used to receive contributions to cover necessary personal expenses incurred by the principals to get this project off the ground. For non-Florida residents, please be aware that if 5G is halted in the Sunshine State , the odds of it being shut down in your state go up significantly. PayPal Email Account: [email protected]
We thank everyone for their interest, their concern and their support of this worthy cause.
We are all in this together, and therefore can only resolve this dire 5G predicament together. After all ………

Washington is planning to designate the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist group, the Wall Street Journal reported on April 5, citing unnamed U.S officials.
According to the officials, the decision will be officially announced by the U.S. State Department as early as April 8. This will be first time Washington to formally designate another country’s military a “terrorist group.”
The President Donald Trump administration reportedly hopes that this decision will increase pressure on Tehran. However, some U.S. officials believe that this step could endanger U.S. troops deployed near IRGC forces in the Middle East.
“There are legitimate arguments both ways, but there are definitely second and third-tier level [implications] that have to be considered … Think those second and third-tier levels haven’t been fully considered,” U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal and added: “New leadership has decided to look at things differently.”
Earlier this week, Brian Hook an advisor for the Secretary of State claimed that Iran is responsible for the deaths of at least 608 U.S. service members in Iraq in the period from 2003 to 2011. This accusation was clearly meant to justify the upcoming decision against the IRGC.
“The effects of Iran’s meddling had been felt most sharply by the region’s innocent civilians. Men, women, and children are casualties of Iran’s dangerous expansionism almost every day,” Hook said during a press briefing on April 2.
Last year, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned the IRGC. The department later expanded the sanctions to include several civilian entities in Iran and other countries after accusing them of facilitating the Iranian force activities in the Middle East.
U.S. sanctions and threats forced Tehran to strengthen its relations with its current allies and increase its military spending. The designation of the IRGC as a terrorist group will likely lead to similar results. More on this topic:"

VeteransToday DALL’AUTOBOMBA FOR JUDGE CHINNICI assassination of President LINCOLN: THE BLOOD RED WIRE TYING The PLOTS OF INTERNATIONAL LOGGE
____ Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio____
“There is a thread that binds all great crimes. A single political project … ” Rocco Chinnici Judge – Head of Education of the Court of Palermo
During the “dala massacre” at Pipitone Palermo on July 29, 1983 35 peoplewere torn apart by a car bomb. The investigating judge Rocco Chinnici, the founder of the Anti-Mafia Pool with Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and the men of his escort, in their memory wish to follow that thread on the great crimes of history, not only Italian, and try to unravel the tangle of that great political project that has an occult principals responsive to the freemasonry name. It should certainly be given that not all Masons are accomplices of the killings but by virtue of brotherhood or collude with the principals to protect the reputation or have naively incredulous before the responsibilities of the loggia of friends. It must be stressed that the criminal operations of the Masons is expressed through secret lodges, blankets and elite,
For brevity I will necessarily leave out many historical steps that will take up in any subsequent articles but sources footer enable further details. Here I will mention the crimes and their connections with those prominent masters of Freemasonry that not only were accomplices of the mafia and used it but even invented! For now we’ll just talk about the murders of Chinn, US President Abraham Lincoln and of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and the International Masonic conspiracies until the First World War.
Giuseppe Mazzini
THE BIRTH OF MAZZINI MAFIA
Leonardo Sciascia, Sicilian poet and writer, wrote: “The most complete and essential definition that you can give the Mafia, we believe it is this: the Mafia is a criminal organization, with the purpose of illicit enrichment for its members, which imposes as parasitic brokerage, and sets by means of violence, including the property and work, between production and consumption, between the citizen and the State “(Salvatore Shoemaker, History of the Mafia, Small Basic library, and. Phoenix 2000) .
In a study published in 1972 Illustrated History of carefully it reconstructs the origin of the term Mafia. He also picks up the theory on the introduction of the word in the island, brought back to the unification of the Kingdom of Italy, expressed by Charles Heckethorn (Charles W. Heckethorn, Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries, London, G. Redway, 1897), which focuses on Mazzini’s secret mission to Sicily took place in 1860, the year before the unification of Italy, this theory, then picked up by the economist and sociologist Giuseppe Palomba, says the term “MAFIA” is merely an abbreviation of the words: “Mazzini Authorizes thefts Fires Poisonings.”
Of all the hypotheses on the etymology of this word seems the most appropriate to the context of that time as today. As I will highlight in other articles just rereading the insurrectionary acts of Mazzini, which look like those of George Soros today in Orange Revolutions, you can understand how incrancrenito in the history of Italy, the Kingdom of Sardinia to the Republic, the spirit conspirator and criminal nature of masonry. Suffice it to say that this revolutionary, who won the 33 degree Masonic, the highest, right from the Supreme Palermo Council of the Scottish Rite, although sentenced to two Courts death and then pardoned as was Albert Pike (read previous article Freemasonry and Satanism), was arrested four times but could afford to live comfortably thanks to close friendships with English Masons.
Suffice to say that he lived his last run, the same way as a Mafia boss, in Pisa in the home of Pellegrino Rosselli, his wife’s uncle Ernest Nathan, the Anglo-Italian Grand Master of the Grand Orient from 1896 to 1904 and from 1917 to 1919 and elected Mayor of Rome in 1907. on the role of international conspirator of Mazzini and the revolutionary ideals of the elite Freemasonry aimed at world wars also read the previous article Freemasonry and Satanism. right from the Supreme Palermo Council of the Scottish Rite, although condemned to death by two courts and then pardoned as was Albert Pike (read previous article Freemasonry and Satanism), he was arrested four times but could afford to live comfortably thanks to the close friendships with British Freemasons.

On 29 July 1983 a car bomb, a padded Fiat127 of TNT, exploded in via Federico Pipitone Palermo, the first time that the Mafia was experiencing the car bomb against a magistrate. The car was parked outside the house of Rocco Chinnici. He was killed so the judge. Together with Mario Trapassi Marshal of the Carabinieri, the pinned Salvatore Bartolotta and the caretaker of the building, Stephen Li Sacchi.
THE PRINCIPAL OF THE MURDER OF MASONIC ROCCO CHINNICI
“Picking up the thread of our discourse Before turning to the mafia of the period from the unification of the Kingdom of Italy in the First World War and the advent of fascism, we must briefly but necessarily precede it and as an association under that name before unification, he had never existed in Sicily, “so declared their Rocco Chinnici confirming the reconstruction made by the same Sciascia of which was certainly aware of the writings.
Rocco Chinnici Head of Education of the Court of Palermo and creator of the Anti-Mafia Pool
“The Mafia – the judge said in an interview – was always reaction, conservation, defense and so accumulation of wealth. First it was the feud to defend, they are now the largest public procurement, most opulent markets, smuggling that travel the world and administer thousands of billions. The Mafia is therefore tragic, mad, cruel vocation to wealth. The same Mafia is a way of doing politics through violence, is fatal then you are looking for a complicity, a match, an alliance with pure politics, ie practically with power. If she wants me to ask how this complicity is concrete, with what men of power, with such forms of criminal alliance, I can not go into detail. It would like to report the intention or the direction of the investigation. “
It would be a long list of political bosses and ended up in the crosshairs of the magistrate. We just remember that Michele Greek, said the Pope for his role inside the Cosa Nostra Dome, although condemned for generic crimes of association with the Mafia, was acquitted after daring than 7 processes (and an investigation into alleged corruption of judges these judgments vanished into thin air) for the massacre of Pipitone and therefore could not be retried during the next and decisive legal proceedings in which the Court of Appeal of Caltanissetta, June 25, 2002, stated that the judgment of the Court of Assizes ( with minor variations):
confirmation of the life sentences for Salvatore Riina, Bernardo Provenzano, Raffaele Ganci, Antonino Madonia, Salvatore Buscemi, Anthony Geraci, Giuseppe Calo, Francesco Madonia, Salvatore and Giuseppe Montalto, Stephen Hooks and Vincenzo Galatolo. Acquitted Motisi Matthew and Joseph Farinella, which at first instance had been imposed life imprisonment.
Reduced from 18 to 15 and 16 years in prison sentence, respectively, for the “collaborators” Anzelmo Francesco Paolo and Giovanni Brusca. Confirmed instead 18 years in prison each for Giovanbattista Ferrante and Calogero Ganci. A verdict confirmed by the Supreme Court a year later.
Giovanni Brusca condotto in carcere dopo la sua cattura, il 21 maggio 1996.ANSA / FRANCO LANNINO Giovanni Brusca taken to prison after his capture, May 21, 1996.
At trial, it hinged on the basic confessions of Giovanni Brusca and other repented, were not accused Nino and Ignazio Salvo because both died in the meantime. According to Brusca’s death Chinn judge he had decided it was annoying cousins ​​Salvo with inquiries about their activities in the field of tax collection “accompanied Ignazio and Nino Salvo in Dammusi in a house where waiting for them my father Bernard and Toto Riina” confessed . That day, placed by Brusca six months before the massacre “Ignazio Salvo, coming in euphoric way he said” finally break the horns to that cuckold “: he referred to Chinn and after the massacre, in fact, the Salvos said” we He made several attempts to approach him but we never did. ‘” The prosecution of Assizes process,
Antonino Salvo during the arrest requested by Giovanni Falcone
A link already emerged years earlier when on 12 November 1984 the judge Giovanni Falcone asked and obtained the arrest of the Salvo cousins ​​on charges of mafia-type association.
Nino Salvo died in Switzerland, in a clinic in Bellinzona, January 19, 1986 from cancer, surrounded by his relatives. He had not yet completed the maxi trial of Palermo, in which he was accused together with his cousin and hundreds of other people. But what were the political – economic sanctuaries referred to by the judges? Some time after his death, it was discovered that Nino Salvo had joined the loggia of the universal Scottish Rite Ancient and Accepted. And not in a lodge any but the “Supreme Council of Italy” in Via Roma in Palermo, the same as a century earlier had given the 33 degree to Giuseppe Mazzini, the same ritual obedience of Confederate General Albert Pike, founder of Ku Klux Klan.
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION hatched ILLUMINATI
Jpahnn Adama Weishaupt, founder of the Illuminati
A courier of the Illuminati named Johann Jakob Lanz, a former Catholic priest, was killed by a lightning Nerl 1785 while going through on horseback the city of Regensburg. By examining the contents of his saddle bag, the police discovered the existence of the Order of the Illuminati, and are detailed plans for the upcoming French Revolution. The Bavarian authorities alert you to the French Government on the impending disaster but disregards this warning.
The Bavarian police arrest all members of the Order of the Illuminati who manages to find, but Weishaupt and other followers manage to hide and evade arrest. Who are the Illuminati? In 1977 the banker jew Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) brings together twelve of his most influential friends and convinces them of the fact that if you join their resources, They will dominate the world.
This meeting took place in Frankfurt, Germany. Rothschild also informs his friends that he had found the perfect candidate, an individual with an incredible intellect and great ingenuity, to guide the organization that designed: this man is Adam Weishaupt (1748-1830). The May 1, 1776 the same Weishaupt (code named Spartacus) founded the secret society called the Order of the Illuminati. Weishaupt was a professor of Canon Law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria.

Almost 1,000 people left the Rukban refugee camp in Syria on April 4 through the Jeleb checkpoint, they were given all necessary assistance, Maj. Gen. Viktor Kupchishin, head of the Russian centre for Syrian reconciliation, has stated.
“On 4 April, 985 civilians left the Rukban refugee camp through the Jeleb checkpoint. They were transported to temporary residence sites in the city of Homs”, Kupchishin said at a daily briefing.
The general stressed that the refugees were provided with all necessary assistance, including the provision of food and temporary accommodation.
The Russian military also set up a humanitarian corridor and the Jleb mobile checkpoint in order to prevent a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban refugee camp, Kupchishin stated.
The Rukban refugee camp is part of the US-controlled zone around its base in Al-Tanf. The camp, which houses some 40,000 displaced people, is located in the south of Syria, not far from Jordan. The Russia-Syria coordination centre on refugee repatriation has repeatedly blamed the United States for blocking access to the camp.
The Russian military also set up a humanitarian corridor and the Jleb mobile checkpoint in order to prevent a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban refugee camp.

The Polish Orthodox Church has said that it does not recognize the newly-created Orthodox structure in Ukraine supported by Constantinople and Kiev. A religious body cannot be led by a group of “renegades,” it said.
What the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has done by declaring the newly formed ‘Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU)’ autocephalous or independent from the Moscow Patriarchate, which the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church belongs to, goes against the church norms and violates the Orthodox Churches’ unity , the Holy Council of Bishops of the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church said in a statement, clarifying its stance on the issue.
Although, the council noted that it generally supports the idea of granting autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, it still said that such a move should be based on the canonical norms and accepted by the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and not just a group of schismatic priests.
“Church apostates, who were deprived of priestly ordination, cannot represent a healthy church organism,” the statement said, referring to the fact that the OCU was formed from two schismatic churches at a “unification council” late in 2018, which was attended predominantly by assorted schismatic priests and ignored by the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Polish Orthodox Church has joined the Orthodox Churches of America, Serbia and Antioch in refusing to recognize the newly-formed clerical structure , which was actively supported by the Kiev authorities and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko personally , after he spearheaded the creation of a new, homegrown “independent” church.
The Moscow Patriarchate also renounced the new entity, with Patriarch Kirill describing the situation as an “unprecedented meddling of state” in church affairs . With most other autocephalous Orthodox Churches distancing themselves from the conflict, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), a self-governed part of the Russian Orthodox Church, remains the only universally-recognized church in the country.

The imploded Russian collusion narrative seems to have had little impact on changing the minds of its devotees. In fact, the hysteria may only have increased, judging by yesterday’s rallies and their motto, “Release the Report!”
In a bizarre spectacle, demonstrations across the country organized by the MoveOn political action committee, with the endorsement of MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow herself, have called for the immediate release of the full, uncensored report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
In order to energize the gatherings, NYC’s Times Square rally also included the distribution of a surreal songbook, complete with lyrics of popular tunes like the classic “My Favorite Things” and “It’s Not Unusual” by Tom Jones, changed to include references about alleged details in the conspiracy narrative.
In call-and-response unison, the crowd chanted the modified lyrics of songs like Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” into the mantra “We will survive!” with expletive-laden lyrics.

Attorney General William Barr has pledged to release a version of the report, redacted in order to protect certain confidential information contained within it. Subsequently, The New York Times published an article using unnamed sources alleging that some of the members of the Mueller team were unsatisfied with Barr’s four-page assessment of the report regarding whether President Donald Trump was cleared of obstruction of justice.
Russiagate enthusiasts have clung to this as an implication of a cover-up by Barr and that there may still be a glimmer of hope that the allegations about collusion or obstruction may be in the report, even though Mueller did not issue any further indictments in the probe.

War with Russia Is Not “Inevitable.” Keep Repeating That,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/war-with-russia-is-not-inevitable-keep-repeating-that.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Well, that didn’t take long! No sooner had Robert Torquemada Mueller wrapped up his obscenely expensive inquisition without finding any so-called collusion with Russia than the obstacles to rapprochement between Washington and Moscow immediately dissipated. Calls for a new détente issued from sound thinkers such as Daniel R. DePetris of The American Conservative (Trump now has his “first opportunity to settle on a Russia policy without the risk of an extreme political backlash”) and Srdja Trifkovic of Chronicles :
‘Now that the Russian Collusion Myth has been revealed to be a mendacious conspiracy by the Deep State, the Democratic Party and the media, President Donald Trump needs to move on with his election promise to improve relations with Moscow. That is a geopolitical and civilizational necessity.’
The undeniable wisdom of such recommendations was instantly recognized by the Washington establishment. Not only did Democrats and Never-Trump Republicans back off their Nazi-Putin paranoia , Trump’s own team, starting with National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rushed copies of DePetris’ and Trifkovic’s musings onto their boss’s desk.
The most striking (though, oddly, little commented upon) evidence of the now-liberated Trump administration’s beeline towards a new realist overture towards Moscow was explicit US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia. The newfound respect for Russia’s security needs is evident:
The White House
Proclamation on Recognizing Crimea as Part of the Russian Federation
Issued on: March 25, 2019
The Russian Federation took control of Crimea in 2014 to safeguard its security from external threats. Today, aggressive acts by NATO, including US forces, in the Black Sea and Ukraine continue to make Crimea a potential launching ground for attacks on Russia. Any possible future peace agreement in the region must account for Russia’s need to protect itself from NATO and other regional threats. Based on these unique circumstances, it is therefore appropriate to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim that, the United States recognizes that Crimea is part of the Russian Federation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.
DONALD J. TRUMP
Oh wait, that actually didn’t happen. The genuine March 25 proclamation related to something entirely different .
Nevermind .
Let’s get something straight. It is a fantasy to believe that Trump has been freed by Mueller’s goose egg. The Democrats will use his work as a starting point (not as a finish) to keep digging into Trump’s private and business affairs to find something for which they can impeach him. As far as Russia goes, sure there was no direct “collusion,” but on the other hand the report, even before its release, is being cited across the political spectrum as proof that Russia “interfered” in our election to undermine our “democracy” and thus as reason to keep the demonization campaign against Russia going. Pathetically, Trump will continue to defend himself by boasting that “ nobody’s been tougher on Russia ” than he has while futilely calling for better relations (and even mutual decreases in military spending , which will join his nonexistent Mexican wall, his national infrastructure rehab, his Syria pullout, his … ).
In that sense Mueller has changed nothing. We will continue to sputter along like this for the remainder of Trump’s presidency in a continued downward slope. If anyone in Moscow thinks Trump now will be able to move towards normalized relations they are sadly mistaken.
Aside from occasional pipe dreams that supposedly “ declining power ” Russia can be pressed into service as a check against China ( without offering Moscow any positive incentive , of course) what we can count on is continuation of the coordinated campaign to render Russia’s strategic situation untenable: deployment of intermediate-range weapons in Europe to make warning virtually nonexistent (and a strong possibility that START will follow INF into oblivion); strategic bomber probes with prototype nuclear-armed cruise missiles to prepare the aircraft for the possibility of launching the Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) weapon ; NATO maneuvers around Russia’s land and sea borders (but only to deter aggression, of course!); more sanctions; yet more expansion of NATO ( Ukraine and Georgia still on the agenda !); vilification of Russia and, particularly, of President Vladimir Putin; militarization of Ukraine; attacking the Orthodox Church ; the Skripal hoax; more chemical false flags in Syria ; trying to tank South Stream 2; blaming Russia for “undermining democracy” in every western country in addition to the US – all are components of a full-spectrum operation to destroy Russia’s economy, to destabilize its society, to replace its “regime” with one more to their “partners’” liking, and ultimately to dismember Russia.
In the face of this, one is mystified why Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and other Russian statesmen continue to refer politely to their Western “partners” even when it’s painfully clear that they have no Western partners. While these “partners”– who, it should be noted, never that use that term about the Russians – claim they only want to change Moscow’s “behavior,” that isn’t true. There is nothing Russia could do short of surrendering its sovereignty and returning to the 1990s that would even begin mollify Russia’s “partners.” As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put it in December 2018, America’s “mission is to reassert our sovereignty [and] reform the liberal international order,” and “we want our friends to help us and to exert their sovereignty as well.” But Russia and other countries that haven’t “embraced Western values of freedom and international cooperation” to Pompeo’s satisfaction aren’t our “friends” and thus have no such sovereign liberty.
In short, these Western “partners” hate Russia not for what it does, but for what it is: an obstacle to absolute global domination by a US-led “liberal international order.” Russia’s deployment of the most powerful weapons imaginable perhaps can limit the military aspect of that agenda, but it cannot reverse it. Quite to the contrary, such actions, like Moscow’s defensive moves after the 2014 regime change in Ukraine or Russia’s 2015 deployment in Syria or current presence in Venezuela, are held up as further “proof” of Russians’“typically, almost genetically driven” aggressiveness, in the words of former CIA Director James Clapper.
Does this mean that western war planners are preparing for a redux of the 1812 Grande Armée or 1941 Operation Barbarossa rolling across Belarus or Ukraine into Russia? No. Rather, western officials, mainly in the US, are confident (aren’t they always?) that under constant moral, economic, financial, and military pressure a tipping point will be reached in Russia’s internal instability and strategic vulnerability (the latter including the knowledge that leadership decapitation without warning is possible), forcing Moscow to fold, either through revolution, or coup, or inflicting a (we would hope, limited) military humiliation on them somewhere.
Notwithstanding their soft rhetoric, the Russian leadership understands this quite well. As Professor Stephen Cohen observes:
‘Moscow closely follows what is said and written in the United States about US-Russian relations. Here too words have consequences. On March 14, Russia’s National Security Council, headed by President Putin, officially raised its perception of American intentions toward Russia from “military dangers” (opasnosti) to direct “military threats” (ugrozy). In short, the Kremlin is preparing for war, however defensive its intention.’
Just over a year ago, in March 2018 , Putin unveiled a new set of deterrent capabilities against “all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, [and] introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development.”(Hint: he was talking about the US and NATO.) “Nobody listened to us,” Putin said then. “Well, listen to us now.”
Of course, they didn’t listen a year ago. And they’re not listening today, either.
Gilbert Doctorow likens the current situation to that in depicted by Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace . Today as then, what happens next will be less due to this or that policymaker making this or that bad decision as much as the existence of a “near universal acceptance of the logic of the coming war” (Must read: “‘ War and Peace’: The Relevance of 1812 as Explained by Tolstoy to Current Global Affairs ,” Antiwar.com ):
‘Transposed to our own day, this issue finds its parallel in the informational war the United States and the West more generally have been waging against Russia. The defamation of Putin, the denigration of Russia all have been swallowed whole by the vast majority of our political classes, who today would view with equanimity, perhaps even with enthusiasm any military conflict with Russia that may arise, whatever the immediate cause.’
Hardheaded observers, notably military men, might reject this notion. Where is mobilization of NATO armies in offensive strength? The Russians know NATO is a joke – they won’t even cough up Trump’s lousy two percent of GDP! General Shoigu isn’t stupid!
Objectively that’s true. But that doesn’t change the fact that western, especially American, policymakers have defined our attitude towards Russia as an existential struggle that can have only one outcome – Russia’s collapse, leading to regime change – either via war or means short of war. All elements of western policy are geared to that one inalterable objective.
That this policy won’t and cannot succeed is never even considered by its authors. It continues because, literally, they cannot think of Russia in any other way. Nikolai Gogol likened the Russia of his day to a speeding troika , wordlessly hurtling towards its fate while “all things on earth fly by and other nations and states gaze askance as they step aside and give her the right of way.”
Today, that reckless plunge describes not Russia but America and our craven satellites. As Israel Shamir concludes :
‘Russians have few ambitions. They do not want to rule the world, or even to dominate their neighbors. They do not want to fight the Empire. They would be content to be left in peace. But if pushed, and now they are being pushed, they will respond. In [the] Russian view, even the most hostile American politicians will desist before the Doomsday collision. And if not, let it be.’
The question that no one in Washington seemingly is asking themselves is not whether war is inevitable but whether the Russian leadership, despite their polite talk, have come to believe (rightly) that positive change in their “partners’” behavior is very unlikely and that therefore war is much more likely than not, according to the “logic” of things described by Doctorow. “Fifty years ago, the streets of Leningrad taught me one rule: if a fight is inevitable you have to strike first,” Putin told journalists at the 2015 Valdai conference. Even if, from the west’s point of view war is not inevitable, what if the Russians have come to believe it is? (Suggested viewing: the films 1612 (2007) and the Taras Bulba (2009) as psychological war preparation of the population comparable to Sergei Eisenstein’s World War II-era Alexander Nevsky (complete with a western bishop with a swastika on his miter ) and the two-part Ivan the Terrible .)
Even more than a year ago , when the writing was already on the wall that Russiagate would turn out to be a whiff as far as nailing Trump goes, it was clear that in one important sense it had exceeded beyond all expectations : achieving permanent enmity between the US and Russia . Now, with the pointless investigation concluded, nothing has improved, nor can there be much expectation that it will. As Doctorow notes:
‘Indeed, no one wants war, neither Washington nor Moscow. However, the step by step dismantling of the channels of communication, of the symbolic projects for cooperation across a wide array of domains, and now dismantling of all the arms limitation agreements that took decades to negotiate and ratify, plus the incoming new weapons systems that leave both sides with under 10 minutes to decide how to respond to alarms of incoming missiles – all of this prepares the way for the Accident to end all Accidents. Such false alarms occurred in the Cold War but some slight measure of mutual trust prompted restraint. That is all gone now and if something goes awry, we are all dead ducks.’
Barring a miracle, this does not end well.

Kurds in Fateful Triangle as US Moves to Redeploy IS Terror Groups,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/kurds-in-fateful-triangle-as-us-moves-to-redeploy-is-terror-groups.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Kurdish fighters have been used by the US to ostensibly defeat the remaining Islamic State holdouts in eastern Syria. But what is emerging is not a final defeat of the terrorists, more a redeployment to further destabilize the Arab country.
Potentially, the Kurds could wind up not with the regional autonomy they desire, but as part of a rebranded American dirty war army whose ranks include the very terrorist the Kurdish militias have been successfully battling against.
President Donald Trump has been lately crowing about how US-backed Kurdish forces have wiped out the IS self-proclaimed caliphate around Baghouz in eastern Syria. “They’re losers… they’re gone tonight,” he boasted about supposedly vanquishing the jihadists.
However, things are not that clear-cut. Syria’s envoy to the United Nations Bashar al Jaafari dismissed Trump’s victory celebrations as a “bluff”. He said that IS was not defeated in areas under US control, but rather were being shunted off to various camps for retraining.
There are credible reports that thousands of jihadists who surrendered or were captured in the fighting around Baghouz have since been relocated by US forces to its military base at al Tanf near the border with Iraq and Jordan, as well as to nearby refugee camps such as Rukban, where some 40,000 detainees are held. Suspiciously, the Americans are refusing international access to these camps, even for UN humanitarian relief agencies. As Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pointed out recently, the detention centers are being used by the Americans as a pretext for illegally occupying Syrian territory.
We can also add the purpose of clandestine military recruitment for US proxies.
Despite Trump’s announcement four months ago that US military was pulling out of Syria, there seems no sign that his plan is being implemented. That’s why Moscow reacted angrily to Washington’s demand for Russian troops to leave Venezuela. The Kremlin responded testily that the US should first deliver on its promise to withdraw from Syria, where its forces are illegally present unlike Russian personnel in Venezuela under bilateral agreement.
In Syria’s supposedly post-war scenario what seems to be happening is the US seeking to find a way to reconfigure its destabilizing intervention in the Arab country. The past eight years of US-sponsored covert war has failed in its objective for regime change against President Bashar al Assad, who is allied with Russia and Iran. What the US is aiming to do now is keep military footprints in the country, effectively annexing swathes of territory, especially in the oil and gas-rich eastern region around the Euphrates River.
That accounts for why supposedly defeated enemy terrorists are being retrained by US special forces at al Tanf. They are reportedly being tasked with capturing the oil and gas fields in Deir ez-Zor province as well as production infrastructure in Homs province.
This puts the Kurdish forces in an invidious position. There is little doubting the courage and fighting ability of the Kurdish men and women who make up the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and its spearhead YPG militias. The Kurds have managed to liberate up to 30 per cent of Syria’s territory in the northeast and east from the IS jihadists. They have dealt a decisive blow to the residual caliphate at Baghouz. American air power augmented the Kurds in their offensive.
But what the US is maneuvering to do is to combine the defeated jihadists with the Kurds in order to push its agenda for breaking up Syria and controlling its eastern mineral-rich resources.
The Special Monitoring Mission to Syria reports that IS militants captured by the SDF are being redeployed by the Americans for seizing oil and gas production facilities.
Still another crucial objective for Washington is to control the Deir ez-Zor east-west corridor from Iraq to Damascus so as to contain Iranian presence in Syria.
This is the context for Trump’s brazen declaration recognizing Israel’s annexation of Syria’s southern Golan Heights. Washington’s game plan is to keep Syria destabilized and fragmented, partly to appease Israel and partly for the US’s own imperial designs for dominance in the region.
In this insidious US maneuvering, the Kurds face a potentially treacherous situation. They have been well armed and supported by Washington, but are finding they are being used like a disposable asset. The Kurds may have calculated that accepting Washington’s patronage in recent years was a way to earn political capital for building a future separate independent Kurdish state. What seems to be emerging, however, is that the Americans only intend to exploit the Kurds as a fighting force to do its dirty work of breaking up Syria – in the same way that the Americans have covertly used jihadist terror groups in other parts of Syria.
The Kurds have been very effective in routing IS in the latter’s remaining strongholds in eastern Syria. But the result is the Kurds are being used as a recruitment agency for the Americans to redeploy the “defeated” terrorists in its ongoing covert war against the Syrian state.
There are signs, though, that the Kurds are well aware of the treacherous danger in dealing with Washington. When Trump made is troop withdrawal announcement, there were palpable concerns among the Kurds about being betrayed to the mercy of Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to send his military forces into Syria to crush the SDF and YPG militia whom Ankara views as “terrorist” affiliates of its own separatist Kurdish movement, the PKK.
It’s not clear if the US will implement a withdrawal of its estimated 2,000 troops in Syria. There are indications it won’t happen, despite Trump’s claims. Nevertheless, the surprise announcement was enough to undermine Kurdish confidence its patron. With the result that Kurdish leaders have begun reaching out to the Assad government in Damascus in the hope of dialogue producing a future federal arrangement.
The Kurds have reportedly requested Russia to mediate with the Syrian government.
Kurdish forces have not heretofore been at war with the Syrian Arab Army. They share the same common enemy of IS and assorted jihadist terror groups.
In the past, President Assad has rebuffed Kurdish aspirations for regional autonomy. But apparently, Damascus has shifted to be more open on forming a new federal constitution for Syria in which the Kurds would gain important regional independence – in a way analogous to the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq.
In this fateful political triangle that the Syrian Kurds find themselves, they would be advised to throw their lot in with the Damascus government. If a mutual pact could be established that would bring the two major chunks of Syria’s territory back into territorial integrity.
If, on other hand, the Kurds accede to Washington’s nefarious agenda, they run the risk of losing independence and being eviscerated from exploitation in endless dirty-war machinations by the Americans. An ominous sign is that after bravely fighting to rout IS, the Kurdish militia are being set up to form a devil’s bargain with the same terrorists – to satisfy Washington’s geopolitical interests.
The Kurds would do well to remember a cynical maxim in Washington, whereby the US “does not have allies, only interests”.

Pepe ESCOBAR
It’s all about the cross-strait median. No, that’s not a drink in a Hong Kong bar. It’s the de facto maritime border between continental China and Taiwan.
Last Sunday morning, two Chinese J-11 fighters crossed the median and stayed on Taiwanese air space for about 10 minutes – even after Taiwanese interceptors were dispatched. Tsai Ing-wen, the President of Taiwan, defined the incursion by the PLA Air Force as “reckless and provocative.”
And, ominously, demanded the “forceful expulsion” of Chinese fighter jets if it ever happened again. Well, that used to happen, quite frequently, but only up to 1999, when Beijing and Taipei clinched a deal to make them stop.
US mainstream media predictably spun this latest incursion as yet another Chinese provocation, omitting the essential background to what is only one more move in an extremely complex – and dangerous – geopolitical chessboard.
Taiwan has made an official request to buy more than 60 F-16 fighter jets from the US. And the Trump administration tacitly approved it. It works like this. Trump’s advisers “encouraged” Taipei to make a formal request. They acted in tandem with Lockheed Martin, which builds the F-16s.
The request then became an actual proposal by the Pentagon and State Department. Finally, Congress has 30 days to consider whether the sale may go ahead. Considering this particular case suits not only the industrial-military complex, but also the overall US government agenda of containment of China, it might as well be considered a done deal.
Call in your CHIPS
Without this crucial context, it’s impossible to understand the logic behind the Chinese “provocation.” And that is also directly linked to John Bolton torpedoing negotiations with North Korea (the DPRK) and the non-stop demonization of both Russia and Iran.
China, Russia and Iran are the essential nodes in the laborious, ongoing, long-term Eurasia integration process. Russia and China were also essential advisers to the DPRK in its nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.
The demonization of Russia and Iran proceeds in parallel with what is in effect a Washington-orchestrated SWIFT-CHIPS war. CHIPS is the US dollar clearing system used by 88% of the transactions in global trade. This means that the US dollar is on one side of every international transaction 88% of the time.
If you are cut out of this system, it’s extremely difficult to conduct world trade – you need barter, trading in local currencies or an untested system like INSTEX , set up by the EU for non-dollar transactions with Iran after the Trump administration crashed out of the JCPOA, or Iran nuclear deal.
China is way more dependent on world trade than Russia as it needs to import massive amounts of natural resources that must be paid for by exports.
Russia, for its part, could very easily become self-sufficient, as it holds about 96% of the natural resources it needs. The US, by comparison, needs to import many vital natural resources for its advanced industries.
Recent history is filled with examples – for instance, Japan and South Korea – showing that national self-sufficiency works. China is fine-tuning the model as applied to the Made in China 2025 strategy.
The problem with Russia is that the Central Bank under Elvira Nabiullina arguably does not operate in the Russian national interest.
As I have extensively discussed with Russian analysts, a solution would be for the Russian Central Bank to create currency controls to prevent oligarchs from siphoning their wealth overseas, a move that only serves to further collapse the ruble. And also create credit to build the industries that would replace imports – a de facto massive import substitution. No credit should be issued for any other purpose.
Entering the next decade, what would constitute a sort of nuclear option would be for Russia to divert to China most of the natural resources sold to the West, whose retribution is packages of sanctions, while importing from China the advanced technologies required for Russia.
China is de facto an equal or even ahead of the US in plenty of technology areas – as documented, for instance, by Kai-Fu Lee on AI Super-Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order . Much is not visible yet because advances have not been commercialized.
All of the above is being debated in Moscow, in detail, on myriad levels. It’s not by accident that Russia is fully on board the New Silk Roads, or Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in connection with the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU).
The latest graphic example of the Russia-China economic partnership is the railroad bridge across the Amur river linking the Russian Far East with China’s Heilongjiang province.
The future rises in the East
Throughout the next decade it will be clear how the entire Eurasian land mass is linked with, or by, the BRI. In comparison, Chas Freeman, a former US ambassador to China, is one of the few informed observers who have sounded the alarm ; Washington treats the BRI as a military strategic challenge.
Alastair Crooke has shown how a mini-BRI is already shaping up, linking Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. In fact, this is the emerging Southwest Asia BRI node.
At the same time, Beijing had made it very clear that – harsh methods included – Xinjiang, the key BRI hub in Western China, would not be allowed to become another Syria, Libya or Iraq. Xinjiang directly links with the essential BRI connectivity corridors to the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
The West, or what remains of its unity, does not represent a vision of the future any more. China is striving for the BRI to fulfill this role. That’s something a few extra F-16s patrolling the cross-strait median won’t be able to change."
How Rachel Maddow Turned into Infowars,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/how-rachel-maddow-turned-into-infowars.html/,"This post was originally published on this site She’s still spinning Russiagate conspiracy tales, even as her ratings come crashing down.
Peter VAN BUREN
Though she doesn’t often bring it up these days, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow remembers how the media abetted the Bush administration’s lies justifying the 2003 Iraq invasion. That was when elite (in many cases handpicked) journalists spent months serving as stenographers for the push to war, parroting every carefully crafted leak without question. They dismissed skeptics as disloyal and spiked stories that would have raised questions about the narrative. When they got caught, they declared “never again.”
Yet with Rachel Maddow as their poster child (along with David Corn, Luke Harding, Chris Hayes, the entire staff at CNN, and hundreds more), journalists over the last two years repeated every mistake their predecessors had made in 2003.
They treated gossip as fact because it came from a “source” and told us to just trust them. They blurred the lines between first-hand knowledge, second- and third-hand hearsay, and “people familiar with the matter” to build breaking news out of manure. They marginalized skeptics as “useful idiots.” (Glenn Greenwald, who called bull on Russiagate from the beginning, says MSNBC banned him after he criticized Maddow. He’d been a regular during the Bush and Obama years.)
They accepted negative information at face value and discarded information that did not fit their pre-written narrative of collusion. The Washington Post never even ran a story about how its reporters came up empty after working for months to prove that Michael Cohen met with Russian agents in Prague.
They went all in with salacious headlines, every story a sugar high. They purposefully muddled the impact of an indictment versus an actual conviction. They conflated anyone from Russia with the Russian government. They never paused to ask why there weren’t “Sources: Trump is Innocent” stories that later needed to be walked back; the errors were somehow all on one side. They became a machine as trustworthy as the politicians they relied on.
Though the wars across the Middle East the media helped midwife are beyond sin, the damage done to journalism itself is far worse this time around. With Maddow in the lead, journalists went a step further than just shoddy reporting, proudly declaring their partisanship (once the cardinal sin of journalism) and placing themselves at the center of the story. In one critic’s words , “In purely journalistic terms, this is an epic disaster.”
So there was Maddow, night after night in front of her serial killer burlap board, Trump and Putin surrounded by blurry images of Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, she running twine between pins so her viewers could keep up with her racing intellect. Anyone with a Russian-y surname “had ties to Putin,”“connections to Russian intelligence,” or was at least an oligarch. She nurtured an unashamed crush on deep state clowns that the Rachel Maddow of a few years back would have smirked at—Brennan, Clapper, Comey.
She ignored or downplayed other news, devoting over 50 percent of her airtime to Russiagate alone (Trump’s Muslim visa ban got less than 6 percent). She worked to convince Americans that the cornerstone of justice was not “innocent until proven guilty” but “if there’s smoke there’s fire.” She joined journalists in knowingly publishing material whose veracity they doubted, centering on the Steele dossier .
Maddow became Infowars. She moved beyond the simpleton advocacy journalism of Bush lie peddling journo tools. She was going to save the country. So she created a story out of whole cloth that reinforced her political beliefs and convinced people it was true. And it was all justified because the fate of the republic itself hung in the balance. Any day now, Trump would peel off a rubber mask Scooby Doo-style to reveal that he was Putin all along.
And then, after years of being held together by the incantation “just wait for Mueller Time,” one day it all fell apart. The Mueller report summary was short, but it answered the most important question ever asked about a president: Trump was not a Russian asset. There was no Russiagate, no conspiracy, collusion, cooperation, or indictments, none to come and none sealed we didn’t know about, and no treason or perjury charges over the Moscow hotel or the Trump Tower meeting or anything else. The accusations were as explicit as was the conclusion. It. Did. Not. Happen.
The great progressive hope—America was run by a Russian stooge—was over and done. Maddow’s response? Break another cardinal rule of journalism and bury the lede. Okay, sure, Bill Barr says Mueller didn’t find collusion if you wanna believe that, but what matters now is that, even after Robert Mueller did not find evidence of obstruction he could charge, and the FBI before him did not find any, and Bill Barr confirmed he did not find it, Maddow still knows obstruction took place. And if only she could see the full Mueller report, she would explain it all to you. (Maddow is promoting a “day of action” for Americans to take to the streets and demand the report.) It wasn’t the Russians; it was old man Barr in the drawing room with the candlestick! Trump is guilty of failing to obstruct an investigation that cleared him!
Meanwhile, after waiting two years for Mueller, waiting two weeks for Barr to release the report was unconscionable. But two days for Barr to write the summary was too fast, proof the fix was in. Trump threatens the rule of law, but when the system works according to the law and the attorney general makes a lawful decision, it’s all an inside-job-cover-up-crisis.
A big focus for Maddow this week was a foreign government-owned company resisting an old Mueller subpoena. The case is in front of a grand jury, so the public does not know what company it is, what government is involved, what the case itself concerns, or whether it has any connection to Trump, Russia, or the Spiders from Mars. But listening to Maddow spin it all out, it sounds VERY BIG.
Over the course of a recent evening, she tied what she dubbed The Mystery Case into Watergate (the same court being used as in 1974 is about the only connection), and because the Watergate judge released some grand jury testimony to help drive Nixon from office, this bodes ill for Trump keeping the dirt Rachel just knows is there secret. It could break this wide open!
The whole oral manifesto was delivered Howard Beale-like in what seemed like one long breath, with the certainty of someone who sees ghosts and is frustrated you can’t see them too. It got so bad that recently Maddow was corrected by her own producers in real time.
It took the New York Times over a year after the Iraq war started to issue a mild “mistakes were made” kind of self-rebuke . At some point with Russiagate, many people will come to understand that there aren’t more questions than answers. They’ll abandon the straw man of waiting for prosecutors to issue a magic Certificate of Exoneration because they’ll understand that prosecutors end things by deciding not to prosecute.
But it’s hard to see Maddow returning to earth orbit. Instead of a reflective pause, she is spinning ever-more complex and nonsensical conspiracy tales, talking faster and faster to cover the gaps in logic. It is sad, but there are psychiatric terms for people who refuse to accept facts and insist they alone understand a world you can’t even see. Delusion. Denial. Psychosis. Obsession. Paranoia.
Maddow is a sad story. Others playing the cable news game never had her intellect (looking at you, Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo). They were weekend Vichy, showbiz grifters. But Maddow believed. Her goal was to end the Trump presidency on her own. And to do so, she devolved from what Glenn Greenwald called “this really smart, independent thinker into this utterly scripted, intellectually dishonest, partisan hack.”
There’s a difference between being wrong once in a while (and issuing corrections) and being wrong for two years on both the core point as well as the evidence. There is even more wrong with purposefully manipulating information to drive a specific narrative, believing that the ends justify the means.
In journalism school, the first is called making a mistake. The second, Maddow’s offense, is called propaganda."
The EU Is Tearing The UK Apart Over Brexit,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-eu-is-tearing-the-uk-apart-over-brexit-2.html/,"Authored by Tom Luongo via The Strategic Culture Foundation,
Brexit has been a fascinating thing to watch.
Despite all of the twists and turns, the incomprehensible motions, legal maneuvers and behavior of Prime Minister Theresa “I Surrender” May, for me there’s been a simple through-line to it all.
The EU does not want Brexit and if it were to happen it will inflict incredible damage to the British political system and its integrity.
This is really no different than what happened in Greece in 2015. And it was directed by Angela Merkel than and it is being directed by Merkel today.
The EU’s intransigence in negotiations, aside from it having no other option, is an elaborate bluff to separate and divide the British political class, now that the people have voted to leave.
It preyed on the divisions within the U.K.’s structure, empowering Scottish ‘nationalists,’ the SNP, while offering power to the eternal victim-status seeking Labour leadership. It knew it had a Tory leadership willing to play ball with them to find a way to deliver BRINO – Brexit in Name Only – and a civil service that would provide all the supporting data to gaslight millions.
The hysteria over a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit is akin to the hysteria we’re seeing among the hard-left over Climate Change. So, I found it fitting watching a bunch of bare-assed, self-absorbed British watermelons – green on the outside, red on the inside – disrupting Parliament this week.
Both are built on foundations of sand. And both are expressions of the fear that their narratives and political power have peaked and are now on the down side. And when people begin to feel the loss of power and the fear kicks in, they become more desperate and more willing to cheat to win.
Make no mistake, the EU is cheating here. Billions in free advertising for their union is at their beck and call and put into the mouths of MPs, Cabinet Ministers and the media to peddle the worst and most disingenuous arguments against Brexit.
And that pressure is causing real cracks in the British political system.
While Labour, the SNP and the new Independent Group try to paint Brexit as some “Tory psychodrama” for political gains to blame shift their own betrayal of voters the Tories themselves are now fracturing under the pressure somewhat.
From Nick Boles resigning from the party after his ‘Common Market 2.0’ proposal failed to Richard Drax’s mea culpa for mistakenly voting for the May/Merkel Surrender Treaty on March 29th we’re seeing the effects this is having on everyone.
Some of it is Kabuki theatre to be sure. Boles’ resignation was an obvious stunt meant to shame MPs. Even Drax’s regrets had an air of worry over the voter backlash for betraying the Leave vote.
And look at the results. Arch-Remainer and former Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, who spent months working with EU officials to strategize openly on how to betray Brexit now faces de-selection from his constituents.
That’s what it takes to get rid of these people. The so-called Independent Group resigned from their parties and refused to call by-elections to confirm their seats. This is completely against all political protocol and an insult to their constituents. But what would you expect from an arrogant, self-important ignoramus like Anna Soubry?
The reason the EU’s plan to scuttle Brexit is failing is precisely because of what I saw months ago – the British people want their will, no matter how flawed, respected. And the political class is too consumed with its own self-righteousness that it cannot see this.
The entire process has made a mockery of the democratic institutions that exist across the West.
And that was precisely the effect the EU wanted out of all of this. Because even if they lose the latest Battle of Britain, they win in creating the philosophical case as to why direct representation is a stupid form of government.
The EU is a dream arrangement for globalists. It is an unelected leadership mostly immune from the changes in demographics and voter opinions pushing humanity, a base and unruly lot in their mind, towards their chosen outcomes.
By exposing the divisions and corruption of the world’s oldest parliament the EU is furthering the argument for its inevitability in the minds of the younger generation in Britain, setting older, more experienced Leavers against younger, less worldly Remainers.
But it’s not working as well as they expected. The fear campaign has radicalized the hard-core Remain camp. They were always going to be who they are. What it hasn’t done is soften the middle of the electorate. In fact, if anything, they’ve hardened in their stance that they don’t want to be ruled by either Westminster or Brussels.
Now this is music to my libertarian ears, of course, because it highlights what happens when the costs of the political and economic status quo rise above the benefits of it – anger and rebellion.
We’re seeing it in France. We’ve yet to truly see it in Italy. And we’re only beginning to see it in Britain.
The politicians are trying to do the impossible with an angry electorate – betray their wishes and blame the other guy.
Theresa May, in the words of one of my followers, “is acting like a used-car salesman wearing down a mark.”
But her act has worn thin and so has the bullying act in Brussels. And the same can be said for the multiple levels of betrayal of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour.
As we approach April 12th, May will try her blackmail scheme one more time to satisfy her puppet-masters, this time trying to bring Corbyn into her vortex of failure, while deeper divisions are revealed within the House of Commons and more MPs resign, threaten and whine about the looming catastrophe of ‘extremists.’
The United Kingdom may not survive Brexit in its current form. But many who are pushing for disunion, the Scots, may find themselves surprised when they themselves have to face their voters.
And that would leave the EU wondering what went wrong, as they got everything they wanted – a broken, divided U.K. – and still lost the war.

Moscow Slams NATO Black Sea Drills As Alliance Vows Support To Ukraine And Georgia,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/moscow-slams-nato-black-sea-drills-as-alliance-vows-support-to-ukraine-and-georgia.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The Kremlin has slammed NATO’s multi-national “Sea Shield 2019” naval drills which kicked off in the Black Sea on Friday and will include limited Ukrainian defense forces. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said upon the military games’ beginning, which also happens to mark NATO’s 70th birthday: “Having militarized NE Europe, NATO has decided to increase its military presence in the Black Sea.”
The Sea Shield 2019 is set to run from April 5 to April 13 and involves “14 Romanian warships and six warships from Bulgaria, Canada, Greece, the Netherlands, Turkey with 2,200 troops will carry out joint combat tasks in the Black Sea region,” according to Ukraine’s Mission to NATO and the Romanian Ministry of National Defense. Aerial assets will also be deployed as part of the games.

Crucially, non-NATO countries Ukraine and Georgia will also take part — both of which have long been potential flash points between the west and Russia. However, officials reports say their involvement will be limited to coast guard maneuvers.
But NATO officials have described the exercise as “a long-planned, annual exercise led by Romania” and claimed that “neither the patrols, nor the exercise, are linked to events in Ukraine.”
“Three Allied nations [Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey] border the Black Sea, and NATO regularly conducts exercises and operations in the Black Sea in order to maintain credible deterrence and readiness,” a NATO official continued in response to questions from Russian reporters last week.

On Thursday NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters that the alliance plans to step up defense of Ukraine and Georgia in the Black Sea and Caucuses, as NATO is prepared to beef up its presence in the region .
According to Reuters :
He said the NATO allies had agreed on a package of measures to step up support for Ukraine and Georgia that included increased surveillance drills and “training of maritime forces and coast guards, port visits and exercises, and sharing information.” Ukraine and Georgia, which like Ukraine is a Russian neighbor and part of the former Soviet Union, are not NATO members.
But it doesn’t appear the Kremlin is flinching, especially given that the 24 Ukrainian sailors still in pre-trial custody following the Kerch Strait incident have just had the Moscow’s Lefortovo court extended their arrest until April 24, according to TASS .
Russian officials say the men face up to 6 years in prison if found guilty on charges which include “illegally crossing Russia’s state border”. Should that sentencing come, it will be sure to set off a new round of heated rhetoric, bringing tensions between Moscow and Washington to boiling point.

"Cyprus, Six Years Later",www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/cyprus-six-years-later.html/,"Submitted by Harris Kupperman from Adventures in Capitalism
I’m writing to you from the beach in Larnaca, Cyprus. It’s 6am and I’m jetlagged, hopped up on coffee and ready to get exploring.
Why Cyprus? Next week, I’m speaking at the annual VALUEx Caspian conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, hosted by my good friend Isaac Schwartz of Robotti & Company Advisors www.valuexkz.com . To break up the flights, I stared at a map and Cyprus seemed to be roughly on the path there. Unfortunately, after I booked the first leg, I realized that to get from Cyprus to Baku, you have to go 20 hours out of your way and transfer through Moscow. Who says global travel isn’t an adventure?
However; I have another reason for going to Cyprus. You see, a few years back, Cypriot banks did some pretty stupid things. They made some dodgy property development loans, over-expanded in consumer lending and when they ran out of bad investments in Cyprus, decided to diversify and buy almost $6 billion in Greek sovereign debt, which was almost immediately written off.
The ECB showed up, saw a smoldering crisis and decided that the prudent decision was to turn it into a raging bonfire. “Hold my beer, we’re gonna bail-in the banks.”
Depositors with more than EUR 100,000 lost 47.5% of their deposits. This was justified by pointing to the Russian connection in Cyprus—yes, Cypriot banks had Russian depositors. However, plenty of Cypriots also lost half their deposits. More importantly, the bail-in led to capital flight, lack of investment and a further round of detonation of the Cypriot economy. ( I wrote about this back in 2013 ).
Even after the bail-in, the Cypriot banking system was still effectively insolvent. The ECB decided that the best way to solve for this, would be to force the banks to de-lever. This sounds fine in theory, but NPEs are hard to restructure or sell. Therefore, to de-lever, you reduce new lending and let performing loans run off your books. If you continue to reduce your performing loans each year, at some point, all you have left are non-performing loans. Hence, despite plenty of NPE exits and asset sales over the past few years, Cypriot banks still have dangerously high NPE ratios. Even worse, when you stop lending, businesses suffer and asset values decline, leading to an increase in new NPE formations. Logic would state that the only way to solve for this is to grow the loan book, dilute the NPE exposures with new performing loans and then use retained earnings to rebuild the capital base. Please, don’t ask the ECB to use logic.
We all take banks for granted. Imagine not being able to get basic working capital loans, not being able to get a mortgage, not being about to effect transactions for fear of keeping capital in the Cypriot banking system. In the ECB’s desire to hurt a few Russians, they hurt over 1 million Cypriot citizens.
As I prepared for my trip to Cyprus, I looked over my notes ( Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 ) from my trip to Greece a year and half ago. Same dilemma, same bureaucratic cure, same economic malaise. Glad I talked myself out of buying Greek banks. You’d think that these guys at the ECB would learn by now. The difference, is that whereas the demographics and macro situation in Greece is weak, those metrics are going in the other direction in Cyprus.
Cyprus has just over 1 million people, it is a low-tax jurisdiction in the EU and tax evasion is ALWAYS in a bull market. Non-performing loans are finally being restructured, property values are starting to recover and the Cypriot economy is back to growth. Most importantly, it appears that a whole lot of natural gas has been discovered off the coast of Cyprus. While it will take many years before this discovery becomes tax revenue, every step along the way will lead to foreign investment, more high paying jobs and new capital in the banking system. Basically, there’s now a catalyst for the recovery.
In any case, I’m in Cyprus. I’ll be taking a bunch of meetings, visiting some historic ruins and drinking too much Zivania (Cyprus’ answer to Raki). Basically, the same recipe I’ve used to learn about every other country I’ve visited. Now, it’s time to wake up my wife and get going.

"Hyperbole and Outrage as Substitutes for Thought, Facts, Accuracy and Truth",www.therussophile.org,John Atcheson,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/hyperbole-and-outrage-as-substitutes-for-thought-facts-accuracy-and-truth.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
These days you can’t pick up a paper or tune into the news without hearing someone expressing their outrage about something or other and usually it is about as newsworthy as the sun rising in the East. The reason it gets reported is the outrage itself, not the topic. Trump is a master at faux outrage – witness his oft repeated claim that the Mueller investigation was “disgraceful,”“outrageous” or a “witch hunt.” Trying to determine whether the Russians interfered with our election and whether our President participated – given the various meetings and emails between them – was anything but outrageous. In fact, it was and is simply a prudent and necessary inquiry.
As for hyperbole, take Congressman Bob Bishop’s (R Utah) comment that “… the ideas behind the Green New Deal are tantamount to genocide.”
Genocide? Really? So taking steps to ward off massive draughts, heat waves, wildfires, extreme storms, social unrest and an explosion in the number of migrants and terrorists and the hundreds of millions of deaths they would collectively cause and the trillions it would cost the economy is genocide? How is it that Bishop is not laughed out of Congress? Instead, his comment got a fair amount of press.
And by the way, this is a bipartisan affront to sanity. Go to any campus and you’ll see so-called liberals in high dudgeon about some egregious comment someone made, or demanding “safe rooms” because some comedian is coming who might somehow injure them with a bit of humor at the expense of some sacred cow or other – like maybe needing a safe room. Look, enduring truths and values don’t need protection from humor – indeed, they are often strengthened by it.
Or take “micro-aggressions.” The key word here is “micro” as in “extremely small; minute in scope or capability.” Now, isn’t it axiomatic that extremely small or minute things aren’t newsworthy, or important for that matter? And yes, when they accumulate over a lifetime they can assume a weight and heft that is significant. But celebrating – indeed embracing — each individual microaggression doesn’t dampen their effect, it amplifies them. Then there’s “trigger warnings”– the idea that a joke, statement or passage that might challenge someone’s equanimity should be preceded by a warning that they might – gasp – be exposed to something that distresses them a bit.
Trump’s Fox-inspired, morning bowel-movement tweets are a variation on the theme. He is often outraged, but more often, he makes outrageous, counter factual statements, knowing they will be covered, precisely because they are outrageous. They should be ignored by the press and media. Any rhetorician will tell you that repeating the absurd makes it less absurd to those hearing it over and over again.
Conservatives who employ outrage are attempting to substitute emotional intensity for realty, to give weight to the weightless. But because the press responds as if it were important that someone was outraged, or that someone reacted hysterically to a minor provocation, their attempts are all too often successful.
Liberals who exhibit outrage might be trying to inject an element of social justice into the national debate – to substitute outrage for the kind of collective action that’s been missing from the progressive movement until recently. More often, they are attempts to make other liberals hew their line and accept their orthodoxy.
All of these things share a fundamentally anti-democratic goal—to stifle speech that is not consistent with the perspective of the outraged complainer. Their ultimate purpose is to shut down debate and encourage an information monoculture, the very antithesis of a democratic dialogue. It’s an attempt to establish the dictatorship of the supremely sensitive.
A resilient and sustainable society demands a robust discussion. The terms of debate must, of course, be constrained to the rational and the real, but we’ve had the blueprint for that kind of discussion since the Enlightenment. For example, simple assertions – no matter how intensely stated — are, by themselves, useless; balance is useless. But statements based on facts and backed up by data demand attention. These are the kind of ideas that should be tested in the public forum, examined and accepted or discarded based on how well they comport with data, context, reality and plausible conclusions based on facts. That’s the function journalism should perform, at its highest level. It was the driver behind Edward R. Murrow’s challenge of Joe McCarthy’s bullying; it was the source of Walter Cronkite’s challenge to continuing the Viet Nam War; it was the driver behind Woodward and Bernstein’s Watergate investigation.
But focusing on outrage or reporting someone’s hyperbolic rants is nonsense, it reduces journalism to its lowest form, and it is destructive to a civil society.
If you want to know how Trump can get away with obviously and overtly violating the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution; how he can consort with Russian Oligarchs; withhold his tax returns; subvert the constitutional separation of powers with fake emergencies; overtly support extreme right wing terrorists, and commit other high crimes and misdemeanors, his use of outrage and hyperbole in the service of distraction, and the press’s abject surrender to it can go a long way toward explaining it.
It’s worth remembering that not too long ago – through the 70’s, in fact — the press and media were barred from holding monopoly positions in news markets; they had to present a variety of perspectives; and they had to provide an opportunity for opposing viewpoints. We still had our share of yellow journalism, but those standards kept it at a minimum, and assured that counter-arguments were presented on outlets like Fox (which didn’t exist until the Fairness Doctrine was abandoned). Faux outrage stood little chance of gaining traction in such an environment.
Today, if you want to get a headline – or get one kicked off the front page – you just need to shout out something outrageous, or feign outrage. Once upon a time, it took a President with a Wag the Dog strategy to dominate the headlines and the news at 7. Today, anyone can do it. Just scream or tweet – the more idiotic and intensely stated the utterance, the more likely it is to succeed.

CAIRO, April 6. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that progress had been made in the issue of resuming flights to Egypt’s resorts, adding that it is premature to come up with forecasts regarding the potential timeframes.
“Experts are working, progress is obvious,” he said answering a question on the issue following talks with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry. “As to when [flights will resume], guesswork is not very productive anyway.”.

The Naiveté Is What's Shocking,www.therussophile.org,P.M. Carpenter,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-naivete-is-whats-shocking.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Mimi Rocah is a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York (serving under Preet Bharara), a distinguished professor of criminal law at Pace University, a legal analyst for MSNBC and NBC News, and just one of the many erudite dupes who, in her words , “was inclined to give [William] Barr the benefit of the doubt” as he testified, in a return performance, before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the position of United States attorney general.
Turns out that Ms. Rocah’s faith in a Trump nominee was misplaced. Turns out that Barr didn’t really “understand the unique importance of [the Department of Justice’s’] independence and integrity.” Turns out that the public’s need to have confidence “that decisions made at DOJ are based on facts, evidence, and law and not political considerations” was not, after all, at the top of William Barr’s priorities.
Shocking. Yes, shocking it is that a Trump appointee would possess anything but the very highest ethics. Continues Rocah:
“In 48 hours, in just a few short paragraphs, Barr essentially threw out the window the facts, findings, nuances, and ‘difficult questions of law and fact’ of Mueller’s nearly two-year investigation which, to any rational observer, was thorough and conducted with integrity….
“[T]his looked pre-determined and political — like a lawyer trying to protect his client, not a public servant trying to get the truth and facts where they belong.”
What’s authentically shocking is the number of scholars, analysts, and politicos who still persist in sliding into the delusion that Donald Trump would appoint anyone but, let’s call it, the ethically pliable. Those in the administration who indeed maintained some sense of dignity, honor, and self-respect — H.R. McMaster, James Mattis, even Gary Cohn — are of course long gone, replaced by the likes of a John Bolton or Larry Kudlow.
How a brilliant attorney and legal analyst such as Mimi Rocah could have fallen into the hallucinatory belief that Trump would or, by now, even could nominate anyone of unshakable ethics, I’ll just never understand."
Capitalism or Socialism. Which Will it Be?,www.therussophile.org,Robert Freeman,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/capitalism-or-socialism-which-will-it-be.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
We already know the most hackneyed slogan of the next election cycle: “socialism.” Utah Representative Chris Stewart has even launched and “Anti-Socialism Caucus.”
But socialism has lost a lot of its epithetic punch since the days of the Cold War, when the world lived under a nuclear Sword of Damocles. Here are a few reasons, on both sides, why socialism doesn’t sound so scary anymore. You might want to save it to parry the lunatic ravings of your crazy uncle at the next family gathering.
Ten important things that Capitalism has given us: Cataclysmic climate change, literally threatening life on earth. Markets cannot price common public natural resources, like the atmosphere or oceans or polar ice caps, though they undoubtedly have value. So, the prize goes to who can use them up first. A perfect prescription for planetary predation. The Great Depression of the 1930s , where the capitalist system blew itself up , dragging the whole of the rest of the world down with it, and giving direct rise to Adolf Hitler. The Great Recession of 2008, where the capitalist system blew itself up again , dragging the whole of the rest of the world down with it, and giving indirect rise to Donald Trump. The greatest economic inequality in the developed world , literally approaching feudalism and destroying democracy to make sure there can be no public regulation of obscene private predation. The highest health care costs in the developed world, by far , and with some of the worst outcomes in many categories. Runaway, parasitic military spending , and for a military that can’t seem to win any of its wars—think Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria. A decimated industrial heartland and a cast-off industrial workforce of tens of millions of workers that used to be the envy of the world. Skyrocketing “diseases of despair” including the world’s worst national opioid epidemic and a declining average life span for the entire population. The highest rate of incarceration of its citizenry in the world , by the U.S., with 784 of every 100,000 people in jail. Russia is far back in second, with 581. $22 trillion of national debt , or $67,000 for every man, woman, and child in the nation. With insufficient purchasing power in the hands of workers, this is the economic cocaine that’s needed to keep the economy going.
Here, on the other hand, are 10 important things Socialism has given us: China’s economy which is blowing the doors off of the United States. The income of the average Chinese worker is up 10 TIMES over the past 40 years. Median U.S. incomes are flat over the same period. Which workers do you think are more loyal to their system? Nordic countries—Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark—with the highest self-reported rates of happiness in the world . All proudly practice democratic socialism. Recovery from the Great Depression via public programs that employed millions , like the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and others. Recovery from the Great Recession , albeit by the government replenishing the capital of the big banks that had been driven to actuarial bankruptcy by their own greed. The internet —yes, it was invented by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, in 1969, and only later commercialized. The interstate highway system that created the first unified, continental-scale market, setting off the greatest economic boom in the history of the world. National standards for safe drugs, foods, and workplaces , and virtual eradication of tuberculosis, smallpox, and other major diseases. Social Security so that elderly people can retire with a modicum of dignity and security. Without it, 40% of the elderly would be in poverty. With it, only 9% are. Medicare, again, so elderly would not be bankrupted by health care costs . Medicare has administrative costs that are 1/10 th those of private (capitalist) health insurance programs. The global campaign to fix the hole in the ozone layer, caused by chlorofluorocarbons . The hole was threatening the world with catastrophic levels of ultra-violet rays. Collective action fixed it.
Socialism isn’t fundamentally about public ownership of private resources. It is about collective action in pursuit of common goals, where private action has destroyed or damaged the common good. It is demonized by concentrated private wealth precisely because it is so effective at redressing so many of the problems that concentrated private wealth has inflicted on society and the world.

Where the Hell Is Rod Rosenstein?,www.therussophile.org,Cody Fenwick,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/where-the-hell-is-rod-rosenstein.html/,"— from Alternet
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to lead the Russia investigation, and he oversaw the probe until his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was forced to resign from the Justice Department.
But as the end of the investigation becomes ever more mired in controversy — driven by the actions of Attorney General Bill Barr and his lack of transparency — Rosenstein’s absence from the public stage is growing increasingly conspicuous.
Some of Barr’s most controversial decisions involve Rosenstein directly. In his letter summarizing the “principal conclusions” of the investigation, Barr said that Mueller had declined to reach a decision about whether President Donald Trump had committed the crime of obstruction of justice in the course of the probe, the special counsel left “it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.” (It is far from clear this is what Mueller intended, however; many suspect he wanted Congress to make the final judgment.)
Barr said that he and Rosenstein together reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude Trump obstructed justice.
Since this letter has come out, though, we have yet to hear publicly about Rosenstein’s thoughts on the matter from the man himself. (The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.)
This is significant for several reasons. Rosenstein, as the official who deemed it necessary to appoint Mueller in the first place, has more credibility than Barr in the investigation. He was also a much more bipartisan pick to supervise the investigation — he was confirmed by a vote of 94-6 in the Senate, while Barr’s nomination was approved in a divisive 54-45 vote. The deputy attorney general consistently defended the investigation even as Republicans and the president maligned and attacked him. From this perspective, if he spoke out and affirmed Barr’s decisions, it could give them more credibility.
On the other hand, Rosenstein is in some ways even more conflicted than Barr. Arguably, Barr should have recused from the investigation because he drafted a memo attacking Mueller’s investigation the summer before he was appointed to the head of the Justice Department. But there’s an even clearer reason why Rosenstein should have been recused from the obstruction investigation: He is a key witness in any case against the president.
That’s because it was Rosenstein who wrote the justification that Trump used to fire former FBI Director Jame Comey. Comey was then overseeing the Russia investigation in May 2017, and while Rosenstein’s memo argued for his ouster because of his actions during the Hillary Clinton email case, Trump later admitted on TV that he fired the director because of “the Russia thing.”
This act triggered the obstruction investigation. But while Rosenstein was involved in this central act, he still oversaw the investigation for nearly two years, and we have now learned that he was a part of making the final decision about whether Trump’s behavior was criminal.
“It is very odd for someone to be supervising the investigation for which they are a witness, let alone a central witness to the underlying act,” Jed Shugerman, a professor at Fordham Law School, told The Atlantic . “It compromises the conclusion that they did not find a criminal act, because it gets Rosenstein off the hook in several ways.”
While this issue had been discussed in media, few major figures publicly called for Rosenstein’s recusal — perhaps because, for the reasons mentioned above, he was viewed as being almost uniquely credible. Now that assessment must be revisited. (Sessions, the attorney general at the time of Mueller’s appointment, was recused because he was involved in Trump’s campaign. For that very reason, though, it seems he shouldn’t have been involved in Comey’s firing, as he was.)
And in recent days, multiple outlets have reported that members of Mueller’s team are fuming about Barr’s handling of the investigation’s final report, believing he has misled the public about how damaging the findings are for the president. In response, Barr’s Justice Department appears to be going on offense. This only makes the fact of Rosenstein’s absence from the public stage even more troubling — is he really going to sit back while his boss and the vital investigation he oversaw are feuding?
This is particularly perplexing because Rosenstein was initially expected to leave the Justice Department in March. CNN reported in mid-March, though, that he decided to stay on longer to be a “heat shield” for any “fallout” from the Mueller probe .
Right now, he doesn’t seem to be absorbing any heat. So why did he stick around?
All of these circumstances surrounding the still developing conclusion of the Russia investigation make it paramount that Rosenstein come forward, address the concerns, and provide satisfactory answers. Congress is already preparing to have Barr testify, and Mueller will almost certainly be called before lawmakers. Rosenstein, too, must make an appearance and explain his actions to the American people."
Pompeo: NATO Must Confront 'Emerging Threats' From Russia and China in Venezuela,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/pompeo-nato-must-confront-emerging-threats-from-russia-and-china-in-venezuela-3.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
On Thursday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged NATO leaders to confront the “emerging threats” posed by the Russian and Chinese militaries across the globe, but especially in Venezuela.
“We must adapt our alliance to confront emerging threats… whether that’s Russian aggression, uncontrolled migration, cyberattacks, threats to energy security, Chinese strategic competition, including technology and 5G, and many other issues,” Pompeo said . Though he more specifically linked Russia with the Venezuela crisis in comments to reporters, China remained a talking point as part of the discussion throughout.
Pompeo addressed a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Washington marking the transatlantic military alliance’s 70th anniversary. He raised the issue of Venezuela in response to a question over Moscow’s alleged increase in military activity in places like the Black sea , where three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crew were seized in the Kerch Strait last November.
According to remarks made after the meeting to reporters, Reuters noted , “Pompeo said NATO members had agreed Russian troops needed to withdraw from Venezuela, where they were deployed in support of President Nicolas Maduro, who is under pressure from a coalition of more than 50 countries, including the United States, to step down.”
Also according to the report, Venezuela’s deputy foreign minister, Ivan Gil, shot back on Thursday saying Russian forces will stay in Venezuela “as long as needed and did not rule out the possibility more could be added.”
This echoes prior Russian foreign ministry statements on the recent deployment of some 100 Russian troops led by a general. Russia described its forces in Venezuela as “specialists” who are servicing existing contracts related to defense procurement, and which is perfectly legal according to prior agreements between two sovereign countries.
Further as part of the conference NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow to release the Ukrainian vessels and their crews which had been held since the Nov. 25 Kerch Strait incident .
Stoltenberg’s words suggest things could grow hot again in the Black Sea and Caucuses, as NATO is prepared to given more support to regional allies there. According to Reuters :
He said the NATO allies had agreed on a package of measures to step up support for Ukraine and Georgia that included increased surveillance drills and “training of maritime forces and coast guards, port visits and exercises, and sharing information.” Ukraine and Georgia, which like Ukraine is a Russian neighbor and part of the former Soviet Union, are not NATO members.
As for China, officials in Beijing this week firmly rejected reports that the Chinese military had entered Venezuela on a humanitarian aid mission.
“I don’t know where you got this information or for what purpose was it produced, but I can tell you this: what you said is simply not true,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Tuesday.
“The Chinese government’s position on the Venezuela issue is consistent and clear-cut,” Shuang added, noting that China opposes “external interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs, and believe the country’s government and opposition need to seek a political solution through peaceful dialogue.”
Last week the White House had warned all foreign troops and countries “external to the Western Hemisphere” to keep their forces out of Venezuela."
Netanyahu not to evacuate ‘single’ settler from West Bank,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/netanyahu-not-to-evacuate-single-settler-from-west-bank.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has made clear to US President Donald Trump that he will not evacuate “a single person” from settlements in the occupied West Bank.
“I said there can’t be the removal of even one settlement, and [that Israel insists on] our continued control of all the territory to the west of the Jordan,” Netanyahu told Israel’s Channel 13 news network.
The Israeli premier said he had set out the same position to Trump and former US president Barack Obama, stressing that he was unwilling to see even a single Israeli being evacuated from the West Bank settlements.
“All the settlements, without exception, those that are in blocs and those that aren’t, need to remain under Israeli sovereignty,” Netanyahu claimed, adding that the plan would “eventually” happen.
Asked in the interview whether he expects Washington to recognize the Israeli claim on the West Bank as Trump did with the Golan Heights last month, Netanyahu said, “Wait until the next term.”
The US president will likely unveil his controversial proposal on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the so-called “deal of the century”, on May 15.
Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has made regional tours over the past two years to secretly win support for the plan.
Israel occupied the West Bank as well as East Jerusalem al-Quds during the Six-Day War in 1967. It later annexed the Palestinian city in a move not recognized by the international community.
Israel lays claim to the whole city, but the Palestinians view its eastern sector as the capital of their future sovereign state.
The prospect of peace between Israelis and Palestinians was dealt a major blow in December 2017, when Trump recognized Jerusalem al-Quds as the “capital” of Israel.
He also moved the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the occupied city on May 14, 2018, in what appeared to be an intentional coincidence with the 70th anniversary of Nakba Day. The occasion marks the expulsion by Israel of Palestinians from their motherland.
Palestinians have already rejected Trump’s yet-to-be-unveiled plan, with President Mahmoud Abbas calling it “the slap of the century.”
About 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds.
Palestinians want the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem al-Quds as its capital.
The last round of Israeli-Palestinian talks collapsed in 2014. Among the major sticking points in those negotiations was Israel’s continued settlement expansion on Palestinian territories.
‘Israel almost identical to Daesh’
On Friday, a Columbia University professor wrote on his Facebook page that the only difference between Israel and the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group was that Zionist columnists defended the regime’s “terrorist cause.”
The “murderous thugs” of the terrorist outfit “conquered parts of Syria and declared a ‘caliphate,’” wrote Hamid Dabashi, professor in the university’s Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies.
“Their ISRAELI counterparts meanwhile conquered parts of Syria and declared it part of their Zionist settler colony.”
He added, “The only difference: ISIS (Daesh) does not have a platoon of clean shaven and well coiffured columnists at the New York Times propagating the cause of the terrorist outfit as the Zionists columnists do on a regular basis.”
Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. The Syrian government says the Israeli regime and its Western and regional allies are aiding Takfiri terrorist groups wreaking havoc on the country.

Italia’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on April 5 that Italian businessman Sergio Zanotti, who was held hostage in Syria for three years, has been freed.
“At the end of complex, delicate operations of information, investigation and diplomacy that took place simultaneously, we succeeded today in obtaining the release of Sergio Zanotti, kidnapped in Syria in April 2016,” Conte said in a statement.
The Italian PM added that Zanotti’s general condition appears to be good and that he will return to Italian capital of Rome within a few hours.
57-year old Zanotti was abducted by terrorists in southern Turkey near the Syrian border in 2016. During his captivity, the terrorists sent at least two videos of him to his relatives. In one of the video, Zanotti can be seen kneeling in front of a masked gunman and asking the Italian government to intervene and prevent his execution.
Syrian opposition sources said that the Italian man was likely abducted by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former branch of al-Qaeda in Syria, or one of its radical allies. These terrorist groups occupy more than 90% of the governorate of Idlib in northern Syria.
The Italian government didn’t provide additional information on how Zanotti was released from captivity. However, there is a good chance that a ransom was paid. Idlib terrorists are known for kidnapping foreigners as way to fund their activities.

On April 6, warplanes of the Western-backed Libyan Government of National Accord (LGNA) air force carried out a series of airstrikes on gatherings of the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the towns of Suq al-Khamis, Mizda, Jendouba and Wadi al-Rabi’a south of the Libya’s capital, Tripoli.
Pro-LNA sources confirmed that the LGNA air force conducted a series of airstrikes on several units, which were advancing towards Tripoli. However, they said that the airstrikes were ineffective.
The LGNA air force operates a few squadrons of old warplanes, including nine Aero L-39 Albatros trainers / light attack warplanes, two Mig-23ML fighter bombers and one Mi-24 gunship helicopter. Most of these warplanes are stationed in Misurata air base.
In response to the airstrikes, the LNA announced that it will establish a no-fly zone over the western part of Libya. The army also threatened that the Libyan Air Force (LAF) will attack any airbase that would support LGNA forces.
The LAF controls several airbases in eastern Libya and operates dozens of warplanes, including two Mirage F1 fighter jets, twelve Mig-21 fighter jets, three Mig-23ML fighter bombers and a Su-22 fighter bomber. These warplanes will for sure allow the LAF to gain air superiority over the western part of the country.
The upcoming few hours may witness some aerial engagements over western Libya, if the LGNA air force continues its airstrikes on LNA units.

Study claims ‘right-wing’ dominate on social media,www.therussophile.org,fwmstaff,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/study-claims-right-wing-dominate-on-social-media.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Despite media censorship, conservatives have not given up on social media, according to a new study.
Calls for mass censorship of conservatives continue, by labeling conservatives as “far right” and “extremist”.
EuroNews reported that the “[F]ar right dominates online political debate” adding that “online political discussion has been hijacked by fringe populist groups according to new research”.
Ahead of May’s European Parliament elections, data compiled by Alto Analytics showed that all over the continent, from Poland to Spain, posts on social media show a huge interest in anti-immigration, anti-globalist issues with less than 0,1 percent of users creating around 10 percent of all political posts.
Notable parties like Spain’s VOX and Germany’s AfD (Alternative for Germany) have dominated the debate online according to the findings.
The sheer extent of the posts online has resulted in a dominance on social media platforms largely focused on anti-establishment voices. Immigration and the complicity of the elites in stripping voters of their sovereign rights are some of the biggest issues facing voters in the upcoming elections.
Mainstream media however continue to complain about the conservative “fringe” even though conservatives and sovereignists are no longer isolated and marginal.
Rather than actually engage in debate, they claim that dissidents are either “bots” or “far-right extremists” in order to censor them.
In the US, Atlantic writer David Frum, a neo-conservative, even warned that Republican anti-immigration voters will put America on the path to “fascism”. Frum also claims that “immigrants are making America safer” because they commit fewer crimes than the native-born population, a notion not supported by statistics.
In 2018, Trump questioned why the US would accept more immigrants from Haiti and “shithole countries” in Africa rather than places like Norway. The bulk of these immigrants to the US and Europe are from countries where crime and insecurity reign.
In 2015, the Lageso, the German acronym for the agency for health and social affairs, became a hot spot in the German capital and the symbol for everytheing that went wrong already in the early days of the migrant crisis: families camping in the open, confusion about procedure, a bureaucracy that was wrestling with itself as much as with the number of newcomers, completely unprepared.
This chaos has continued, even after an estimated eight million people came forth in Germany to help the migrants – one German in ten. The number comes from a study conducted by the Protestant Church in Germany in late 2015, but the number of volunteers has remained high even years after the peak.
The reason for the administrative nightmare may be that well-organised criminal syndicates have been responsible for the flood of African migrants who arrived in Spain last year.
Filmmaker Lauren Southern told RT that in a rare interview with a human trafficker who helps ferry migrants from Morocco to Spain, the criminal explained that each client pays between €2 000 and €4 000 for the trip – a business model which Southern described as incredibly lucrative.
In this way, nearly 60 000 illegals arrived in the EU.

The New York Times WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Friday its latest round of economic sanctions against the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, this time aimed at oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba, a country that the administration has accused of propping up Mr. Maduro’s authoritarian government. In a speech to the Venezuelan exile community in Houston, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States is levying sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. , Venezuela’s state-run oil company, as well as on two international companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba. “Venezuela’s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people,” said Mr. Pence, who is expected to address the United Nations Security Council next week on the situation in Venezuela. The goal of the sanctions, senior administration officials said, was to force a “recalibration” of the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba, which, alongside China and Russia, has been defending the Maduro government. But in the short run, they are meant to end the arrangement by which the Maduro government provides oil to Cuba in exchange for intelligence and counterintelligence services while the Venezuelan people lack food, medicine and clean water. Venezuela has been shipping 20,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, according to experts in the oil industry and administration officials. Russ Dallen, the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, who specializes in the Venezuelan oil industry, said the most likely outcome of the sanctions would be to create an atmosphere in which shipping companies would be even more wary of doing business with either Cuba or Venezuela, for fear of triggering sanctions. He said they were also meant to “name and shame” companies that have transported Venezuelan oil to Cuba so that Mr. Maduro can help an ideological ally rather than use profits from the oil to feed a starving population. “It makes Cuba and Venezuela even more radioactive,” he said. Mr. Dallen, who tracks oil shipments leaving Venezuela, said that some of the ships had begun turning off their transponders when in Venezuelan ports, something regulations prohibit but is a technique used in countries like Iran to conceal their presence in the country. One ship, Mr. Dallen said, had recently left its transponder off until it reached Europe. The sanctions come as Venezuela has faced a month of blackouts that have resulted in an estimated loss of a week’s oil production. President Trump has thrown his support behind Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, who in January declared himself the country’s interim president and who has demanded Mr. Maduro’s departure. Venezuela’s economy and population have slipped further into crisis — with blackouts, as well as food and water shortages — while Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaidó appear to be trying to wait each other out . A senior administration official said on Friday that the latest round of sanctions would “tighten the noose of the financial strangulation of Maduro and his cronies.” Those sanctions come weeks after the Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on a Russia-based bank that it accused of helping Mr. Maduro’s government sidestep American financial penalties. But it has been more than two months since the Trump administration began imposing sanctions in Venezuela in hopes of pushing Mr. Maduro’s government out of power. But to people living in Caracas, the capital, it is not clear that his grip on power is loosening, despite the American effort to target governors, generals and the state-run oil company and to cancel visas for Mr. Maduro’s friends and family members. The American official said that there would be more actions by the United States in the coming weeks and that a military response continued to be a “very serious option.” The official hinted that a red line for American intervention would be any threat to arrest Mr. Guaidó.

U.S considering use of military action against Venezuela — US Official,www.therussophile.org,Murasel-En,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/u-s-considering-use-of-military-action-against-venezuela-us-official.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The United States is considering the use of military action against Venezuela as diplomatic measures are becoming inefficient, a high-ranking US administration official said on Friday.
The United States’ diplomatic tools “continue to diminish due to Maduro’s recent actions,” the official said.
“These tools are diminishing, which is leaving us with increased economic tools and increased economic pressure and also a military option, which, as President Trump has said, is on the table,” the source went on.
He added that the military option was the result that “no one would like to see,” but it remains “the one being seriously considered as events unfold.”
“The European community, the United States and the Lima group have made it clear that the consequences of any harm that comes, or an arrest of Juan Guaido would be devastating to Maduro, it would be the worst and last mistake he makes, and, therefore, we are watching very closely,” the official said.
Trump earlier said his country has almost run out of economic and political options on Venezuela and was now considering the military scenario.
Juan Guaido, Venezuelan opposition leader and parliament speaker, whose appointment to that position had been cancelled by the country’s Supreme Court, declared himself interim president at a rally in the country’s capital of Caracas on January 23. Several countries, including the United States, Lima Group members (excluding Mexico), as well as the Organization of American States, recognized him as president.
Venezuela’s incumbent President Nicolas Maduro blasted these actions as an attempted coup and said that he was cutting diplomatic ties with the United States.
In contrast, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Iran, China , Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Syria and Turkey voiced support for Maduro.

Russia’s stance on Israeli attacks on Syria unchanged — Russian FM,www.therussophile.org,Murasel-En,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russias-stance-on-israeli-attacks-on-syria-unchanged-russian-fm.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Russia proceeds from the need for rigorous respect for Syria’s sovereignty and the inadmissibility of Israeli attacks on Syria’s territory, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview.
“Our principled stance concerning shelling Syria’s territory has remained unchanged. We have always clearly expressed our attitude to that. We proceed from the need for strict respect for Syria’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. We are opposed to turning the country’s territory into a scene of armed standoff between various regional players,” he said when asked to comment on remarks by some political analysts about softening Moscow’s stance on Israeli shelling.
“During our contacts with all parties concerned, we highlight the importance of preventing an upsurge in tensions and the dangerous escalation of the situation in Syria, which are fraught with negative consequences for both neighboring countries and the Middle East region in general,” Lavrov stressed.
Russia’s top diplomat noted that Russia, cooperating with Iran and Turkey, contributed to work to set up a de-escalation zone in Syria’s south and southwest. “Now these areas are under the control of the Syrian government. Russian military police officers help maintain law and order there,” Lavrov added.

LIBYA: Battle for Tripoli – Russia Plays at ‘Moderating’ Role While Favoring Haftar’s LNA,www.therussophile.org,Joaquin Flores,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/libya-battle-for-tripoli-russia-plays-at-moderating-role-while-favoring-haftars-lna.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MOSCOW – Russia calls on warring parties in Libya to return to the negotiating table and resolve disputes peacefully. Lev Dengov, head of the contact group on intra-Libyan settlement at the Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, explained to Russian media.
The diplomat also said that the aggravation of the situation occurred two weeks before the planned conference. Representatives of Tripoli, headed by the leader of the Government of National Accord Faiz Sarraj, and delegates from the Parliament in Tobruk under the leadership of the Commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) Khalifa Haftar were invited. The special representative noted that Libyans are seriously afraid of foreign intervention and the repetition of the 2011 scenario.
The escalation of the situation in Libya began on April 4 – General Khalifa Haftar, who heads the country’s eastern provinces controlled by the national government in Tobruk, announced the start of a military “operation to liberate Tripoli” and called on residents of the city to voluntarily surrender and go to his side.
After the video message, in which Khalifa Haftar called upon the people of Tripoli to “lay down their arms and raise the white flag,” Prime Minister Faiz Sarraj ordered the troops to be fully operational in order to protect civilians. Military aircraft were scrambled.
As Russian contact-group representative Lev Dengov explains, Moscow is concerned about the aggravation of the situation and calls on both sides to resolve the disputes that have arisen by peaceful means.
“We urge Tobruk and Tripoli to avoid bloodshed.”Throughout this time, our country has maintained contacts with all parties to the conflict – with representatives of Tobruk, Tripoli, and Misurata. Therefore, to say that we support any one side is unfair. We urge the parties to return to a productive peaceful dialogue, to the positions stated during the Palermo conference,” the special representative said.
“The most important thing is to prevent foreign intervention so that the conflict can be resolved without the involvement of third actors,” he added.
“There is a growing concern among the residents of Tripoli that the events of eight years ago may repeat,” the politician said.
FRN assesses that these comments come as a form of diplomatic cover. While it is certainly logical that Russia does not want foreign intervention outside of their own efforts, it is also clear that Russia has overall be en favoring Haftar’s forces from Tobruk. He has already united the vast majority of Libya, and Sirte, Misurata, and Tripoli remain the only areas in control of Sarraj. Sarraj is favored by the west, and is recognized by the UN. However, he is backed by Al Qaeda-type formations, and has been unable to bring stability, let alone economic growth to the war-torn country. This creates a delicate scenario for Russia.
Prior to this, on April 4, speaking at the Libyan Youth Forum, General Haftar said that the political crisis in the country would be resolved already this month by creating a single government. At the time however, experts did not accept the words of Haftar as a possible threat to the authorities in Tripoli – in mid-April it was planned to hold a national conference at which talks were expected between representatives of the East, the West, as well as southern provinces and Misurata, the third largest force in the country, not controlled by Sarraj, nor Haftar. However, it is understood that Misurata sees their fate tied to Sarraj and Tripoli. Should Tripoli be unified with the rest of Libya under Haftar, then Misurata would have no options.
In February, Haftar’s forces seized the largest oil field in Libya, al-Sharara, without encountering much resistance from Tripoli or Misurata. Then there were reports in the press that the army was moving to the south-west of the country, subordinating more and more new areas. Given that the LNA already controls most of the coast, where large export terminals are located, it is safe to say that deliveries of Libyan oil abroad are now almost completely in the hands of Haftar. – Advertisement –
The intervention never stopped. “American aviation still strikes at terrorist formations,” the political scientist noted. – This situation is unstable, since there are two centers of power and many different groups that have their own armed structures. And it can not last forever. Will Haftar have enough strength to extend control to the whole country? Before that, nobody could do it.
According to Senator Alexei Pushkov, due to the multiplicity of centers of power in Libya, virtually no Western state has enough authority in Libyan affairs in order to get some kind of compromise from them.
The last round of peace talks between the two opposing camps was held in late February. Then, in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, Faiz Saraj and Khalifa Haftar held talks, at which the parties addressed the most important issues of intra-Libyan settlement. In particular, they reaffirmed their commitment to hold national parliamentary elections in the spring. This idea was expressed during last year’s Palermo Conference by the UN Special Representative for Libya Gassan Salame. It was supposed that the elections would put an end to the existing dual power in the country – according to their results a single parliament was to be formed.
The protracted crisis in Libya is a consequence of the direct and illegal intervention of NATO in the affairs of the country, which led to chaos, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
“As a result, this country was plunged into chaos, became a source of regional instability, a hotbed of terrorism,” said Lavrov in an interview with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram before going to Cairo.
The situation in Libya again escalated in early April. The commander of the Libyan National Army, Marshal Khalifa Haftar, announced the launch of an offensive on Tripoli to dismiss the government of national consensus led by Fayez Sarraj, which he considers terrorist.
In turn, in the Libyan capital declared full combat readiness.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at a press conference in Tripoli called on the parties to avoid military clashes.
The UN Security Council supported the Secretary General and announced his intention to bring to justice those responsible for the escalation of the conflict.
In 2011, the United States and the European Union supported the Libyan rebels and promoted the coup d’etat “the Arab spring”, in which the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed, and in terms of the number of victims this conflict became the largest in the Middle East, not counting the war in Syria.
So far, clashes continue in the country, besides, dual power has reigned there – a parliament elected by the people sits in the eastern city of Tobruk, and the government of Sarraj, formed with the support of the United Nations and Europe, sits in Tripoli.

“There’s gold in them thar missiles,” cried US President Donald Trump. And, no, I am not reporting on the Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel comedic film from 1934, “Them Thar Hills.” Today’s nuclear comedy will end tragically. Finally, with no other options on his desktop, Russian President Vladimir Putin makes his counterplay – Russia will enter a new arms race. The decision by Washington and Moscow to withdraw from a nuclear weapons treaty is the start of an unspeakable travesty for billions of people. Here’s why missile manufacturers should go broke.
The undeclared war on Russia the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations were too chicken to announce, it has cost humanity tens of trillions of dollars, and a hundred trillion more to come. In order to maintain a failed super-capitalism and a successful hegemony, Washington and her allies have blistered the world the last few decades inventing terror, launching wars, and pirating untold resources from countries President Donald Trump affectionately calls –“shit holes.” Now, in the infinite financial wisdom of Trump’s handlers (Israel or whoever), it’s time for a weapons buildup like the world has never seen before. The Guardian frames the recent reversal of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty:
“Unless Moscow and Washington unexpectedly rediscover the spirit of detente, the INF treaty is finished. A global monument to the triumph of diplomatic rationality over militaristic paranoia is being pulled down.”
Now for what this really means for you and me and the rest of the “normal” human beings on Earth.
For the moment, let’s forget what Ronald Reagan and the daddy George Bush did back in the 1980s. Turning to the cleptomaniac slash misogynist former President Bill Clinton, we find the altar boy of world economic war and chaos destroying Yugoslavia, launching a globalist nightmare economy, and setting the stage for Bush II to ring the world with US soldiers, missiles, and Big Brother surveillance systems. Several trillion spent on a “War on Terror” against camel jockeys in distant Afghanistan caves, and enter a real live American Uncle Tom named Barack Obama. If not for the Snowden revelations, the world would already be under the complete control of the NSA-Deep State-Drone slinging psychopaths who leverage Wall Street and Raytheon to pile up more profits. Excuse me crunching all this into a slimy ball of recent history, but we’ve gone over and over this before. Today, however, things just got even stupider. Let me return to the lucid commentary of Rafael Behr and The Guardian. The INF treaty disaster unfolding is based on nonsense, it’s planned, and the ones standing behind are spotlighted:
Trump framed the INF treaty withdrawal as a response to Russian misdemeanor, but the true relationship with Moscow is more complex. The US security establishment, while horrified at evidence (sic) of meddling in the 2016 presidential election, doesn’t see Russia as an equal.”
The US security establishment, it’s an organ of the greater beast of Armageddon. A construct, if you will, of lizard men or banksters or frozen Hitler’s brain in an Antarctic base – another inhuman catastrophe of human potential. World’s off our world could be conquered, disease eradicated, other dimensions explored, and Utopia found for what these money worshippers are doing. Just think about one possibility for $1 trillion U.S. That’s 1,000 billion dollars. 1,000 billionaires, or a billion people with a year’s or month’s salary. A trillion times 100! I cannot emphasize this sum enough.
Forget solving hunger. Forget curing cancer. Give up your ideas of a Utopian Earth. And think about Europe turned into a “kill zone” where Russia must protect herself from land-based nukes. The globalists tried to invade Russia through Ukraine again – and this is what Euromaidan was, but it did not work. The Anglo-European mob launched Arab Spring, but it stopped in Damascus because Putin called a halt. Georgia, the country, was taken over by NATO thugs, Romania armed with Aegis missile countermeasures, and Poland too – and Putin’s Russia is not supposed to respond? What kind of idiot leader do the liberal world order of lizards supposed Putin is? Meanwhile, the Amerigo-Nazi populist right proclaim Putin is hamstrung by bold US and Europe sanctions – and that he cannot defend Russia!
Do you see how dangerous the mayhem they call US detente has become? The hard-core Trump following are ready to goose-step across borders like Hitler SS zombies. The Brexit nut cases cannot let Britain have any opinion – and France is run by Rothschild’s idiot stooge Macron. Merkel is in hiding, wanting her pension in the Alps. And the Chinese are content, as always, to wait in the wings until the rest of us kills one another. Latin America awaits the coming D-Day landings in Venezuela. And I cannot write a complete sentence here because the lunacy is that fragmented. The danger for all of us, the clear warning signs I am getting, is that a dark age like that after the fall of Rome is about to be upon us. 70-something years of this world order will end in another failed attempt to secure Russia’s wealth as if nothing at all was learned from the past.
What must Vladimir Putin do, declare a national emergency and order the creation of a million nuke robots of death? Are we to assume that the most diabolical dictator Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post can create, he cannot just “order” his subjugated people to another Kursk, or Stalingrad, or to take over the Nazi’s fortress Europa AGAIN? Our lives are at stake, my friends. The future of our children and grandchildren, and we are watching a new Holocaust begin. How is this even possible? Was I alone in grade school, high school, and college? Pay attention people.

CHISINAU, April 6. /TASS/. Moldova’s President Igor Dodon has pointed to the importance of strategic partnership with Russia in the country’s foreign policy.
“Today, Moldova seeks to restore strategic partnership with the Russian Federation. I am certain that our bilateral relations have good prospects for expanding and deepening,” the president wrote on Facebook on Saturday on the occasion of the 27th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Moldova and Russia.
“Moldova is determined to pursue a balanced foreign policy based on national interests. However, strategic partnership with Russia will always be a particularly important part of our country’s foreign policy concept. Our fraternal peoples have gone through a lot: there was our common history, common problems and common victories too,” Dodon added. He noted that next year Moldova, Russia and other former Soviet republics would jointly celebrate the 75th anniversary “of our common Victory in the Great Patriotic War.” The country is also going to celebrate the anniversary of the republic’s liberation this coming August.
Relations between Chisinau and Moscow deteriorated after the coalition of pro-European parties came to power in Moldova in 2009. In 2016, former leader of Moldova’s Party of Socialists Igor Dodon won the presidential election in the country. His main slogans were strengthening nationhood, observing neutrality and restoring strategic partnership with Russia.

MOSCOW, April 6. /TASS/. Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has refrained from commenting on the proposal by Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin concerning the lower house’s involvement in forming the government.
“This is a new proposal,” Peskov told TASS when asked whether the initiative, which calls for amending the Constitution, had been coordinated with the Kremlin.
In an interview posted on the State Duma’s website, Volodin spoke out in favor of the lower house’s participation in consultations while appointing members of the Russian government.
The State Duma currently takes part in forming the Cabinet only within the framework of the procedure of giving consent to the president for the prime minister’s appointment.

"In the Wake of Cyclone Idai, the North Has a Climate Debt to Pay",www.therussophile.org,William Minter,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/in-the-wake-of-cyclone-idai-the-north-has-a-climate-debt-to-pay.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Weeks after Cyclone Idai struck the coast of Mozambique, near Beira, the flood waters have receded to reveal a shattered landscape.
Houses and roads were washed away; crops awaiting harvest were destroyed. Confirmed deaths number in the high hundreds across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, with the total still unknown. Emphasis has shifted from the rescue of survivors clinging to treetops and rooftops to provision of food, housing, and medical care for hundreds of thousands left homeless.
Even as local and international relief efforts gear up, there is a need to also focus on broader global implications. The causal connection between climate change and extreme weather events, such as Cyclone Idai, is clear. The need for climate actions in both poor and rich countries is beyond dispute. These include making the response to crises sustainable, increasing resilience to the effects of climate change through adaptation, and rapidly accelerating action to cut greenhouse emissions from fossil fuels.
Whose responsibility should this be? At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the first global climate agreement affirmed that much of the burden should be shouldered by the wealthy countries :
The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.
Civil society and the diaspora step up
Civil society in Mozambique and Zimbabwe has played a major role in the immediate cyclone response. Rescues in flooded Buzi, for example, involved not only South African helicopters and Indian Navy teams, but also local canoes and a fishing boat, seen in this video from Al Jazeera . In the Mozambican capital Maputo, more than 5,000 volunteers coordinated collection of needed supplies, filling a container ship that arrived in Beira on March 26.
Meanwhile, there has been an unprecedented level of fundraising by diaspora Africans and others with personal ties to the affected countries.
As global media attention fades, disaster relief by the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations will probably decline. But diaspora and other personal connections, aided by social media, may be more lasting. (You can help by adding Cyclone Idai to a Google news search or Facebook search and sharing updates on social media.)
Paying the climate debt
The outpouring of support is impressive, but a key test will be its sustainability. Beyond immediate disaster relief, sustainable global responses to climate change require greater and more predictable funding to strengthen the resilience of the most vulnerable regions.
There is no shortage of proposals for action, such as this guidance from the UN Environmental Program . But implementation will depend on political will in the countries that can afford to pay. This requires wide recognition of the “climate debt” owed by fossil fuel companies and rich countries whose emissions have contributed the most to destructive climate change.
Poorer people and countries, which have contributed the least to climate change, are also the most vulnerable to its effects. The price paid in lost lives and livelihoods falls disproportionately on them. This is seen not only in Cyclone Idai, but also in the recent flooding in the U.S. Midwest , where Native Americans on the Pine Ridge Reservation are finding recovery far more difficult than farmers in neighboring states.
Those who should pay more to prevent and mitigate climate change, and to cope with climate disasters, are still evading their responsibilities. In the words of Dipti Bhatnagar, coordinator of Friends of the Earth Mozambique , speaking on Democracy Now, “This is about the rich countries … We need to stop dirty energy, dirty and harmful energies everywhere. But this is about historical responsibility. So, that needs to happen in the Northern countries first, to stop fossil fuels, to stop dirty and harmful energies.”
Bhatnagar and other climate justice campaigners such as Decoalonize in Kenya also call for an end to projects such as Exxon’s natural gas project in northern Mozambique and new coal mines in Kenya, South Africa, and other countries . While national governments, in both North and South, remain slow to act, the range of action by civil society and subnational governments is expanding. Examples include the rising tide of law suits against fossil fuel companies and the March 15 climate strike in over 112 countries .
The Green New Deal in the United States, and similar efforts in other countries, must take on the powerful forces of the status quo. They must also be framed within a South-centered vision that highlights global climate justice, addresses inequality both within and between nations, and targets the strategic reallocation of wealth from the most privileged sectors to the common good.
This in turn will require structural changes, especially the identification and progressive taxation of corporate and individual wealth, much of which is hidden or exempt from taxation . In addition to saving lives in the present, South-North networks built in response to crises such as Cyclone Idai provide a foundation for demanding these critical changes.

Weaponized Social Media Is Driving the Explosion of Fascism,www.therussophile.org,candice,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/weaponized-social-media-is-driving-the-explosion-of-fascism.html/,"Bayer and Monsanto Defend Themselves With Science They Funded
I was blindsided a few weeks ago by a video of the New Zealand mosque massacre showing up on my screen — courtesy of Facebook. I really don’t have language to succinctly describe what it is, filmed by a self-described “fascist” hoping to pull viewers into his deranged hate-ravaged point-of-view, immortalizing the captured images of terror on his victims’ faces at the second their stolen lives flashed before them. The murderer also captured images of his victims and used them as a weaponized meme, which is now forever preserved as a cultural artifact. Making it was likely a driving force behind the massacre. This visual meme brought a white supremacist’s horrific battlefield into my home and the homes of millions of others who either willingly or unwittingly watched this horror. Welcome to World War F. The Weaponization of Social Media, From Israel to Iraq
In 2014, the two millennia-old Iraqi city of Mosul, with a multicultural population of almost 2 million people, defended by approximately 30,000 American-trained and armed Iraqi troops, fell to a disheveled band of about 800 – 1,500 poorly armed ISIS (also known as Daesh) fighters sporting a small fleet of stolen Toyota Hilux pickup trucks. But the war was essentially over before they arrived — won on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, aided by a slick viral propaganda video telling a fictitious story of an invincible army. As ISIS fighters advanced on Mosul, they posted gruesome videos from villages on their path, not unlike the New Zealand one, but peppered with beheadings.
Before reaching Mosul, their hashtag #AllEyesOnISIS topped the Arabic language trending charts on Twitter. What ISIS pulled off on social media was a virtual Blitzkrieg or shock-and-awe grade terror campaign, projecting an illusion of overwhelming force. The result was as effective as a real bombardment. Iraqi soldiers and civilians in Mosul, glued to the little screens in their palms, thanks to a new cell tower network built with U.S. aid, descended into rabbit holes of fear and terror. Uncompromised, uncompromising news
Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.
Haunted by images of ISIS winning the battle before it was fought, almost all of the Iraqi soldiers defending Mosul fled before the first Toyota Hilux rolled into town, leaving the bulk of their American weapons, including six Blackhawk helicopters and 2,300 Humvees , behind. Then ISIS arrived, killed the few remaining soldiers and police officers, and posed for selfies with their spoils. The ensuing images proved powerful as visual props spread on social media, enabling ISIS to recruit 15,000 fighters from dozens of countries in the year following the capture of Mosul. War would never be the same again.
ISIS didn’t invent the strategy of weaponizing social media. Perhaps that credit goes to the Israeli military, which had been trolling social media since at least 2008 . In 2012, they took their game to the next level, live tweeting and uploading a snuff video to YouTube of a drone assassination against a Hamas leader. Unlike the Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, however, Hamas had responded to the social media campaign in-kind. Both sides enlisted help from their web fans, ultimately generating a pandemic of online hate involving millions of posts. By the end of 2012, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) was running a global social media propaganda unit executing operations on every major platform. Today, hip young Israeli soldiers complete their mandatory military service as part of the IDF’s International Social Media Desk , trolling, for example, American college students supporting Palestinian rights movements such as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions . Sockpuppets, Botnets and Trolls
By 2016, sophisticated propagandists utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms driven by a seemingly limitless trove of data points on damn near every internet user, revolutionized social media-based psych-ops campaigns. And we got some new vocabulary words, like “sockpuppet.” That’s a human internet warrior purporting to be all sorts of folk they ain’t — like the sockpuppet operating out of St. Petersburg, Russia, who formed and facilitated the Twitter group, “ @Ten_GOP ,” the fake “unofficial Twitter Group of Tennessee Republicans.” At its zenith , it had 10 times the following of the real Tennessee Republican Party’s group. @Ten_GOP spread misinformation memes and incendiary stories, including 3,107 of its own psych-ops messages, while amassing and identifying 136,000 followers to use as viral vectors, retweeting the St. Petersburg messages 1,213,505 times.
One famous sockpuppet persona, the fictitious Jenna Abrams , became an American mainstream media fave. Described by The Guardian as an “all-American, Trump-loving, segregation-supporting, Confederate-defending Twitter star [who] does not really exist,” Jenna appears to be another St. Petersburg creation. As such, “she” was quoted by The New York Times , The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, USA Today, BET, The New York Daily News and a host of others. Once established as a lovable, personable, witty, trusted young Twitter star, “her” repertoire turned socially toxic, empowering millions of other racist haters on social media.
Then there are bots, which are robotic versions of sockpuppets. They come complete with fabricated identities, like the John McCain-hating Confederate monument-loving American Trump supporter Angee Dixson, who was exposed by ProPublica as a Russian bot. Powered by artificial intelligence, bots like Angee successfully engaged with human trolls. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump quoted such bots 150 times . When Bots Tweet
Since a bot is just an algorithm residing on a computer server, it’s easier to replicate. In fact, they can be tasked with replicating themselves. Once established as a network, or “botnet,” they can almost instantly propel any tweet or post into mega-virality by robotically seeding a seemingly organic viral orgy of reposting — enough to trick social media site algorithms into seeing the messages as naturally trending, and thus, make them actually trend into millions of news and social feeds. So, when ProPublica outed the Angee Dixson bot, a replacement bot’s tweet attacking ProPublica was instantly propelled by Angee’s 60,000-strong bot cell , eventually reaching more readers than the ProPublica exposé of Angee.
State actors on the World War F battlefields — like Russia, Israel and China — tend to dominate our national discussion of online propaganda. They’re the virtual elephants — lumbering giants that you just can’t miss. The Israelis used glossy ads to recruit social media commandos, while the Russians, for all of their sophistication, just didn’t hide themselves well, with a bunch of Russian sockpuppets cluing investigative journalists in to their whereabouts by keeping bankers’ hours in Russian time zones. We certainly can’t claim any moral high ground against the Russians, however, as whatever they’re accused of doing, we did it to them first and exponentially more successfully using old-school tech in the 1980s, then shamelessly gloated for two decades after the U.S.S.R. came apart. We’ve since meddled in their elections — shortsightedly raising Putin to power through our support of the epitome of incompetence, Boris Yeltsin.
Major world powers have historically targeted each other with propaganda — and it’s easy to spot. The Russians are also suspected of using their army of sockpuppets to promote the Brexit withdrawal from the European Union, but an Oxford Internet Institute study contends that while they did exploit Twitter and Facebook during the 2016 U.S. election, there’s no strong body of evidence that they did the same with Brexit. And while France wants to tar the popular Yellow Vest movement with accusations of nefarious Russian support , there’s still not much evidence to support that claim.
Researchers at the Oxford University Computational Propaganda Research Project argue that while governments do target the internal politics of other nations, authoritarian regimes primarily focus on targeting their own populations, with bots controlling, for example, 45 percent of Twitter activity in Russia. Mark Zuckerberg’s reaction to complaints about Facebook propaganda is to call for more government control over the internet. Appeasing governments in this way would, not coincidently, keep global markets open for Facebook, while strengthening the propaganda power of governments and preventing any more nasty outbreaks of democracy, such as the Arab Spring. Fear Yourselves
While authoritarians use social media propaganda campaigns to target their own populations, the Oxford researchers argue , “almost every democracy in this sample has organized social media campaigns that target foreign publics,” while leaving the targeting of their own populations to “political-party‐supported campaigns.”
Looking back at our concerns over our own 2016 and 2018 elections, while Russian interference was real and documented , its impact paled in comparison to the more effective propaganda campaigns launched by Breitbart and Fox . Our myopic focus on Russia’s obnoxious sockpuppets led us to take our eyes off the larger faster harder ball on the field. World War F is global, but if you really want to fear someone, fear your fellow Americans. Fear yourselves.
State-to-state disinformation battles are not the major threat in World War F. States, almost by definition, are inherently corrupt. They jockey for leverage and advantage and are always willing to compromise their stated values or buy each other off, because they have too much vested in maintaining an orderly status quo of trade and banking. At the end of the day, they generally don’t want to blow the world up. By contrast, the Reagan-Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama-Trump economic policies have hollowed out much of the U.S., leaving economically disenfranchised communities populated by angry people poisoned by despair, and vulnerable to authoritarian and fascist leaders skilled at deploying precision propaganda to channel such anger. Unfortunately, this is what social media does best.
People are more likely to both share and react viscerally to things that anger or frighten them, as opposed to things that inspire them or give them hope. Propagandists know this. And despite decrying their own roles in spreading hate and fascism, social media executives also understand that their business model is based on clicks — and haters are the most voracious clickers. Social media executives seem remiss to mess with this metric — unless their hands are forced. Perhaps that’s why it took Facebook until March 2019 to ban white nationalism — 70 years after the end of the Nuremburg trials. A Fascist War on Empirical Reality
Social media now gives the assholes who used to live in seething isolation the ability to create community — online, as futurists promised. Nurtured by community, haters empower each other and make hate part of mainstream discourse. Algorithm-driven social media silos curate customized worlds where hate festers among people who all spend their lives spreading it. From Islamophobes to white supremacists to “incels” (self-described “involuntary celibate” misogynists who believe they have a right to sex with women) to ISIS — social media amplifies the ugliest voices, delivering them to your children’s bedrooms. This is World War F.
But above everything else, World War F is about bullshit. More Americans now claim to get their news on Facebook than from any other venue. During the 2016 election season, fraudulent sites and fascist posts got more Facebook reads than the top 19 news sites reporting verifiable reality put together.
Falsehoods are the currency of fascism. For corrupt authoritarian regimes, truth is the enemy: Truth is the weapon that, when wielded, will cut them down. For authoritarians, first and foremost, truth has to be destroyed. This is at the core of World War F.
World War F is a war on empirical reality. Unconstrained by any pretenses to accuracy, weaponized memes are engineered to excite and incite while poisoning democracies with disinformation. Algorithmic targeting coupled with data-mining and data analytics allows liars to micro-target individuals with propaganda psycho-engineered just for you. And they can micro-target the people most likely to believe their lies.
Without a shared reality, we can no longer engage in the reasoned discussions and deliberations that sustain democracy. When reason gives way to rage, people navigate solely by emotion, and too many start to speak the language of fascism.
This is World War F. It’s a false reality fueled by Facebook, fascism and fraud. It’s entered our homes, it’s glowing in our palms, it gave us Donald Trump, Sean Hannity, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Jair Bolsonaro, Viktor Orbán and Alex Jones, and it tells us we’re fucked. This is World War F. If it conquers reality, we have nowhere left to fight. Copyright © Truthout. May not be reprinted without permission ."
MUST Watch: Sen. Kennedy OBLITERATES Democrats in hilarious rant over Trump’s taxes!,therightscoop.com,SooperMexican,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/must-watch-sen-kennedy-obliterates-democrats-in-hilarious-rant-over-trumps-taxes/,"Email 3
In this very funny video, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana goes on a rant about how stupid the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee is, how stupid his rationale for seeking Trump’s taxes is, and how dumb CNN is for believing him.
At one point he says, “it must suck to be so dumb!”
It is a thing of beauty, and it starts at about the 7 minute mark below:
LOL! That was pretty persuasive – especially the point about Chairman Neal arguing that the only reason they’re looking into the taxes is to make sure they’ve been audited correctly. Of course that is ridiculous, and Kennedy calls them out perfectly. You can’t just go off on an angry rant, like so many like to do, it is way more effective if you toss in some humor, which Kennedy does brilliantly.
IN any case, I’m seeing from the Democratic side that some are backing off on the demand, thinking that there’s not enough political demand for them. If they DO continue, it looks like it may go straight to the Supreme Court, where Republicans have a relative advantage. So we’ll see how it goes… Total: 64"

Former President Obama expressed concern about the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, saying he feared it could end up undercutting allies.
Speaking at a town hall event on Saturday for the Obama Foundation in Berlin, the former president spoke about the need for compromise in politics, citing the Affordable Care Act as something that he said signified progress even though it did not achieve all of his aspirations for U.S. health care.
One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States —maybe it’s true here as well — is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Uh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be,’ and then we start sometimes creating what’s called a ‘circular firing squad,’ where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues. And when that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens,” he said.
“So I think whether you are speaking as a citizen or as a political leader or as an organizer … you have to recognize that the way we structure democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you, and that by definition means you’re not going to get 100 percent of what you want,” he added.
This happens all the time. When a political party gets more leeway, more political power, all of a sudden the more extremist parts of that party try to seize control. And sometimes, they ruin it for the party by spoiling what concessions they could have had, in favor of 100% purity. Sound familiar? In any case, let’s hope they keep it up and spoil the election again in 2020… Total: 88"

There’s that “Bronx toughness” everyone loves, that toughness she cultivated in… private school in the suburbs. Anyway after that she started crying, because everyone loves a little manic hysteria in our public officials: As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx.

Zionist Campaign Drives Black Jewish Activist Out of UK’s Labour Party,www.therussophile.org,Merula Furtado,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/zionist-campaign-drives-black-jewish-activist-out-of-uks-labour-party.html/,"Bayer and Monsanto Defend Themselves With Science They Funded
Anti-racist activist Jackie Walker was expelled from the U.K. Labour Party on March 26, after two-and-a-half years of suspension for allegedly “bringing the party into disrepute.”
Walker, a pro-Palestinian, Black Jewish woman and supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, contested the definition of “anti-Semitism” at a training session in 2016 conducted by the Jewish Labour Movement, which conflated anti-Semitism with criticism of Zionism . Further, several decontextualized comments she made on Facebook were used against her in what became a long and abusive smear campaign .
Walker’s experience and consequent expulsion show direct parallels to the recent defamation of Rep. Ilhan Omar . Further, the use of Walker by Zionists and their allies to incriminate Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is reminiscent of the targeting in the United States of Representative Omar, leaders of the women’s march and those close to Sen. Bernie Sanders . Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
Walker co-wrote and has performed a one-woman play, “ The Lynching ,” as a means of communicating her viewpoint in an otherwise complete media bias and/or boycott against her. Meanwhile a new documentary film, WitchHunt , details her account. Walker has received the endorsement of multiple Labour Party grassroots groups and prominent intellectuals, including Noam Chomsky and others.
Truthout spoke with Jackie Walker about the campaign waged against her and the weaponization of “anti-Semitism” by Zionists to silence critique of Israel, target BDS activists and fragment the left.
Yoav Litvin: Describe your trajectory as a political activist. When did you become aware of BDS?
Jackie Walker: I was born in New York and am a dual American and British citizen. I went on my first civil rights demonstration as a child with my mother. We left the U.S. when my mother was deported for “un-American activities” during the civil rights movement.
My first political grounding was with the South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO), which was fighting alongside the African National Congress (ANC) for liberation of Black people from apartheid in South Africa. There, I was first introduced to apartheid and became aware of boycotts.
The massacre of Gaza of 2014, also known as “ Operation Protective Edge ,” profoundly affected me and I felt no choice but to get more involved in supporting BDS and the Palestinian struggle.
What is the significance of your expulsion from the Labour Party? Speak to its state under Corbyn’s leadership and the support you have received, or lack thereof, throughout this affair.
The Labour Party is not one body. It depends whether you are referring to the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) or the power structures within the Labour Party. The PLP still remains a Blairite party and does not reflect the membership. And so, this is where the conflict between … the old/new Labour and the new/new Labour is being played out… on this ground of anti-Semitism. It could have revolved around other issues, but none gained the same kind of traction. My Jewish and African descent made me extremely dangerous for the Zionists in the U.K. because the last thing they want is the coming together of Jewish and Black radicalisms to forge a politics of resistance in support of Palestinians.
The Labour Party has been in a state of civil war since Jeremy Corbyn was elected as a candidate, let alone became leader. In fact, one of the reasons I was suspended is precisely due to the fragmented nature of the party.
The campaign against me has been highly political with dramatic effects on my life. I have absolutely no doubt that the bulk of the activist membership are in support of me. It may well be that the majority of the regular members either support me or think, “What the hell is going on here?”
How has the British media reported your case?
The reporting has been unprecedented in its negligence. There is only one available narrative and no fact-checking; for nearly three years I have never had an English newspaper come to me and confirm a story or my direct quotes.
It is very interesting what the papers and the media are not reporting, which is actually what is happening in the Labour Party at the Constituency Labour Party level.
Why did you walk out of your final hearing?
One of the reasons I walked out of my hearing was the racist abuse against me, which was peppered throughout the Labour Party’s evidence bundle. It included anti-Black abuse, which the Labour Party refused to remove after multiple requests from my solicitor. They expected me to sit there and be examined and cross-examined while looking at racist abuse.
The hypocrisy is staggering. While they target me for differentiating between criticism of the state of Israel and anti-Semitism, there is no recourse for a Labour Party member of parliament who says that “to be anti-capitalism is to be anti-Semitic.” That is astonishing.
What role do race and your intersectional identity play in the campaign against you?
One thing that the Labour Party found absolutely impossible to wrap its head around was my Jewish background. In fact, the media and the PLP will not mention my Blackness or my Jewishness and therefore my very particular perspective and access to the politics of oppression. There is an anti-Semitism in the Labour Party people are afraid to openly discuss — it is a relentless persecution of Corbyn-supporting Jews.
Certain aspects of the politics and the narrative of race are healthier in the United Kingdom than the United States. However, Britain lags behind the United States in the understanding and implementation of intersectional politics, as our struggle has not been as contested as it has been in the U.S. In the U.S., you have Mocha Jews – a whole movement and organization reflecting the complex responses Jewish people of color express. We have no such organization here in the U.K.
My claim on both Jewish and African descent made me extremely dangerous for the Zionists in the U.K. because the last thing they want is the coming together of Jewish and Black radicalisms to forge a politics of resistance in support of Palestinians. It is explosive in many ways and forges a global struggle against white supremacy.
What is the particular part of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism that disturbs you?
Nobody I know and work with has a problem with the beginning of the definition, which states anti-Semitism is hatred of Jews for being Jews. The problem for many people, including certain Jews, lies with the sub-clauses linking criticism of Israel/Zionism to anti-Semitism.
In effect, the definition removes the ability of any Jew to choose to identify with Israel or not. It forces Israel to be an intrinsic part of Jewish identity and if one dares to protest, they are immediately branded a “kapo,” or not a real Jew.
There is an anti-Semitism in the Labour Party which people are afraid to openly discuss — it is a relentless persecution of Corbyn-supporting Jews. We receive threats to our safety in myriad formats, suspensions and defamations. When the media discuss this, they omit the fact that we are Jewish.
For example, a Labour Party colleague of mine whose family are survivors of the Auschwitz Nazi extermination camp made a joke that some deemed inappropriate and was consequently suspended. She was described in the media not as “Jewish,” but as “claims to be Jewish.” What I am describing is a process in which Jews are being made and unmade. Jews who support Jeremy Corbyn are being unmade, yet people like Joan Ryan , who is not Jewish , are seen and spoken of as Jewish. Astonishingly, if you criticize Ryan, you are accused of anti-Semitism!
Outside of our meetings lurks a man who works as a security agent for the fascist political organization Britain First. He brandishes a Star of David, calling socialist Jews like myself “anti-Semites.” And that is what the Labour Party has done – they have allowed this to happen.
Zionist propaganda reframes a narrative of settler colonialism and subjugation of an Indigenous population into one of Israel’s “right to exist.” How do you counter this talking point?
I feel this discussion is a smokescreen. It is a trap. I am not interested in a state’s “right to exist,” but in a state being of its citizens. The reframing you mention encourages a notion that those who criticize Israel want to “destroy” the state. Yet all I want is for Israel to become a state of its citizens in the same way that England or even America is a state of its citizens, not a state for one particular ethnic group. This is immoral. It is apartheid.
Ilhan Omar, a Black Muslim woman affiliated with the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party, was recently targeted for comments which were deemed “anti-Semitic.” What are some of the lessons we as Americans should learn from the campaign against you in the Labour Party? Do you have any advice for people who face similar campaigns?
Zionists politically lynched me and my body is not even cold, yet an editorial published in the Jewish Chronicle is all about how Jackie Walker is insignificant, and what’s important is she’s indicative of Jeremy Corbyn’s “anti-Semitism.” It is exactly the same with Omar and Sanders.
Bernie Sanders must not do what has happened in the Labour Party, which is to allow the picking off of too many people close to the leadership. This leaves a leadership without support and vibrant activist base. For Bernie Sanders to win, just like Corbyn, he needs people on the ground. He must not get cut off from his base. People have got to believe that he is willing to stick his neck out for his beliefs and his base. If you undermine that basic foundation, it is over.
Sanders and those close to him must not apologize for correctly criticizing injustice. Instead, they need to seek solidarity and media outlets that will truthfully convey their perspective if the mainstream media does not.
They will attack Sanders, and there is only one defense: solidarity and no compromise on principles and the integrity of the activist base.
Bernie Sanders has conveyed Zionist opinions and is a Jew. How are these facts going to affect the smear campaign gearing up against him?
You might think his Jewish identity will affect or perhaps even deter the smear campaigners, but it makes no difference. As I said, in this process, Jews are made and unmade — an anti-Semitic process in its essence. There’s a whole load of people: Noam Chomsky and other eminent Jewish people who were unmade by their proximity to the Palestinian cause.
On a personal level, how do you plan to proceed?
I am taking time to rest and recuperate. I am not interested in spearheading a campaign to go back to the Labour Party. I have an interest in raising levels of awareness about oppressed people and democracy within the Labour Party. I will continue to promote the film WitchHunt , even though it has been banned from being shown in Parliament. I will continue going around the country and talking to people. A play I co-wrote –“The Lynching”– is now being developed for three Black women actors to represent the story of Black women’s history of political life in the U.K. I will also write a book about what it feels like as a person to have this happen to you.

New Hints of the Mueller Report: Did Trump Simply Get Rolled by the Russians?,www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/new-hints-of-the-mueller-report-did-trump-simply-get-rolled-by-the-russians.html/,"Bayer and Monsanto Defend Themselves With Science They Funded
Despite the fact that William Barr had made public comments denigrating the Mueller investigation and clearly auditioned for the job with a spurious memo suggesting that it was almost impossible for a president to obstruct justice, he was confirmed as Donald Trump’s new attorney general with little difficulty. After what had happened with Jeff Sessions, it was understood that Trump would never again stand for an AG recusing himself from any investigation of the president. So everyone knew that Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election would be in the hands of someone who was unlikely to be an honest broker.
Nonetheless, most of us gave Barr the benefit of the doubt. I wrote about Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski, who had been a conservative supporter of Richard Nixon. He was coerced into taking the job by White House chief of staff Alexander Haig, who told him, “We need you, Leon”— assuming he would be loyal to the president. When Jaworski saw the evidence against Nixon, however, he was appalled and moved forward with the investigation. I thought maybe that could happen with Barr too.
I should have known better. Barr was a very political attorney general during George H.W. Bush’s administration, recommending pardons for all the guilty players in the Iran-Contra case, showing that he wasn’t going to be one of those weaklings who saw the Nixon pardon as setting a bad example for the country. I should have realized that this wasn’t a case of someone who’d spent too much time watching Sean Hannity and was slightly out of it. Barr’s been a rock-solid right-winger for decades. Never miss another story
Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.
I characterized Barr’s initial four-page summary of the Mueller report as an elegant little political document and it was. It elicited exactly the response he and the White House wanted. He validated Trump’s slogan, “No Collusion, No Obstruction” while cleverly obscuring the fact that there is obviously much more to that story. After a couple of weeks of careful parsing and reconsideration of the implications by the press and various experts, Barr has now lost control of the storyline. He is promising to deliver the full report after he redacts whatever he deems necessary, but because of the game he’s been playing, there is no longer much trust that he’s acting in good faith.
Unlike Ken Starr’s investigations of the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals, the Mueller team didn’t use friendly members of the press to pressure witnesses and try their cases in the court of public opinion. In fact they said nothing at all outside the courtroom. But now that the investigation is over and the attorney general has taken it upon himself to summarize their conclusions they have reportedly begin to express their distress about how he’s handled that.
Numerous news outlets have confirmed that members of Mueller’s team say that Barr has mischaracterized the evidence of obstruction of justice, which by all accounts is substantial.
They have also told associates that they carefully prepared summaries for different sections of the report, assuming they would be released to the public. Those summaries should not require all this concern from Barr about redactions. This certainly comports with many experts’ assumptions about how such a report would be organized. While Barr and the Justice Department are now saying that the summaries are labeled as containing grand jury and other confidential information, therefore requiring careful review and redactions, many professionals have suggested that’s just pro forma .
I think we all knew that the question of obstruction was going to be a problem for President Trump, simply because so much of it was happening right out in the open. But according to NBC News , it’s not just that issue that has the Mueller team agitated. The “collusion” case is also being somewhat misrepresented. The special counsel decided not to charge Trump or his campaign with conspiring with the Russian government in its election interference, but that is far from the whole story. Members of the team say that “the findings paint a picture of a campaign whose members were manipulated by a sophisticated Russian intelligence operation.”
I have long been willing to believe that Trump and his minions were simply so unethical, corrupt and uninformed that they were easy marks for the Russian election sabotage campaign. We know that they behaved idiotically when Russians approached them. Donald Trump Jr. writing an emails saying, “if it’s what you say, I love it!” upon hearing that Russian emissaries want to give him dirt on Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump” is not the language of a sophisticated conspirator. It’s almost as if they were testing to see if Junior was even sentient. But that doesn’t get him or Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort or Donald Trump himself off the hook. This isn’t a game. Trump is president of the United States.
Trump and his team were almost certainly compromised by the lies they told about the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations. Trump knew that could be revealed at any time and his obsequious behavior toward Vladimir Putin the could easily be interpreted as bowing to an unspoken threat. Trump is conversant in blackmail threats, as we all know. We also know that he pays up when he deems it necessary.
Mueller found that none of this was prosecutable and it is vital we find out why he reached that conclusion. But to say that there was nothing there amounts to sweeping some of the worst judgment calls in the history of presidential campaigns under the carpet. And that’s really saying something.
These were outrageous decisions regardless of the criminal liability or lack thereof. I’m not sure if rank stupidity and reckless greed qualify as high crimes and misdemeanors but we should probably know the whole story before deciding about that. Even if Trump and his close advisers were suckered by the “Russian election interference activities” it’s quite clear that once Trump realized that the FBI and the intelligence community thought he might have done something illegal, he tried to cover it up. If that’s so, it’s not William Barr’s place to make the decision about criminal obstruction of justice. If the Department of Justice has concluded that it cannot charge a sitting president with a crime, it cannot clear one of wrongdoing either. It’s up to the C ongress to decide what to do about Donald Trump. It seems as though the Mueller investigators agree. This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

Janine Jackson: The case is called Edwin Hardeman v. Monsanto , which sounds something like David v. Goliath . Hardeman is a 70-year-old man who says using Roundup , Monsanto’s weed killer, for nearly 30 years caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
And Monsanto is, well, Monsanto. Recently acquired by German drug and crop chemicals company Bayer for some $66 billion, the corporate behemoth commands more than a quarter of the combined world market for seeds and pesticides, with a famously active PR machine .
And yet Goliath lost. The jury in US District Court in San Francisco returned the necessary unanimous decision, finding that Roundup caused, or was a substantial factor in causing, Hardeman’s cancer. And that Monsanto should be held liable, because the herbicide is not labeled to warn of that risk. Uncompromised, uncompromising news
Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.
The company, naturally, is appealing . But with more than 11,000 other cases in the wings, this story isn’t going away anytime soon.
Our next guest has been following this case and others. A longtime food and agriculture journalist at Reuters, Carey Gillam is now research director at US Right to Know , and author of the book Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer and the Corruption of Science, out from Island Press. She joins us now by phone from Kansas. Welcome back to CounterSpin, Carey Gillam.
Carey Gillam: Thanks for having me.
Listeners may remember the case last year in which a California jury found that the use of Roundup by a school groundskeeper, Dewayne “Lee” Johnson, was a substantial factor in his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. But that ruling didn’t make this one a sure thing, or even an expected thing.
I’m noticing that some coverage seems to be taking a line that, as a former federal prosecutor was quoted on one news show, the verdict “proves that juries are being convinced that Roundup is causing cancer.” Another headline was, “A Man Said He Got Cancer After Spraying Monsanto’s Weed Killer. A Jury Agreed.” It makes it sound as though these court decisions are mainly the result of fancy lawyering, or maybe even deception. But Hardeman’s attorneys presented scientific data , just as Monsanto did ; it wasn’t based on sympathy-mongering or something, right?
Right. Of course, it is Bayer and Monsanto’s argument, or position, that the science is on their side, that the weight of scientific evidence shows no cancer risk, no carcinogenicity connection to its glyphosate-based herbicides like Roundup. But the evidence tells us otherwise.
And, of course, I’ve written a whole book about it, and talked about it many times. The weight of scientific evidence, published peer-reviewed epidemiology, toxicology, mechanistic data done over multiple years, multiple countries, does indeed show a cancer risk associated with these herbicides, with clear association to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. And that’s what caused the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in 2015, to classify glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup, as a probable human carcinogen. So there’s a great deal of scientific evidence, and that’s what is convincing juries.
But the second leg of this, or the second part of it, is there’s also a great deal of evidence of Monsanto’s manipulation of the scientific record. So when Monsanto says it has all of this science on its side, well, we know now from internal Monsanto documents , that a lot of that science they point to is science that they paid for, that they wrote, that they ghostwrote , that they manipulated — that they essentially had a hand in creating a safety narrative that really was not true.
It’s interesting, because I think that was why some folks were surprised by the ruling in Hardeman , because the judge, Vince Chhabria, had taken a lot of issue , hadn’t he, with Hardeman’s attorneys presentation of the case? And what he seemed to take particular issue with was lead attorney Aimee Wagstaff’s effort to introduce evidence of just that, of Monsanto’s effort to manipulate regulators, including ghostwriting safety reviews. And I’m not sure, legally, whether that’s permissible, but it sure sounds relevant to me as a layperson, if the company is then going to rely on that data from those regulators.
Right. Well, what Chhabria did — and this is the federal judge; the Johnson case was in state court — but what he did was really unusual. He threw Monsanto a bone. Monsanto said, “You know what? Let’s just let the jurors hear only about the scientific evidence.”
And so the judge divided the case into two phases. And the first phase was sharply limited to only discussion and presentation of scientific studies to the jurors. And Monsanto thought that they would win that. If the jurors couldn’t know about their ghostwriting and manipulation, they thought that they could win.
But, in fact, they did not. The jurors in that first phase said , after looking at all of the scientific evidence, that the weight of evidence was on the plaintiff’s side. And they found that, yes, it did cause his cancer.
In the second phase of the trial was when they considered damages , and that was when they looked at the manipulation of science, and came back with this $80 million verdict.
Let me just keep you on regulators for a second. When you’re reading press accounts, you see: Bayer/Monsanto flatly deny that glyphosate-based herbicides are carcinogenic, and they cite the Environmental Protection Agency. So in media stories, you get kind of disagreements between institutions, between the World Health Organization, EPA and different groups . What are we to make of the disagreements between various regulatory entities on this?
Well, a couple of different elements to that. So No. 1 is that most of the regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, only require a large body of evidence about the active ingredients. So in the case of Monsanto’s products, the active ingredient is glyphosate. It is not the only ingredient, but it is the active ingredient. So their studies, that they were required to present to the EPA, was limited to glyphosate.
Now, the products on the store shelves are not glyphosate only; they include surfactants. And scientists around the world who have studied the actual formulated products have said that the way that these surfactants interact with glyphosate make it much more toxic than glyphosate by itself.
And Monsanto admits it has never done any long-term studies about these formulated products, and the EPA admits that it’s never required any long-term studies. So the actual products that we’re being exposed to, and that are being used out there, and that these plaintiffs [have] used, have never had any long-term regulatory requirements for carcinogenesis studies. And that is shocking to a lot of people. But that is the fact. So that’s one element.
The other element is, again, the regulators rely primarily on data and information that’s been given to them by the companies that sell the chemicals. And we know, from analysis that’s been done, that studies that are done by companies that profit from those products generally find those products to be safe. Whereas independent analysis and independent research is more likely to find risk, if risk is there. We have to take that into account when they point to the EPA as the all-knowing being that we should rely on.
Right. So it’s about carcinogenicity; it’s also about the right to know. I mean, capitalists talk a good game about choice. But what is choice without information ? And the failure-to-warn , I’ve heard, is very important in these cases. But I have to say, I still wonder how much say a farmworker, for example, really has, even if there’s a label on the product. And given the ubiquity of these chemicals in our food, I certainly think the failure-to-warn is critical, but I wonder if there are some things that a label doesn’t cover, if you will.
Yeah, that’s true. The failure-to-warn is a big issue. Now for the users of this who are exposed occupationally, a warning is a big deal. Because if you’re told, “Hey, this could cause cancer,” or, “This is particularly dangerous, you want to make sure that you don’t get it on your skin, and you don’t inhale it. And you wear gloves and long pants and a mask,” that’s going to provide a degree of protection.
And they didn’t do that with this product. They said it’s safe as table salt , safe enough to drink ; people are out there in sandals, spraying it. You know, Mr. Hardeman was spraying a backpack sprayer around, with no protective gear. So that’s the deception.
When it’s in the food, you’re not voluntarily consuming food with pesticide residues in them — or maybe you are, most people don’t think about that! That’s a different animal.
But again, if this had been classified differently by our EPA, it would not be allowed to be sprayed directly onto food crops; we wouldn’t have the types of residues that we’re having in food if it had been judged differently by the EPA.
And then I would just note that I know that some of the work is around, not just farmworkers, but farmworkers’ children, who, of course, have different levels of susceptibility from damage from this. So you really have to look at who all is coming in contact with it, and it’s not just necessarily the person spraying it.
Gosh, no, I mean, right. There have been studies where they find this in the urine of farmworkers’ children, even though the children are not out there working in the fields. And our government scientists have found that this chemical, because it’s so widely used, it’s in air samples; you see residues, traces of it, in rainfall; even it’s in the soil. It’s pretty ubiquitous, particularly in farm country.
Well, in the end, Vince Chhabria had some strong — or in the middle, I guess — he actually had some very strong language, in which he said :
There is strong evidence from which a jury could conclude that Monsanto does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer, focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about the issue.
That is some pretty strong language. And, I have to say, I read it as a heads-up to the press as well.
CG: Exactly. And he also did say , in that same ruling, that there are “large swaths of evidence,” the scientific evidence, showing that this product could be considered carcinogenic, and that Monsanto’s been trying to ignore those large swaths of evidence. So it’s not just the manipulation, it is also the scientific evidence that’s brought these juries, twice now, to these multi-million-dollar verdicts.
Media coverage has taken some familiar turns, talking about the loss for Monsanto and Bayer, as though they were the harmed party here.
But then also, I think, just framing stories around lawsuits and trials affects how we hear them. So when you hear about how Dewayne Johnson was awarded $280 million in damages, and that was later reduced to about $80 million, and $80 million in Hardeman , you have to remember that Monsanto has almost endlessly deep pockets, and, you know, money doesn’t cure cancer. So just speaking of it in terms of, “Oh, they won,” doesn’t really give you an accurate picture of what’s happening here, I don’t think.
Definitely. And I spoke with the plaintiffs attorneys, Aimee Wagstaff and Jennifer Moore, yesterday, and we talked about that. You know, it’s great to say, “We won,” and there’s money, and this cancer victim will get a few dollars.
But it’s really a larger picture and a larger problem in this world, where we’re allowing these companies, a handful of very powerful companies, to really dominate the regulatory system, the political system, food policy matters, agricultural policy, in which we all are just exposed to pesticides and chemicals that can do harm to our health.
And analysts are expecting that a global settlement from Bayer to put an end to all of this litigation might be between $2 and $5 billion. $2 to $5 billion is not going to cripple Bayer, Monsanto’s new owner.
So if people really want to see change, and we really want to have accurate information, to be informed, reporters and others need to start paying attention to the big picture here, and what’s happening to our environment, to our health, and how this company and these revelations in these jury trials, what they mean, what they really mean.
And that’s what I think is more important about these trials, is not who wins or who loses or how much money. I think what’s important is that it puts a spotlight on a really important public policy issue, and brings to light a lot of secret information. Internal Monsanto documents and regulatory documents and scientific studies that the general public has not heard about, 40 years of information that’s finally coming to light in these jury trials.
