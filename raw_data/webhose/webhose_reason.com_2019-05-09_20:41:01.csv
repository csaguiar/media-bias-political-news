The Strange Case of Steve Wilson - Reason.com,reason.com,John Sugg,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2006/05/05/the-strange-case-of-steve-wils,"It was not Steve Wilson’s finest moment. On May 16, 2004, the super-sized television reporter, who achieved some national fame that year for his role in the anti-business documentary The Corporation , broadcast some stunning allegations on Detroit’s WXYZ/Channel 7: One hundred sixty-seven local officials and businessmen who call themselves the “Michigan Boys” took a fishing jaunt to a seaside resort in Costa Rica, where, Wilson breathlessly reported, “dozens of prostitutes were waiting to party.”

Media Wilson’s steamy reports for the Scripps Howard©–owned station depended heavily on anonymous sources. The reporter said a madam (unnamed) told him she had brought 70 hookers to meet the Michigan Boys. A hotel worker (likewise unnamed) recounted that “the men and women are up to 5 a.m. partying. The girls go from guy to guy.”
Three days after the initial segment, Wilson was still going strong. “Many of the women told us that their business was brisk,” he intoned, again failing to name sources. “Indeed, we saw them leading Michigan men to their rooms in the dark.”
Did Wilson really see such assignations? His very recognizable bulk, the size of two typical TV anchors, and blow-dried helmet of hair would have been hard to conceal in a hotel hallway at an isolated resort. His frowning visage was already well-known to Detroit viewers, likely including many of the alleged Michigan Boys gone wild. And for a guy who is never far from a camera, including those hidden from his targets, it was odd that he had no incriminating video.
Wilson has refused to answer specific questions about his reporting and financial affairs in interviews and written exchanges stretching back six years. His most common response is vitriolic obfuscation, and he declined to comment on the topic for this article. He did try to paper over the problems with the Michigan Boys story with the on-air disclaimer, “All of the public officials identified by 7 Action News insist they never hired any hookers…and admittedly we have no proof to the contrary.”
Let’s repeat that: “We have no proof.” That’s not the stuff of airtight investigative reporting, even for a guy best known as a veteran of the national tabloid program Inside Edition . It’s even less impressive coming from a guy who has been hailed by lefty media commentators and organizations as a noble journalistic David bravely fighting the trashy tyranny of the corporate Goliaths Monsanto and Rupert Murdoch.
Wilson’s nine-year battle with the Murdoch-owned WTVT/Channel 13 in Tampa, Florida, made him a cause célèbre in media activist circles. It is now awaiting a final decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). If he gets his way, WTVT will lose its license because of decisions it made about content, an outcome with dire implications for freedom of the press.
Wilson’s beatification as an icon of the left received a big boost with the release of The Corporation two years ago. The film aspires to psychoanalyze companies, concluding that they are sociopaths whose inhuman quest for money and power has huge costs for individuals and communities. Wilson is depicted as a martyr in his crusade against Fox and Monsanto. It’s a newfound role for the TV scribe. Although a number of his earlier, sometimes award-winning investigations were consumer-oriented—exposing defects in automobiles, for example—his reports displayed no ideological position. His embrace of the “progressive” press was calculated, and he achieved remarkable success with the hate-Fox, hate-Monsanto strategy.
Leftist outlets adopted Wilson’s spin as truth, peaking with the completely credulous treatment given him in The Corporation . Meanwhile, journalists on the left have never taken note of Wilson’s own questionable reporting on the Michigan Boys, or the fact that the story led to a second license challenge at the FCC, this time aimed at him and his employer.
So one very loud local TV reporter stands on both sides of an issue that could decide how much the federal government will butt into broadcast news. But because his better-known targets are two of the institutions most reviled on the left, few people even care to know whether their man on the front lines is a crusader or a fraud. Nor do they appear to recognize the implications of making the FCC the arbiter of whether a news outlet is shading the truth.
Fighting Murdoch and Monsanto Wilson started his career in—well, it’s not clear when. He has refused to give résumés to me or to other reporters. But he first surfaced peddling freelance investigative pieces to TV stations in the 1980s. He worked for investigative teams on the CBS station in New York and the ABC station in San Francisco and eventually gained prominence during more than five years as an investigator based in Miami for the syndicated tabloid show Inside Edition . Many of his reports have won awards—at least four Emmys—for consumer investigations, such as revealing lethal defects in Chrysler minivans and Ford ignition switches.
Wilson married another reporter, Jane Akre, who worked for local stations in Albuquerque, Tucson, St. Louis, and Miami and for CNN in Atlanta before coming to Tampa. She had been fired from another Tampa station prior to joining WTVT; she subsequently sued, and the settlement agreement prohibits comments.
The two won’t answer questions about their personal lives, including whether they are still married, a matter of some speculation among their former colleagues at Fox’s WTVT in Tampa. What’s clear is that while both were in Miami in the 1990s, they teamed up, first in marriage and later, in Tampa, as news partners.
Wilson’s specialty is the ambush interview—or, as he calls it, the “unscheduled accountability session.” He loves to set up physical confrontations on camera with public officials or corporate executives, using his massive girth to create a situation where his quarry can’t escape. Wilson himself has described his reporting as “sleazy” and “tabloid.”
But by the late 1990s, both he and Akre were out of television and making a living selling phone cards, according to court records. WTVT, one of Florida’s most respected news stations, offered Wilson a return to broadcast news in 1996, and he and his wife joined the station as a team. Akre earned $70,000 a year for reporting and some anchoring; Wilson received $45,000 for part-time work as an investigator.
In 1997 Wilson and Akre began preparing a piece on a controversial Monsanto milk additive called recombinant bovine growth hormone, or rBGH, which had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993. The hormone has been blamed over the years for a variety of real or imagined offenses, from early puberty in girls to prostate cancer. Probably the fairest assessment about the product is that there is mixed scientific opinion, pitting activists against researchers whose funding often comes directly or indirectly from agribusiness companies and their trade associations. The FDA’s scientists judged that the additive posed no health threat.
On balance, the weight of evidence appears to back Monsanto. In October 2003, after more than a decade of intense public debate, The Washington Post summed up the issue this way: “Could hormones meant to make cows give more milk lead to early puberty, as some parents fear? On its face, it sounds plausible enough. But government and pediatric health experts say there are no scientific data to back up such an association.…There is also no evidence that milk from hormone-treated cows contains harmful amounts of antibiotic residue or promotes cancer.”"
Why the Acquittal of Roger Clemens Should Mean the End of Washington's Steroid Witch Hunt - Reason.com,reason.com,Rob Bibelhauser,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2012/07/04/why-the-acquittal-of-roger-clemens-shoul,"On June 18, the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves, 6-2. That same day in Washington, D.C., former Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens beat the federal government. After five years, and despite the tireless efforts of 93 deputized bureaucrats and $3 million in taxpayer sweat, Clemens was acquitted of perjury charges that stemmed from his testimony about steroid use.

Sports Drug Policy Criminal Justice Courts The Not Guilty verdict, which acquitted Clemens of all six charges in his long-running federal perjury trial, came 14 months after MLB home run king Barry Bonds was absolved of all but one of the charges filed against him in a similar show of Justice Department grandstanding. Bonds was found guilty of obstructing justice, and sentenced to a measly 30 days house arrest.
The Bonds' case, much like Clemens’, was viewed by legal analysts as paper thin and largely dependent on the testimony of witnesses who were unwilling to take the stand. Yet at the insistence of President George W. Bush, the DOJ made policing pro baseball an expensive and pointless priority.
Nanny that he was, Bush cited the steroid issue in his 2004 State of The Union address. “The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message,"" the president said. ""That there are shortcuts to accomplishment and that performance is more important than character.” Bush would go on to call on owners, coaches, and players to “get tough and to get rid of steroids now.”
At the time, fans raised their fist in agreement. Eight years later, baseball watchers and liberty lovers alike are damn tired of the government's steroid witchhunt.
“What a waste. I was thinking about it after all this time, what a waste of resources,” Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly told the Associated Press following the Clemens' verdict. “Then you hear about teachers who don’t have paper and pencils for kids, and it seems like what a waste. Really, I don’t think anybody cares. At this point nobody cares, it’s like, ‘So long.’”
Washington-based defense attorney, and former counsel to the House of Representatives, Stanley Brand echoed those same sentiments in a post-verdict interview with the AP. “It was a tremendous waste of federal resources. The juries that acquitted these people (Clemens and Bonds) weren’t persuaded by any of this.”
Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins brought the government’s glaring overreach into sharp focus. “The miscarriage of justice is not that Clemens may have gotten away with something, but that vindictive government functionaries can spend five years trying to jail someone for a crime without adequate evidence. That’s far more dangerous than any syringe Clemens may have used. I care only minimally what Clemens injected in his butt—his butt is his personal business. But I do care that a government cowboy can put his boot on Clemens’ front porch just because he doesn’t like the look of his face. Because he thinks Clemens did something ‘dirty.’ Because he feels Clemens doesn’t meet his personal definition of a ‘clean sport.’”
Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, are still slouching around a darkened ballpark.
“Lying to Congress is a serious matter,” said Ty Cobb, former coordinator of the Justice Department’s Mid-Atlantic organized crime and drug enforcement task force. “Lying to a grand jury is a serious matter, and the Justice Department should pursue those crimes without fear of losing when they think they occurred.”
Yet critics of Washington's steroid witch hunt aren't thumbing their noses at the rule of law, they're simply asking Washington to prioritize its resources toward crimes that cause actual harm. After all, the federal government does not volunteer, nor impose, its resources to police the use of Adderall, a drug many scholarship-wielding students consider to be “performance enhancing,” across a national network that includes over 600 public colleges and universities.
What could possibly justify the government assuming the role of parent and policeman, and at such a cost, to an institution as inconsequential to the preservation of civility as Major League Baseball? With America drowning in red ink, how could Cobb possibly believe that “the Justice Department should pursue those cases without fear of losing”? And what evidence is there to support the idea that the MLB cannot police itself?
Whether the Clemens’ acquittal marks the end of the government’s involvement in policing drug abuse in pro sports is yet to be seen. Luckily, baseball fans don't have to wait for federal permission to play ball.

Because Facebook and Twitter gave us the power to fight hate speech and incitement across the world from the comfort and safety of our living rooms and instead of doing that we sign petitions demanding social media 'do more' and then pat ourselves on the back for our slacktivism. Even worse, when the peacemakers amongst us were banned from social media for defending free speech, we were silent or even blamed the victim. We let these problems run rampant and it's no surprise that the social media companies now spurn our hypocrisy and turn to government to solve the problem. The result will be that even more companies decide that comment sections are too much of a liability and shut them down and direct all traffic to Facebook, which then has complete control to ban us permanently from the internet."

That was Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's message to Congress recently.
""Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,"" he wrote in an op-ed. ""(W)e shouldn't make so many important decisions…on our own.""
It sounds so self-sacrificing.
But give me a break. Big companies use regulation to their advantage.
His smaller competitors can't afford the squads of ""compliance officers"" that Facebook employs.
""You, as a company, welcome regulation?"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) asked Zuckerberg during a congressional hearing.
""If it's the right regulation, then yes,"" replied the CEO.
""Would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry?""
""Absolutely,"" replied Zuckerberg.
Zuckerberg's no dope. He sees which way the wind is blowing. He issued his plea to be regulated after receiving months of criticism from politicians.
If he cooperates early and enthusiastically, Facebook is likely to get to work with the regulators to shape the rules.
This is sad for two reasons.
One, the First Amendment says Congress ""shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech."" I'd think Zuckerberg would know that, but no, he called for government to ""require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.""
Currently, his own website is a wonderful forum for all kinds of useful speech. There's hateful speech, too, but it's the private company's job to decide whether to police that, not government's.
The second reason Facebook working with regulators is sad is that if anyone should fight for permissionless, unregulated innovation, it should be people like Mark Zuckerberg.
It's no accident that the amazing wealth creation that brought us Facebook, Google, Instagram, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., happened in the two big metropolitan areas farthest from Washington, D.C.
As Yaron Brook, chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute, says: ""Microsoft in the early 1990s was the largest company in the world, incredibly successful. They spent exactly zero dollars on lobbying, on cronyism, on lawyers. They had no presence in Washington, D.C.—not a single lawyer, not a single building."""
The NRA Is Right About the Violence Against Women Act,reason.com,Jacob Sullum,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2019/04/10/the-nra-is-right-about-the-violence-agai,"After the National Rifle Association urged legislators to oppose the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act that the House approved last week, Amy Klobuchar said the organization had shown its true colors. The Minnesota senator, who is seeking the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, claimed the NRA's position ""shows where they are when it comes to safety and when it comes to protecting women.""
The NRA, in other words, does not care about violence against women, or at least it does not care enough to accept the new gun control provisions in the House version of the bill. This blithe dismissal of the NRA's legitimate complaints about those provisions makes Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, sound like an authoritarian demagogue who equates concern about civil liberties with indifference to crime.
Criticism of the NRA's opposition to the bill has focused on the least objectionable gun provision, which would close the so-called boyfriend loophole by expanding the list of violent misdemeanors that disqualify people from owning firearms. Those crimes currently include violence against a boyfriend or girlfriend only if he or she has cohabited or produced a child with the perpetrator—a requirement that makes little sense if the aim is to disarm people who are inclined to assault intimate partners.
The provision dealing with protective orders is more problematic. Under current law , people subject to such orders may not possess guns, but only when they have had an opportunity to contest claims that they pose a threat.
The House bill would expand the disqualification to ex parte orders , which are issued without a hearing, can last a few weeks, and may be renewable after that. That change should trouble anyone who cares about due process, since it takes away people's constitutional rights based on allegations they have had no chance to rebut.
Another provision of the House bill is even more far-reaching. It would permanently deprive someone of his Second Amendment rights if he has been convicted of misdemeanor stalking, a crime that need not involve violence, threats, or even a victim the offender knows.
In Pennsylvania , for example, someone can be guilty of misdemeanor stalking if he ""repeatedly commits acts toward another person,"" including communications, that ""cause substantial emotional distress."" Stalking laws in states such as Arizona , Colorado , and New York likewise encompass repeated communications that cause emotional distress.
As NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker noted , such stalking could involve ""harassing messages"" on Facebook or nasty posts on Twitter. This sort of stalking is pretty far afield from ""violence against women.""
It is doubtful that people convicted of such misdemeanors, especially if they involve remote contact with victims they have never met, have demonstrated violent tendencies that should forever disqualify them from exercising the constitutional But instead of making the case for such a broad exclusion, the bill's backers suggest that questioning it is tantamount to siding with wife beaters and girlfriend murderers.
Before the House vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared , ""Members have a decision to make: will they protect survivors of stalking & domestic abuse? Or are they willing to allow their convicted stalkers & abusers to have access to firearms?""
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a presidential contender, deemed the NRA's criticism ""absolutely outrageous."" Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) insisted , ""I am not someone who wants to take people's guns away,"" although that is what the bill she supports would do.
""I am not paying attention to the rhetoric of the NRA because I can't be distracted,"" said Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.). ""What's most important is putting forth good legislation to save as many lives as we can.""
This casual disregard for civil liberties is reminiscent of Donald Trump's recommendation , during a meeting last year with members of Congress, that police should ""take the guns first, go through due process second."" When it comes to sacrificing constitutional rights in the name of public safety, Democrats see eye to eye with the president.

This is insane.
The whole reason the IRS shouldn't be offering ""free services"" that can be provided by the market for a cost is that the government shouldn't be competing with the private market. It is typically bad at it, because it doesn't have a profit motive. It can run at a loss forever, driving private competitors out of the market.
As for the agency providing people with pre-filled tax forms containing salary data, what the fuck do people think a W2 is? It takes me literally 20 seconds to import my W2 into Turbo Tax. And then begins the 8 hours of tax preparation bullshit that ACTUALLY constitutes filing taxes.
I remember 5 years ago when finishing my taxes, TT would pop up with ""We found a problem with line 42 on form 321Niner. Please fill in the actualized variance of your prorated value as expected"". It was horrible- as basically it was a line in the tax forms that TT hadn't figured out how to automate. Over the past 5 years, this has gone down to basically nil. The only field I had to fill out manually on a form was an address for my kids daycare. The IRS system would basically have these manual steps 90% of the process, because they have no need to do better.
Don't get me wrong, I believe H&R and Intuit are rent seekers. But they are correct here. This is not the government's job. If they want to add value, simplify the taxes!"

I don't suppose it's ironic that the government ends up destroying the very innovation it's trying to encourage with its mandates--because ""ironic"" is supposed to imply ""unexpected"" and I thoroughly expected the government to shoot itself in the foot.
It's the same thing with California and other states mandating carbon free electricity by such and such a year. The most cost effective and legitimately profitable green technologies are being undermined by these mandates by drawing in money losing competitors who wouldn't be ""competing"" with the legitimate innovators if it weren't for the mandates.

A bill supported by Democrats and Republicans would make permanent a program that bars the IRS from ever developing its own online tax filing service.
Just in time for Tax Day, the for-profit tax preparation industry is about to realize one of its long-sought goals. Congressional Democrats and Republicans are moving to permanently bar the IRS from creating a free electronic tax filing system.
Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee, led by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., passed the Taxpayer First Act, a wide-ranging bill making several administrative changes to the IRS that is sponsored by Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Mike Kelly, R-Pa.
In one of its provisions, the bill makes it illegal for the IRS to create its own online system of tax filing. Companies like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, and H&R Block have lobbied for years to block the IRS from creating such a system. If the tax agency created its own program, which would be similar to programs other developed countries have, it would threaten the industry's profits."

If we could by some means return to the circumstances where only those who have need of extensive study would require college. Those who don't require extensive study could be handled by trade schools, apprenticeships, or simply learning on-the-job with what they've already learned in high school.
Along with creating a situation where college is ""required,"" there is the issue of tuition costs that have risen far faster than inflation. Much of those costs are due to an increasingly top-heavy staff bloated with administrators. Only a minority of those administrators are a direct response to paperwork involved in student loans but even those wouldn't be necessary if costs hadn't so far outstripped the cost of living.
Making college ""free,"" in addition to not actually solving the problem that created the current state of affairs, also simply transfers the rising cost of education from the students and their parents to every tax-payer. Once that's done, the situation will only get worse as cost of education can increase at a far greater rate without suffering the backlash that it currently does."

Make it free and you saturate and dilute education. Plenty of people in those classes don't belong there. I think in a class of 100, maybe 10 belonged and another 10 were borderline.

Assuming you mean buying automated machinery to replace human labor, it makes the newly jobless human laborers poorer. It also makes pensioners poorer, because the new machines don't pay into pension funds the way the replaced laborers did. Maybe the new stuff does add to gross national product, or something, but that is by no means the same as ""makes us all richer."""

Democratic principles are hurt by ignoring the vote of the people. 2. Hating and scorning/never acknowledging an elected president is hating the country itself. 3. Law and order become a game for lying and cheating the system. 4. the country's identity and history are undermined as trivial. 5. Culture is remade as simply a matter of money and power.
Libertarians and Republicans become just users without consistent principles. The government is subsidizing big-time the illegal immigrants, but hey, big government is bad, right? Where will Libertarians be when the jobs go cold and immigrants have not integrated? Oh well, not their problem because they have their stash and can move where they want. In fact, why even have nations. Nations are the feared evil of evil now it seems. How convenient -- and how irresponsible.
A cultural war over beliefs and principles is underlying this issue. If for the sake of material wealth, the wrong ideas and ideals are indulged....will it matter? Yes, it's revolutionary. But Libertarians pretend that's outside their ultimate concern. Not very admirable, not very honest."

Bottom line, the people who are against higher levels of immigration fall into one of two camps, or both.
