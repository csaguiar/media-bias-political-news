CRANSTON — The shoulder patch worn these days by Police Chief Michael J. Winquist is loud and proud.
The embroidery features bright red and yellow puzzle pieces, which clash with the rest of the blue and black Cranston police uniform.
But there’s no mistaking that the patch is, in fact, part of Winquist’s uniform because it includes the words “Cranston Police, RI.” Further investigation reveals an insignia that says, “Supporting Autism Awareness.”
It’s all part of an effort to support autism awareness duringApril and raise money to support The Autism Project, a Johnston-based organization that provides programs, information and services for children in the region with autism. A similar police-supported autism-awareness patch campaign is underway in North Smithfield.
Cranston police officers who are wearing the patches paid $10 for each patch and the patch is being sold at the department to raise money. A total of 150 patches have been sold so far and 100 more are on order.
In Cranston, the patch campaign is part of an overall effort to support autism awareness in the community, and especially among police officers, said Winquist.
Some people with autism can have difficulty in social interactions generally, including with the police, experts say.
In 2017, Cranston police established a voluntary registry that can help officers know if someone with autism lives in a household they might be headed to. The registry, which is not public, now holds 15 names.
Its creation came after Cranston police officers learned how to recognize autism-related behaviors during a training session in 2015.
“It is not unusual for people who have autism to have an atypical reaction to a high-stimulus environment,” said Dr. Henry T. Sachs III, Bradley Hospital’s chief medical officer.
Sachs is also an assistant clinical professor in the department of psychiatry and human behavior at the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University.
He estimates Rhode Island’s population of people with autism at about 15,000.
In addition to difficulty with stimuli such as the flashing lights on a police cruiser, a person with autism can face challenges in communications, social interactions and problem-solving, Sachs said.
In social interactions, a person with autism might display behavior that seems untruthful or disrespectful to a police officer.
“If it’s misinterpreted it can lead to trouble,” Sachs said.
He can see benefits in the patch campaign.
Seeing that police officers are aware of autism and supportive can lower anxiety for some people, he said.
Cranston isn’t the first community where police personnel have altered their uniforms with special patches to bring awareness to a cause.
For example, last fall, during breast cancer awareness month, pink trim and styling on shoulder patches was in vogue at some departments around the country.
Of course, uniforms are an important part of police visibility. The presence of uniformed police officers can help people notice that a responsible organization is keeping control.
The definition of the term uniform is “always the same.”
Winquist said he probably would not support police officers wearing a differently styled patch permanently. But he said he is open to embracing other causes via other patches during some other months of the year.
“I think it’s the start of something,” Winquist said.
“We’re so visible in our community that we feel that the onus is on us to be part of our community to educate them, to help people that have different situations,” Winquist said.
“So that’s ... why we do it.” Never miss a story

7 who accused Cosby of sex abuse settle defamation suits,www.providencejournal.com,The Associated Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/zz/news/20190405/7-who-accused-cosby-of-sex-abuse-settle-defamation-suits?rssfeed=true,"7 who accused Cosby of sex abuse settle defamation suits 7:52 PM Cosby's spokesman said Cosby did not authorize the settlement reached between the women and American International Group Inc., and ""vehemently denies the allegations.""
Seven women who said Bill Cosby sexually assaulted them decades ago and then labeled them liars by denying it have settled defamation lawsuits against the imprisoned actor.
Court documents filed Friday in Springfield, Massachusetts, show a settlement has been reached since Cosby went to prison last fall in a separate Pennsylvania sex assault case. Cosby, 81, is serving a three- to 10-year prison sentence.
Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby did not authorize the settlement reached between the women and American International Group Inc., and ""vehemently denies the allegations.""
""Mr. Cosby did not settle any cases with anyone. He is not paying anything to anyone, and he is still pursuing his counterclaims. AIG decided to settle these cases, without the knowledge, permission and/or consent of Mr. Cosby,"" Wyatt said in a statement.
Courts had ruled that AIG had to pay for Cosby to defend the defamation lawsuits as part of his coverage. Cosby had homeowners and other coverage through AIG.
The judge overseeing the defamation case in Massachusetts must still approve the settlement. The terms were not disclosed in the filings Friday. A message left with AIG's corporate press office was not immediately returned late Friday.
The plaintiffs are among the dozens of women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct. They include Tamara Green, Barbara Bowman and Therese Serignese. Cosby, in a 2006 deposition, acknowledged giving Serignese quaaludes that made her ""high"" before a sexual encounter in Las Vegas in 1976, when she was 19. Some of that deposition testimony was aired in his criminal case.
""I don't think he has much to contest the cases with, given his conviction,"" said Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson. ""I don't know how much resources (he has left). It probably makes sense for both sides to resolve it.""
Joseph Cammarata, an attorney who represents the women, told The Associated Press on Friday that ""each plaintiff is satisfied with the settlement."" He declined to comment further.
However, he warned in a status report also filed Friday that his clients would seek to depose Cosby and gather other documents and evidence if Cosby does not drop counterclaims that accuse the women of harming his reputation through their accusations. Wyatt said that Cosby still intends to pursue those claims.
Cosby's wife, Camille, had been ordered to give a deposition in the defamation case in 2016, after a heated fight over her testimony.
Lawyers for the Cosbys tried to quash her subpoena to testify, saying she didn't have any relevant information on the women's claims and that any marital conversations she had with her husband of 50 years were confidential. The judge agreed that marital conversations were private, but the women's lawyers noted she also served as his business manager throughout their long marriage.
The case had largely been put on hold amid the Pennsylvania criminal case, which involved charges that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted a woman at his home in 2004. The first trial ended in a deadlock in 2017, but a second jury convicted Cosby last year.
Cosby is appealing the conviction. He is being held at a state prison in Montgomery County, outside of Philadelphia. "
Libyan militias capture Hifter's forces marching on Tripoli,www.providencejournal.com,"Rami Musa, The Associated Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190405/libyan-militias-capture-hifters-forces-marching-on-tripoli?rssfeed=true,"Libyan militias capture Hifter's forces marching on Tripoli Rami Musa, The Associated Press 3:17 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 3:17 PM
BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) "" Militias in western Libya fought forces under rival army commander Khalifa Hifter on Friday, capturing 100 of his soldiers and waging an airstrike on one of his positions a day after he declared an offensive to seize Tripoli, the capital of the oil-rich nation.
The violence came as the U.N. chief wrapped up his visit Friday aimed at avoiding an expanded conflict with a ""heavy heart and deep concern.""
The escalation comes after forces commanded by Hifter, who runs the self-styled Libya National Army based in the country's east, pushed westward. He brought his troops closer to Tripoli, which is controlled by the U.N.-backed Presidential Council and Government of National Accord and supporting militias.
A showdown between Hifter's army and the militias could plunge Libya into another spasm of violence, possibly the worst since the 2011 civil war that toppled and later killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
It would also put at risk upcoming peace talks between rivals brokered by the U.N. and aimed at drawing a roadmap for new elections. Those talks are scheduled for April 14-16.
The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency closed-door meeting on Friday afternoon at Britain's request to discuss the unfolding developments.
Hifter's troops on Thursday captured the town of Gharyan, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Tripoli without a fight, putting them closer to the militias than ever before.
Hifter then ordered his forces to march on the capital, saying in an audio recording posted online: ""We are coming Tripoli, we are coming."" He also urged his forces to enter the city peacefully and only raise their weapons ""in the face of those who seek injustice and prefer confrontation and fighting.""
The march appeared to have faced a set-back on Friday, however.
Militias from the western cities of Zawiya and Misarata, which control Tripoli, said they had mobilized to confront Hifter.
""We are the revolutionaries and the elders ... we declare we are in full mobilization and war,"" they said in a video statement posted online.
A group of allied militias called the Joint Tripoli Protection Force based in the area around the Libyan capital announced they would also deploy to repel Hifter's offensive.
Over 100 of Hifter's soldiers were captured by Zawiya militias, said army spokesman Ahmed al-Mesmari. He said the soldiers' commander was being investigated.
Anti-Hifter activists on social media posted pictures of what they described as militiamen from Zawiya capturing dozens of Hifter's forces and armored vehicles carrying stickers reading ""106th Battalion."" The unit is known to be commanded by Hifter's son, Khaled. It's one of the largest units Hifter has deployed to march on Tripoli.
Also, Misrata militias launched an airstrike targeting Hifter's position at the foot of the mountains of Nafusa, he said. He didn't elaborate on the number of casualties.
In Tripoli, council member Mohammed al-Ammari spoke from the city center saying that Libya will not become a ""hostage in hands of a military dictator once again.""
There were conflicting reports during the day as to how much and where exactly Hifter's fighters were advancing in areas such as Souk al-Khamis.
Clashes erupted at night in the western district of Qasr Bani Ghashir, close to Tripoli International airport, which was destroyed in 2014 fighting. Former lawmaker Abdel-Raouf al-Manaei said the forces fighting under the umbrella of the Government of National Accord will not permit ""a replica of el-Sissi military rule in Libya,"" in reference to the authoritarian Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is an army chief turned president.
The renewed fighting came a day after U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres arrived on a rare visit to Libya. On Friday, Guterres went to the eastern region, which is the seat of a rival administration and parliament that Hifter is aligned with.
Guterres met with Agila Saleh, head of the east-based parliament, according to spokesman Abdullah Ablahig.
""I am leaving Libya with heavy heart and deep concern,"" he told reporters at the airport shortly after meeting with Hifter.
""I still hope, if possible, to avoid armed confrontation around Tripoli,"" he said. ""The United Nations remains available to facilitate any political solution.""
Since Gadhafi's ouster, Libya has been split between rival governments in the east and the west and an array of militias fighting over power and oil fields. Hifter has recently seized much of southern Libya without fighting.
Several governments and organizations urged de-escalation, including those known to be Hifter's key backers, such as France and the United Arab Emirates, without specifically mentioning the commander.

"Former Obama Aide Becomes College President, Makes It Clear He OPPOSES Free Speech On Campus",ilovemyfreedom.org,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://ilovemyfreedom.org/former-obama-aide-becomes-college-president-makes-it-clear-he-opposes-free-speech-on-campus/,"Former Obama Aide Becomes College President, Makes It Clear He OPPOSES Free Speech On Campus April 5, 2019 J.R.
Despite being out of office for two-plus years, the United States is still very “Obama-centric.”
Beta males in the media, Hollywood, and Congress are still whining over silly things, while masculine women continue to pretend there’s no such thing as gender roles.
From The Blaze :
David R. Harris — president of Union College in New York and an appointee in the administration of former President Barack Obama — stated in an Inside Higher Ed essay last week, “I oppose free speech on college campuses.”
That statement — along with the title of his essay, “ A Campus Is Not the Place for Free Speech ” — is quite the attention grabber for those on both sides of the free speech debate raging at institutions of higher learning and around the country at the moment.
And indeed a further read of his piece shows Harris has more on his mind than his provocative statements indicate — but backlash against his essay accuses him of not fully communicating with readers and not completely spelling out his beliefs about free speech, particularly at his own private college.
First, Harris declared that he doesn’t believe “college campuses should be safe havens from voices on the left and right that violate what I have learned and what I believe. My opposition is just as strong when it comes to free speech arguments in support of voices that affirm my beliefs.”
NATIONWIDE POLL: Should Trump CUT Pensions For Former Presidents?
From the essay, Harris writes:
Free speech, in its purest form, is an exercise in what is achieved when a person yells a view and then leaves, after which someone with an opposing perspective does the same. The speakers do not grow as a result of the experience, and the audience has no opportunity to probe the opposing points of view. Such an exercise is guaranteed by the Constitution, and I wholeheartedly support the exercise of free speech in public spaces.
On campuses, however, we must strive for something more than free speech. Our mission requires that we seek what I refer to as constructive engagement. It is not enough for individuals to speak freely. We must also find myriad ways to put a range of views into conversation with one another. It is what we do in classrooms every day. It is what we do on debate teams. It is what happens across every campus, far more than critics appreciate. It is what happens in the lives of college students much more frequently than in the lives of most adults, in part because college campuses and social networks tend to be more diverse than “real world” neighborhoods and social clubs.
POLL: Should Crooked Hillary Be Tossed In Jail?
This guy is loony tunes.
And yet, he’ll never get called out on it thanks to his adoring fans in the MSM. "

An attorney for President Donald Trump on Friday blasted U.S. House Democrats' request for six years of Trump's tax returns as ""a misguided attempt"" to politicize the tax laws, accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits. In a statement that mapped out the legal battlefield ahead, William Consovoy said the request, formally filed on Wednesday by U.S. House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Richard Neal, flouts ""constitutional constraints."" ""The requests for his private tax information are not consistent with governing law, do not advance any proper legislative purpose, and threaten to interfere with the ordinary conduct of audits,"" Consovoy said. ""We are confident that this misguided attempt to politicize the administration of the tax laws will not succeed,"" he said. One of the many investigations targeting Trump on Capitol Hill and in the U.S. court system, the House Democrat's probe into the president's tax returns could pull back the curtain on his business empire and his reputation as a savvy dealmaker. Unlike previous presidents over recent decades, Trump has refused to make public past tax returns, while retaining ownership in many enterprises, ranging from golf courses and hotels to Trump Tower in New York City and his Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida.

Nunes: The Russian Collusion Hoax Meets An Unbelievbable End | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/nunes-russian-collusion-hoax-meets-unbelievbable-end,"
Authored by Rep. Devin Nunes, op-ed via The Washington Examiner,
As the Russia collusion hoax hurtles toward its demise, it’s important to consider how this destructive information operation rampaged through vital American institutions for more than two years , and what can be done to stop such a damaging episode from recurring.
While the hoax was fueled by a wide array of false accusations, misleading leaks of ostensibly classified information, and bad-faith investigative actions by government officials, one vital element was indispensable to the overall operation: the Steele dossier.
Funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee, which hid their payments from disclosure by funneling them through the law firm Perkins Coie, the dossier was a collection of false and often absurd accusations of collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials. These allegations, which relied heavily on Russian sources cultivated by Christopher Steele, were spoon-fed to Trump opponents in the U.S. government, including officials in law enforcement and intelligence.
The efforts to feed the dossier’s allegations into top levels of the U.S. government, particularly intelligence agencies, were championed by Steele, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, and various intermediaries. These allegations were given directly to the FBI and Justice Department, while similar allegations were fed into the State Department by long-time Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal.
Their efforts were remarkably effective. Officials within the FBI and DOJ, whether knowingly or unintentionally, provided essential support to the hoax conspirators, bypassing normal procedures and steering the information away from those who would view it critically. The dossier soon metastasized within the government, was cloaked in secrecy, and evaded serious scrutiny.
High-ranking officials such as then-FBI general counsel James Baker and then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr were among those whose actions advanced the hoax. Ohr, one of the most senior officials within the DOJ, took the unprecedented step of providing to Steele a back door into the FBI investigation. This enabled the former British spy to continue to feed information to investigators, even though he had been terminated by the FBI for leaking to the press and was no longer a valid source. Even worse, Ohr directly briefed Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad, two DOJ officials who were later assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In short, the investigation was marked by glaring irregularities that would normally be deemed intolerable.
According to Ohr’s congressional testimony, he told top-level FBI officials as early as August or September 2016 that Steele was biased against Trump, that Steele’s work was connected to the Clinton campaign, and that Steele's material was of questionable reliability. Steele himself confirmed that last point in a British court case in which he acknowledged his allegations included unverified information. Yet even after this revelation, intelligence leaders continued to cite the Steele dossier in applications to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
It is astonishing that intelligence leaders did not immediately recognize they were being manipulated in an information operation or understand the danger that the dossier could contain deliberate disinformation from Steele’s Russian sources . In fact, it is impossible to believe in light of everything we now know about the FBI’s conduct of this investigation, including the astounding level of anti-Trump animus shown by high-level FBI figures like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, as well as the inspector general’s discovery of a shocking number of leaks by FBI officials.
It’s now clear that top intelligence officials were perfectly well aware of the dubiousness of the dossier, but they embraced it anyway because it justified actions they wanted to take - turning the full force of our intelligence agencies first against a political candidate and then against a sitting president.
The hoax itself was a gift to our nation’s adversaries, most notably Russia. The abuse of intelligence for political purposes is insidious in any democracy. It undermines trust in democratic institutions, and it damages the reputation of the brave men and women who are working to keep us safe. This unethical conduct has had major repercussions on America’s body politic, creating a yearslong political crisis whose full effects remain to be seen.
Having extensively investigated this abuse, House Intelligence Committee Republicans will soon be submitting criminal referrals on numerous individuals involved in these matters.
These people must be held to account to prevent similar abuses from occurring in the future. The men and women of our intelligence community perform an essential service defending American national security, and their ability to carry out their mission cannot be compromised by biased actors who seek to transform the intelligence agencies into weapons of political warfare.

Senate leaders agreed April 4 on firm dates for the final vote on 10 government bills currently in the Upper Chamber, including several key government bills, but not the two that have drawn the staunchest opposition from the Conservatives, C-69 and C-48.
The deal sets dates for the progression through one, two, or three stages—depending on the bill—for all 13 government bills currently in the Senate. The agreement, which was signed by the leaders of all four groups in the Senate, also sets dates for the final vote on bills C-55 on marine protected areas, C-58 on access to information, C-59 on national security, C-71 on gun control, C-75 on criminal justice reform, C-77 on military justice reform, C-78 on divorce law, C-81 on accessibility, C-83 on inmate segregation, and C-85 on the Canada-Israel trade agreement, according to a copy of the deal obtained by The Hill Times.

Oh, pizza. Is there a single food more universally beloved that is also so incredibly divisive? The most contentious of these divisions comes between New Yorkers and their New York-style slices and Chicagoans and their deep dish pies. Deep dish pizza was invented in the Windy City in 1943 by Ike Sewell, founder of Uno’s Pizzeria. It became so popular that it spun into a huge national chain and inspired dozens upon dozens of other deep dish pizzerias in major cities across the world. So tuck a napkin into your collar, grab a fork and knife (you’ll need them), and celebrate National Deep Dish Pizza Day with us this April 5!"
VA Company Warned About Genetic Tests,www.wvlkam.com,sjohnson,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.wvlkam.com/2019/04/05/va-company-warned-about-genetic-tests/,"VA Company Warned About Genetic Tests
(FDA)–Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to Inova Genomics Laboratory (Inova) of Falls Church, Virginia, for illegally marketing certain genetic tests that have not been reviewed by the FDA for safety and effectiveness. The tests claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications based on genetic variants. Selecting or changing drug treatment in response to the test results could lead to potentially serious health consequences for patients. The FDA is unaware of any data establishing that Inova’s tests can help patients or health care providers make appropriate treatment decisions for the listed drugs. The action today reflects the agency’s commitment to monitor the pharmacogenetic test landscape and take action when appropriate to address a significant public health risk.
“Consumers are increasingly embracing genetic testing to better understand their individual risk for developing diseases. With this rise in popularity and availability, we’re also seeing significant activity in the field of pharmacogenetics, which is the process of understanding what, if any, role genetics plays in a patient’s reaction to particular drugs. Without appropriate evaluation to determine whether these tests work, patients are being put at risk—potentially impacting treatment decisions by providing false promise that they will respond well to a certain medicine or keeping them from using therapies that may benefit them,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “We are issuing this warning letter as part of our ongoing efforts to protect the public from the significant risk these tests pose. We are particularly concerned about pharmacogenetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications where such claims have not been established and are not described in the drug labeling and continue to warn patients and health care professionals that they should not rely on these tests for treatment decisions.”
“To be able to detect genetic variants and use them in determining an appropriate course of care is one way in which we encourage research and innovation. We have so much more to learn about the use of these tests for specific medications, what the results mean, and how we can apply the information to improve a patient’s health,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “While we are committed to supporting innovation in this area, we will also be vigilant in protecting against the potential risks and are therefore issuing this warning letter to help protect patients and providers from acting on data that has not been demonstrated to promote the safe and effective use of drugs.”
The use of some drugs can be informed by pharmacogenetic testing. When the agency has reviewed scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between the drug’s effects and genetic variants and determined the information is sufficient to be included in the drug labeling, information about how to use the genetic test results to manage medication treatment is described in the labeling for the specific drug to assure safe use of the drug.
The FDA issued a warning letter to Inova for marketing pharmacogenetic tests that have not been reviewed by the FDA and that claim to predict patients’ clinical responses to specific named drugs, including antidepressants, opioids, cancer treatments, anesthesia and diabetes medications. The FDA has not reviewed and is unaware of any data establishing that Inova’s tests can help patients or health care providers use the listed drugs more safely or effectively. The warning letter requests that Inova respond, within 15 working days from the date the warning letter was received, with details of how the violations noted in the warning letter will be corrected. Any violations not corrected could lead to enforcement action such as seizure, injunction or civil money penalties.
Tests that make claims that have not been evaluated by the FDA may influence health care providers and patients to inappropriately select or change drug treatment based on the results from genetic tests. Acting on these results could lead to potentially serious health consequences for patients. For example, patients may change the dose of their medication for a particular condition or disease based on the results of such a genetic test, which may lead to an incorrect treatment or worsening illness.
Last year, the agency issued a safety communication warning consumers and health care professionals about pharmacogenetic tests being marketed directly to consumers or offered through health care providers that claim to predict how a patient will respond to specific medications.
Following issuance of the safety communication, the FDA reached out to several firms marketing pharmacogenetic tests with claims to predict how a person will respond to specific medications in cases where the relationship between genetic (DNA) variations and the medication’s effects has not been established. Most firms addressed the FDA’s concerns by removing specific medication names from their labeling, including promotional material and patient test reports.
These actions, including the warning letter issued today, reflect the agency’s commitment to advancing policies that enhance the FDA’s oversight of device safety. As part of the Medical Device Safety Action Plan , the FDA has warned the public when safety issues are identified, such as with thermography devices .
Health care professionals and consumers should report any adverse events related to these and other genetic tests to the FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program. To file a report, use the MedWatch Online Voluntary Reporting Form . The completed form can be submitted online or via fax to 1-800-FDA-0178. The FDA monitors these reports and takes appropriate action necessary to ensure the safety of medical products in the marketplace."

Nepal: Two Third Majority For Oli Has Not Worked – Analysis,www.eurasiareview.com,SAAG,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/06042019-nepal-two-third-majority-for-oli-has-not-worked-analysis/,"By SAAG
By S.Chandrasekharan
Prior to the last General Elections, the unified Communist party of Maoists and the UML went round the country seeking votes promising that they would need a good majority to have proper governance and stability. Not that the country has not had a majority government in the past, but it was a good justification to ask for votes purely on the promise of stability of the country. Yet fourteen months have passed and the two third majority has really not worked. One of the writers in the media has examined this issue and has come up with good reasons.
First, there is rivalry and ego clashes among the top leadership. Oli is getting more and more isolated with all other leaders both from the UML and the erstwhile Maoist leadership ganging up together to thwart any new initiative.
Second, is the uneasy relationship between the two top leaders- Dahal and Oli as the latter will have to be constantly looking behind his back to watch Dahal who has ambitions of his own to become the next Prime Minister! He is yet to tell Oli as what transpired between him and the Indian leadership during his recent visit.
Third, is the intra party relationship and the merger of the two groups is actually in name and not in spirit. At the ground level they remain as two entities. On top of that, two senior UML leaders Jhalanath Khanal and Bam Dev Gautham are taking sides with Dahal on any issue where differences arise within the party leadership.
Fourth, in my view is that Oli is taking decisions all by himself and has given up consulting the senior leadership within the party. There are allegations that he is making the PMO strong thereby making other departments irrelevant. The PMO has brought in departments like the National Investigation Dept, Department of Revenue investigation, Department of Money laundering within its control thus making the PM’s office very powerful and it could harass anybody.
Above all, Oli is moving a bill to get the power to deploy Army unilterally thus bypassing the National Security Council. This is being opposed even by the Army. The National Security Council consists of the PM as the chairman with the Defence, Law and Finance Ministers as members along with the Chief Secretary and the Army Chief.
In the matter of administration everything appears to be frozen. The two transitional mechanisms, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Agency to look into the disappearances are frozen and it is said that the TRC files have all been bundled up and sealed for a new committee to be yet appointed by the Cabinet. The TRC has received over 63,000 complaints and after all these years enquiry has been completed in only 4000. Of the investigation into disappearances, out of 4000 complaints, investigation has been completed in 2200 petitions. No one except the poor victims care about the disposal of these cases. Meanwhile there is a talk of “forget and forgive” amongst the erstwhile top Maoist leadership.
Oli has since realized the need for firm against the breakaway faction of the Maoists led by ‘Biplab’ alias Netra Bikram Chand and his group. Some arrests at the middle level have been made while the top leadership have gone underground! Unless Oli gets full support from the erstwhile Maoists ( he is ot getting), the problem is likely to develop into serious proportions affecting the law and order situation of the whole State. A task force has been formed from the Security Forces to coordinate, monitor and deal with the problem.
There is yet no sign of getting the constitutional amendments to satisfy the MADHESI groups and most likely Upendra Yadav, who is keen to keep his Deputy Prime ministership in tact may wait till the next General Elections to approach the innocent voters to vote for them again! Some fifty lives have been lost in the protest campaign so far but no effort is seen to have been taken by the leaders to give the victims’ families their due compensation.
The media is abuzz with the rumour that a National Security Policy has been approved by the cabinet two weeks ago and it is said that the Ministry of Defence has categorically asked officials not to disclose the details.
Yet, some points have trickled down in the public domain. It is said that 13 issues affecting the national interests have been identified and possible threats to all these interests have been discussed.
Mention has been made of interference in the internal affairs by external powers. It is said that no country has been named. Does India figure in this ? One observation that needs to be made here is- that in the foreign policy narrative, efforts to balance relations with China- a rising super power and the USA are being discussed and India does not figure. This is good in a way now as in the past, anything going wrong in Nepal, India was being blamed!
There is of course mention of the five-month blockade and the vulnerability of Nepal being a land locked country. Misuse of law is seen as a major tendency to be avoided and there appears to be a mention of “authoritarian trends to maintain political control”. Does it allude to the present Prime Minister Oli who wants to make himself very powerful?
One of the top leaders of the Nepali Congress- General Secretary and a member of the Koirala family dropped a bomb in proposing a referendum to get the view of the people of making Nepal a’Hindu State’ as opposed to the current status as federal republic. He said that he stood for a Hindu nation because many of the voters in Nepal are Hindus and it is important to pay attention to their call for a Hindu Nation. At the same time, he called for freedom of religion.
This call for a ‘Hindu State’ is unikely to die soon and one can see many more politicians coming out openly for a Hindu State.
One redeeming feature in Oli’s administration is that the economy is doing well. Latest ADB report projects a GDP growth of 6.2 percent going up to 6.3 percent in 2020. A good monsoon is expected with agricultural sector going up from 2.8 to 4.5 percent and inflation fairly under control rising to 4.4 from 4.2 percent.

"Venezuela: UN Should Lead Full-Scale Emergency Response, Says HRW",www.eurasiareview.com,Eurasia Review,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/06042019-venezuela-un-should-lead-full-scale-emergency-response-says-hrw/,"By Eurasia Review
The combination of severe medicine and food shortages within Venezuela, together with the spread of disease across the country’s borders, amounts to a complex humanitarian emergency that requires a full-scale response by the United Nations secretary-general, researchers from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Human Rights Watch said in a report.
The Venezuelan authorities during the presidency of Nicolás Maduro have proven unable to stem the crisis, and have in fact exacerbated it through their efforts to suppress information about the scale and urgency of the problems.
The 71-page report, “ Venezuela’s Humanitarian Emergency: Large-Scale UN Response Needed to Address Health and Food Crises ,” documents increased numbers of maternal and infant deaths; the unchecked spread of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and diphtheria; and sharp increases in the transmission of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis in Venezuela. Available data shows high levels of food insecurity and child malnutrition, as well as of hospital admissions of malnourished children.
“No matter how hard they try, Venezuelan authorities cannot hide the reality on the ground,” said Shannon Doocy, Ph.D., associate professor of International Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who conducted research at Venezuela’s border. “Venezuela’s health system is in utter collapse, which, combined with widespread food shortages, is piling suffering upon suffering and putting even more Venezuelans at risk. We need UN leadership to help end this severe crisis and save lives.”
In late March 2019, the International Federation of the Red Cross announced that it was scaling-up its operations in Venezuela to provide aid to around 650,000 people. A UN report leaked to the media around the same time estimated that the population in need of support was 7 million.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres should lead efforts to develop a comprehensive humanitarian response plan for the situation inside and outside of the country, the groups said. Specifically, Guterres should: Officially declare that Venezuela is facing a complex humanitarian emergency, a UN term of art, which would help unlock the mobilization of sufficient resources to address the urgent needs of the Venezuelan people; Task the UN emergency relief coordinator, who is also head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), to address Venezuela’s crisis as a top priority requiring full-scale mobilization of humanitarian relief efforts and resources; and Request Venezuelan authorities to grant UN staff full access to official disease, epidemiological, food security, and nutrition data so they can carry out an independent and comprehensive humanitarian needs assessment of the full scope of the crisis nationwide.
Experts from Human Rights Watch and from the Center for Humanitarian Health and the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health interviewed more than 150 people for the report. They included health care professionals, Venezuelans seeking or in need of medical care or food who had recently arrived in Colombia and Brazil, representatives from international and nongovernmental humanitarian organizations, UN officials, and Brazilian and Colombian government officials. Researchers also analyzed data on the situation inside Venezuela from official sources, hospitals, international and national organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. This was a one-year research project. Enjoy the article? Then please consider donating today to ensure that Eurasia Review can continue to be able to provide similar content."
Moscow Close To UN Recognition That Its Continental Shelf Extends Far Into Arctic – OpEd,www.eurasiareview.com,Paul Goble,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/06042019-moscow-close-to-un-recognition-that-its-continental-shelf-extends-far-into-arctic-oped/,"By Paul Goble
After almost 20 years of Russian lobbying, a subgroup of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf has declared that much of the Arctic seabed is an extension of Russia’s continental shelf. If that is confirmed by the entire commission, Moscow’s claims to the Arctic will have gained significant international recognition.
Russian officials are jubilant. Yevgeny Kiselyev, who heads the Russian agency that oversees questions of natural resources and territorial arrangements about them, told TASS that the decision was “extraordinarily important for us” ( tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/6290153 ).
If he is right that the full commission will soon follow suit, that will mean that the UN will have given new weight to Moscow’s argument that its continental shelf extends under an additional 1.2 million square kilometers in the Arctic. And that in turn will give it a much stronger claim for controlling access to natural resources and the passage of ships even far from its coastline.
Russian commentator Aleksandr Dubrovsky is equally excited about the consequences. In an article entitled “The Arctic is Returned Home,” he says that what the sub-commission has done works to Moscow’s advantage even if the full committee eventually decides not to include all the territory that the sub-commission has ( iarex.ru/articles/65623.html ).
“Already now,” Dubrovsky argues, “independent of the final result, this event testifies to a triumph of Russian fundamental science which has been capable of carrying out work” that no one else could do and “the strategic thinking of the Russian authorities” about the Arctic basin and how to struggle for it.
But Western experts say that the Russian enthusiasm may be overstated: Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia says that the UN commission is not in the business of defining borders but rather ruling on the validity of geological data presented to it ( thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2019/04/russia-scores-scientific-point-quest-extended-arctic-continental-shelf ).
That suggests the issue is far from resolved, although there is one reason Moscow may have for thinking it has made progress toward achieving its goal in this region. Defining the borders does come under the international Law of the Sea Convention, something Moscow is a signatory to but the US has not ratified.
