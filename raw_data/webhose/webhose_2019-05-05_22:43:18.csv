TALLINN (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to dispel Tallinn 's security concerns during the upcoming meeting with his Estonian counterpart, Kersti Kaljulaid, set to take place later in April , Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday.
Kaljulaid will arrive in Moscow on April 18 to attend the opening of the renovated Estonian Embassy building. Peskov confirmed on Wednesday that Moscow had received a request for a meeting between Putin and Kaljulaid and the preparation for talks were underway.
""There are certain concerns in Estonia about the security situation. From our point of view, there are no grounds for this. Russia has repeatedly stressed that there are no threats for our neighbors from our side. The purpose of the meeting is to get to know each other better and discuss topical issues"" Peskov told the Postimees newspaper.
The neighboring countries suffer from the lack of communication at the top level, the spokesman noted.
""It is very important to talk to each other. We have a large deficit in bilateral dialogue, especially at the highest level,"" Peskov noted, adding that the upcoming meeting is unlikely to result in any concrete agreements.
The last visit of Estonian leader to Russia took place in 2011, when then-president Toomas Hendrik Ilves attended the reconsecration of St. John's Church in St.Petersburg. This Protestant church belongs to Estonia ."

Kuala Lumpur, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : India set their sights on qualifying for the 2026 World Cup as Praful Patel became their first representative on the powerful FIFA Council on Saturday.
Patel, one of six Asian delegates elected to the Council at the Asian Football Confederation Congress , said the World Cup was the next big step for India after making great strides in recent years.

History against Tiger Roll's bid to emulate National legend Red Rum,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/history-against-tiger-rolls-bid-to-emulate-n-587535.html,"History Against Tiger Roll's Bid To Emulate National Legend Red Rum Faizan Hashmi 15 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 03:46 PM Tiger Roll will bid to succeed where 17 previous Grand National winners in the intervening years have failed and emulate Red Rum (1973/74) in winning the world's greatest steeplechase for a second successive time.
London, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Tiger Roll will bid to succeed where 17 previous Grand National winners in the intervening years have failed and emulate Red Rum (1973/74) in winning the world 's greatest steeplechase for a second successive time.
History may suggest the Gordon Elliott-trained star is up against it but punters do not believe that as they pile the money on ahead of the tape going up on the spine-tingling race at 1615 GMT at Aintree racecourse.
Tiger Roll could be the shortest-priced favourite since Red Rum went off at 7/2 in 1975 when he finished second.
A win for the Davy Russell-ridden favourite would strip the bookies of an estimated 200 million .
""He seems to be getting better,"" Russell told ITV.
""He is carrying more weight this year so it is a big ask.
""But the bigger occasion the better he is and he is a right character,"" added the 39-year-old Irishman.
Two former Grand National winning jockeys, AP McCoy and Mick Fitzgerald, believe he is an even better horse than last year when he just held off a charging Pleasant Company , who is back for revenge.
Ironically based on sheer weight of numbers Tiger Roll could be denied by another Elliott horse, as the Irish trainer handles 11 of the 40 runners -- a record in itself.
""I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I don't come from a horse background,"" the combative handler told BBC Sport.
""Everything I have, I've worked very hard for it.
""I've got five or six different owners, they've all paid their entry fee, they're all entitled to have a runner in the race ."" - 'Mentally he is in the right place' - The classiest horse in the race apart from Tiger Roll, whose short price is also due to a startling annihilation of a classy field in the Cross Country Race at the Cheltenham Festival last month, is top weight Anibale Fly.
He comes into this year's edition -- he was third last year in an Irish clean sweep -- on the back of a fine second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
However, trainer Tony Martin has had to bring in jockey Mark Walsh as a late replacement after Barry Geraghty's hopes of a second win in the race were dashed after he broke a leg in a fall on Friday.
History too could be made if either Lakeview Lad -- trained in Scotland by former stockbroker Nick Alexander -- or Vintage Clouds win as it would give former Blackpool Tower owner Trevor Hemmings a record fourth victory.
Another Scottish runner One For Arthur is bidding to repeat his success of 2017 -- one of a plethora of runners trained by women , in his case Lucinda Russell.
""Mentally he is in the right place, Aintree fences bring the best out of him,"" said Russell.
The odds are shorter on a woman training the winner this year than of either Lizzie Kelly on Tea For Two -- trained by her mother Jane Williams -- or top Irish jockey Rachael Blackmore on Valseur Lido becoming the first of their sex to win the race .
However, there have been a flood of bets for Kelly's ride, who has been an integral part of her establishing herself as a top jockey.
""I was still at university when I won a bumper on him at Wincanton, all those years ago. He's been part of my career at every stage,"" said the 25-year-old.
Russell's boyfriend Peter Scudamore won almost every major prize as a jumps jockey but, like fellow greats John Francome and Jonjo O'Neill, the National eluded him.
This is a fate that threatens to befall champion jockey Richard Johnson, who has his 21st try with Rock The Kasbah.
""I am not going to lose sleep if I never win it,"" said the popular 41-year-old.
""However, to have a picture on the wall of winning the Grand National, you would never get tired of looking at that."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman will head a delegation of US ambassadors and White House representatives on the March of the Living, which will be dedicated this year to the struggle of the future generation against antisemitism and the memory of Greek Jewry.""We are marching to remind the world of the horrors of the Holocaust,"" said Dr. Shmuel Rosenman, founder and co-chairman of the International March of the Living. The 31st annual March of the Living will take place on May 2, 2019. Some 10,000 Jewish and non-Jewish youth from all over the world will walk 3.2 kilometers between Auschwitz and Birkenau in memory of those who perished in the Holocaust and in a call to fight antisemitism. This year, the main event of the Holocaust Day will be devoted to Greek Jewry and the singer Yehuda Poliker, who will participate in the parade and perform at the ceremonies.The participants in the march will call for a war against rising antisemitism and against the background of the growing trend of hate crimes against Jews around the world in the past two years. Concurrently, participants will cooperate in a large-scale digital ad campaign under the following criteria: #SayNoToAntisemitism.According to a report by the Ministry of the Diaspora, 2018 was the year in which the most antisemitic Jews were murdered since 1994. Even in 2019, hundreds of antisemitic incidents were recorded.Twenty young people from around the world, some of whom have experienced antisemitism on their own, will sign a joint treaty to combat racism and antisemitism and call on young people around the world to take part in an international event on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day in Krakow. Poliker, who recently marked 30 years since the debut of his album ""Ash and Dust,"" will also perform at the event, performing his songs ""When You Grow Up"" and ""Things I Wanted to Say.""""Unfortunately, lately antisemitism has reared its ugly head, and studies in the US and Europe have shown that about half of the youth have never heard of Auschwitz before,” said . One of our goals here in the march of life is to fight against it, ""said Rosenman. “We are here to say in a clear voice: 'Never again.' We march to remind the world of the horrors and to lead a global move to fight antisemitism.”Along with thousands of young people from around the world, dozens of Holocaust survivors will also travel on the March of the Living to share their stories. They will be joined by a special delegation headed by US ambassador to Israel David Friedman. That delegation will also include US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, US ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher and Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Elan Carr.Greece will also send a distinguished delegation to the march, headed by Patriarch Bartholomew, 270th Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch, who leads tens of millions of Orthodox Christians around the world. The speaker of the Greek Parliament, Nikos Voutsis, will also participate.Joining these dignitaries will be Romanian Prime Minister Eureka Dancilla and Rabbi Israel Lau. The latter has been marching since the first parade in 1988.Jewish Agency Chairman Isaac Herzog will head the Jewish Agency delegation. The New England Revolution soccer club will also take part.March of the Living is an annual educational program that brings people from all over the world to Poland and Israel on a journey from the Holocaust to revival. The purpose of the parade is to instill in the younger generation the history of the Holocaust and to instill in it values of tolerance, acceptance of the other, volunteerism and mutual responsibility. Since the first parade, more than 250,000 participants from 52 countries marched the nearly 3 kilometers from Auschwitz to Birkenau on Holocaust Day.In the framework of the program, various youth delegations, Jews and non-Jews alike, visit ghettos, monuments and death camps, culminating in the march. After that, participants from the March of the Living continue their journey from Poland for a week of study in Israel, where they take part in the Memorial Day ceremonies for the IDF and then celebrate Israel Independence Day.

Chris Heaton-Harris MP was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) until April 3rd, when he resigned in response to Prime Minister Theresa May announcing she would request a second Brexit delay from the European Council, suggesting that bureaucrats had purposely failed to inform her of all the No Deal planning which is in place.
Mrs May’s decision to abandon her previous position that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and suggest she would submit to a customs union with the European Union to win the support of the hard-left Labour opposition for a deal “obviously makes my job in Government [as minister overseeing No Deal planning] irrelevant”, Heaton-Harris said in his resignation letter.
After much contemplation, I have decided to leave Theresa May's Government. I'm grateful to the PM for giving me the opportunity to serve the UK and I will continue to represent my constituents as the MP for Daventry. pic.twitter.com/sHkVhwJ7bb
— Chris Heaton-Harris (@chhcalling) April 3, 2019
Now, in a hard-hitting article published in The Telegraph , the MP for Daventry has again pressed home that “Hundreds of civil servants had been working for over two years to ensure we would be ready [for No Deal], but parliamentarians and others who are doing everything they can to stop Brexit needed to maintain a narrative that leaving without a deal would be a ‘disaster’ for jobs and our economy.”
The Brexiteer described “very well advanced” plans to deal with any potential disruption of trade across the English Channel — by the European Commission and the French government, as well as British officials — and that there would be no killer blow to so-called “just-in-time” supply chains should the country revert to trade with the EU on standard World Trade Organization (WTO) terms — otherwise known as a “clean” or “No Deal” Brexit.
He stressed that there had even been “open days for the media to demonstrate how ready both countries are to leave without a deal” at new Anglo-French border facilities — little-noticed by a mainstream media more concerned with tall tales of Mars bar famines and a barrage of space debris following Brexit.
Govt Whistleblower: UK Prepared for ‘No Deal’ Brexit, Scare Stories ‘Absolutely Untrue’ https://t.co/FHVSSJBnua
— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2018
The former Brexit minister’s reassurances echo those given by an anonymous Civil Service whistleblower , who revealed in late 2018 that “claims that we will all ‘crash out’ over the white cliffs of Dover into the Channel at 11 p.m. on 29 March 2019” — when Britain was originally scheduled to leave the EU — “and wake up to certain chaos and doom… is absolutely untrue, as anyone who, like me, has been involved in Brexit work for the past two-and-a-half years in Whitehall will tell you.”
“[O]f course no-deal preparations have been made. Very detailed plans have been proposed, assessed, analysed to death and finally agreed by working groups and steering groups and directors’ boards and cross-Whitehall talking shops. They have then been sent to ministers for approval. And they are now being executed,” the official disclosed.
“To claim otherwise is to equate the United Kingdom with a tinpot dictatorship where officials tote machine guns,” he added — suggesting that members of the public and Members of Parliament were both being misled about the how well-prepared the country was for No Deal, likely in order to bounce them into falling in behind Mrs May’s unpopular Withdrawal Agreement.

CARACAS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Venezuelan opposition is coordinating with allies the measures to prevent the exports of Venezuelan oil to Cuba , opposition leader Juan Guaido, who proclaimed himself country's interim president, said on Saturday.
On Friday, the United States sanctioned 34 vessels tied to the Venezuelan PDVSA oil company , controlled by the government of President Nicolas Maduro, and two companies that allegedly transport oil from Venezuela to Cuba . Moreover, a senior official from the administration of US President Donald Trump said the latest round of sanctions was introduced at the request of the Venezuelan opposition-led National Assembly .
""In coordination with our allies, we are taking measures to prevent the deliveries of oil belonging to Venezuelans to Cuba ,"" Guaido said on Twitter without naming the allies.
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the US move, noting that Caracas would respond to these sanctions in an appropriate legal way.
Venezuela has long been suffering from an acute economic crisis exacerbated by the US sanctions against the country.
In January , US-backed Guaido illegally declared himself interim president of Venezuela after disputing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's reelection in May . Washington immediately endorsed Guaido and called on Maduro to step down.
Maduro has accused the United States of trying to orchestrate a coup in order to install Guaido as a US puppet. Russia , China , Cuba , Bolivia , Turkey and a number of other countries have voiced their support for Maduro as the only legitimate president of Venezuela ."
Huddersfield Town 1-4 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy scores twice as Leicester climb to eighth,trendgossipnow.com,Trend Gossip Now,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trendgossipnow.com/huddersfield-town-1-4-leicester-city-jamie-vardy-scores-twice-as-leicester-climb-to-eighth/,"Huddersfield Town 1-4 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy scores twice as Leicester climb to eighth By 0 Jamie Vardy has now scored 15 Premier League goals this season. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers described Jamie Vardy as “one of the best around” as the striker’s double helped the Foxes to a fourth consecutive Premier League win at the expense of relegated Huddersfield.
Youri Tielemans, on loan from Monaco, broke the deadlock for the Foxes with a clever finish from the edge of the area after Huddersfield failed to clear from a corner.
Vardy doubled the visitors’ advantage with his 14th league goal of the season two minutes after half-time, as Ricardo Pereira delivered a perfect low cross to the back post.
Huddersfield responded quickly with their first penalty of the season, Aaron Mooy converting from the spot after 52 minutes following Caglar Soyuncu’s foul on Karlan Grant.
But James Maddison added a third for the Foxes with an excellent free-kick before Vardy scored his second from the penalty spot with 84 minutes played.
On Vardy, Rodgers said: “We play a very aggressive game, an attacking game that suits offensive players and obviously he’s one of the best around.
“It’s great to have someone right up there who does not just score the goals but who sets up our press. He works very hard and he’s a joy to work with.”
The result sees Leicester climb from ninth to seventh, level on points with Wolves having played a game more. Leicester’s progress under Rodgers continues Leicester players have a lot of potential – Rodgers
This was former Celtic manager Rodgers’ fifth game in charge of Leicester, yet it is already evident that his players have developed an understanding of the style of football he hopes to implement while at the club.
The 46-year-old described his side as “outstanding” in their victory over Bournemouth last time out, and despite a slow start to the match, the Foxes once more put in an impressive attacking display.
Tielemans, 21, who has impressed consistently since his January arrival, brought his side to life with a composed opening goal 24 minutes in and Leicester were relentless for the remainder of the match.
Terriers goalkeeper Ben Hamer was kept busy as Leicester surged for a second before the interval, denying Demarai Gray as Ben Chilwell also went close.
In a week when the late Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha would have celebrated his 61st birthday, Rodgers side again hinted at their promise for next season with sweeping counter-attacks as Vardy and Maddison made sure of the points.
With Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans absent, only 22-year-old Soyuncu’s error for Huddersfield’s penalty dampened Leicester’s afternoon, while Kasper Schmeichel had to produce a sublime save when called upon to deny Steve Mounie’s curling strike.
It’s another positive step for Leicester, who maintain their hopes of possible Europa League qualification.
“The idea is to finish as high as we can. You want to be in Europe if you can. We’ll see if we can find a different way to get in there,” said Rodgers.
“If it’s this season great. If not, throughout my contract here that was the aim. So far the boys have been absolutely first class.” Relegated Terriers put up fight in front of home crowd Siewert takes positives from heavy defeat
After their “inevitable” relegation was confirmed with defeat at Crystal Palace last weekend, the remaining fixtures of Huddersfield’s two-year stay in the Premier League must focus solely on building positivity ahead of next season.
Since Jan Siewart’s arrival in January, the Terriers have now lost nine of their ten league games, while there were reports this week that the former Borussia Dortmund coach’s job was already under threat after falling out with senior players.
The Terriers, backed by a lively home crowd, made a confident start against Leicester and looked comfortable in possession up until the visitors’ opener.
They had goalkeeper Hamer to thank on several occasions as they trailed by just the single goal at half-time.
However, they remained short of ideas in attack until the introduction of substitutes Isaac Mbenza and Mounie.
Mbenza almost had an instant impact, creating space down the right before sending an inviting ball into the path of Grant, while Mounie’s effort was only kept out by an alert Schmeichel.
Understandably, following the disappointment of relegation, the heads of the Huddersfield players dropped as a clinical Leicester disappeared from view.
Terriers chairman Dean Hoyle believes his club is “in its best position in modern memory” as they prepare for life in the Championship; yet while financial figures released last week showed a club-record profit, both he and Siewart will hope for some improvement on the pitch in their final five top-flight games.
“We have to give credit to Leicester, we couldn’t beat their quality today, they were much more clinical than we are and we needed too many opportunities,” said Siewart.
“The supporters know the time in the Premier League is time we can take much learning out of. It’s about being clinical – this is the crucial thing about being in the Premier League.” Man of the match – Jamie Vardy (Leicester) A man in form. Leicester striker Jamie Vardy epitomised his side’s clinical performance, scoring twice to make it eight goals in his last eight games. Huddersfield finally get a penalty – the stats Leicester have now matched their points tally of 47 from the entire 2017-18 season in their 33 league matches this season. The Foxes have won 10 of their last 11 league games against Huddersfield Town, drawing the other game in September 2017. Jamie Vardy has scored in each of his last four league games against Huddersfield, registering five goals, including four in three in the Premier League. James Maddison has scored three direct free-kick goals in the Premier League this season, the most by a player in a single campaign since the three scored by Philippe Coutinho in 2016-17. Youri Tielemans has either scored or assisted a goal in five of his last six Premier League games for Leicester, scoring in two and assisting in three. Huddersfield Town have lost 19 of their last 21 games in all competitions since the beginning of December 2018, winning one and drawing one. That’s more defeats than any other side in the top four tiers of English football during that period. This was Huddersfield’s 25th Premier League defeat of the season; only in 1987-88 in the second tier have they lost more games in a league campaign, losing 28. The Terriers’ penalty was their first in the Premier League this season and the first in the league since February 2018, making them the 20th and final club to win a spot-kick in the competition this season. What’s next?
Leicester host Newcastle on Friday, 12 April, (20:00 BST), while Huddersfield travel to face Tottenham next Saturday (12:30 BST). "

Christchurch, New Zealand, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The Canterbury Crusaders swamped the ACT Brumbies with a five-try second-half revival while an Israel Folau Super Rugby try-scoring record was not enough to stop a Blues victory over the NSW Waratahs on Saturday.
The table-topping Crusaders, returning to their home base for the first time since the Christchurch mosque massacres, came from 0-7 down at half-time to beat the Brumbies 36-14 in Christchurch .
Folau scored for the Waratahs midway through the first half against the Blues for his 60th try , eclipsing the previous record of 59 by New Zealander Doug Howlett who retired 12 years ago.
But it was the resurgent Blues who celebrated at the final whistle with a 32-29 victory to complete four consecutive wins for the first time since 2011.
The gunning down of 50 Muslims by an alleged white supremacist has forced the Crusaders to rethink its branding given the link to the medieval Crusades, and the familiar sword-wielding knights on horseback have been dropped from the pre-match entertainment.
But they retained their familiar ability to find an extra gear when under pressure to retain their position at the head of the table.
The penalties that blighted their first half -- when they conceded eight -- disappeared and they found the precision that was missing from their early play.
Captain Matt Todd said the first-half discipline ""was not good enough. They put us under a lot of pressure but we responded which was good.
""We were confident if we held the ball we could get points in the second half. "" The Brumbies, missing injured Wallaby flanker David Pocock and resting three other Wallabies had a game plan to rattle the Crusaders.
It worked for 40 minutes and they scored the only points in the first half with a converted try by Christian Lealiifano after Owen Franks, who led the Crusaders on to the field to mark his 150th game with the club, was yellow-carded for a dangerous tackle.
But the second 40 minutes was a different story, starting with the first of Sevu Reece's two tries three minutes after the restart.
Right wing Will Jordan also bagged a double with Jordan Taufua crossing the line as well before Tevita Kuridrani scored a late consolation try for the visitors.
The Blues had raced to a 17-0 lead with tries to Tom Robinson and Caleb Clarke and an Otere Black penalty when Folau swing the momentum the Waratahs' way with his try .
Will Miller scored just on half-time to close the gap to 17-14.
In the second half both sides cancelled each other out with TJ Faiane and Ma'a Nonu scoring for the Blues and Black adding a penalty while Alex Newsome and Jake Gordon scored for the Waratahs with a penalty from Bernard Foley.
Blues captain Patrick Tuipulotu said while four wins in a row was satisfying, letting a 17-point lead slip showed there is a lot of room for improvement.
""I'm proud of the way we came back in the last 10 (minutes) to hold them out. There's still plenty to work on if we want to get better,"" he said."

Bangkok (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) The leader of a new political party that did well in Thailand 's election last month has appeared at a police station to face charges of sedition.Scores of supporters greeted Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of Future Forward, at the Bangkok offices.Thanathorn says an allegation, from 2015 , that he aided a protest leader is politically motivated.The ruling military and an opposition coalition are both vying to form the next government following the polls.At 40, he is the young and charismatic head of the Future Forward Party, which has appealed strongly to young voters and opposes the military government , which has been in charge of Thailand since 2014.Future Forward did well in March 's election , finishing a strong third, gathering 6.2 million votes.It has since joined a ""democratic alliance "" to try to prevent the 2014 coup leader and current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha from staying in power.They date back to 2015 and allege Thanathorn gave assistance to the leader of anti-coup protesters, who violated laws on crowd gatherings.Thanathorn is accused of breaking three articles of the Thai criminal code and could face up to nine years in prison if found guilty.He could also be disqualified from parliament .The charges have been filed by an officer in the ruling government .Commenting on the delay in bringing the charges, police said there had been several reshuffles of personnel. Thanathorn is also facing a cybercrime charge for allegedly spreading false information.Earlier in the week he said the charges were politically motivated, adding: ""The dark influence will not leave Future Forward Party alone.""As he left the police station on Saturday, he asked: ""Why does this come a week after the election?""We believe in our innocence This isn't about me.
This is about everyone who fights for justice.""Scores of supporters, many wearing the party's orange colour, shouted slogans backing Thanathorn.They held up posters with the trending #SaveThanathorn hashtag and slogans such as ""end the age of the dinosaur"".The election results are not scheduled to be ratified until 9 May .Preliminary results suggest the party backing Gen Prayuth won the most popular votes, ahead of the Pheu Thai party, which is allied with exiled former PM Thaksin Shinawatra.But a complicated system of allocating seats in parliaments based on vote share , introduced by the military, means it remains unclear how many seats each party will ultimately have, hence the uncertainty on the next government .The Election Commission has been indicating that fewer seats than expected will be given to Future Forward and Thanathorn's supporters view the latest criminal charge against him as part of a wider campaign to keep his party out of power.

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) New research shows that people who follow a keto diet to lose weight or treat diabetes should avoid sudden spikes in blood sugar levels.Diets require discipline, and it is not always easy for people to follow them without indulging in a ""cheat day."" One day may not make a big difference in the long-term, but a recent study from the University of British Columbia in Okanagan, Canada (UBCO), found that when it comes to the keto diet, a single dose of carbohydrates may have dangerous side effects.The keto diet aims to provide the body with more calories from protein and fat and less from carbohydrates.
Ratios depend on the individual's body mass and activity level, but they usually stay in the following ranges: 60-75 percent of calories from fat , 15-30 percent of calories from protein, and 5-10 percent of calories from carbohydrates.When the body receives less than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day, it will run out of its preferred fuel source glucose and this will happen 3 to 4 days after the beginning of the diet.
At this point, the body will start to break down protein and fat to get energy. This metabolic process is calledketosis.People often use the keto diet to lose weight , but this method can also help to manage certain health conditions, including diabetes.
Studiesshowed that the keto diet might help to control hunger and reduce body weight , and it may lower blood sugar levels in those with diabetes.""The ketogenic or keto diet has become very common for weight loss or to manage diseases such as type 2 diabetes,"" says Jonathan Little, senior author of the recent study and associate professor in the school of Health and Exercise Sciences at UBCO.Little explains that during ketosis, the body's chemistry changes.
The process in which the body starts to aggressively burn its fat stores to get energy may lead to significant weight loss and improvement in symptoms of diseases, for example, type 2 diabetes.It is common for people to indulge in ""cheat days,"" and so researchers at UCBO wanted to know what happens when people reintroduce a dose of glucose to the body.
The study was looking for inflammatory responses or reduced tolerance to blood glucose.""Since impaired glucose tolerance and spikes in blood sugar levels are known to be associated with an increased risk in cardiovascular disease, it made sense to look at what was happening in the blood vessels after a sugar hit,"" says Cody Durrer, study first author and doctoral student at UBCO.Nine healthy young males participated in this study, which appears in the journal Nutrients.
The researchers asked them to follow a 7-day high fat , low-carbohydrate diet that was similar to the keto diet, consisting of 70 percent fat , 10 percent carbohydrates, and 20 percent protein. They also had to consume a 75-gram glucose drink before and after the diet.The inflammatory and blood glucose concerns were not what the researchers discovered, however.""What we found instead were biomarkers in the blood , suggesting that vessel walls were being damaged by the sudden spike in glucose,"" Durrer continues.The results were alarming because even though the participants were all young males, the condition of their blood vessels after consuming the glucose drink was more similar to that of people with poor cardiovascular health.Little explains that the damage to blood vessels is due to the body's own metabolic response to spikes in blood sugar levels, which may lead to the death of blood vessel cells.Researchers cautioned that the study only included nine people, and more work is needed to verify the results.
However, it still points to worrying issues, the senior author suggests.""My concern is that many of the people going on a keto diet whether it's to lose weight , to treat type 2 diabetes, or some other health reason may be undoing some of the positive impacts on their blood vessels if they suddenly blast them with glucose,"" Little concludes.These findings should give those on a keto diet pause when considering a ""cheat day.""The data suggest that the keto diet is not something that people should do for 6 days a week and take a day off.
This consideration is especially important for people who are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease."

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) A major study has found that unhealthful eating is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other risk factor, including smoking.The Global Burden of Disease Study looked at dietary consumption between 1990 and 2017 in 195 countries, focusing on 15 types of food or nutrients.In a paper that features in The Lancet, the study investigators conclude that, due to its contribution to noncommunicable diseases, poor diet accounted for 1 in 5, or 11 million , adult deaths in 2017 .The vast majority of those deaths, around 10 million , were from cardiovascular disease.
The rest were mainly from cancer and type 2 diabetes.Ranking the countries from lowest to highest rates of diet-related deaths puts Israel first, with 89 deaths per 100,000 people, and Uzbekistan last, with 892 per 100,000.The United States , with 171 deaths per 100,000, comes in at 43rd place and the United Kingdom at 23rd, with 127 deaths per 100,000.
India is in 118th place, and China is in 140th.""This study,"" says study author Dr. Christopher J. L. Murray, who is director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle , ""affirms what many have thought for several years that poor diet is responsible for more deaths than any other risk factor in the world .""In their analysis of global diets, the researchers looked at 15 items: fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, legumes, whole grains, fiber, calcium, milk,omega-3 fatty acids from seafood, polyunsaturated fats, trans fats, red meat, processed meat, sugary drinks, and sodium.They found that the global diet in 2017 contained less than the ideal amounts of nearly all healthful food items.
The biggest deficiency was in nuts and seeds, milk, and whole grains.Consumption of nuts and seeds, for instance, was on average only 3 grams (g) per day, or around 12 percent of the optimal intake.Consumption of milk was only 16 percent of optimal intake and whole grains was only 23 percent.Alongside these, daily intakes of unhealthful dietary items ""exceeded the optimal level globally."" Sugary drink consumption, for example, ""was far higher than the optimal intake,"" followed by the consumption of processed meat and sodium.
Red meat consumption was just above the optimal level.An important finding of the study was that insufficient intake of healthful foods could be just as, if not more, damaging than eating too many unhealthful foods.The authors note that the diets that related to the most deaths were ""high in sodium, low in whole grains, low in fruit, low in nuts and seeds, low in vegetables, and low in omega-3 fatty acids.""They found that each of these dietary factors accounted ""for more than 2 percent of global deaths.""In addition, just three of these whole grains, fruits, and sodium accounted for more than half of the diet-related deaths and two-thirds of the years lost to diet-related ill health and disability.Dr.
Murray says that these results contrast with the fact that, over the last 20 years, policy discussions have tended to focus more on restricting unhealthful foods.He and his colleagues suggest that campaigns should concentrate on rebalancing diets.
They also urge that any changes to food production and distribution aimed to achieve this must consider the environmental impact on the climate, land, water , and soil.In a linked editorial, Prof.
Nita G. Forouhi and Prof. Nigel Unwin, both of the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., agree with the authors in that ""in a global context,"" and despite its limitations, the study offers ""evidence to shift the focus"" from restricting unhealthful food items to increasing healthful ones.They suggest that it confirms a need to emphasize foods rather than nutrients.
However, they also highlight some of the challenges of shifting the global diet toward a more healthful one, such as the ""prohibitive"" costs of fruits and vegetables.For example, in low-income countries, ""Two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day per individual accounted for 52 percent of household income,"" compared with just 2 percent in high-income nations.While sodium, sugar, and fat have been the focus of policy debates over the past two decades, our assessment suggests the leading dietary risk factors are high intake of sodium or low intake of healthy foods, such as whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds, and vegetables.""

Can scientists 'hack' memory?,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/health/can-scientists-hack-memory-587388.html,"Can Scientists 'hack' Memory? Mohammad Ali (@ChaudhryMAli88) 10 hours 12:10 PM Modern science brings us endless possibilities to help our bodies and our minds stay healthy, but some recent scientific pursuits have also been the center of controversy
Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) Modern science brings us endless possibilities to help our bodies and our minds stay healthy, but some recent scientific pursuits have also been the center of controversy.
One of these is researchers' interest in manipulating memories. Is this feat possible, and if so, why would we want to achieve it?Our memories make up so much of who we are, and the things we remember can often define our experience of the world .And while positive memories can help us grow and thrive, negative memories do not always have such welcome effects.Sometimes, unpleasant memories can be part of a learning curve getting scalded with boiling water means that next time we will be more careful when handling the kettle.However, there are also memories that are truly traumatic, and recalling them can lead to distress and serious mental health conditions, such aspost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).The study of memory formation, recall, and forgetting attracts a lot of attention and curiosity among neuroscientists, psychologists, and even researchers from the humanities, as there is still so much we do not fully understand about the processes surrounding memory.And, while we still need to find out more about how memories form in the brain, researchers in recent years have started investigating the possibility of manipulating memories particularly negative ones to see if they can weaken or remove them altogether.In this Spotlight feature, we look briefly at why we remember and why we naturally forget.
We also explore some studies that have delved into memory manipulation, explaining how researchers aim to achieve it, and why.When the brain encodes information, those data become stored in groups of neurons that synapses or links that allow brain cells to ""communicate"" connect together.Scientists typically associate stronger synapses with a better memory, and the brain constantly ""updates"" synaptic connections, forming new ones or strengthening old ones, as new memories build or we update older ones.However, synapses can also become weaker if they are not activated often enough, and the brain often loses some of these connections altogether.
Thus, forgetting can occur naturally and, indeed, researchers argue that forgetting is a crucial part of learning and creating new memories.Medical news Today spoke to Sam Berens, Ph.D., who is currently a research assistant at the University of York in the United Kingdom , and he explained to us that natural forgetting can be due to a few different reasons.""Forgetting occurs because it would not be energy efficient to indefinitely maintain all the memories that we form each day,"" he explained, adding that it ""also seems to be a natural consequence of neurogenesis the process that creates new brain cells in support of future learning.""""Because of this, clearing old and unused memories may be directly related to our ability to learn new things,"" he told MNT .But scientists continue to explore the many complications that riddle memory recall and formation.
For instance, not all our memories are correct, and sometimes our brains ""implement"" forgetting as a defense mechanism.Past research has shown that social interactions can influence a person's memory of an event , as can what other people remember or claim to remember about the same event .According to a report in the journalScience, ""conformity may present in two forms, which initially convey similar, explicit behavior but are fundamentally different."" These are:* Private conformity, in which ""an individual's recollection may genuinely be altered by social influence, resulting in long-lasting, persistent memory errors.""* Public conformity, in which ""individuals may choose to outwardly comply, providing an account that fits that of others, but inwardly maintain certitude in their own original memory.""However, while public conformity does not actually affect an individual's own memory perception, engaging in this process could lead to that person influencing others' memory of the event .At the same time, the reports' authors note, ""memory conformity may also serve an adaptive purpose because social learning is often more efficient and accurate than individual learning,"" which is not always reliable.For instance, as studies have shown, the process of memory retrieval can mean that the original memory is rewritten with the memory of that memory so that the original memory becomes warped.A study appearing in the Journal of Neuroscience calls this ""retrieval-induced distortion,"" and explains that the distortion could occur either because the retrieval process modified the memory, ""or because it led to the formation of new [...] associations"" that ""got stuck,"" so to speak, to the original memory.""A memory is not simply an image produced by time traveling back to the original event it can be an image that is somewhat distorted because of the prior times you remembered it,"" says Donna Bridge, one of the study authors.Memories aren't static.
If you remember something in the context of a new environment and time, or if you are even in a different mood, your memories might integrate the new information.""On top of the issues surrounding how we remember the things that we remember, there is also the problem of why we forget, and some researchers note that forgetting sometimes occurs as an adaptive mechanism. One way in which forgetting can be adaptive, Berens told MNT , is that, by letting go of irrelevant details, our brains are then better able to recall important information.""[M]y own work suggests that forgetting specific details of an event allows us to focus on the bigger picture and pull out general patterns that can predict the future,"" he explainedFor instance, remembering exactly which trees in the forest bear the most delicious fruit is only useful until you have eaten all of that fruit.
Instead of remembering the specifics trees, it may be best to remember the general area of a forest that has the best trees.""""This sometimes involves forgetting specific details [...] and blurring together many experiences in order to pull out a general pattern,"" Berens continued.The researcher also noted that another way in which forgetting can be a helpful process is by placing negative memories out of reach so that they are less distressing to the person they affect.""Memories for emotional or traumatic events lose their emotional tone over time,"" said Berens, and ""this can help us reappraise and learn from past experience without the need to reexperience all the associated emotions at the same time.""But what happens when traumatic memories persist and resurface unbidden? Experts call this the ""intrusive reexperiencing of trauma,"" and it is a core feature of PTSD.Individuals who experience PTSD may spontaneously recall a traumatic memory, or feel as if they are going back into the context that produced the trauma.This effect can cause the person severe distress and lead to erratic behaviors as a coping strategy.For this reason, some scientists have wondered what approach they could take to weaken or manipulate negative memories and lessen their effect.
And, we already know that it is possible to interfere with a memory and stop it from solidifying.""[M]emories can be actively weakened after formation,"" Berens told us, explaining that this is ""a process distinct from forgetting.""""Firstly, there seems to be a time window after memory formation where memories are particularly weak and sensitive to interference where conflicting information can overwrite the contents of a memory.
[...] Memories can also be weakened by the simple act of retrieval... Yes, simply recalling a memory makes it more susceptible to being weakened, distorted or erased.""Berens further explained that the drug Propranolol, which doctors can prescribe for PTSD, already goes some way towards weakening distressing memories to dampen their effect.""This is how Propranolol is being used to help patients with PTSD,"" he explained, adding that ""[f]irst the patient recalls the trauma, which weakens the memory, then the Propranolol is given, which stops the emotions from being re-encoded as a new memory.""Nevertheless, researchers are still on the lookout for other ways of interfering with memory formation and recall.
Such studies could help not only find novel treatments for PTSD and other phenomena such asphobias, but they might also reveal new information about how memory-related brain mechanisms work.To try and understand whether or not we can artificially manipulate memories, a team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge first tried to instil false memories in mice.This initial study, which appeared in Science in 2013, used an optogenetic technique to manipulate the formation of a ""hybrid"" memory in the mice's brain.
This method requires the use of light beams to activate neurons that researchers have engineered to respond to this stimulus.In the study, the team led by Prof. Susumu Tonegawa used optogenetic methods to synchronize two groups of neurons one in the hippocampus, which activated a spatial memory, and one in the amygdala, which activated a fear memory.The experiment was successful the mice started associating fear with a space where they had never actually had a bad experience.In a further study by the same team which they published in Nature in 2014 Tonegawa and colleagues managed to use the same technique to ""switch off"" negative associations in the brains of mice.But are such studies in animals truly indicative of what would happen in the human brain under similar circumstances?Berens told us that, while there are indeed some discrepancies between human brains and the brains of nonhuman mammals that researchers usually work with, the similarities are strong enough to give us a good idea of how human brains would work in the same context.""We really are very similar to non-human mammals like mice and rats in many important ways,"" Berens explained for MNT .
""The same memory formation and consolidation process that help us learn to read and write also operate in rats and mice with only very minor differences,"" he said.""Memories warm you up from the inside.
But they also tear you apart,"" writes author Haruki Murakami in the novel Kafka on the Shore, and we still have a way to go in learning how best to use our memories for growth, and to stop them from becoming an obstacle. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Speech for New Zealand Sign Language Act Celebration,beehive.govt.nz,beehive.govt.nz,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://beehive.govt.nz/release/speech-new-zealand-sign-language-act-celebration,"Disability Issues
Thank you Kim and the team at Deaf Action for this opportunity to celebrate the New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006 with the Deaf community.
Tonight is a celebration of and by the Deaf community. It feels really special for me to also be able to be a part of this.
The passing of the New Zealand Sign Language Act on April 6, 2006 was widely celebrated in New Zealand and internationally for its official recognition of our signed language and the right to use it.
I want to acknowledge the people in the Deaf community whose advocacy and tenacity contributed to seeing NZSL recognised in legislation as one of Aotearoa’s two official languages.
I also want to acknowledge again Kim Robinson for his ongoing commitment to a better New Zealand for the deaf community and Rhian Yates, a member of the New Zealand Sign Language Board. And to Cruze Kapa for MC-ing this event, as well as Milton Reddy/ Eric Matthew for the opening karakia.
This is an important opportunity to recognise the importance of sign language for the lives and wellbeing of the deaf community.
Language is integral to developing our culture and identity, and it is also a tool that ensures we can communicate with each other, and everyone can access all a society has to offer.
I am pleased that New Zealand Sign Language is an official language here. Government has responsibility for promoting and protecting our official languages. Both New Zealand Sign Language and te reo Māori are vital to our expression of culture and identity in Aotearoa.
We are recognised as a world leader for our commitment to maintaining and furthering the use of our sign language. Through New Zealand Sign Language we can promote equal opportunities for Deaf people and work toward a more inclusive Aotearoa.
This Government is committed to the promotion and maintenance of NZSL. You will have seen recently efforts to ensure there is more New Zealand Sign Language in the public media, in particular during events of national significance. We have also made post-cabinet briefings more accessible by having sign language interpreters present. It is exciting that more people are seeing sign language and more people are interested in learning about it.
These changes are an important part of this Governments commitment to a more inclusive and accessible New Zealand. At the end of last year Cabinet agreed to a policy work programme to accelerate accessibility and consider how legislation may contribute to that. This will be a collaborative work programme including a range of disabled people, older people, organisations, businesses and officials.
From my experience meeting and working with the Deaf Community- it is a passionate and diverse group of people. There are many people and organisations playing a unique part in maintaining and promoting New Zealand Sign Language. I am glad to be here to help celebrate your achievements.
This is a critical time to work together to strengthen NZSL as a core part of Deaf culture and as an official language available for all New Zealanders.
Education is an area that I am keen to see is continuing their work on lifting access to New Zealand Sign Language.
Government provided more funding in Budget 2018 to lift sign language support for those using it when very young and in school, particularly for those whose first language is New Zealand Sign Language.
This is helping our children and rangitahi, and their whānau and educators, to learn New Zealand Sign Language and to use it for their communication and learning.
I am excited to hear about the success of First Signs and NZSL@School, and am looking forward to seeing how our service model for deaf education can continue to improve.
Another area that I am pleased to see progressing is the review of the Telecommunications Relay Services. I hope that you have all taken the chance to have your say about the proposed changes for the Relay services, in particular the Video Interpreting Service. It is important that the future service is user-friendly, reliable and up to date.
The NZSL Board is also continuing to work hard to promote sign language across New Zealand with the distribution of five million dollars through the NZSL Fund over the past four years. This has supported local community events, the development of resources such as LearnNZSL, and key strategic work needed for the long term health of NZSL, such as the Online NZSL Dictionary.
Announcements about Round five of the NZSL fund will be made soon, giving us another opportunity to celebrate.
The New Zealand Sign Language Board has an important role in maintaining and promoting NZSL. The Board has been well served by the current members and past members. However the time has come to appoint new members to the Board and I expect in mid- April there will be a call for new members. The Office for Disability Issues will have information on their website about the process. Applications will be welcomed from people who are fluent in NZSL, with good judgement, and who are committed to the maintenance and promotion of NZSL.
I look forward to another opportunity to celebrate sign language during New Zealand Sign Language Week. The week of celebrations keeps getting better each year and continues to support a growing awareness and acceptance of NZSL, making it more visible to everyone in New Zealand.
A lot has changed for New Zealand Sign Language over the past 20 years thanks to the passion, skills, knowledge and expertise of this community. The Government is keen to work alongside the Deaf community so that we can achieve more for the current and next generation of NZSL users."
Rural health training hubs praised,beehive.govt.nz,beehive.govt.nz,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://beehive.govt.nz/release/rural-health-training-hubs-praised,"Rural Communities
Minister for Rural Communities Damien O’Connor has welcomed the Minister of Health’s commitment to develop rural health training hubs.
“Minister Clark’s announcement yesterday shows the Government is listening to rural New Zealand and follows on from the rural proofing policy we introduced last year.
“Those living in rural communities can enjoy excellent lifestyles but they face unique challenges that must be reflected in Government policy.
“This past year alone has seen drought, floods and biosecurity incursions, which cause stress across in rural communities. The Rural Proofing Policy ensures that when policy-makers sit down to design the rules they take into account the unique factors that affect rural communities such as low populations, isolation, and reliance on the primary sector for employment.
“Rural Kiwis should have equitable access to social and economic opportunities, to reach their full potential.
“Developing rural health training hubs in which a range of medical professionals are trained inside rural communities is a great way to build communities up and encourage connections.
‘We’ve all heard stories about rural communities finding it hard to attract GPs and other health professionals. This is a real concern. It means rural Kiwi’s aren’t getting the same access to healthcare as urban Kiwi’s - and that has to be fixed.
“If students are training in rural communities and becoming a part of that community, many will stay at the end of their studies.
“I know there’s still a lot of detail to work through but I’m very excited to see progress towards the first hub and I look forward to watching this initiative flourish.’’"

Migrant Crime Barack Obama Warns Progressives Not to Form ‘Circular Firing Squad’ Sean Gallup/Getty Images WARNER TODD HUSTON 6 Apr 2019 On the heels of a week’s worth of attacks on handsy Joe Biden for his years of untoward treatment of women, former President Barack Obama is warning progressives not to form a “circular firing squad” to take out their own candidates. Speaking in Germany at a town hall event on Saturday for his Obama Foundation, the former president said he feared that the extreme left of the Democrat Party has become too rigid.
“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Uh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be,’” Obama said , according to the Hill. “And then we start sometimes creating what’s called a ‘circular firing squad,’ where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues. And when that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens.”
“So I think whether you are speaking as a citizen or as a political leader or as an organizer,” Obama continued, “you have to recognize that the way we structure democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you, and that by definition means you’re not going to get 100 percent of what you want.”
The former president was speaking to a group of young people about leadership. He added that leaders should not go too far either way. “You can’t set up a system in which you don’t compromise on anything, but you also can’t operate in a system where you compromise on everything,” he said.
The former president’s comments come on the heels of growing outrage against his former vice president, whose decades of handsy and creepy treatment of women has finally come under fire among Democrats.
Joe Biden recently gave a half-hearted non-apology for invading women’s space, and touching, hugging, and kissing them repeatedly without their permission. Biden has been making women uncomfortable for decades, but only now in this #MeToo era, as he gears up for a possible run for the Democrat nomination in 2020, has his behavior come into question.
Many have wondered why Barack Obama has not jumped to the defense of the man who was his vice president for eight years. Indeed, by some reports, Biden has been annoyed over Barack Obama’s fawning over presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke.

"Assange to be Handed over to the UK, then to the US?",www.therussophile.org,Stephen Lendman,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/assange-to-be-handed-over-to-the-uk-then-to-the-us.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
According to WikiLeaks on Thursday, Julian Assange ’s freedom is gravely threatened, tweeting:
“BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within ‘hours to days’ using the #INAPapers offshore (corruption and money laundering) scandal (involving President Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno) as a pretext — and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.”
Reports surfaced months ago, suggesting Moreno might collude with the US and UK on Assange – ignoring his citizenship rights, along with revoking his asylum granted him in Ecuador’s London embassy by President Rafael Correa in August 2012.
On Tuesday, Moreno falsely accused Assange of “repeatedly violat(ing) the conditions of his asylum,” suggesting he’ll revoke his asylum, hand him over to UK authorities, followed by extradition to the US.
Moreno lied claiming Assange “hack(ed) private accounts (and) phones.” The phony accusation relates to a WikiLeaks tweet about what’s referred to in Ecuador as the INA Papers.
In March, information from Moreno’s cell phone and gmail account sent to an opposition lawmaker was published online, the material called the INA Papers, allegedly implicating Moreno, his brother, and close associates in an offshore corruption scandal, involving perjury and money laundering.
Denying wrongdoing, Moreno turned truth on its head, saying
“(i)n WikiLeaks we have seen evidence of spying, intervention in private conversations on phones, including photos of my bedroom, of what I eat, of how my wife and daughters and friends dance.”
He accused Correa of spying on him by planting a hidden camera in the wall of his presidential office. Correa called the charge absurd.
WikiLeaks didn’t publish the INA Papers. Pressured by Washington and Britain, Moreno has been seeking an easy way to justify revocation of Assange’s asylum. He provided no evidence supporting his charges because none exists.
Assange is a political refugee – granted Ecuadorian citizenship and given asylum in the country’s London embassy by former President Correa.
Under international law, refugees and asylum seekers are protected.
Article I of the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees calls them:
“(P)ersons who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, (are) outside the country of their nationality, and (are) unable to or, owing to such fear, (are) unwilling to avail (themselves) of the protection of that country.”
Post-WW II, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was established to help them. To gain legal protection, they must: be outside their country of origin; fear persecution; be harmed or fear harm by their government or others; fear persecution for at least one of the above cited reasons; and pose no danger to others.
Assange clearly qualifies on all of the above, entitled to political asylum by Ecuador as a citizen of the country.
Expulsion from its London embassy would be a flagrant violation of international law, unjustifiably justified by baseless charges.
Assange is an investigative journalist/whistleblower, publishing material supplied by sources believed to be credible, unidentified for their protection.
WikiLeaks is not an intelligence operation. Nor it it connected to Russia or any other country. Claims otherwise are fabricated.
Assange earlier explained that WikiLeaks has the right “to publish newsworthy content. Consistent with the US Constitution, we publish material that we can confirm to be true…”
US regimes are at war on individuals who reveal dirty secrets about the imperial state – notably its high crimes of war, against humanity, and other serious wrongdoing.
It’s information everyone has a right to know, providing it a vital public service, heroism above and beyond the call of duty, warranting high praise – nearly always with no monetary compensation. Doing the right thing is its own reward.
The Obama regime prosecuted more whistleblowers doing their job honorably than all his predecessors combined.
Trump hardliners consider leaking vital information everyone has a right to know a threat to national security which it’s not.
Since the 1970s, Congress repeatedly affirmed the right of civil servants to report what they believe are abuses of power, government corruption, rule of law violations, dangers to public health and safety, as well as other wrongdoing.
Journalism the way it should be is protected by the First Amendment. It’s the most important freedom. Without it all others are threatened.
Truth-telling in America today is greatly endangered. When ruling regimes consider independent journalists and whistleblowers doing their jobs honorably threats to national security, totalitarian rule replaces freedom.
In 2012, the Obama regime turned truth on its head, falsely declaring Assange an enemy of the state, forcing him to take refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid unjust arrest, extradition to America, prosecution, and imprisonment to silence him – for doing the right thing, for the crime of vital truth-telling.
At the time, a secret grand jury issued a sealed indictment, reportedly accusing him of spying under the long ago outdated 1917 Espionage Act, enacted shortly after America’s entry into WW I.
It should have been declared null and void decades ago. During WW I, it prohibited anyone from interfering with US military operations, supporting the nation’s enemies, promoting insubordination in the ranks, or obstructing military recruitment.
It remains the law of the land, used to charge, prosecute, convict and imprison Chelsea Manning unjustly, along with other unjust charges against her.
Assange faces the same fate if extradited to America. Anyone exposing US high crimes and/or other dirty secrets Washington wants suppressed is vulnerable.
Assistant US Justice Department Attorney Kellen S. Dwyer revealed the indictment, saying it “need(s) to remain sealed until Assange is arrested.”
Trump earlier called him “disgraceful,” saying the “death penalty” would be OK against him and others associated with WikiLeaks.
Earlier, Pompeo falsely called WikiLeaks a “non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.”
John Bolton once said Edward “Snowden should swing from a tall oak tree.” He called for “a cyberwar attack on WikiLeaks.”
Attorney Carlos Poveda believes a deal was struck between Ecuadorian President Moreno and the Trump and Theresa May regimes to extradite Assange to the US, saying:
“There has been a rapprochement between the United Kingdom, the United States and Ecuador,” adding:
“I believe that (the US and UK) have reached some agreement, and that is exactly why the special protocol (on home rules) was introduced, which is to justify Julian’s withdrawal (from the Ecuadorian embassy) to accelerate the process of ending his asylum and hand him over to the UK authorities”– for extradition to America.
Major unjust charges await him, Poveda saying “(i)t will not be a death penalty, but he may get a life sentence”– maybe without the possibility of parole.
Horrific US mistreatment of Chelsea Manning , other whistleblowers, and countless others falsely charged in the US show the imperial state wants everyone in its crosshairs denied their fundamental rights if dare reveal government wrongdoing.
Constitutionally guaranteed due process and equal protection under law no longer apply in the US. Police state injustice replaced them.
Chelsea Manning languishes in solitary confinement detention since rearrested on March 8 for invoking her constitutional rights, refusing to give grand jury testimony, believing she was wrongfully subpoenaed for three reasons.
Trump regime hardliners opposed the commutation of her sentence by Obama, wanting her imprisoned again for revealing US high crimes of war.
They’re aiming for her to unwittingly self-incriminate herself during grand jury testimony, along with providing information to be used against Assange.
If expelled from Ecuador’s London embassy, he awaits a harsh fate similar to years of torture abuse Manning continues to face.
Note: Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry denied the reports about Assange’s imminent expulsion from its London embassy.
His supporters pitched tents outside the embassy, backing his right of asylum. “NO EXPULSION” is spelled out in LED lights on the sidewalk in front of the embassy, cameras positioned near its entrance.

VIPS warn that Trump’s policies regarding Venezuela appear to be on a slippery slope that could take us toward war in Venezuela and military confrontation with Russia.
***
FROM: Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS)
SUBJECT: Avoiding War with Russia over Venezuela
Mr. President:
Your Administration’s policies regarding Venezuela appear to be on a slippery slope that could take us toward war in Venezuela and military confrontation with Russia. As former intelligence officers and other national security practitioners with many decades of experience, we urge you not to let yourself be egged on into taking potentially catastrophic military action in response to civil unrest in Venezuela or Russian activities in the Western Hemisphere. With the recent arrival of two transport aircraft and enduring political support for the government of Venezuela, the Russians are far from crossing any “red line” emanating from the 1823 Monroe Doctrine.
Unfulfilled Objectives in Venezuela
Inside Venezuela, U.S. actions have failed to do more than plunge the country into deeper crisis, cause greater human suffering, and increase the prospects of violence on a national scale. President Maduro’s mishandling of the economy and authoritarian reactions to provocations are impossible to defend, but they result in part from the fact that he has been under siege since he was first elected in 2013 and has faced sanctions aimed ultimately at removing him from office. In our view, the advice you’ve received from your top advisors – Florida Senator Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor John Bolton, Special Representative Elliott Abrams, and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo – was and apparently continues to be wrong. Recognition of Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as “interim president” did not prompt the military to rise up against President Maduro. Neither did attacking the officer corps as merely corrupt opportunists and drug-traffickers enriched through loyalty to former President Chávez and Maduro, nor did repeatedly threatening them with harsher sanctions. Those actions reflected a fundamental misunderstanding about the Venezuelan military, which has never been free of corruption and political compromise but has also never been so totally isolated from the Venezuelan people that it hasn’t felt their suffering. U.S. policies incorrectly assumed that the officers – while probably fed up with Maduro’s shortcomings – would support Guaidó despite his faction’s commitment to dismantle Chavismo , which most officers believe brought historically necessary changes to the country, including enfranchisement of the poor.
Similarly, your Administration’s repeated hints at military intervention have been counterproductive to your regime-change objectives. Your policy and intelligence advisors were correct in interpreting the disparate polling data showing popular support for Guaidó as actually being support for the U.S. to extricate the country from its crisis – the National Assembly President was a political unknown until the United States and others recognized his claim to the Presidency – but your team showed a lack of understanding of Venezuelan nationalism. Venezuelans do not welcome the destruction that would be caused by U.S. military attack; they recall the death toll of Operation Just Cause, when the United States killed more than 3,000 Panamanians (by its own count) to remove one corrupt authoritarian, Manuel Noriega. Threats of invasion have pushed people to circle around Maduro, however reluctantly, not reject him. Your Administration’s strategy of punishing the Venezuelan people, including apparently knocking out their electricity, seems based on the false assumption that humanitarian crisis will prompt a coup to remove Maduro. In fact, the U.S. sanctions have allowed Maduro to shift blame from his own failings to U.S. malice – and it has left Guaidó, whom your advisors portray as the moral equivalent of our Founders, looking like a sell-out to Yankee imperialists at the cost of the Venezuelan people’s health and welfare and magnified civil disorder.
Lost Opportunity for Diplomacy
Senator Rubio, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Abrams, and Mr. Pompeo have also squandered a formidable moment to build on common values with allies in Latin America and Europe. Even though most Latin Americans find your aides’ public assertion that the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well to be insulting, the right-leaning Presidents of most of South and Central America rallied with you to support Guaidó’s self-proclamation. But Guaidó’s lack of leadership – he appears totally scripted by U.S. Government agencies – his inflexibility on negotiations, his open call for U.S. military intervention, and your own Administration’s dangling threat of war are rapidly alienating all but the most subservient to U.S. policy dictates. Negotiation proposals, such as those being developed by the International Contact Group, are gaining momentum.
Internationalizing the Conflict
National Security Advisor Bolton and others have sought to internationalize the Venezuela issue since before Guaidó’s proclamation. Bolton’s reference to a “Troika of Tyranny” in November – which he called “a triangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua” and “sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere”– was a veiled Cold War-era swipe at Russia and China. Mr. Bolton, Senator Rubio, and other advisors have made clear on numerous occasions that the overthrow of President Maduro would be just the first stage in efforts to eliminate the current governments of the “Troika” and “Communist influence” in the Western Hemisphere. They have repeatedly asserted that Cuban advisors have been crucial to the Maduro government’s survival without providing evidence. Indeed, the reportedly “hundreds” of Venezuelan military defectors, including many managed by U.S. agencies, have not provided even credible hearsay evidence that Cubans are doing more than providing routine assistance. In addition, the threats coming out of Washington have preempted any willingness that Cuba might have had to contribute to a regional solution to the Venezuelan crisis as it has in similar situations, such as Colombia’s recent peace process, the Angola peace process in 1989-90, and the Central American negotiations in the early 1990s.
Provocative Rhetoric about Russia
Most dangerous, however, are aggressive statements about Russia’s engagement with Venezuela. Russian oil companies, particular Rosneft, have long been in Venezuela – bailing out the Venezuelan petroleum company (PDVSA) as its mismanagement and falling oil prices have caused production and revenues to plummet. Most long-term observers believe Rosneft’s decisions, including throwing good money after bad, have been motivated by business calculations, without a particularly ideological objective. Your advisors’ rhetoric imposing an East-West spin on the issue presented President Putin and his advisors an opportunity to try to poke the United States in the eye – especially as Administration efforts to remove Maduro foundered and diplomatic support for Guaidó cracked. Maduro and Putin have not enjoyed particularly close personal relations in the past, and their shared strategic interests are few, but U.S. rhetoric and threats have given them common cause in tweaking us. A meeting in Rome between your special envoy, Elliot Abrams, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov achieved nothing amid further U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and continued threats that “all options” were on the table.
Publicly available information is insufficient for us to know exactly what was aboard the two Russian aircraft that landed at Maiquetía last week – two months after your Administration publicly proclaimed its intention to remove Maduro – but precedent suggests Moscow had two main objectives. One, and probably primary, is to embarrass your Administration by defying your rhetoric, just to rub your nose in Moscow’s sovereign right to have the relations, including military liaison, with whomever it pleases. In this sense, Russian behavior resembles its intervention, at Bashar al-Assad’s request, in Syria. And it is not a far cry from Moscow’s reaction to the Western-supported coup in Kiev. Another objective, if press speculation about the Russian advisors and equipment aboard the aircraft is correct, would be to shore up Venezuela’s ability to warn of and respond to a U.S. military strike. Your Administration has publicly asserted that the Russians are helping repair S-300 surface-to-air missile systems, which have a purely defensive purpose. There is no evidence, not even circumstantial, that Russia has any offensive objectives in this relationship.
The U.S. reaction has suggested a much greater chance of military confrontation. Mr. Bolton “strongly caution[ed] actors external to the Western Hemisphere against deploying military assets to Venezuela, or elsewhere in the Hemisphere, with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations.” Without defining what activities he would object to, Mr. Bolton said, “We will consider such provocative actions as a direct threat to international peace and security in the region.” Your Special Representative said the “Russian presence” is “extremely pernicious.” Your Secretary of State said, “Russia’s got to leave Venezuela.” You said, “Russia has to get out” and reiterated that “all options are open”– including presumably forcing the Russians out militarily. And we note that Russia has not closed its embassy in Caracas as your Administration has.
Avoiding the Slippery Slope
As intelligence officers and security experts, we have given many years to protecting our nation from a host of threats, including from the Soviet Union. We also believe, however, that picking fights. including ousting governments, blocking negotiated settlements, and threatening other countries’ sovereign decision to pursue activities that do not threaten our national security – is rarely the wise way to go.
We repeat that we are not defending Maduro and his record, while at the same time pointing out that many of his troubles have been exacerbated by U.S. policies and efforts to oust him. We believe that due process and practical, realistic policies better protect our national interests than threats and confrontational rhetoric. It strains credulity to believe that your advisors picked this fight with President Maduro without realizing that Venezuela would seek help fixing its defensive capabilities.
Moreover and very seriously, rhetoric challenging Russia could all too easily lead to a much more consequential confrontation. Invoking the 1823 Monroe Doctrine is unhelpful. For Russia to provide assistance for purely defensive purposes to a country in which we seek to create regime change and threaten military attack would not be widely seen as violating the Monroe Doctrine or crossing a “red line.” We realize that some in the media are trying to egg you on into taking forceful action, perhaps even of a military nature, to punish Russia in any case. We urge you not to fall into this trap. This is not 19th century Latin America, and it is a far cry from the Cuba missile crisis of 1962. The best way to prevent dangerous miscalculation would be for you to speak directly with President Putin. Washington’s energies would be better spent clearing up differences, adjusting failed policies, and promoting a peaceful resolution in Venezuela.

Video: The Dissolution of NATO,www.therussophile.org,RT News,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/video-the-dissolution-of-nato.html/,"This post was originally published on this site German lawmaker Alexander Neu lambasted NATO for conducting aggressive wars and raking up defense spending, suggesting Germany should quit its military command, and the bloc be dissolved altogether.
NATO’s 70th birthday is “not a reason to celebrate, but rather an occasion to finally rethink it, before it’s too late,” Neu wrote in Die Freiheitsliebe blog on Thursday.
The lawmaker from the opposition Left Party slammed the US-led military bloc as an organization that poses “significant security risk to the world” and “systematically violates international law.”
NATO revealed its true colors when it waged an “aggressive war” against Yugoslavia without the UN’s approval, and carried out numerous interventions, which claimed the lives of “countless victims,” Neu argued.
He pointed out that last year NATO’s member states spent more than $1 trillion on defense, which is far more than the defense budgets of its rivals, China and Russia, combined.
The imperialist competition and the fear of losing economic and ideological supremacy drive NATO towards more rearmament and confrontation.
In order to avoid global escalation, the lawmaker proposed that Germany should leave the alliance’s “military structures,” and then NATO itself should be dissolved and replaced by a new “collective security system,” which would include Russia.
Berlin’s contribution to NATO has caused a rift with Washington in recent years, as President Donald Trump repeatedly accused Germany, along with other EU nations, of not spending its “fair share” on the bloc’s collective security. German officials rebuked the criticism, but admitted the country won’t reach NATO’s spending target until 2024.
Founded in 1949, NATO was primarily seen as a bulwark against the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War. The alliance continued its existence after the Soviet Union collapsed, and expanded eastwards, despite vehement protests from Moscow.

Trump Regime Considering Aggression against Venezuela?,www.therussophile.org,Stephen Lendman,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/trump-regime-considering-aggression-against-venezuela.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
International law is clear and unequivocal. It’s automatically US constitutional law under the Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2) – pertaining to treaties, conventions, and other international agreements to which the US is a signatory.
According to the UN Charter and other international law, no nation may attack another for any reason except in self-defense if attacked or an attack is clearly imminent.
Even then, the Security Council alone may authorize military action by one nation against another – not the US president, Congress or courts.
Venezuela is at peace with its neighbors and all other nations, not at war or threatening any, obviously not the US – a country waging war on humanity at home and abroad.
For over two months, everything thrown at its legitimate government for regime change failed.
Is US military intervention coming? Will Britain, France and other NATO countries join a US “coalition of the willing” to rape and destroy Venezuela?
It’s the strategy used in the 1990s rape of Yugoslavia and in all post-9/11 wars of aggression against nations threatening no one.
In my view, it’s highly unlikely. The world community opposes it, notably EU, Latin, and Central American nations.
That said, the Trump regime pulled all its staff from Venezuela. A State Department alert advised US citizens in the country to leave.
On Friday, an unnamed Trump administration official said military intervention “is seriously (being) considered as events unfold”– because everything else tried so far failed, adding:
US tactics “continue to diminish due to Maduro’s recent actions. These tools are diminishing, which is leaving us with increased economic tools and increased economic pressure…and also a military option, which, as President Trump has said, is on the table.”
“The European community, the United States, and the Lima group have made it clear that the consequences of any harm that comes, or an arrest of Juan Guaido, would be devastating to Maduro.”
“It would be the worst and last mistake he makes, and, therefore, we are watching very closely.”
Trump and other regime hardliners earlier said they’re running out of nonmilitary options so belligerent intervention may come next.
Are these and similar comments meaningless bluster, aiming to pressure Venezuela’s military to switch sides? What hasn’t worked so far won’t likely ahead.
Convicted felon Elliott Abrams was appointed point man for regime change in Venezuela.
Dirty Central American wars he orchestrated in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala were responsible for over 300,000 deaths, countless thousands more brutally tortured, and forced into exile.
In June 1986, an International Tribunal on Genocide in Central America called the period a time of intense violence – made in the USA by Abrams and his co-conspirators, saying:
Things “verg(ed) on a near total break-down of the state institutions and open warfare between state governments, competing rebel forces challenging state authorities and indigenous” peoples.
“In the course of resurgent violence, acts of genocide and ethnocide (were) committed against indigenous groups.”
Accusations “of state sponsored and rebel force sponsored genocide against indigenous peoples (were) repeatedly made throughout the course of” the decade, including massacres, torture, forced military service, land seizures, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments, population relocations, and attacks amounting to genocide under the UN Convention.
“That there is sufficient evidence to warrant the convening of a (genocide) tribunal goes without question.” Perhaps Abrams intends an encore of the above atrocities in Venezuela.
Is he plotting something similar in Venezuela, together with other Trump regime co-conspirators?
Along with more illegal sanctions, proxy and cyberwar war are most likely, the former with armed paramilitary thugs for involvement in violence creating chaos, the latter by attacks on Venezuelan infrastructure.
Direct military intervention would be high-risk, neighboring countries Colombia and Brazil especially hostile to the idea, concerned about possible millions of Venezuelans fleeing cross-border for safety.
Russia appears committed to help preserve and protect Venezuelan sovereignty. If US forces attack the Bolivarian Republic, will Putin intervene against Trump regime aggression similar to how he acted in Syria?
Will the US risk possible East/West confrontation over Venezuela?
In a same day article, I suggested Guaido’s arrest, detention, and prosecution for high crimes against the state is likely coming, adding:
Most likely what will follow is escalated US sanctions war, along with more Trump regime threats and establishment media rage. All of the above are coming anyway whether Guaido remains free or detained, awaiting trial – direct US military intervention highly unlikely despite regime threats otherwise.
Venezuela has a choice – going all out to preserve and protect its hemisphere’s best social democracy and sovereign independence or become a US vassal state, the country transformed into a fascist police state, its people terrorized into submission.
The choice is simple. Fundamental freedoms are too important to lose. They’re worth fighting for, no matter the risks.
Losing them to an imperial power means all hope is lost – which is no choice at all.

U.S. Admits It Cannot Attack Venezuela – Confirmed S-300 Anti-Air Systems,www.therussophile.org,Joaquin Flores,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/u-s-admits-it-cannot-attack-venezuela-confirmed-s-300-anti-air-systems.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The U.S State Department special operator for Venezuela, Elliot Abrams , has revealed that Venezuela is already in possession numerous highly effective S-300 (Antey 2500 version) systems . This makes a military campaign against Venezuela highly unlikely, given the high-importance of air-cover for any boots on the ground, and the high effectiveness of the S-300 system. It also explains the decision of OAS member states Columbia and Brazil not to resort to military intervention against the Bolivarian Republic – a jungle war without air-cover would be extraordinarily costly in terms of casualties and the resulting social and political unrest. While the U.S military has known of this, until Abrams statement today there was a reluctance to report the problems posed by this, amid Trump’s war-drums surrounding his alleged ‘all options’ approach to Venezuela.
Previously, FRN relayed a report from a private Israeli satellite giving the locations of the S-300 systems then believed to be in movement to strategic locations. While the source was questionable regarding alleged piece movement, it led to some confusion as to whether Venezuela indeed possessed the systems at all.
See Elliot’s Presentation Here
CSS analysts are of the opinion that the U.S military’s knowledge of Venezuela’s relatively advanced anti-air capacities are one of the factors behind the now infamous Abrams confession that the U.S has no plans to ply a thorough military campaign against the Bolivarian socialist nation.
In short Venezuela has at least six systems now operating, each system can target nearly 25 advanced fighters or attack planes simultaneously. This means that the Venezuelan anti-air forces could target 150 U.S fighters, bombers, attack planes, and even ballistic missiles simultaneously. With a hit rate of about 85%-90%, the U.S could expect to lose upwards of 130 planes in a sortie unless the SAM systems were overwhelmed. However, the U.S possesses about 1800 fighters and attack planes in its entire arsenal; many of these are deployed around the world and could not be used all to attack Venezuela, for numerous reasons including vulnerability and logistics.
[embedded content]
The S-300 system is effective against 4th and 5th generation U.S fighters and attack planes, as well as most bombers, when bombers lower altitude to avoid detection. Venezuela is said to have at least five of these Antey 2500 systems now forward deployed, and one S-300VM. These systems are extremely similar, and summarily it can be said that Venezuela has six S-300 systems comprised of several models of the system.
The major revelation was made hours ago, when the U.S State Department subsequent to a closed door meeting, briefed media about its belief that the several planes of Russian military, numbering more than 100 personnel so far, are in Venezuela to help make sure the S-300’s are up to par. They are believed to be installing the latest computerated upgrades to Venezuela’s S-300 systems, also known as the Antey 2500, a very high-end export version above the S-300VM. This is known to be able to target and hit 4th fighters and attack jets, such as the F-16, F-14, and F/A-18, including the 4.5 generation of those makes, as well as 5th generation jets like the F-35 with an 85% success/hit rate.
The Russians in Venezuela would be there to see that these S-300/Antey 2500’s are upgraded to effectively target U.S jets at a range of over 230 km, with the introduction of the 48N6E2 missile and similar. This upgraded system is apparently capable against not just short range ballistic missiles, but now also medium range ballistic missiles. It uses the 83M6E2 command and control system, consisting of the 54K6E2 command post vehicle and the 64N6E2 surveillance/detection radar. It employs the 30N6E2 fire control/illumination and guidance radar.
S-300 system
Abrams pronouncements, however, that the Russians were there to perform electrical repair work required for the S-300’s in the aftermath of the black-out, is incoherent given that these systems are not operated on grid. It is likely that his statement was made to give some credibility to the possibility of a U.S attack, i.e., that such an attack upon Venezuela’s electric system could be replicated, and therefore the U.S air forces could attack during such a black-out. This is contrary to what is known about the electric systems that militaries rely on, including back-up generators or being off-grid to begin with. “In our opinion, one of the things the Russians are doing there is to help the authorities with the S-300 systems that have suffered from the blackouts,” special representative Abrams said. Abrams clarified that the US is not aware of what kind of maintenance is being provided by the Russian military, which on the face of it appeared to contradict his assertion from just moments earlier. In early March, the National Electricity Corporation of Venezuela reported sabotage on the large hydroelectric power station El Guri. The incident in Caracas and in 21 of the 23 states of the country suffered electrical black-outs. Nicolas Maduro blamed Washington for the incident. In turn, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied these allegations, while tweets from American politicians such as Marco Rubio appeared to confirm U.S interference. On Saturday March 23rd, two airplanes with Russian servicemen arrived at the airport near Caracas for consultations on military-technical cooperation. According to local media reports, 99 military personnel were flown to Venezuela, and 35 tons of cargo were also delivered. As Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova emphasized, the presence of Russian specialists is regulated by an agreement on military-technical cooperation between Moscow and Caracas.

As the Russia collusion hoax hurtles toward its demise, it’s important to consider how this destructive information operation rampaged through vital American institutions for more than two years, and what can be done to stop such a damaging episode from recurring.
While the hoax was fueled by a wide array of false accusations, misleading leaks of ostensibly classified information, and bad-faith investigative actions by government officials, one vital element was indispensable to the overall operation: the Steele dossier.
Funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee, which hid their payments from disclosure by funneling them through the law firm Perkins Coie, the dossier was a collection of false and often absurd accusations of collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials. These allegations, which relied heavily on Russian sources cultivated by Christopher Steele , were spoon-fed to Trump opponents in the U.S. government, including officials in law enforcement and intelligence.
The efforts to feed the dossier’s allegations into top levels of the U.S. government, particularly intelligence agencies, were championed by Steele, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, and various intermediaries. These allegations were given directly to the FBI and Justice Department, while similar allegations were fed into the State Department by long-time Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal .
Their efforts were remarkably effective. Officials within the FBI and DOJ, whether knowingly or unintentionally, provided essential support to the hoax conspirators, bypassing normal procedures and steering the information away from those who would view it critically. The dossier soon metastasized within the government, was cloaked in secrecy, and evaded serious scrutiny.
High-ranking officials such as then-FBI general counsel James Baker and then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr were among those whose actions advanced the hoax. Ohr, one of the most senior officials within the DOJ, took the unprecedented step of providing to Steele a back door into the FBI investigation. This enabled the former British spy to continue to feed information to investigators, even though he had been terminated by the FBI for leaking to the press and was no longer a valid source. Even worse, Ohr directly briefed Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad , two DOJ officials who were later assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. In short, the investigation was marked by glaring irregularities that would normally be deemed intolerable.
According to Ohr’s congressional testimony, he told top-level FBI officials as early as August or September 2016 that Steele was biased against Trump, that Steele’s work was connected to the Clinton campaign, and that Steele’s material was of questionable reliability. Steele himself confirmed that last point in a British court case in which he acknowledged his allegations included unverified information. Yet even after this revelation, intelligence leaders continued to cite the Steele dossier in applications to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
It is astonishing that intelligence leaders did not immediately recognize they were being manipulated in an information operation or understand the danger that the dossier could contain deliberate disinformation from Steele’s Russian sources. In fact, it is impossible to believe in light of everything we now know about the FBI’s conduct of this investigation, including the astounding level of anti-Trump animus shown by high-level FBI figures like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, as well as the inspector general’s discovery of a shocking number of leaks by FBI officials.
It’s now clear that top intelligence officials were perfectly well aware of the dubiousness of the dossier, but they embraced it anyway because it justified actions they wanted to take – turning the full force of our intelligence agencies first against a political candidate and then against a sitting president.
The hoax itself was a gift to our nation’s adversaries, most notably Russia. The abuse of intelligence for political purposes is insidious in any democracy. It undermines trust in democratic institutions, and it damages the reputation of the brave men and women who are working to keep us safe. This unethical conduct has had major repercussions on America’s body politic, creating a yearslong political crisis whose full effects remain to be seen.
Having extensively investigated this abuse, House Intelligence Committee Republicans will soon be submitting criminal referrals on numerous individuals involved in these matters. These people must be held to account to prevent similar abuses from occurring in the future. The men and women of our intelligence community perform an essential service defending American national security, and their ability to carry out their mission cannot be compromised by biased actors who seek to transform the intelligence agencies into weapons of political warfare.
Rep. Devin Nunes, a Republican, represents California’s 22nd Congressional District. He is ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. Comment: The Examiner’s Daniel Chaitin comments :
Alleged FISA abuse is now the subject of a revamped investigation by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who last month demanded from the Justice Department a wide array of documentation related to the surveillance of Page and other members of the 2016 Trump campaign.
“[T]he Committee is concerned that the Woods procedures and a full presentment of material and relevant facts may not have occurred with regard to the applications for FISA warrants for (and the opening of the underlying investigations on) Carter Page and other individuals associated with the presidential campaign of Donald Trump,” Graham wrote in a letter. Enacted in 2001, the Woods Procedures were intended to protect U.S. citizens from improper surveillance by the government, seeking to “ensure accuracy with regard to the facts supporting probable cause.”
For years there has been suspicion of intelligence agencies waging a political campaign against candidate and then President Trump. Allies of Trump often seize on a breadcrumb trail of odd activity, such as the infamous 2016 tarmac meeting between Obama-era Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton when his wife Hillary Clinton was a presidential candidate and under investigation for her unauthorized email server. Also fueling speculation are comments such as that from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schume r, who in January 2017, just before Trump’s inauguration, warned the president-elect that intelligence officials “ have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. “
Conservative Treehouse adds a warning note :
By now everyone knows there were two parallel operations, two investigative paths, at work in the 2016 election. There was an official government investigation, Crossfire Hurricane via the FBI; and an unofficial investigation, dossier assembly via Chris Steele and Fusion GPS. Both operations originated in synergy with the vast Russian conspiracy narrative.
One operation was a function of elements outside the traditional framework of government via Fusion GPS. The second operation was specifically happening inside government spurred by CIA Director John Brennan and with the delivery of his “EC” officially creating the Crossfire Hurricane counterintelligence investigation.
Crossfire Hurricane, began on July 31st, 2016. Later in the year, the FBI investigation merged with the Fusion GPS investigation through the use of the Steele Dossier; and that led to the FISA application on Carter Page as a way to enmesh the two tracks.
Devin Nunes does an excellent job explaining the Fusion-GPS network, which includes: Glenn Simpson, Nellie Ohr, Christopher Steele and eventually DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Bruce was the bridge to import opposition research (The Dossier) from the private sector and inject it into the FBI intelligence apparatus.
This Fusion-GPS operation, as Nunes correctly describes , culminated with the Steele Dossier being transferred into the FBI. Again, I strongly urge everyone to read the Op-ed .
However, there is a stark absence within Nunes outline; there is something completely missing, “ the second operation “. The operation that originated from within the U.S. government in early 2016. The CIA operation started by John Brennan.
The external team, Glenn Simpson and Nellie Ohr et al, could not instruct Joseph Mifsud ( Maltese Professor, FBI/CIA asset ), or Alexander Downer ( Australian Diplomat ), or Stephan Halper ( U.K. Academic and FBI/CIA asset ), or Charles Tawil ( Israeli CIA asset ) to make contact with George Papadopoulos, Mike Flynn or Carter Page. Those contacts were covert and (un)official government missions for the weaponized U.S. intelligence apparatus.
I can understand why Devin Nunes would want to avoid attention on the second ‘inside government’ operation due to collateral damage that might hit our intelligence capabilities, ie. FISA. Indeed, with Mr. Nunes in charge of keeping those intelligence capabilities intact, he has somewhat of a conflicted professional interest in full exposure.
However, let me state clearly I’m very concerned the U.S. intelligence system is going to take the same approach toward defending their conflicted interests that Devin Nunes is taking inside this op-ed.
Heck, it would not be a leap to anticipate CIA Director John Brennan, ODNI James Clapper and Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe counting on exactly this inherent conflict helping their own escape from accountability.
The Steele Dossier did not originate Crossfire Hurricane. CIA Director John Brennan ran an operation from February through July 2016 to create the Crossfire Hurricane investigation run by FBI Agent Peter Strzok. The Dossier was on an entirely different track.
Devin Nunes has been a solid and trustworthy patriot throughout. Unfortunately, while many people might not notice the gaping hole inside his op-ed , those of us who do notice have a reason to be concerned….
Do not let the Deep State bad actors escape by only holding outside conspirators accountable.

Libyan National Army led by Haftar begins offensive on UN-backed govt in Tripoli – UPDATE,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/libyan-national-army-led-by-haftar-begins-offensive-on-un-backed-govt-in-tripoli-update.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

The forces of the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Khalifa Haftar, have assumed control over several southwest neighbourhoods of Tripoli, engaging in no major clashes so far, a source in the LNA told Sputnik Friday.
“As of now, the streets of the city are empty. It seems that almost all residents have chosen to leave the city. Several areas are already occupied by the LNA forces, for example, Janzur and Al-Swani, which are in the south-west of Tripoli. No clashes have taken place yet, only a few minor attacks from gangs along the way [of the Haftar army divisions] to Tripoli.”
Meanwhile, the mayor of Garyan in Libya told Sputnik on Friday that the LNA, led by Haftar, had assumed control of the city without fighting.
“The Libyan National Army entered Garyan and assumed full control over it without any resistance on the part of the armed militia that had withdrawn in the direction of Tripoli several hours before the LNA coming,” Bahlul Sayyid said.
The mayor said that the situation in the city was calm, no sounds of clashes were heard in neighbouring settlements. Haftar’s army was advancing upon Tripoli, he added.
According to Sputnik source, head of the Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Sarraj, remains in Tripoli despite the LNA offensive.
Commenting on the operation, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari stated that the army is continuing to advance.
“We are next to Al-Swani. This is a heavily populated settlement about 25 kilometres [15 miles] south of Tripoli. We are also advancing toward Tripoli from other directions. In addition, we are conducting an operation in Janzur, but unfortunately, we have had to withdraw a little from there.”
Mismari told Sputnik that the LNA had not reached the capital yet. He also said that he could not predict when the operation would conclude due to the conditions under which it was being conducted.
Meanwhile, the tracker Flightradar24 shows that Mitiga International Airport and Tripoli International Airport are operating as usual.

Addressing the situation in Libya, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit called on both sides of the conflict to show restraint and to take urgent de-escalation measures.
The news comes after media reported on Thursday that the LNA commander had ordered an offensive on Tripoli, controlled by the UN-supported interim Government of National Accord after his army took control over cities of Surman and Garyan.
On 20 March, the United Nations announced that it would sponsor a conference in Ghadames on 14-16 April to address the crisis in Libya and set a date for the long-awaited elections that could restore peace and security for the nation.
As a result of a years-long civil conflict that erupted following a rebellion and murder of the ex-head of state Muammar Gaddafi, there is no single central government in Libya, and the country’s eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament, elected in 2014 and backed by the LNA, governs the east of Libya, while the GNA, established in 2015, controls Libya’s western parts from Tripoli. Comment: See also:
FRN provided a location map for situational identification:
© FRN This map is an up-to-the-minute representation of the present situation in Libya. The Red dots represent areas held by Haftar/Benghazi, the Green dots represent either Tripoli’s forces or various warlords.
Haftar’s forces have been routing the Tripoli government’s forces without major problems, followed by today’s call for a march to the capital.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guteres, who arrived in Tripoli on Wednesday, called for restraint from both sides, warning the growing danger of a new major confrontation.
UNSC, G7, Russia and the US have called on Haftar to halt advances toward Tripoli. RFE/RL has this:
After an emergency meeting on April 5, the council warned that the military activity of Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) was putting the country’s stability at risk. German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, who currently holds the Security Council presidency…”called on LNA forces to halt all military movements.” The council said it would hold accountable those responsible for any further violence.
The council’s statement came hours after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with Haftar in Benghazi as part of efforts to forestall an outright assault on Tripoli and avoid a bloody civil war. “I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli,” he said on Twitter after his meeting.
Earlier, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7)…expressed their “deepest concern” about the renewed fighting and urged an immediate end to military activity. “We urge all involved parties to immediately halt all military activity and movements toward Tripoli, which are hindering prospects for the UN-led political process, putting civilians in danger, and prolonging the suffering of the Libyan people,” a statement said
Russia, which has provided Haftar with backing in the past, claimed it was not helping the commander’s forces in the offensive and that it supported a negotiated political settlement that ruled out any new bloodshed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told news agencies on April 5 that Moscow was monitoring the situation.
The U.S. State Department also sounded the alarm about the new fighting.
Reports on action in the field:
Reuters and other news agencies said Haftar’s forces took the town of Gharyan, about 80 kilometers south of Tripoli after fighting against forces allied with Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, who is based in Tripoli.
Tripoli-allied forces also reportedly took dozens of soldiers from Haftar’s units prisoner in a town west of the capital.
Late on April 5, area residents said fighting was going on near the former international airport outside Tripoli and that the LNA had taken control of the facility. The Tripoli-based interior minister, Fathi Ali Bashagha, later said central government forces had retaken the airport.
The G7 group doubled down in warning against military action and conflict:
“We firmly believe that there is no military solution to the Libyan conflict,” the foreign ministers of France, Britain, Germany, United States, Italy, Japan and Canada said in a joint statement. The ministers added that “any Libyan actor or faction that precipitates further civil conflict are harming innocent people and standing in the way of the peace that Libyans deserve.”

© Risk Julian Assange
By the time I publish this we’ll be at or around the 24-hour mark since WikiLeaks announced that two high level Ecuadorian government insiders had told them that Julian Assange faces eviction from the Ecuadorian embassy within days, which seems to have been further confirmed by the Foreign Minister of Ecuador now tweeting that states have the right to revoke political asylum at any time. Activists are mobilizing everywhere, a round-the-clock presence has been set up outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and a #Unity4J emergency broadcast is currently underway full of many respected dissident voices coming together in defense of the legendary leak publisher.And, as we should all have come to expect by now, the establishment narrative management patrol has been going out of its way to inform us all that this is a good thing and no cause for alarm. Whenever you voice concerns about the persecution of Julian Assange on any public forum, you will with remarkable predictability encounter empire loyalists calling Assange a stinky Nazi rapist Putin puppet Trump supporter who deserves to be in prison forever.
What’s striking about these responses, which by now are as familiar to me as the keyboard I type these words on, is how extremely emotional they always are. If you talk about economic policy or foreign policy, for example, you might get a few angry troglodytes who take internet arguments far too seriously, but you’ll also typically get people calmly explaining why they believe you’re wrong and laying out ostensibly fact-based arguments for why this is so.
This is literally never the case with people who want to see Assange imprisoned, in my extensive experience. There’s never, ever any calm, fact-based rationale for why the benefits of prosecuting and imprisoning him for his publications outweigh the risks and costs of doing so . It’s always vitriolic, hyperbolic, frequently profanity-riddled arguments from pure emotion, usually something to the effect of “He collaborated with Russia/helped Trump win the election, therefore and I want him punished because I hate him.” Which is just another way of saying, “I want Assange imprisoned because of the way my feelings feel.”
Now, aside from the established fact that the US government’s agenda to prosecute Assange has nothing to do with the 2016 election but with the exposure of US war crimes six years earlier, this is also a completely fallacious argument from top to bottom. Claiming that something ought to happen because of how your feelings feel is very obviously a logical fallacy , but this kind of argument comprises the entirety of support for Assange’s imprisonment that Assange defenders encounter on a regular basis.
This happens because the smear campaign that has been used by the western political/media class to manufacture support for Assange’s silencing and imprisonment has its foundation not in fact, but in emotion. Smear campaigns are by their nature emotional at their core, because they are intended to elicit public disgust, disdain and hatred for their target. That’s why you’ll see so many mainstream news media articles claiming that Assange smells bad , for example, despite that having nothing whatsoever to do with the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Assange’s work. The goal is not to present a factual case for why it would be more helpful than harmful to prosecute the WikiLeaks founder, the goal is to make people feel disgust for him, and, by extension, disgust for his work as well.
So naturally, because they are constantly being inundated with establishment propaganda about Assange consisting of nothing other than appeals to emotion, mainstream liberals are going to believe that spewing vitriol about how their feelings feel is a perfectly legitimate response to his name coming up in political discourse. This is all they have had modeled for them in responding to Assange’s plight. It’s been normalized for them.
Yes, the mainstream liberal political conversation really has gotten that crazy and stupid. Their emotions really are that insanely coddled, and facts really have become that marginalized. That is why you can’t defend Assange in public without getting a bunch of brainwashed MSM-swilling liberals falling all over themselves to show you how emotional they feel about the subject at hand.
Another reason the Assange smears focus on emotion rather than facts is because the facts are very contrary to the interests of the smear merchants. The facts are that prosecuting Julian Assange under the Espionage Act for exposing US war crimes, as the Trump administration is attempting to do, would strike a devastating blow to press freedoms around the world. This is because there are no legal distinctions in place separating an outlet like WikiLeaks from outlets like the New York Times , the Washington Post , or the Guardian , meaning that a precedent would be set allowing for the prosecution of those outlets on the same grounds, who also publish anonymous government leaks . Which is why the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian have all warned sternly of this precedent, which has also been recognized by the Obama administration .
These are facts.
These are facts regardless of how your feelings feel about Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.
These are facts regardless of how your feelings feel about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
These are facts regardless of how your feelings feel about Russia and Vladimir Putin.
These are facts regardless of how assertively and authoritatively Rachel Maddow speaks.
These are facts regardless of how much of a stinky, stinky stink man the news media claims Assange is.
These are facts regardless of how much your emotions have been coddled by your favorite pundits, your university professors, your political cliques and your echo chamber.
These are facts. It does not matter how your feelings feel. Your feelings are irrelevant to this conversation. Only facts matter here. And the facts say that everyone, regardless of how they feel about Assange, must defend him against the US government’s attempts to prosecute him for publishing inconvenient truths. Not because it’s the right thing to do, not because anyone expects you to behave in a moral way, but out of sheer, garden variety self-interest. We all need the ability to hold power to account, and the prosecution of Assange will necessarily cripple our ability to do that. This is a fact. Regardless of how your feelings feel.

Trump To Designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard A Foreign Terrorist Group,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/trump-to-designate-irans-revolutionary-guard-a-foreign-terrorist-group.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The White House is preparing to designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization, the Wall Street Journal reported late Friday, citing US officials.
This would take Washington and Tehran’s four decade long hostile dealings into uncharted territory, likely paving the way for future war, given as the WSJ points out it “would mark the time that an element of a foreign state has been official designated as a terrorist entity.”
Major-General Qassem Soleimani, left, the IRGC Quds force commander.
The IRGC is the elite branch of Iran’s armed services founded upon the 1979 Islamic revolution by order of Ayatollah Khomeini and charged by the constitution with safeguarding internal order, and preventing coup attempts and external plotting.
Its specialized “Quds” force is the foreign arm of the IRGC, often accused by US and Israeli officials of committing espionage and terror attacks abroad. It handles all clandestine and special forces style operations on foreign soil.
According to the report, the Trump administration plans to announce the move as early as Monday , which could be accompanied by an alert going out to all military personnel and foreign service staff abroad warning them of possible retaliation .
However, all of Iranian government entities, including the Guard, are already under unprecedented and aggressive sanctions, so it’s unclear just what impact the White House hopes to make; but it certainly will bring Washington and Tehran into more direct conflict.
It’s also a move designed to instill greater fear and hesitancy in European and international countries still trying to do business with Iran , given the IRGC actually controls a significant segment of the Iranian economy.
White House officials have in the past speculated IRGC could have its hands in up to half of the total economy, something veteran Iran analysts say is hugely overblown.
And crucially, the IRGC being branded a terrorist entity would make it much harder if not near impossible for a future American president to attempt to restore relations with Iran , and would permanently dash any near term or future attempt to renew any semblance of the 2015 nuclear deal.

Capitalism (AKA Self-Ownership) Is The Only Moral Economic System,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/capitalism-aka-self-ownership-is-the-only-moral-economic-system.html/,"Authored by Gary Galles via The Mises Institute,
With all the “turn that over to the government, too, so someone else will have to provide it for you” proposals that have come from Democrat Presidential hopefuls already, candidates are actually being asked if they are a “socialist” or a “capitalist.”
Bernie Sanders , who has called for “economic rights” guarantees to be treated as Constitutional rights, admits being a socialist.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , who may want even more people to live at everyone else’s expense, is on the same bandwagon: “Capitalism is an ideology of capital–the most important thing is the concentration of capital and to seek and maximize profit.” Consequently, “capitalism is irredeemable.”
However, other candidates, proposing or supporting very similar changes, have claimed they are (modified) capitalists.
Elizabeth Warren has said “I am a capitalist to my bones…I believe in markets. What I don’t believe in is theft.” Along the same lines, she has said, “I love what markets can do. I love what functioning economies can do. They are what make us rich; they are what create opportunity. But only fair markets, markets with rules. Markets without rules is about the rich take it all…And that’s what’s gone wrong in America.”
Kamala Harris offered a similar complaint that “the rules aren’t applying equally to all people.”
Joe Biden asked, “What happened to a moral responsibility, to a moral capitalism?”
Beto O’Rourke followed up his claim to be a capitalist with “Having said that, it is clearly an imperfect, unfair, unjust and racist capitalist economy.”
Unfortunately for these candidates (and for Americans if voters don’t understand better), every one relies on false assumptions about markets and governments.
Senator Sanders fails to see that his call for more positive rights to things, from education to health care, must violate Americans’ negative rights (prohibitions laid out against others, especially government, to prevent unwanted intrusions). The Declaration of Independence, echoing John Locke, asserts that all have unalienable rights, including liberty, and that our government’s central purpose is to defend those negative rights, which is further reinforced in our Bill of Rights. Each citizen can enjoy them without infringing on anyone else’s rights. Negative rights impose on others only the obligation not to invade or interfere. But when the government creates new positive rights, extracting the resources to pay for them necessarily takes away others’ unalienable rights. That is, you cannot add new positive rights to existing negative rights, you can only do so by destroying some of the negative rights that define the idea that became America.
AOC, as she is now typically called, shows that she “learned” things that contradict what she should have learned in her economics major. She subscribes to what Marx intended in naming capitalism – making it seem that the owners of capital gain and others are hurt. But capitalism is better defined as a system of private ownership of resources, including one’s labor, not simply ownership of capital, coordinated by solely voluntary arrangements. Private property prevents the physical invasion of a person’s life, their liberty, or their property without their consent. By preventing such invasions, private property is an irreplaceable defense against aggression by the strong against the weak. No one is allowed to be a predator by violating others’ rights. In such a system, capitalists need the voluntary consent of laborers in their arrangements, preventing capitalists from exploiting laborers. In Herbert Spencer’s words, “far from being, as some have alleged, an advocacy of the claims of the strong against the weak, [capitalism] is much more an insistence that the weak shall be guarded against the strong.”
Elizabeth Warren’s supposed endorsement of markets, but opposition to markets without rules is senseless. There are no markets without rules in capitalism. The core rule is that of private property, which requires arrangements to be voluntary, which in turn rules out the possibility of the theft she supposedly objects to. If there is theft, or fraud that allows it, that represents a government failure to defend someone’s property rights or a piecemeal violation of equal property rights by government, neither of which justifies still more government intervention to fix, unless it is to better defend private property rights now being violated or stop violating them itself. And Kamala Harris’ complaint that “the rules aren’t applying equally to all people” is subject to the same criticism.
Joe Biden’s “What happened to a moral responsibility, to a moral capitalism?” reflects a similar confusion. The most basic moral or ethical basis for any human relationship is to not violate others’ rights, which Cicero called “giving each his own,” over two millenia ago. Or, as Adam Smith wrote in his Theory of Moral Sentiments , “The man who barely abstains from violating either the person, or the estate, or the reputation of his neighbors…does everything which his equals can with propriety force him to do, or which they can punish him for not doing. We can often fulfill all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing.” Yet Biden seems to think that policies that require the violation of unwilling Americans’ rights is more moral than one that does not.
Beto O’Rourke’s endorsement of capitalism, then described as “imperfect, unfair, unjust and racist,” seems to reflect a similar view, but mainly reflects serious confusion. What American would endorse something that meets his description of capitalism, unless he was a sadist?
For each of these candidates, even a rudimentary understanding of private property rights and voluntary arrangements eviscerates their evaluations of capitalism, and sweeps away any reliable basis for their proposed “solutions.”
In fact, both logic and history attest to the damage their proposals can create. As Ludwig von Mises explained it, private property is the basis for “joint action and cooperation in which each participant sees the other partner’s success as a means for the attainment of his own,” in sharp contrast to any “us versus them” zero- or negative-sum view of social interaction which treats someone’s gains as others’ losses. In capitalism (which is actually inconsistent with the government- created or enabled crony capitalism we see all around us), even those who would be tyrants, if given the opportunity, must focus their efforts on providing willing service to others to induce their voluntary cooperation. In contrast, the drive for power that animates these politicians who condemn a capitalism they plainly don’t comprehend would increasingly turn others into their unwilling servants.

Russian diplomat holds phone talks with Libyan National Army commander Haftar,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russian-diplomat-holds-phone-talks-with-libyan-national-army-commander-haftar.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MOSCOW, April 6. /TASS/. Russian Special Presidential Representative for the Middle East and Africa Mikhail Bogdanov held phone talks with Commander of the Libyan National Army Khalifa Haftar on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
“Haftar shared information on the Libyan National Army’s operations in recent days, which were said to be pursuing a goal of boosting the fight against terrorist and extremist groups operating in different parts of the country, including in the capital of Tripoli, which pose a threat to stability of Libya’s society and hinder the implementation of agreements on the establishment of a sustainable intra-Libyan inclusive political process and a consensus dialogue, with the aim to set up unified efficient government bodies,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
“The Russian side reaffirmed its principal position in support of political solutions to all disputable issues in Libyan society and mediatory steps taken by the United Nations and its Special Envoy for Libya Ghassan Salame. In addition, [they] underscored the need to consolidate efforts in the fight against terrorism and extremist ideology,” the ministry added.
The phone call was requested by the Libyan side.
Libya has two supreme executive authorities, namely Tripoli’s world-recognized government of National Accord headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and the interim government headed by Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani, which operates in the country’s east along with the elected parliament and is supported by the Libyan National Army.
On April 4, Haftar announced the launch of an offensive on Tripoli. On Saturday, the Libyan National Army was reported to have approached Tripoli at a distance of ten kilometers from the city center. Meanwhile, Fayez al-Sarraj ordered all military units subordinate to him to be on alert and to use force if necessary “to defend the civilian population and critical facilities.”.

PARIS, April 6. /TASS/. G7 foreign ministers voiced their concern on Saturday over the deployment of Russian military personnel to Venezuela, the ministers said in a joint communique after a two-day ministerial meeting in Dinard, France.
“We are alarmed by the deployment of Russian military forces which threatens to exacerbate the already dangerous situation,” the communique says.
“We also call upon the international community to collectively take a strong, principled stance to help the Venezuelan people achieve a peaceful, democratic and sustainable solution to the worsening crisis,” it adds.
Juan Guaido, Venezuelan opposition leader and parliament speaker, whose appointment to that position had been cancelled by the country’s Supreme Court, declared himself interim president at a rally in the country’s capital of Caracas on January 23. Several countries, including the United States, Lima Group members (excluding Mexico), as well as the Organization of American States, recognized him as president. In contrast, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Iran, China, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Syria and Turkey voiced support for Maduro.

CAIRO, April 6. /TASS/. Egypt works on security at domestic airports and tries to learn from Russia’s experience, Egyptian Foreign Minister Saleh Shoukry said on Saturday after talks with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Cairo.
“We have an unprecedentedly high level of cooperation with Russia [on the issue of resuming Russian charter flights to Egyptian resorts], we are trying to take into account Russia’s experience,” he said recalling numerous visits by delegations of Russian experts who had inspected security measures at Egypt’s air hubs.
“We welcome Russian delegations within the framework of technical cooperation in order to resume direct flights to the resorts and pledge to do our best to ensure security, so that Russian tourists can come on holidays to the Egyptian resorts again,” he said.
According to the minister, in spite of the general situation in the region, Egypt is doing everything possible to keep terrorism out of its territory.
All flights between Russia and Egypt were cancelled in November 2015 after an A321 passenger jet owned by Russia’s Kogalymavia air carrier bound to St. Petersburg crashed on October 31, 2015, some 30 minutes after the takeoff from Egypt’s resort of Sharm El Sheikh.
In 2016-2017, the sides negotiated the resumption of aviation service. A new terminal meeting all aviation security requirements was been constructed in the Cairo airport. Before flights resumed, Russian aviation experts inspected the airport several times.
In January 2018, Putin signed a decree to resume regular flights between Russia and Egypt. The first flight from Moscow to Cairo took place on April 11, 2018.
However, charter flights to Egyptian resort towns, particularly Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada, remain suspended to date.

Sanders’ ‘Berners’ Still Smoldering Over 2016,www.therussophile.org,William Holland,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/sanders-berners-still-smoldering-over-2016.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

IOWA CITY, Iowa—It was hard to miss Cheri Pichone’s excitement about Bernie Sanders’ second presidential run. She showed up to a recent Iowa rally decked out in Sanders gear, complete with a figurine of the Vermont senator and progressive icon.
But underneath her exuberance, the 36-year-old was still mad about the last Democratic primary, when Sanders’ bid for the presidency fell short to Hillary Clinton.
“They cheated,” she said, directing much of her anger at the Democratic National Committee. The party establishment, she lamented, was “actively working against us.”
Pichone voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein in 2016 and said she may vote for a third party again if Sanders doesn’t clinch the nomination.
She’s emblematic of a persistent group of Sanders supporters who won’t let go of the slights — real and perceived — from the last campaign. The frustration is notable now that Sanders is a 2020 front-runner, raking in $18.2 million in the first quarter, downplaying concerns about DNC bias and highlighting his success in bringing the party around on liberal policies it once resisted.
Some establishment-aligned Democrats worry the party could lose in 2020 if lingering concerns about the last primary aren’t put to bed.
“It has the potential to escalate, and it has the potential to help re-elect Donald Trump,” said Mo Elleithee, a former spokesman for Clinton and the DNC.
The acrimony stems from a fiercely fought campaign and a sense among Sanders loyalists that party leaders privately favored Clinton. DNC leaders at the time scheduled fewer debates than Republicans and sometimes slated them for nights with low television viewership. Often opaque delegate allocation rules also contributed to a belief among some Sanders supporters that the primary was essentially rigged.
According to data from the Pew Research Center, the tension took a toll. About 81% of people who consistently supported Sanders during the primary season and were confirmed to have voted in the general election said they ultimately voted for Clinton, while 11% said they supported Stein or Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, and 3% supported Trump.
In a closely contested election, those moves away from Clinton may have factored into the results.
Since the election, party leaders have sought to smooth things over with Sanders and his supporters. DNC Chairman Tom Perez is planning a robust debate schedule. The rules governing superdelegates — party insiders who overwhelmingly backed Clinton — have changed.
Sanders has publicly expressed confidence in the process this time around, but in terms that suggest he won’t soon forget 2016.
“In 2016, I think I will not shock anybody to suggest that the DNC was not quite evenhanded,” he said during a CNN town hall in February. “I think we have come a long way since then, and I fully expect to be treated quite as well as anybody else.”
In an interview Friday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir echoed that optimism.
“If you’re talking to anyone at the Democratic National Committee who’s there now, I’m sure they will tell you that their relationship with the Bernie Sanders campaign is great and that we are operating in good faith and we are talking to each other on an almost daily basis,” he said. “Anyone suggesting that there’s any kind of friction there is living in the past. They are living with some grudges that they are holding onto from a bygone time.”
Still, the campaign has made some moves that raise questions about whether resentments from 2016 will linger. Briahna Joy Gray, formerly a liberal journalist who voted for Stein, is Sanders’ national press secretary. Nina Turner, who called the DNC “dictatorial and pompous” in 2017, is one of his national campaign chairs.
And some of Sanders’ most loyal supporters in the crucial early voting states say they’re not ready to fully move on.
Nicholas Shaw, a 39-year-old from Concord, New Hampshire, spent his recent birthday watching Sanders speak. Like Pichone, he said he wouldn’t support the Democratic nominee if it’s anyone other than Sanders.
“If they steal it from him again, I’ll go independent or something other than that,” he said. “The Democratic Party’s on their last edge of me if they kind of try to screw him again.”
Even in South Carolina, where Sanders lost momentum after a 47-point drubbing from Clinton, some supporters are still smarting over a process they believe was rigged.
“Lost might be a stretch,” said Tom Amon, of Summerville, when asked how he felt about Sanders’ ability to perform better in South Carolina than he did in the 2016 primary. “It was stolen from him.”

"For American Jews, Trump Is Key Figure in Israeli Election",www.therussophile.org,DAVID CRARY The Associated Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/for-american-jews-trump-is-key-figure-in-israeli-election.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
NEW YORK—Donald Trump isn’t on the ballot for Israel’s national election, yet he’s a dominant factor for many American Jews as they assess the high stakes of Tuesday’s balloting.
At its core, the election is a judgment on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has won the post four times but now faces corruption charges. In his battle for political survival, Netanyahu has aligned closely with Trump — a troubling tactic for the roughly 75% of American Jewish voters who lean Democratic.
“The world has come to understand that Netanyahu is essentially the political twin of Donald Trump,” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal pro-Israel group J Street. “Unlike his previous elections, there is a much deeper antagonism toward Netanyahu because of that close affiliation between him and Trump and the Republican Party.”
Netanyahu featured Trump in a recent campaign video, while Trump has made a series of policy moves viewed as strengthening Netanyahu in the eyes of Israeli voters, including relocating the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and officially recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory.
“It’s troubling,” said Halie Soifer, executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. “The U.S.-Israel relationship should not be about any two leaders or any two parties. The American Jewish community wants the relationship to remain on a bipartisan basis.”
Though it leans Democratic overall, the American Jewish community — numbering 5.5 million to 6 million — is not monolithic. Most older Jews remain supportive of Israel’s current Middle East policies, as does the roughly 10% of the Jewish population that is Orthodox. Jewish billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has been a staunch financial supporter of Trump and the GOP.
Divisions among U.S. Jews have been exacerbated by recent allegations of anti-Semitism directed at the Democrats’ two Muslim American congresswomen — Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. Seizing on the controversy, Trump tweeted his support for a purported “Jexodus” movement that would encourage Jews to leave the Democratic Party.
“Republicans are waiting with open arms,” Trump tweeted on March 15.
Morton Klein, president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, predicts such an exodus will take place because of the Democrats’ decision to avoid explicit condemnation of the congresswomen.
Ben-Ami scoffed at the notion, suggesting that Jexodus was a fantasy of pro-Trump operatives.
“I’ve yet to meet an actual Obama/Clinton voter who’s said publicly they’re switching to vote for Donald Trump,” he said. “This is not real. It’s completely made up.”
New York-based journalist Jane Eisner, former editor of The Forward, a Jewish newspaper, said many American Jews have “Netanyahu fatigue”— even some who supported him in past.
Among liberal Jews, Eisner said, there are strong worries that Netanyahu will push Israel’s government even further to the right if he wins, perhaps moving to annex some land in the occupied West Bank with confidence that the Trump administration will not object.
Morton Klein conceded that some Jews have grown weary of Netanyahu, but predicted he would prevail.
“People would be nervous if he’s not there,” Klein said.
Jack Rosen, president of the American Jewish Congress, said any surge in Netanyahu fatigue should not be interpreted as a weakening of American Jews’ support for Israeli.
“There is a sense of fatigue having one leader for 10 years,” Rosen said. “Just as we’ve had Clinton fatigue and Bush fatigue.”
Among liberal and centrist American Jews, dismay with Netanyahu extends beyond his alliance with Trump. Some say he’s been too harsh in his treatment of migrants, and they bemoan his backtracking on a promise to allow mixed-gender prayer at the Western Wall. Perhaps most disturbing has been Netanyahu’s alliance with an ultranationalist political party linked to a movement previously banned for anti-Arab racism and incitement.
That political alliance was assailed as “repugnant” by Eric Yoffie, a rabbi from Westfield, New Jersey, in a March 27 op-ed in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Yoffie also decried Netanyahu’s “excessive enthusiasm” for Trump.
“Cordial relations are essential,” wrote Yoffie, president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism. “But the sycophantic buddy movie that Bibi has produced with America’s unbalanced and unpredictable president is something else altogether … Bibi’s egregious and unnecessary embrace of everything Trump will cost Israel dearly.”
In Israel, a prevalent view, at least in pro-Netanyahu ranks, is that the prime minister’s friendship with Trump is paying unprecedented dividends. There is widespread sentiment that liberal American Jews, as a constituency, are dissipating due to intermarriage, and that the evangelical Christian community in the U.S. is a more dependable ally for Israel.
At last year’s ceremony in Jerusalem celebrating the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv, evangelical Christian pastors allied with Trump delivered the opening and closing blessings.
Netanyahu’s main challenger in the election is Benny Gantz, a former military chief popular in Israel but with a relatively low profile in the United States. American Jews who dislike Netanyahu view Gantz as preferable, due in part to a less combative personality, but liberals note with frustration that the platform of Gantz’s Blue and White party makes no mention of Palestinian statehood, and says that Israel will maintain control of parts of the West Bank.
Emily Mayer of IfNotNow, a group of youthful American Jewish activists opposed to Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, is dismayed at how that issue has been marginalized in the Israeli election campaign.
“Regardless of the winner, the utter erasure of Palestinian humanity from this election cycle and the normalization of an undemocratic and immoral military occupation should alarm any Jew who cares about freedom and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians,” Mayer said in an email.

Russian foreign minister slams Israel’s 'inadmissible' shelling of Syria,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russian-foreign-minister-slams-israels-inadmissible-shelling-of-syria.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Russia’s foreign minister has slammed as “inadmissible” Israel’s airstrikes on Syria, underlining the need for respecting the sovereignty of the Arab country.
In an interview with Egypt’s al-Ahram newspaper on Saturday, Sergei Lavrov said Moscow’s stance on the inadmissibility of Israeli shelling of Syria’s territory has not changed.
“Our principled stance concerning shelling Syria’s territory has remained unchanged. We have always clearly expressed our attitude to that. We proceed from the need for strict respect for Syria’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,” Lavrov said.
“We are opposed to turning the country’s territory into a scene of armed standoff between various regional players,” Lavrov said when asked to comment on remarks by some political analysts about softening Moscow’s stance on Israeli shelling of Syria.
The top Russian diplomat said, “During our contacts with all parties concerned, we highlight the importance of preventing an upsurge in tensions and the dangerous escalation of the situation in Syria, which are fraught with negative consequences for both neighboring countries and the Middle East region in general.”
He went on to say that Russia in cooperation with Iran and Turkey contributed to working to set up a de-escalation zone in Syria’s south and southwest.
“Now these areas are under the control of the Syrian government. Russian military police officers help maintain law and order there,” Lavrov said.
Israel began carrying out military strikes in Syria in 2013.
The Tel Aviv regime has recently increased its airstrikes in the Arab nation. Earlier in March, the Israeli regime launched the attacks on Shaykh Najjar industrial city located 10 km northeast of the city of Aleppo.
The Syrian government has on multiple occasions slammed the Israeli regime’s act of aggression and also warned about the “dangerous repercussions” of Israeli assaults on its territories. Israel is widely believed to have been providing weapons to anti-Damascus militants as well as medical treatment to Takfiri elements wounded in Syria inside the occupied Golan Heights.
Israel often claims that it conducts airstrikes targeting “Iranian assets” in Syria.
Damascus and Tehran have repeatedly rejected Israeli claims that Iran has military bases in Syria. Iran has been offering military advisory support to Syria at the request of the Damascus government, enabling its army to speed up its gains on various fronts against terror outfits.
Russia has also conducted aerial bombardment of terrorist positions.
In the past, the Syrian army has confiscated Israeli-made arms and military equipment from terrorists fighting the government forces. There are also reports that Tel Aviv has been treating the extremists wounded in Syria.

Turkey moving away from America’s sphere of influence: Analyst,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/turkey-moving-away-from-americas-sphere-of-influence-analyst.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Turkey has been moving away from America’s sphere of influence and improving its relationship with Russia, which was underscored by Turkey’s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system despite US threats not to do so, says a political analyst in Virginia.
“There’s been tensions between the United States and Turkey in recent years over a number of issues pertaining to US policy in the Middle East,” said Keith Preston, chief editor of AttacktheSystem.com.
“American foreign policy has become increasingly hostile towards Russia in the last few years and the Turks do appear to view that as not being in their interest, in part because of their relatively close geographical proximity to Russia,” Preston told Press TV on Thursday.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday vowed to go ahead with a deal to purchase Russian missiles despite Washington’s suspension of Turkey’s participation in a US jet program.
The US said on Monday it was halting all deliveries and joint work with Turkey on the F-35 fighter jet program if Ankara insisted on the deal.
Washington has suggested Turkey could opt for the US-produced Patriot missiles instead.
But Erdogan said although Ankara was keen to buy the US-produced missiles, “America was unfortunately not giving Patriots to us on the same terms” as Russia.
The row over the F-35 and the S-400 is the latest in a series of diplomatic disputes between Ankara and Washington.
Tensions have been escalating between the two NATO allies over issues including US support for Kurdish groups in Syria that Ankara says are responsible for terror attacks inside Turkey.
Washington and its NATO allies have strived to prevent the sophisticated Russian-built anti-aircraft weapon system from collecting information about the US-made all-weather stealth multirole warplanes, technically known as the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters, just as they are gaining a foothold in Europe.
Erdogan has also slammed American officials for rejecting his requests to hand over Fethullah Gulen, a powerful opposition figure living in the US, whom Ankara accuses of having masterminded a coup attempt in July 2016.

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has agreed to pardon or commute the sentences of a large number of Iranian prisoners.
Ayatollah Khamenei on Saturday agreed to a request by Iran’s Judiciary Chief Hojjatoleslam Ebrahim Raeisi to pardon or reduce the sentences of 1,117 eligible inmates.
Those granted “Islamic clemency” through the Leader’s approval had been convicted at the country’s court of common pleas and Islamic Revolution tribunals, the Judicial Organization of the Armed Forces, and the State Discretionary Punishment Organization.
Ayatollah Khamenei issued the approval on the occasion of Eid al-Mab’ath and the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Republic referendum.
The 27th day of the lunar Islamic month of Rajab marks the auspicious occasion of Eid al-Mab’ath, the anniversary of the divine revelation to the Prophet Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him) to declare his Prophethood.
April 1 marks a historic referendum in which Iranians overwhelmingly voted for the establishment of an Islamic Republic following the overthrow of the monarchy of the US-backed Pahlavi regime.
In the two-day referendum held on March 30-31, 1979, more than 98.2 percent of eligible Iranians voted “yes” to the establishment of an Islamic Republic in the country.

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the Baghdad government should expel US forces from Iraq as soon as possible.
“Relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq are beyond relations between two neighboring countries and the Iranian government and nation regard progress and prosperity of Iraq as beneficial to themselves,” the Leader said in a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and his accompanying delegation in Tehran on Saturday.
“But despite their remarks, the Americans regard democracy and Iraq’s current political activists to their detriment and based on this, the Iraqi government should do something [to ensure] that American military troops leave Iraq as soon as possible,” Ayatollah Khamenei added.
The Leader emphasized that Iraq could turn into the Arab world’s most influential country thanks to its human capacities and rich underground resources.
The US and its stooges in the region oppose the current democratic process in Iraq and believe that it would be against their interests, the Leader stated.
Ayatollah Khamenei added that the Iraqi government, parliament and current political activists were not favored by the US and therefore it was hatching plots to eliminate them from the political scene of Iraq.
The Leader pointed to contradictory remarks and intentions of American and Saudi officials and said, “They funneled money, weapons and equipment to Daesh at a time that they [the terrorists] had occupied Mosul, and now that Iraq has overcome Daesh, they are expressing friendly words.”
The Leader hailed Abdul-Mahdi’s wise and prudent stance on regional issues, particularly the developments in Iraq, and said the Iraqi youths were among the country’s human capacities that passed the exam of the fight against Daesh terrorists in a good and admirable way and marked a historical event.
Ayatollah Khamenei added that scientists and elites were among Iraq’s other human capacities and said the US had killed many Iraqi scientists because it was aware of the significance of “this important asset.”
The Leader stressed the importance of maintaining full vigilance against the Daesh remnants “because they will once again embark on their crimes, if they feel a moment of weakness among the Iraqi government and nation.”
Ayatollah Khamenei said the presence of US troops in the region could harm the interests of any country which they had established a long presence there.
The Leader further said that the Iranian and Iraqi nations had common beliefs and cultural and historic bonds.

During the meeting, which was also attended by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Iraqi prime minister said the Iranian government and nation had always supported the Iraqis in difficult times, particularly in the fight against Daesh.
Abdul-Mahdi hailed his country’s relations with Iran and emphasized that Iraq would never join US sanctions against Tehran.
Speaking at a joint press conference with the Iraqi prime minister earlier in the day, Rouhani said Iran and Iraq were keen to expand their cooperation in the fight against terrorism and smuggling while seeking stronger ties in the power, gas and oil sectors.
“Border cooperation to fight terrorism, narcotics and smuggling will become stronger between the two countries,” Rouhani said.

"Despite Trump Tergiversation, Immigration Increasingly Divides Parties. and Raise A Fosters to Oz Sen.

Every week brings news of some new concession to the business lobbies on legal immigration. I don’t have to go looking for these stories. They pop up every few days. Washington Times , March 29th: DHS to double seasonal guest worker increase (by Stephen Dinan ) The story tells us that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has approved an extra 30,000 seasonal guest worker visas. That’s 15,000 extra over last year’s increase. This increase also comes earlier in the season, which, the report tells us, “will give employers more time to apply and plan.” Well, isn’t that nice for them. Secretary Nielsen is just as worthless on illegal immigration. She showed up on Tucker Carlson’s show earlier this week to talk about the tens of thousands of Central Americans coming across our southern border without authorization every month and being released into the U.S.A. Nielsen emitted billowing clouds of hot air. On compulsory E-Verify for employers: Clip : Carlson: “How about this: Why wouldn’t your agency write an executive order, present it to the President, have him sign it, and do it tomorrow?” Nielsen: “Everything is on the table. We’ll do everything we can within our authorities ( sic ).”
[embedded content] Carlson got the same answer on the birthright citizenship executive order the President offered us before last November’s elections. [ Clip : Nielsen: “Y’know, Tucker, I think the President’s been clear: All of that is on the table.”] E-Verify , birthright citizenship, visa tracking , stop remittances (or at least tax them), …“All of that is on the table .” And that’s where it sits—on the table, turning brown and curling up at the edges like last week’s sandwich. On the table. Madame Secretary, with respect: “On the table” butters no parsnips. Americans are not impressed by things lying uselessly “on the table.” We want action —clear, decisive action, like your directive the other day to import 30,000 foreigners to do seasonal work—but we want action for American workers, for American sovereignty, for a demographically stable nation to bequeath to our grandchildren. When shall we see that clear, decisive action, Madame Secretary? Mr. President? But note that immigration patriots are at least getting rhetoric from Trump—more than they would have gotten from any random Bush. I am under orders not to repeat that We Are Doomed too often on VDARE.com. And there is a Big Picture development that transcends Trump trivia. What actually divides our two main parties? We know of course that Republicans are the Stupid Party while Democrats are the Evil Party; but what are the substantive issues that really separate them? This has of course varied across historical time. The Republican Party started out sectionalist, as the anti-South Party. They’d prefer me to say “anti-slavery,” and to be sure abolitionists had a home in the early party; but so did Free Soil advocates, who just didn’t want slavery expanded into new territories but many of whom were indifferent to slavery as a moral issue. The impression you get from contemporary sources is that most pre-Civil War Republican Party voters wanted blacks to stay in the South, preferably but not necessarily as free citizens; or else be shipped off to black colonies in Africa or the Caribbean. If a Donald Trump had shown up in 1860 promising to build a wall around the slave states, I bet he’d have won in a landslide. After the Civil War the GOP coasted along for a while as the Party of Victory in that war, then morphed across the turn of the 20th century into the party of capitalism, most especially of the small businessman and his beloved tariffs, while the Democrats drifted leftwards into progressive social reform. The sectionalist stamp was still strong, though, with Democrats solid in the old Confederacy down to the 1960s. With the great expansion of higher education and knowledge work after WW2, meritocratic elitism began to rise, bearing aloft the standard of essentialist egalitarianism, most especially of race and sex denialism. This “ New Class ” easily took over the Democratic Party. Its rise stirred a reaction, though: Richard Nixon’s “Silent Majority,” Donald Warren’s “ Middle American Radicals .” The old South, where meritocratic elites were thinner on the ground and race realism was strong, swung Republican. This was a new kind of sectionalism, the beginnings of what I call the Cold Civil War. The sectionalist line no longer cuts cleanly across the nation: it now separates one county from the next, one city district from the next. It cuts through neighborhoods and streets, even through individual families. That’s the history of the two big parties in a nutshell—familiar to all of us, I think. OK, but what’s the key defining issue today? What, more than anything else, separates the two parties? Immigration, that’s what. Back in February, during the congressional fight over funding for Trump’s wall, I went to NumbersUSA and looked up the immigration score cards on all the members of the House Appropriations Committee with a voting record. I tweeted out the result . Executive summary: The 23 Republican members had a spread of ratings, from two members rated A down to one rated F-minus. The median rating for Republicans was B-minus. Of the 29 Democratic members, one was rated D and two were rated F. The other 26 were all, every one of them , rated F-minus. B-minus is not actually very impressive from an immigration-patriot point of view. There’s considerable squishiness over immigration on the Republican side, due of course to big-money business donors looking to imported workers to keep wages down. But the striking thing is the near-total absence of squishiness among the Democrats. F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, F-minus, … These guys are rock-solid. It’s the defining issue between the parties in our age. We may as well call them the “Immigration Control Party” and the “Open Borders Party.” It’s a tectonic shift that seems to be happening regardless of what the Trump Administration is actually doing. Finally some good news: Down in the antipodes, ripples from the March 15th mosque massacres in New Zealand continue to spread out. Brenton Tarrant, who committed those massacres, is actually an Australian; so the event generated even more interest in Australia than it would have anyway. That interest has brought forth a hero: Sixty-nine-year-old Fraser Anning, who has a seat in the 76-member Australian Senate.
ORDER IT NOW Senator Anning is … I think the word is “colorful.” He is plain-spoken and straightforward in what we used to consider a classically Australian style, although in recent decades the loathsome turbid waters of Political Correctness and feminized sensitivity have risen and drowned much of the cultural landscape Down Under. Anning is culturally conservative: hates homosexuality and abortion, opposes multiculturalism, and—you may want to position yourself near the fainting couch for this one—in his maiden speech to the Senate last year, called for a referendum on re-introducing the White Australia policy that his country practiced up to the 1970s . That policy limited permanent settlement of immigrants to white people. Senator Anning responded to the New Zealand killings by saying As always, left-wing politicians and the media will rush to claim that the causes of today’s shootings lie with gun laws or those who hold nationalist views but this is all cliched nonsense. The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place. Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. Lawmaker hit by ‘Egg Boy’ censured for blaming New Zealand mosque shootings on Muslims, by Emily Jacobs, New York Post, April 3, 2019 That had them reaching for the smelling salts from Brisbane to Perth, from Bunda to Wagga Wagga , from Kalgoorlie to Kookaburra Springs . There were condemnations, a motion of censure in the Senate, and a petition to remove Fraser Anning from the Senate (although there is apparently no constitutional way to do that). One young chap was so incensed he snuck up behind the Senator in public and broke an egg over his head. Senator Anning span round deftly and bopped his assailant very accurately on the jaw, twice.
[embedded content] Nothing abashed, this week Senator Anning registered a new party, Fraser Anning’s Conservative National Party . He also published a spirited open letter to the Australian Prime Minister—you can read it at the Occidental Observer , on Facebook, or at Australia’s Pickering Post —defiantly asserting his objections to mass Muslim immigration: It is a matter of causation, not moral blame, that until recently we were largely immune to this problem because until the 1970s Western populations were, for the most part, ethnically, culturally and religiously homogenous. I believe that these changes were initiated by governments, not requested by the people, who generally wished to retain their way of life, as did others around the world. The Japanese people have no wish to bring in millions of Vietnamese and grant them citizenship. The Chinese don’t want to be swamped with Indians. No people wish for this. We didn’t vote for it and we weren’t asked. You can take issue with Senator Anning’s bluntness, and even with his arguments. I, for example, would take issue with his saying that Australians didn’t vote for mass immigration and weren’t asked. It is true that in Australia, as here and in Britain, all the big old political parties, with various degrees of honesty, promoted mass Third World immigration. It’s also true that there are difficult institutional barriers to getting a new party established. Still, no-one has to vote for the established parties. I was about to add: “indeed, no-one has to vote at all …” Then I remembered that Australia does in fact have mandatory voting , with a $20 fine if you fail to vote—not a bad idea, in my opinion. [ How Compulsory Voting Works: Australians Explain , by Tacey Rychter, NYT, October 22, 2018] Still, there must have been minor parties people could vote for that didn’t push mass immigration. Or voters could have staged a strike—a voter strike! Yet Aussies—like Americans and Brits—went on voting for the major parties. In that default sense, contra Senator Anning, we did wish for it; we did vote for it. But see what I’m doing there: I’m arguing back, as cogently as space and my abilities permit, against Fraser Anning’s points, which he has very cogently expressed. That’s what’s supposed to happen in a free, self-governing society. We make our points and argue them in public. The one who persuades the most listeners advances to the next round. Australia’s elites are having none of that! They are laboring mightily to silence Senator Anning, just as their counterparts here are laboring to silence dissident voices like ours here at VDARE.com. Further quote from Senator Anning’s open letter: In order to lock-in permanent mass immigration, you multicultural elitists have annihilated the bedrock principle of Free Speech from our society. This is the foundational principle on which our system of democracy is built. That was the point where I stood up and cheered. Strength to your arm, Senator—and to your pen.

"Leaving the EU Has Already Left Britain Crippled for Good, by Patrick Cockburn",www.therussophile.org,Patrick Cockburn,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/leaving-the-eu-has-already-left-britain-crippled-for-good-by-patrick-cockburn.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Future historians will look back at Britain in the age of Brexit and seek to explain why its people reduced their power and influence in the world in the belief that they were doing the exact opposite. But historians will have to move quickly if they are to have a say because the most important consequences of Brexit are already with us. People do not see this because UK membership of the EU is wrongly discussed as an economic issue when it is primarily a political one. This is a traditional mistake by the British who have been making it with varying degrees of intensity ever since the French politician Robert Schumann put forward his plan for the French-German Coal and Steel Community on 9 May 1950 – a pact that eventually turned into the EU. Enhancing the political power of European states, particularly France and Germany, was always the chief objective. The misperception has meant that the outcome of the Brexit crisis is talked about with alarm or enthusiasm, depending on the views of the speaker, but generally on the supposition on all sides that this is something good or bad that lies in the future. There is ceaseless discussion about custom unions and single markets which masks the devastating loss of UK power and influence that has already occurred in three crucial areas. There is greater political division in Britain than at any time since the 17th century and this is not going to go away. Even if parliament is finally forced to swallow Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement at least half the population is going to feel that they have been betrayed or, at best, are the victims of an act of self-destructive idiocy. Theresa May has systematically made these divisions deeper by pretending that there was national unanimity about the referendum decision. Secondly, the UK as a state is more divided than it has been since the Scottish Act of Union in 1707. Scottish nationalists and Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland – half the population – are strengthened because Scottish independence and Irish unity can be presented as a jump into the future with the EU rather than staying put with a regressive and xenophobic England. Through resurrecting Irish partition as an issue, Britain will be permanently at odds with the Irish government, something which might not have mattered much in the past, but does now when Ireland is empowered by the rest of the EU. Angela Merkel was in Dublin this week telling Leo Varadkar that Germany would “stand by Ireland” and earlier the Irish taoiseach was seeing Emmanuel Macron in Paris. This used not to happen. The third area in which the balance of power has swung against the UK over the last three years is that, as Britain becomes more divided, the EU becomes more unified. This was not inevitable: remember how there was talk in 2016 of the EU shedding more members and possibly even breaking up. Having seen what is happening to Britain, dissident members of the EU are these days keeping secessionist thoughts very much to themselves. Evidence of the swing in the balance of power away from Britain has become more apparent over the course of the Brexit negotiations. Retreat on one side and advance on the other was the inevitable consequence of Brussels having much the strongest hand of cards. Nothing is more absurd, and a sign of a frightening detachment from reality, than the claim of prominent Eurosceptics that Britain would have got what it wanted in negotiations if only it had been firmer, something it failed to do because the British negotiators were weak-willed, incompetent or treacherously sabotaging their own side. At one level, the explanation for the crisis gripping Britain is not a mystery: globalisation has produced political crises all over the world which differ in some respects but have certain common themes such as de-industrialisation, increased inequality, immigration, and the alienation of large parts of the population. There are obvious parallels between Trump supporters in Pennsylvania and Leave voters in the Labour strongholds in the Welsh Valleys. The same pressures were long visible in the Middle East where kleptocratic elites clustered around authoritarian rulers and their families, leaving the rest of the population to rot. But this does not tell us why it is that the political crisis in the UK looks worse than elsewhere in Europe. Unsurprisingly, the historically minded have sought guidance from past precedent and, more particularly, from crises that revolved around the UK’s relations with continental Europe and, equally important, those that threatened the integrity of the UK itself. Jacob Rees-Mogg caused some hilarity by plunging deep into the Middle Ages for an analogy, pillorying May’s withdrawal agreement as a sell-out by claiming that it was “the greatest vassalage since King John paid homage to Phillip II at Le Goulet in 1200”. Academic historians immediately pounced to call his history wrong, but there was nothing wrong with taking the longer view. One could even go back a further 800 years and look at Roman Britain’s departure from the empire at the start of the fifth century. The circumstances are murky and ill-recorded, but there is evidence that the Romans did not pull out unilaterally but were encouraged to go by the local inhabitants. According to the sixth century historian Zosimus, quoted in The Anglo-Saxon World by Nicholas J Higham and Martin J Ryan, they were reduced “to such straits that they revolted from the empire, no longer submitted to Roman law, and reverted to their native customs. The Britons, therefore, armed themselves and ran many risks to ensure their own safety and free their own cities from attacking barbarians.” This early example of Brexit did not end happily, though it would be interesting to imagine some Romano-British version of Liam Fox trotting off to sign trade deals with the Angles, Saxons and Jutes on behalf of “global Britannia”.
ORDER IT NOW A constituency has always existed in Britain open to the idea that continental entanglements are a costly waste of money and are undertaken with the complicity of simple-minded or corrupt British politicians. Jonathan Swift wrote a devastating pamphlet, The Conduct of the Allies , making such charges three hundred years ago that would not look out of place in Leave campaign literature. Britain has traditionally tried to avoid having a crisis in relations with continental Europe powers at the same time as a crisis threatening the unity of the UK. But Brexit was guaranteed to produce both simultaneously. Eurosceptics denigrate the EU as a leviathan and then seem shocked when it behaves like one. “Splendid isolation” was a dangerous idea for Britain even when it was at the height of its power at the end of the 19th century and looks like an even worse one today. Even so, Leavers are blithely confident that it does not much matter that Britain is now more isolated in Europe than at any time since the five-year period before Napoleon marched on Moscow in 1812. The failure of historians to find a convincing parallel between events in Britain’s past and the Brexit crisis may have a simple explanation: never before has the nation embarked on a project likely to make it poorer, weaker and less able to control its own future.

April 5, 2019 America Needs ‘Blue Flag Laws’ To Remove Traitors From Power After The Highest Levels Of The Obama Administration Sold Out The American People In Treasonous ‘Witch Hunt’
By John C. Velisek – US Navy, Retired – All News Pipeline
Once the Mueller report analysis came out, the progressive socialists almost had whiplash changing the statements they have made over the past two years about Russian collusion. So far, they have ignored the results, calling Attorney General Barr a bought and paid for Russian stooge. Some have actually called Mueller, their God of the past two years, bought and paid for. They speculate on what President Trump has done to force Mueller to write what he did. I would think as rational people they would wait to receive the Mueller report and see what is in it.
They talk of the laws that President Trump has broken. Joel Mathis, a partisan sycophant who writes for The Week, even goes so far as to tell us that we don’t have to take his word for it that we can go to the New York Times. Really? The New York Times? The premier liars throughout the Russian collusion? The moral superiority that the New York Times pushes forward is a mockery of the morality and honesty that the citizens of this country deserve. Now that the Russian collusion hoax is finally put to bed, it is time to look at how and why this happened and who did this. Let’s take a look at the unmasking done by the members of the Obama administration. It is already known that regulations that Obama passed just before leaving office slackened rules for unmasking and who that information could be given to. It was still illegal to pass this information on to the media, The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, and the New York Times all received classified information that they then used in their attempt to damage President Trump.
The laws in place to protect Americans from the spying of the government were ignored. Samantha Power, who was the UN Ambassador, unmasked over 200 Americans that she then tried to blame on someone using her name. It has never been explained why the UN Ambassador needs to unmask anyone. She has no right to persue the information through spying channels of American citizens.
(If you appreciate stories like this, please consider donating to ANP to help keep us in this battle for the future of America .)
Something else that needs to be looked into is the money laundering through the DNC into the Clinton campaign. $84 million was illegally transferred to the Clinton campaign and even though a complaint was sent to the Federal Election Commission, nothing has been done.
The President’s power under the Immigration and Nationality act allowed the travel ban that the President placed on countries whoe vetting process for immigrants did not meet the standards. The Department of Justice even went so fat as to issue an opinion calling the travel moratorium legal and proper. But acting attorney general Sally Yates, appointed by Obama, issued orders to ignore the executive order.
The railroading of Lt. General Flynn also deserves a look. In his first informal and routine meeting with the FBI, he spoke of the conversations that he had with the Russian ambassador in a totally legal manner as part of the incoming administration. Even the FBI did not believe he was lying.
By threatening Lt, Gen Flynn’s son and financially ruining a man with a 33 year career of serving our country honorably, the Mueller Special Council forced Flynn to admit to “ Lying ” rather than understanding no one can accurately remember everything said months before. This was accomplished through a classified leak of Lt. General Flynn’s discussion with the Russian ambassador in violation of law. The discussion between Flynn and the Russian Ambassador were leaked to the Washington Post.
More leaks about President Trump’s conversation with the Russian Foreign minister and President Trump’s conversation with Austrailian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto also occurred. Leaked within hours, these leaks curtail the President from speaking honestly. It also curtails the conversations that foreign leaders will have with the President.
E mails from President Trump transition team were taken by the Special Coucil without a warrant and without any consideration to executive privilege. This is actually covered by the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 which prevents such searches and seizures.
Rod Rosenstein also needs to be asked why he installed himself as the overseer of the Special Council when it was Rosenstein who wrote the memo to President Trump to fire FBI Director James Comey. Of course, being in charge of the investigation could shield any liability that could come his way for his part in the Comey firing. Rosenstein also needs to explain why he thought it was legal to threaten congressional staffers for doing their job.
Threatening to investigate them and to subpoena their records and emails was in violation of the law and nothing more than to get them to stop requesting answers in writing to questions they sent to him in writing. It is clear Rosenstein did not want to leave a paper trail that may illuminate his actions taken for his Deep State cronies. Rosenstein has displayed his contempt of both the President and Congress.
The raid on Michael Cohen’s office was never adequately explained. The lawyer/client privilege earmarked in the Sixth Amendment was ignored and the reason for the warrant has never been known. Even though the media nods in unison to say the raid was well founded, none of them can explain why.
There is more, but it is clear that databases have been used for partisan political purposes. The rule of law has broken down within our intelligence services, and have been continually misused to “ get Trump ”. Those that are in the highest level of the FBI, the CIA, and the DOJ have flaunted the rule of law to the detriment of our country and our people.
It is time to “ Drain the Swamp ”. And now that the Mueller investigation is over, it is time to fight back and get to the bottom of the lawlessness that has transpired.

“We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and dejected with a lost opportunity.”
– Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., “Beyond Vietnam.” Riverside Church, April 4, 1967
Dear Chelsea, – Advertisement –
Do not lose heart, for as a prisoner of conscience, your inspirational witness sustains so many of your less free brothers and sisters on the outside. Our hearts and hands reach out to you with love and thanksgiving. Your courage is contagious, or so I hope, for it resonates in the soul of every person who senses the meaning of the power of individual conscience to oppose state violence and the beauty of those who will not betray a comrade, who will not deliver the Judas kiss demanded by the killers, as you will not betray your brave brother, Julian Assange, also held under lock and key for the “crime” of revealing the truth.
You remind me of another young woman from long ago and far away whose bravery in the face of radical evil is celebrated today as a sign of hope in dark times. She is Sophie Scholl, the young German college student who, like you, was arrested for releasing documents exposing state atrocities, who, like you, was prompted by a higher power, by her conscience, who, like you, was arrested for releasing documents exposing such crimes against humanity, in her case those of Hitler.
Little seems to change over the years, doesn’t it? The killers go on killing, from Golgotha in ancient Jerusalem to Hitler’s Germany to Vietnam and Iraq and on to Palestine and Syria today. Why bother with the list. History is a litany of bloodbaths. Where does it all go, this blood? Does the good earth soak it up? – Advertisement –
But in all the darkness, certain lonely voices of resistance have kept the lighted chain of faith alive. You stand in that line, a living embodiment of a faithful non-violent warrior. So does Julian.
I am writing this epistle to you on 4 April, the day in 1967 that our brother Dr. Martin Luther King stood tall in the pulpit of Riverside Church in New York City and followed his conscience by breaking with those who urged him to ignore the truth eating at his soul. The truth that he must not remain silent about the U.S. obscene war against Vietnam. “A time comes when silence is betrayal,” he said. Then he added:
“The truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government’s policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one’s own bosom and in the surrounding world” This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation’s self-defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation, for those it calls “enemy,” for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers”. A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand, we are called to play the Good Samaritan on life’s roadside, but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life’s highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring”. When I speak of love, I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am not speaking of that force which is just emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-Muslim-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John: “Let us love one another (Yes), for love is God. (Yes) And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. . . . If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us.” Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day.”
Chelsea, you have heeded Dr. King’s message and you have put to shame those of us who profess faith in “the living God” that informed Martin’s call for a non-violent revolution.
You, like Sophie and Julian, have released documents that tell the truth about the savage actions of our government.
You have suffered for us many times over. You have stood strong and tall, like Jesus in front of Pilate, and you have shown the road we must all travel out of the darkness that threatens to consume us. – Advertisement –
You have shown us by your actions “that silence is betrayal” when it comes to one’s government’s immoral and illegal actions.
And you have shown us by your sacred silence in Caesar’s court that is a U.S. grand jury, that your conscience will never allow you to betray another truth-teller.
You are, Chelsea, the embodiment of faith, hope, and courage."

Deformed face of Lady Liberty
On Friday, in its latest move against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro “official” Washington put sanctions on companies, its heads and 35 tankers delivering oil to Cuba.
Looking at the names-none recognized here-it appears Washington is getting desperate with its schemes to bring down Maduro. – Advertisement –
Though we continue to hear the likes of idiot Senator Marco Rubio intoning the all too familiar “all options are on the table”, aka a US military operation into Venezuela, even he concedes the Venezuelan army and a majority of the people continue their support of Maduro, not Juan Guaido, the self appointed interim president of Venezuela the US and its lackeys recognize.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear he doesn’t support US actions against Maduro, as does China, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Iran ,South Africa, North Korea and notably NATO members Turkey and Italy all countries the US has sanctioned, threatened or provoked-Turkey accepting Russian made S-400 ABM’s and Italy signing on to China’s BRI, Belt and Road Initiative, which the US condemns as Chinese overreach.
But the key country against US depredations in Venezuela is Russia. – Advertisement –
Russia doesn’t have a huge military contingent in Venezuela, some 100 military personnel-reportedly-advisers and a couple of military transports that recently sent material and cargo over the last two weeks.
We continually hear Trump and his coterie of officials barking they want Russia out of the country yet it appears Russia isn’t going anywhere, bringing a stalemate to US intentions for regime change.
The world is watching.
Any US led or supported military, mercenary operation against Venezuela will be seen as outright aggression against a sovereign country, the worst form of aggression cited in the UN Charter which the US is a signatory. It would be a war crime.
Initiating coups, assassinations, regime change operations against any government the US opposes, many that were legitimately elected, exposes Washington as the sinister empire that it is.
Certainly not a supporter of “freedom and democracy”, a falsehood that masks its real intentions. – Advertisement –
Though the propaganda of America’s “goodness” in the world continues to be spewed by Washington’s unofficial mouthpiece, its complicit enabling corporate MSM, more and more American people recognize they’ve been sold a rotten bill of goods-though other than some protest demonstrations have yet to rebel in significant numbers.
As this author candidly admits it may be wishful thinking Venezuela could be Washington’s last gasp attempt at regime change where the world finally steps up and says enough. Washington’s depredations against Venezuela are so bald faced, out in the open, they’re unmistakably aggression, against international law.
More and more voices are heard in Europe, one of the latest was a German MP who said, “70 year old NATO should retire [1] , as he lambasted the organization for conducting aggressive wars."
Mitch McConnell is destroying the Senate — and American government,www.therussophile.org,Robert B. Reich,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/mitch-mcconnell-is-destroying-the-senate-and-american-government.html/,"From The Guardian – Advertisement –
The majority leader cares only for winning, not rules or democracy itself. He is doing more damage than Trump
No person has done more in living memory to undermine the functioning of the US government than the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. – Advertisement –
Yes, Donald Trump has debased and defiled the presidency. He has launched blistering attacks on Democrats, on judges he disagrees with, journalists who criticize him and the intelligence community.
But McConnell is actively and willfully destroying the Senate.
Last Wednesday he used his Republican majority to cut the time for debating Trump’s court appointees from 30 hours to two , thereby enabling Republicans to ram through even more Trump judges. – Advertisement –
McConnell doesn’t give a fig about the Senate, or about democracy. He cares only about winning. On the eve of the 2010 midterm elections he famously declared that his top priority was for Barack Obama “ to be a one-term president .”
Between 2009 and 2013 , McConnell’s Senate Republicans blocked 79 Obama nominees. In the entire history of the United States until that point, only 68 presidential nominees had been blocked.
This unprecedented use of the filibuster finally led Senate Democrats in 2013 to change the rules on some presidential nominees (but not the supreme court), to require simple majorities.
In response, McConnell fumed that “breaking the rules to change the rules is un-American.” If so, McConnell is about as un-American as they come. Once back in control of the Senate he buried Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland for the supreme court by refusing even to hold hearings.
Then, in 2017, McConnell and his Republicans changed the rules again , ending the use of the filibuster even for supreme court nominees and clearing the way for Senate confirmation of Trump’s Neil Gorsuch.
Step by step, McConnell has sacrificed the Senate as an institution to partisan political victories. – Advertisement –
There is a vast difference between winning at politics by playing according to the norms of our democracy, and winning by subverting those norms.
To Abraham Lincoln, democracy was a covenant linking past and future. Political institutions, in his view, were “ the legacy bequeathed to us .”
On the eve of the Senate’s final vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act in July 2017, the late John McCain returned to Washington from his home in Arizona, where he was being treated for brain cancer, to cast the deciding vote against repeal.
Knowing he would be criticized by other Republicans , McCain noted that over his career he had known senators who seriously disagreed with each other but nonetheless knew “they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively.”
In words that have even greater relevance today, McCain added that “it is our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do something less satisfying than ‘winning.'”
Political success should never be measured solely by partisan victories. It must also be judged by the institutional legacy passed onward. The purpose of political leadership is not merely to win. It is to serve.
In any social or political system it’s always possible to extract benefits by being among the first to break widely accepted norms. In a small town where people don’t lock their doors or windows, the first thief can effortlessly get into anyone’s house. But once broken, the system is never the same. Everyone has to buy locks. Trust deteriorates.
Those, like Mitch McConnell, who break institutional norms for selfish or partisan gains are bequeathing future generations a weakened democracy.
The difference between winning at politics by playing according to the norms and rules of our democracy, and winning by subverting them, could not be greater. Political victories that undermine the integrity of our system are net losses for society.
Great athletes play by the rules because the rules make the game. Unprincipled athletes cheat or change the rules in order to win. Their victories ultimately destroy the game.
In terms of shaping the federal courts, McConnell has played “the long game,” which, incidentally, is the title of his 2016 memoir . Decades from now, McConnell will still be shaping the nation through judges he rammed through the Senate.
But McConnell’s long game is destroying what was once known as the world’s greatest deliberative body.
He is longest-serving leader of Senate Republicans in history but Mitch McConnell is no leader. He is the epitome of unprincipled power. History will not treat him kindly.

How Would China Benefit from Acquiring the Russian Su-57 ?,www.therussophile.org,Paul Antonopoulos,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/how-would-china-benefit-from-acquiring-the-russian-su-57.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
BEIJING – Over the next two years, China will consider buying fifth-generation Su-57 Russian fighters. The Military Watch Magazine explains what the strategic benefits that China could derive from this agreement.
As the issue indicates, the China Air Force already has fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 fighters, which have been in service since 2017 and are currently produced in series. The newest Russian fighter has not yet entered series production, but is already testing some sixth generation systems.
It is believed that the J-20 is superior to the Su-57 because of its low visibility. At the same time, Russian hunting was built using technologies lacking the Chinese analogue. These are modern motors with controlled vector thrust, long-range missiles and a system of countermeasures controlled against infrared means, which allows the “blinding” of enemy missiles. – Advertisement –
In addition to acquiring new technologies, the purchase of Su-57 could bring strategic benefits to China. If China makes this request, it is likely to accelerate the production program of Russian fifth generation aircraft, and reduce its cost (due to mass production), Military Watch Magazine writes. The acquisition of the Su-57 by China would also make it more attractive to other potential customers, such as India.
The increase in the number of orders would not only increase investment in research and development in the aviation sector, but would also further stimulate Su-57’s production program.
This could lead to the massive deployment of Russian fifth generation fighters by the mid-2020s, which would force Western countries to move some of their brand new aircraft from the Pacific region to Europe, which is in China’s interest.
In the publication it is said that, given Russia’s willingness to export Su-57, the acceleration of the production program would also make it possible to arm other countries with fifth-generation aircraft. It is believed that the Russian aircraft is superior to its western counterparts, so its acquisition by third countries would create additional problems for China’s competitors.

On 4th of April 2019 NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) “celebrated” the 70 th Anniversary of its murderous existence. This horror organization was born sort of as a “Rosemary’s Baby”, signed into life in Washington DC, as the North Atlantic Treaty. Its creation was absolutely unethical but also absolutely “legal”– meaning what we, the west, have made the law, a man-made law for war, was applied by the Washington-Pentagon driven NATO. Estimates have it, that NATO and its ‘allies’, cronies, proxies and mercenaries killed more than 20 million people since NATO’s existence, basically since the end of WWII. Compare this with about 70 to 80 million killed in WWII. – The 70 years of NATO are considered “Peace Time”– were they really a period of Peace?
This is a call on all NATO members to exit NATO – to opt for Peace and to exit NATO! To stop fighting wars – to liberate yourselves from the shackles of NATO.
Was the artificially and under totally false pretenses, as we know today, Cold War, which started immediately after WWII and lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 – a period of Peace? – Or was it rather a period of constant intimidation for war, a period of armament of the west, a period of maximizing profits for the mainly US military industrial complex – a period, to destroy any chance the Soviet Union may have had to economically advance, as the arms race made it impossible for the USSR, the country that won WII, to concentrate on economic development at home after having lost 25 million lives and her basic production infrastructure.
And yes, it was the Soviet Union – not the “allies” (US, UK, and France) that liberated the world at the time from the German Nazi dominance. And yes, western history books tell you a different story. Western history books are never to be trusted.
The entirely Pentagon-run NATO has today 29 member countries (see NATO member states ), 26 of which are in Europe, and one, Turkey, in Eurasia. Plus, there are a number of “associated” or wannabe members, like Ukraine, Israel – and in recent months, would you believe! – Colombia in South America joined NATO through a so-called “Cooperation Agreement”, dating back to 2013 – and Brazil is perhaps the next candidate. The US want to control again their “backyard”, by applying again their Monroe Doctrine (no foreign power, other than the US, in Latin America) except, that the backyard has learned its lesson.
While Venezuela and her hydrocarbon and other mineral riches is the main target right now for NATO’s presence in Colombia and perhaps soon in Brazil, the most democratically elected government in the western world, is not just buckling under, as Washington is used to from the past. No. Venezuela has a solid strategic, economic – and MILITARY alliance with Russia and China. Despite all the infamous Trump-Pompeo-Bolton saber-rattling, its Russia and China who are drawing the red line. So much for the Monroe Doctrine. Times ar’a changing .
The US/NATO – all ruled by the Pentagon – have about 800 – and according to some estimates more than 1,000 military bases in about 100 countries. Not all are known to the public. The funds used to arm and maintain the bases are your tax-payer’s moneys. While producing weapons for the NATO killing bulldozer, these moneys are not available for much needed, education and health care, let alone basic infrastructure in poor countries, precisely those countries that are being colonized by the US / NATO military bases.
It has, of course, never been a priority for the western elite – those financial-military-petrol and lie-propaganda giants – that dark shady neofascist state that pretends to manipulates the rest of the world, to care for people’s health, and, of course even less so, for people’s education. Educated people are dangerous for these nefarious lecherous, greedy kingpins.
Take note! People around the world, your education is not wanted. Instead the money – YOUR MONEY – your government is supposed spend to give you a decent education so you can earn a decent living and understand the ropes of this ever more complex globe – these funds – YOUR FUNDS – are spent for arming to the teeth the NATO bases, to colonize you and your countries, to enslave you to a One World Order under a western dollar dominated financial hegemony.
They have already all the instruments in place, IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO); they are subordinates to NATO. Get out of them too. They are the “elite’s” (for lack of a better term) tool to suffocate you with debt – so you will be at their mercy and sell them your resources for a pittance. Create your own economy, outside of the realm of GLOBALIZATION, of globalized neoliberalism, bordering already today on neofascism. Get out of NATO – and the rest will follow.
Because that’s what Europe has become: A US-NATO-Pentagon colony. European Nations – you think since you are a member of NATO, you have a say in NATO decisions? – Better think again. You know, you have no say in NATO. It couldn’t be more obvious that the Pentagon is calling the shots. Trump and his minions, on behalf of the Pentagon and, of course, on behalf of the military industrial oligarchs, is threatening you – you European members, better pay up to NATO, or else … Whatever “else” means, it’s supposed to scare you. You know, you leaders (sic) of so-called EU members, you have been coopted to obey. Your non-elected European Commission (EC) that calls the shots on European legislation – yes, not the EU Parliament – has also been bought by Washington. The EU is nothing but a puppet of Washington and run by NATO.
But, then, what can you expect, the European Union was never an idea of Europeans. It was an idea born by the CIA already during WWII – then transplanted to some “willing” Europeans, with the promise of NATO protection from the evil Soviets. And, bingo, the red scare did it. It was the US Senator Joseph McCarthyera. The Red Scare . And today, we live in the entire wester era Russia Scare , then the China Scare , scares no-end – they keep NATO in place – keep NATO in Europe and gradually moving around the world – South China Sea, Latin America; the scares keep NATO ravaging and killing millions around the globe.
All the while – there is a real danger of a nuclear war – People, wake up! The Masters of WAR, NATO, are just waiting for the moment to provoke that infamous Red Button. People of this Universe, don’t you realize – if that happens, we are all doomed; mankind is doomed. Mother Earth may recover, but humans self-destruct.
People! Before that happens, kill the killing machine; kill NATO in its roots. Exit NATO! Contribute no penny anymore to the NATO budget. Withdraw from NATO, get out of NATO. Kick NATO out of your sovereign countries. Regain your NATO-stolen sovereignty. – And you will see the feeling of Peace enhances your wellbeing, while the constant fear of war destroys your soul.
Getting out of NATO is actually easy, it’s also legally possible. As per Article 13 of the NATO charter, all of you members are eligible to exit NATO and to opt for PEACE:
There most likely may be multiple attempts to coopt (buy) your leaders again, under the false pretenses of security. Don’t fall for it. There is no danger from the “East”. In fact, neither Russia or China have an expansionist history. They have a different philosophy. They are seeking a multipolar world, by connecting to what is most logical – the so-called European Continent, which is geographically just the western most part of the huge contiguous Continent of Eurasia, even including the Middle East. Trading with friendly nations within this huge land mass is not only logical, it had been done in the past for thousands of years.
Chinese President Xi Jinping , six years ago, launched the so-called Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also called the New Silk Road, connecting the world with transport, industrial cultural, learning and research infrastructure; the largest and most brilliant all-inclusive economic development project of known human history. It aims at connecting people, not separating them. It aims at equality and justice, including those left behind, for a world of Peace. As a Chinese delegate to an international conference recently said – we are building bridges to connect people, while the west is building walls.
It’s time for a new era of Peace. Seventy years of NATO, of killing for dominance and greed – is passé. Stop NATO. Exit NATO. Abolish NATO.

End-of-conference pro-life march at the World Congress of Families event in Verona, Italy, at the end of March 2019
Several tens of thousands of people have marched in support of the ultra-conservative World Congress of Families on Sunday, on the final day of their conference in northern Italy.Participants in the city of Verona carried pink and blue balloons and placards with slogans such as “Yes to life, not to abortion”, an AFP correspondent saw.
Supporters travelled by train and coach from all over Italy to attend the march , which came a day after protesters staged their own demonstration denouncing the organisation’s anti-abortion, anti-gay stance.
Before the march started at around midday, those gathered listened to a message from the organisers of the Congress. “The family, fundamental pillar of our society, must be at the centre of government policies,” they said in their closing statement.

Some marchers carried tiny rubber models that were handed out during the conference, which were intended to represent a 10-week old foetus. They came with the message: “Abortion stops a beating heart.”
The three-day conference attracted senior political figures from the far-right including Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and two other government ministers .
Don’t touch abortion law: Salvini
The event also revealed divisions in the ruling coalition of Salvini’s League party and the anti-Establishment Five Star Movement. But Salvini’s coalition partner Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, denounced the World Congress of Families as a gathering of “fanatics”.
“The vision defended by this Congress in Verona is a vision of the world that belongs for the most part to the Middle Ages, which considers women as submissive,” said De Maio.
Salvini, while backing the Congress’s vision of a family as one composed of “a father and a mother”, rejected calls by some participants to abolish Italy’s laws. “You don’t touch the 194 law,” said Salvini, referring to the 1978 legislation that legalised abortion . “There’s no debate either on abortion, or on marriage. Everyone makes love with whoever they want, and dines with whoever they want,” he added.Italy legalised civil unions between people of the same sex in 2016. Salvini has however spoken out against gay couples being allowed to adopt.
Founded in 1997 by the American Brian Brown, the World Congress of Families has held an annual meeting since 2012 . Its credo, as stated on its website, is to “affirm, celebrate, and defend the natural family as the only fundamental and sustainable unit of society”.
Previous meetings include one in Hungary, which enjoyed the patronage of the country’s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban. As well as Salvini, other speakers at this year’s event include the President of Moldova Igor Dodon — a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Hungary’s ultra-conservative Families Minister Katalin Novak and a senior figure in the Russian Orthodox Church, Dmitri Smirnov, were also listed as speakers. And two other Italian ministers were listed as speakers at the Congress: Lorenzo Fontana, Minister for Families and Disabilities and Education Minister Marco Busetti. Comment: A US-founded, Russian-friendly, normal conference addressing concerns of the silent majority, the naturally conservative populations ruled by secular elites. This is the best of the West.
CNN’s report on it called it a “conference of hate” and reminded its ultra-liberal audience that it took place in a city that was “home to one of the headquarters of German Intelligence during the Nazi occupation and in the 1970s, a far-right [NATO] terrorist network.”
The UK’s Independent focused on the negatives by labeling it an “anti-LGBT+ and anti-abortion conference,” and suggesting that its real crime was providing a venue for discussing positive solutions to reversing the West’s declining birth rates.
