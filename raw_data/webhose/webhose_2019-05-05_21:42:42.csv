Migrant Crime Nolte: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Melts Down over Criticism of Fake Accent Spencer Platt/Getty Images JOHN NOLTE 6 Apr 2019 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) responded to criticism for her patronizing use of a fake accent in front of a black audience in the usual manner — crybabying. The not-terribly-bright socialist was caught on video Friday patronizing the mostly black audience with a fake southern drawl at Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network conference.
The humiliating video quickly made the rounds on social media, earning the criticism and ridicule it deserved.
The video is as shocking as it is excruciating. All of a sudden, the Westchester socialist, who is famous for her Jerry the Mouse voice, starts talking like a black preacher.
“This is what organizing looks like. This is what building power looks like,” Ocasio-Crazy said with her affected cadence. “This is what changing the country looks like. It’s when we choose to show up and occupy the room and talk about the things that matter most, talking about our future.”
“Ain’t nothing wrong with that. There’s nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy,” she continued. “There is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors will eat. There is nothing wrong with driving the buses that take your family to work”:
The moment is reminiscent of two-time presidential loser Hillary “Hot Sauce” Clinton’s similar attempt to condescend to a predominantly black audience with her “Ain’t No Ways Tired” remarks in 2007:
And let’s not forget then-Vice President Joe “The Hair Sniffer” Biden warning a black audience that Mitt Romney’s going “to put y’all back in chains”:
“Ain’t.”
“Y’all.”
More like…
“Phony.”
“Freak.”
Anyway, using the Twitters, Ocasio-CowFart basically melted down over the ridicule, using the absurd argument that this is how Alex from The Block does her thang, and if you were from The Block, you’d know that’s how a thang is done, and y’all need to forget Miss Thang grew up in, ahem, Westchester:
Folks talking about my voice can step right off. Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech, same.
Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what’s up.
My Spanish is the same way.
These conspiracy mills are 🚮. https://t.co/8li33Jd6DL

“Folks talking about my voice can step right off,” she tweeted. “Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech, same. Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what’s up. My Spanish is the same way.”
What a load of crap.
Even though, at the time, I was younger than she is (she’s currently 29 going on 14), I managed to live, work, and go to school in Milwaukee’s inner city for a total of five years. My whole “class enviro” during those years was predominantly black, but the thought of affecting an accent never even crossed my mind — not because I was woke or sensitive, but because I didn’t want to look like an asshole — because this is what Ocasio-Crazy looks like (NSFW):
What’s more, she’s lying…
As Ryan Saavedra at the Daily Wire discovered , her claim that this is not the first time she’s used a “distinct dialect,” that she did the same during her “Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech,” simply isn’t true.
Below is video footage of those two speeches, and all you hear is Jerry the Mouse:
In a second tweet, she lied again.
“As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home,” she tweeted.
Except she’s not from the Bronx. She’s from Westchester.
“It is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time,” she added, as though it wasn’t hurtful for us to have to watch her patronize a mostly black audience as though they were babies who require baby talk.
Man, she’s awful.

Report: Amazon Customers Misled by 'Bundled' Reviews,www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/04/06/report-amazon-customers-misled-by-bundled-reviews/," WH Scare Border Battle Antisemitic Omar Assange Trans Military Ban Mayor Pete Pops Off Farage’s Brexit ‘Revolution’ Report: Amazon Customers Misled by ‘Bundled’ Reviews Cliff Owen/AP Photo LUCAS NOLAN 6 Apr 2019 According to a recent report, Amazon’s practice of “bundling” reviews for different products together has resulted in inaccurate ratings of certain products. The Guardian reports that according to a recent analysis, Amazon’s policy of bundling reviews of different products together has resulted in poor translations of classic books and terrible remakes of Hollywood films to display high star ratings and positive reviews. A study by the Guardian found that many products which have been given one-star ratings appear alongside glowing reviews for other items making it extremely hard for buyers to understand the true quality of the product they’re attempting to buy.
The Guardian listed just a few examples they found of poor products receiving amazing reviews simply due to this bundling system. The Guardian listed a few of its findings writing:
• Badly translated or updated Kindle versions of Emma by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations , which include references to “moms”, “guys” and “buddies”, but appear to have 4.5-star ratings from hundreds of reviewers.
• A 2017 TV version of Dirty Dancing that shares the 4.5-star reviews of the original film, despite being described by Hollywood Reporter as a “bloated” remake “that nobody asked for and nobody is likely to truly enjoy”.
• Reviews for Wuthering Heights appearing under listings for Jane Eyre , and vice versa.
• Complaints from consumers who said they had been misled when buying books from a variety of authors – from JK Rowling to Shakespeare.
• Star ratings being combined for different products in other departments, from electronics to gardening equipment.
Complaints dating back to 2014 can be found on certain items noting that reviews were appearing under the incorrect editions of certain books. So far, Amazon has declined to comment on this issue.
A Kindle edition of the classic Charles Dickens book Great Expectations, which has a 4.5-star review rating, is reportedly riddled with errors. One review from a reader points this out, writing: “Each page has a dozen errors. It reads as if it has been translated from a foreign language. ‘Dog’ in the original is ‘canine’ in this version; ‘file’ in the original has become ‘document’; ‘tremendous’ has become ‘maximum incredible’; ‘man’ has become ‘guy’. That is just a short summary of the errors in the first two pages. The whole thing is unreadable and a waste of money.”
Natalie Hitchins, the head of home products and services at the consumer group Which? commented on Amazon’s practices, stating: “If online retailers are incorrectly grouping customer reviews for different products together, there is a real risk that their customers will be misled.” She added: “We need to know we can rely on the information that retailers provide about the products they sell. Online retailers must up their game and ensure reviews are presented in a clear and accurate way.”

Several migrants, including children, have fainted amid the clouds of tear gas on Saturday. The protesters have lit fires to make the air more bearable, but fires have also erupted from exploding stun grenades.
Greek officials say the migrants have been mobilised by fake news originating on social media and false reports that the road to central Europe, tightly sealed to migrants for three years, is open, and that buses chartered by non-governmental organizations are waiting on the other side of the border with North Macedonia, about 60 kilometres (40 miles) to the north.

Unfettered immigration from Mexico and Central America is flooding the US with a demographic of people who are low skilled, illiterate, and lack even a basic high school education.
They don't read or write their own language and for the most part, are unwilling to learn English. More importantly, they have absolutely NO transferable job skills or training and are unable to compete for entry level jobs in the US; some of which require either a college degree or work experience for jobs in the tech industry. Keep in mind there are only so many jobs in the service and construction industry.
In short, those who favor unfettered immigration are knowingly creating an American underclass of people and this demographic of people is growing exponentially. Mass immigration isn't working in Europe and it won't end well in the United States, either."

That is the reason that nothing has been done about illegal immigration for decades. both parties profited by it. That is the reason we still have Obamacare. It makes the insurance companies and the politicians rich. Sure, a few people benefited from it with extended Medicaid which is free, but the system was set up so that the average worker is forced to pay for that free healthcare for some. The elites and the politicians do not pay for it, they have their own super duper plans the public pays for. So Joe and Jane six pack pay for the rich and the poor, while they cannot afford good healthcare themselves."

The GOPe is the Party of Corporatism where their constituency is the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable that also wishes to break Middle Class Liberty for cheap labor with minimal benefits.
Montesquieu wrote in ""The Spirit of the Laws"" that for tyranny to exist, there must be an ignorant and fearful people. So BOTH Parties import Third World illiterates in their own language from failed states where they welcome the Welfare State. My proud ancestors thought it shameful to accept one thin dime from the government as they fled Britain to escape the government tyranny.
In reading Hans-Hermann Hoppe ""A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism,"" we do not grasp that what I refer to as Fascism from Mises ""Socialism"" is ""Conservative Socialism."" The GOPe uses Monopoly as in Mercantilism to force the middle class into Serfdom. It also became crystal clear as I am eligible for Social Security. As two professionals, given 15.3% FICA and 11% effective tax rate, we must have had nearly a million dollars expropriated from our income to get a few grand a month in inflated payments. If we had that money plus modest interest for forty years, we would not miss Social Security. What is the difference between Indentured Service where one works four days for the Noble and a day for one's family, and government at all levels leaving people modest wealth after thirty-five or forty years of professional incomes? I would say it is simply that one was an agrarian society and one is a fractional Reserve Keynesian society. The difference is that when this one goes down, it will make ""The Age of Democratic Revolutions"" (Palmer) look like Nirvana."

In 2017, his wife fell ill, whereupon social services decided to take away his children on the grounds that he had no full employment and was therefore unable to take care of them. Instead, they were placed in a Muslim Lebanese family. Lisov’s family formally retained the custody of the children, but only had the right to see them six hours a week.
He took his daughters and decided to return to Russia. However, he was stopped (and arrested) at Warsaw airport, as the Swedish authorities reported his daughters missing (Poland and Sweden are members of EU, submitted to the EU laws). Therefore, he has applied for asylum in Poland instead.""
