Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design?,www.edaboard.com,venkates2218,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.edaboard.com/showthread.php?383506-Transformerless-transformer-Power-Supply-Design,"6 Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? I am solving how to power the electronics that must GND at the potential of L network. I need 25mA +3,3V and GND on L1. Device is powered permanently 7/24. The first option is Transformerless Power Supply with C. The second option is small trasnsformer The third option is DC/DC converter from low side. There is a problem, the secondary side does not necessarily need to work 7/24 Because GND must be on L1 potencial I thing can only be used this type of transformerless PS because half wave is always destroyed on Zener will be effective indicatively 20-25%. My question. Is there any way to increase efficiency for transformerless PC where is GND on L1? Transformer design,use any asi BV2010123 What is the real effectiveness of these small transformers? 68 Re: Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? By ""must GND at the potential of L network"" do you mean your load ground side (but not Earth) must be connected to one of the AC lines directly? What do you mean by ""L1""? Brian. PLEASE - no friends requests or private emails, I simply don't have time to reply to them all. It's better to share your questions and answers on Edaboard so we can all benefit from each others experiences. Re: Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? Is there any way to increase efficiency for transformerless This 'power supply' topology should be considered only as a secondary option due to the obvious reason of being unsafe from the point of view of the handling, but a very relevant aspect is its intrinsic inefficiency, manifested in the form of (much) dissipated heat, the lower the load being consumed, the greater the heating; ie if the powered system is in an idle state, the series resistor on this 'power supply' will have its highest dissipation. Re: Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? What frequency and voltage is your AC source? Re: Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? I'm sorry this information fell out of my text. My app is something like power meter o power network analyzer. Power is 230V 50Hz>Why must GND at the potential of L network because first ADC measure current on 500uOhm - 1mOhm shunt resistor and one of the end of the resistor must be on the ground potential of the ADC. Second ADC measure voltage between L a N and use resistor divider 1M/1k on Neutral line. Re: Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? please show L network and shunt resistor with the power converter it is much easier to help when everything is known 230V @50 Hz to 3.3V @ 25 mA i think you're much better off with a transformer from the website you included in the first post rectify the secondary, put capacitor on it and then regulate however you like give yourself 2 V overhead - that is, the output of the transformer secondary should be >= 2V above your desired regulated voltage at low input line voltage Re: Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? That is a question, maybe yes may be not. The key question is the efficiency of a small transformer 0,35 or 0,5VA . My guess is, it will be one big tragedy, but I am wrong, there is some real measurement of the efficiency of transformers under 1VA? 68 Re: Transformerless / transformer Power Supply Design? I think the solution depends on how the power monitor reports what it measures. Small transformers are not particularly inefficient and they do offer the advantage of isolation. If you are making any electrical connection outside of the circuit, other than by a wireless method, you must have isolation to prevent unwanted current paths and their inherent dangers. If circuit is entirely self contained and insulated from contact, you can use the capacitive dropper method but add a resistor across the capacitor to discharge it if the power is removed. Keep the series resistor fairly small (use a safety rated type) and keep the capacitor value as small as possible while allowing enough current flow to the load. In other words, maximize the drop in the capacitor where dissipation is lowest. Consider that you can still measure current and voltage on the 'live' side of a circuit while running on the isolated side if you use differential methods and high enough series resistances that the leakage current is at safe levels.

Understand, Harper is entitled to whatever money he can get any team to pay him. I don't like the player and his 'game'; I'm a Mets fan and though many others wanted the team to go after him... I was always against a move for Harper; and in retrospect, considering the Mets team and its dynamic this early in this 2019 season (type of players and veteran/youth balance), the guy, based on his 'game' thus far along in his career, would have been a net negative... in my opinion."

Harper won't be the last free agent to leave the Nats. Scherzer and Redone will be gone too"

GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump | TheHill,thehill.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/437656-gop-gets-used-to-saying-no-to-trump,"GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump By Alexander Bolton - 04/06/19 05:52 AM EDT
GOP lawmakers are getting bolder in saying ""no"" to President Trump Donald John Trump Chelsea Handler says she went into therapy after Trump's win Will it take more deaths or disaster for Washington to fix immigration and border security? Conspiracy theorists keep their Ginsburg death claims alive MORE .
Whether it’s ripping apart ObamaCare or closing the border, Republicans are bucking Trump when they see his strategies as self-defeating — and damaging to their own hopes of keeping the White House and winning congressional seats in 2020.
On foreign policy, a minority of Republicans have joined with Democrats to cut off U.S. support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen’s civil war. They’ve also derailed Trump’s plans to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and to cut in half the U.S. force in Afghanistan. ADVERTISEMENT
GOP lawmakers were furious with proposed budget cuts for the Special Olympics, which Trump overruled.
Republicans also are showing less deference to Trump.
Willard (Mitt) Mitt Romney GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump Trump says he plans to nominate Herman Cain to Fed DNC 2020 convention in Milwaukee will backfire MORE (R-Utah) mocked Trump’s expected pick for Federal Reserve, Herman Cain, for the simplistic 9-9-9 tax plan he pushed during the 2012 Republican presidential primary, which Romney ultimately won.
Trump remains the party’s leader, and Republicans still fear his involvement in party primaries, where the president could torpedo a sitting lawmaker’s chances by backing his primary opponent.
But Trump doesn’t seem to be instilling the same level of fear in GOP lawmakers that he once did.
One Republican senator closely allied with Trump said the GOP leadership is getting more comfortable about publicly airing their disputes with the president.
This senator also said there has been more pushback in the past than noticed.
""There was more of that last year than sometimes got reported,"" said the lawmaker, who requested anonymity to discuss the leadership’s dynamic with Trump.
""I think some of this is everyone just getting used to each other, especially at the leadership level — Mitch and the president getting more comfortable dealing with each other and understanding they're on the same team and running in the same direction even if they don’t have the same route charted out,"" the lawmaker said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnell Former Democratic aide pleads guilty to doxing GOP senators attending Kavanaugh hearing GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump Green new deal is an opportunity for GOP to retake climate debate MORE (R-Ky.).
Brian Darling, a Republican strategist and former Senate aide, said Republicans are learning that Trump respects people who show some backbone, even if he doesn’t agree with them.
""What a lot of Republicans understand is they can have some influence over the president by pushing back and being aggressive. The president respects people who stand up for themselves, and he may be harsh at times, but he respects that,"" Darling said.
But Darling said that Trump ultimately calls the shots.
""He makes the calls on what the policies are going to be going forward because he’s going to be at the top of the ticket. He’s going to be leading the charge on the issues he wants to lead on, Congress be damned,"" he said.
Randal (Rand) Howard Paul Trump: I have not read Mueller report, 'though I have every right to do so' Former Democratic aide pleads guilty to doxing GOP senators attending Kavanaugh hearing GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump MORE (R-Ky.) described a recent episode in which he said a group of Republican senators came to the White House and tried to ""bully"" the president to drop his plan to withdraw from Syria.
""I think most of them keep pushing back,"" Paul said of his Republican colleagues’ defiance of Trump’s wish to withdraw from Syria. ""I was at the White House three or four weeks ago, and six of them showed up to try to tell him why he had to stay. ADVERTISEMENT
""Five or six of them had requested a meeting with him to try to bully him into staying in Syria, and he told them what he’s been telling everybody else: They’re coming out,"" Paul said, describing the interaction with the president but declining to name his colleagues.
A similar episode unfolded shortly before 12 Republican senators voted last month for a Democratic-backed resolution to disapprove of Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the border.
Melania Trump GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump The Hill's Morning Report — Washington readies for Mueller end game Schwarzenegger tells Trump to 'listen to the first lady' before attacking McCain MORE the night before the vote in a bold attempt to change Trump’s mind about his emergency border declaration, according to The Washington Post.
The lack of deference was not lost on the president, who berated the senators for interrupting his evening without invitation and wasting his time, according to the Post.
On health care, McConnell bluntly told Trump in a phone call on Monday that the Senate would not be taking up comprehensive health care legislation, something the president pitched to them enthusiastically less than a week earlier during a meeting with the entire Senate GOP conference.
Trump then backed off the idea and now says it will be something acted upon immediately in 2021, assuming he wins reelection.
John Cornyn Big Dem names show little interest in Senate GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump Wendy Davis thinking of running for Texas congressional seat MORE (R-Texas), a member of McConnell’s leadership team, called Trump on Tuesday night to tell him that shutting the border would be a ""terrible mistake."" Earlier that same day, McConnell warned that doing so would be ""catastrophic.""
Republicans have also rejected an effort to dramatically increase military funding through a special overseas contingency operations account, which would have evaded spending caps.
James Paul Lankford GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump GOP to go 'nuclear' with rules change for Trump nominations This week: Senate GOP prepares to change rules on Trump nominees MORE (R-Okla.) said GOP lawmakers have a responsibility to stand up for their constituents’ interests when they’re at odds with Trump’s latest ideas. He noted the frequent GOP cries against Trump’s actions on trade.
""Senate Republicans have spoken out on tariffs, on Syria policy,"" he said. ""I have a responsibility to represent 4 million people.""
Lankford said closing the border would have a ""dramatic"" impact on Oklahoma.
""That’s the No. 2 trade partner we have, Mexico,"" he said. ""Parts, supplies, agriculture, all those things would be [impacted] pretty dramatically.""
Before last year’s midterms, Republicans clearly shied away from confrontation with Trump for fear it could depress GOP voter turnout.
GOP leaders admitted last year that that’s why they didn’t want to pick a fight with the president over his tariff policy, even though there was overwhelming opposition to it within the Senate Republican Conference.
In June, GOP leaders quashed a vote on a proposal sponsored by former Sen. Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips Corker GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump Democrats introduce bill to rein in Trump on tariffs Trump keeps tight grip on GOP MORE (R-Tenn.), one of Trump’s chief antagonists, to rein in the president’s power to impose tariffs.
Cornyn, who was then the Senate majority whip, declared, ""This is not the time to pick a fight with the president in the run-up to the midterm election.""
McConnell personally felt the sting of falling on Trump's bad side in 2017 when the president excoriated him repeatedly on Twitter for failing to pass legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump even hinted that McConnell’s days as Senate GOP leader might be numbered if there was a failure to pass tax reform.
Marion (Mike) Michael Rounds GOP gets used to saying 'no' to Trump On The Money: Wells Fargo CEO steps down | Trump vows to keep funding for Special Olympics | House panel approves marijuana banking bill | Controversial Fed pick gains support in Senate Controversial Fed pick gains support in GOP Senate MORE (R-S.D.) said his colleagues are looking for reciprocity in their relationship with the president, noting that McConnell has devoted most of the Senate schedule this year to confirming Trump’s executive branch and judicial nominees.
Just this week, the Senate GOP went ""nuclear"" by changing the Senate rules to speed up confirmations of Trump appointees.
Rounds said Republicans will do everything they can for the president when it’s feasible, arguing that Trump’s idea to pivot to a major push on comprehensive health care reform simply wasn’t the right thing to do at this time.
“We’re getting some things done in terms of his request to get nominations rolling again,"" he said. ""As we say, we want this president to be successful. There are some things we can do and some things we can’t. Health care we can’t do.""
""It’s a difficult one to do because we don’t think we have any support from House Democrats,"" he said."

Brexiteers have played by the rules. JRM thought he could defeat her by using EU rules, parliamentary procedures and the rule of law, but he failed. We had a referendum, and that failed. There's a quiet but smouldering anger out here.
Theresa May is fully aware that the EU elections in the UK are likely to result in an overwhelming vote for Brexit parties. It seems she is confident enough not to care, and during the campaign no doubt Brexit supporters will be called all the names under the sun 24/7 on TV and radio.

Just 28 per cent of people said they would be pleased while 23 per cent they “don’t mind” the country taking part in the EU elections.
Of the 1,295 Sky customers interviewed on April 5th, more than a quarter (26 per cent) said they would boycott the vote entirely.
When asked what was respondents’ preferred way to resolve the Brexit deadlock, No Deal Brexit came out with a relative majority of 41 per cent.
The option of accepting a long Brexit delay and European Parliament elections came second, being preferred by 35 per cent, with just 16 per cent favouring Prime Minister May’s controversial Withdrawal Agreement.
The results of the poll came after Mrs May said she would seek a longer Brexit delay which could force the country into EU elections next month — almost three years since the UK voted to leave the bloc.
‘Fight Back’: Brexiteers Vow to Sabotage Brussels if Pulled into EU Elections https://t.co/A8CMj1LqaC
— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 5, 2019
EU bureaucrats and European leaders are likely to be equally unhappy at the prospect of the British, preparing to leave the EU, having influence in Brussels decision-making.
That concern would have been increased considerably after key Brexiteers threatened to sabotage Brussels if forced to take part in European Parliament elections.
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said that Britain “should be as difficult as possible” if it sends MEPs back to the continent, and could cause merry havoc with “integrationist schemes” by vetoing budget increases and obstructing advancement of the EU army.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage also warned that if the planned extension goes ahead, “this is the fight back and they’re going to be very surprised by what they get.”

Never has the saying been more true.
The enemy of my enemy is my Friend.
Our Enemy is the EU and all that support it.

Change it back to nation states, loosely linked but self governing.
That we are having a Euro election at all is betrayal and an abomination.
However we cannot change that.
So we must use the opportunity to achieve something positive.
And voting for our EU enemy, enemies - suits me just fine.

And actually just as Farage has claimed all the credit for the referendum and Brexit - we now know that Gerard was the brains, the author and the real power behind it.
And of course it was Sir james Goldsmith and the Referendum Party that got the original pledge for the referendum vote.
The wisest of people always know when to move on and let go.
Farage walked, Batten picked up the pieces from the gutter where Farage had consigned it.
A week or so from bankruptsy.
I would have hoped Farage would have had the grace to take the wisest and most dignified course.
He hasn't and will cost Brexit and UKIP further grief if he can.
And splitting the UKIP vote impacts not only on Britain where it will do little more than save the remainers seats and make it far more difficult for UKIP to unseat them, but now with the EURO vote, cost UKIP seats that are pledged to the Salvini. le Pen ENF group where UKIP now sits under Batten.
