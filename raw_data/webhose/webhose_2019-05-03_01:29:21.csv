It really does explain the middle class dilemma.
I am retired now but early in my IT career I as making $45k/yr. My wife and I hired the neighbors cleaning lady at $85/day to do our house too once a week. I asked her why she never applied for amnesty, since she had lived in the US thru TWO amnesties. She was very candid and told me said she did the math and knew she made more by living under the radar and outside the tax system! She had two kids here, always used free emergency rm services, and was aware of all the freebies she was eligible for via her community network. I did a similar analysis and realized this girl was taking home more than me! Maybe I should have been doing her cleaning? Just goes to show you that those who apply for amnesty have more to gain and those that dont - also have more to gain. Either way, it's a lose/lose for American tax payers.
Btw, we were very tidy people but we still assumed she spent at least four or five hours cleaning floors or things we avoided until one day i had to return home an hour after she arrived. It was very awkward finding her already over at the neighbors but having to come back to my house to get her laundry out of my dryer."

Case in point, my mother-in-law broke her neck on a cruise ship last year and was taken straight to the hospital via ambulance. She died within 30 days of her injuries. After going through two attorneys I have come to find out there is a 100 year-old law that prevents most litigation against Cruise Lines. It was enacted shortly after the Titanic sunk. I have reached out to all of out my elected officials in some cases twice, I have used Twitter, I have used Facebook. I have not had any response from them aside from the standard auto reply.

On a positive note, what’s happening in Algeria is fascinating and even extraordinary.
The people of Algeria have forced their government to collapse.
They organized themselves, took to the streets in huge numbers and brought their government down. It took seven weeks of protesting during which not a single person was injured or killed.
But if that wasn’t unusual enough, this mass of people was leaderless from beginning to end.
The people have demanded elections to replace all of the oligarchs, plutocrats, and corrupt politicians now exercising their power in government.
Asked who the people would vote to be their next head-of-state the protesters replied, “We’ll have to find someone to run for that office very soon.”
This is a bottom-up, leaderless revolution and something that every country should try real soon. Leave a Reply"

"American Automakers Urge Donald Trump Not to Shut Mexico Border, Warn of 'Significant Disruptions'",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-mexico-border-automakers-trade-disruptions-1384646,"The Auto Alliance has urged President Donald Trump against shutting the border with Mexico in his immigration dispute with the U.S.'s southern neighbor, warning of “significant disruptions” were he to make good on his threats.
The group, representing America’s biggest automakers, put out a statement Wednesday titled “The Importance of Open Borders” in response to repeated comments by Trump that, unless Mexico takes greater action to curb undocumented migration, he will close the U.S. border.
“Automakers rely heavily on cross-border trade throughout the North American region,” the Auto Alliance statement said. In many instances, auto parts can cross the border multiple times before being integrated into the final assembly of a vehicle.
“We urge all parties to work together to avert a border closing that would result in significant disruptions to the North American auto industry, because ultimately the costs of all this fall upon our customers and make it more difficult for them to afford a new vehicle that is cleaner, safer and more energy-efficient.”
Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, a Republican and president of the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC), an industry group that represents automakers FCA US, Ford and GM, also warned the Trump administration against shutting the border with Mexico.
""Any action that stops commerce at the border would be harmful to the U.S. economy, and in particular, the auto industry,"" Blunt said in a statement sent to Newsweek .
The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Trump believes there is a crisis at America’s southern border and has declared a national emergency to secure funding for his wall, after Congress refused to allocate any money to its construction.
The president’s critics accuse him of manufacturing a border crisis for which there is little evidence, and argue his wall is an expensive and ineffective political gimmick.
“Mexico is going to have to do something, otherwise I’m closing the border. I’ll just close the border,"" Trump told reporters last Friday . ""And with a deficit like we have with Mexico and have had for many years, closing border would be a profit-making operation.""
On Saturday, Trump tweeted : “Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out & we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!”
In reality, suddenly closing the border would drive up costs for many American businesses trading with Mexico, potentially causing job losses and putting some firms’ survival at risk.
The automobile industry would be hit hard by any closure of the border. Many vehicle makers have factories in both Mexico and the U.S., importing and exporting automobile parts and finished products between both countries.
According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the biggest goods import to the U.S. from Mexico is vehicles, a trade worth $84 billion in 2017 alone.
Overall goods and services trade between the two across all industries totaled $615.9 million during that year. There was a $71 billion deficit in America’s trade as it imports more from Mexico than it exports to it.
Trump believes this deficit is significant and negative for America, which he claims is being ripped off. He has imposed tariffs and opened up trade conflicts with China, the European Union, Japan, and others to secure better terms because of America’s trade deficits.
Economists, however, say bilateral trade deficits do not matter all that much. Instead, it indicates that the U.S. economy and dollar are strong, allowing American firms to import cheaply from abroad, keeping their costs low, improving their bottom line, and enabling them to reinvest more.
The president scrapped the NAFTA trade deal between America, Canada, and Mexico because of the bilateral deficits. He imposed tariffs to strong-arm Canada and Mexico into negotiating a new but little-changed deal, USMCA, which is yet to be ratified by Congress.
""Access to Mexico’s market place and North American integration are critical to operations in the U.S.,"" the AAPC's Blunt said in his statement. ""That is why we are strong supporters of the administration’s USMCA agreement. USMCA is essential to maintaining the competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry and we are urging Congress to pass it without delay.""
Trump has also pressured American companies, particularly automakers, to repatriate factories from abroad and open up new plants on U.S. soil under his administration’s policy of economic nationalism, despite the increase in costs to both businesses and consumers that this entails.
President Donald Trump smiles during the National Republican Congressional Committee Annual Spring Dinner, in Washington, D.C., on April 2. Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border. Automakers warned of “significant disruptions” were he to make good on his words. JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images This article was updated with a comment from the American Automotive Policy Council.

What Is Madame Satan's Plan For Sabrina? Michelle Gomez Teases 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' Part 2,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/chilling-adventures-sabrina-part-2-michelle-gomez-1383926,"On 4/3/19 at 10:20 AM EDT Share Culture Movies & TV
The only way to describe Madame Satan in her true form on Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is absolutely terrifying.
The centuries-old witch possessed the body of school teacher Mary Wardwell in the very beginning of the Netflix series's first season but in the concluding moments of the finale episode, Lucifer's leading lady freed herself of her body—graciously provided by Michelle Gomez—and revealed her natural demonic state, scaring poor Principal Hawthorne (Bronson Pinchot) halfway to death before she quite literally ate his face off.
The odds of fans seeing more of Madame Satan's treacherously dark and menacing behavior when COAS returns with Part 2 on Friday are pretty high, according to Gomez. In a recent interview with Newsweek , the Scottish actor said viewers will finally get to understand the aspiring Queen of Hell's motivations and how Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) fits into her agenda.""It’s always about, 'What is the motivation? Why is somebody doing what they’re doing? What is their preface? Where do they want to get to? What do they want to get?' We see more of that this season,"" Gomez said.
""I truly don’t believe people are born evil. I think people are born as perfect as they can be, innocent and untainted, and then life starts to swoop in and starts to take chunks out of you,"" she continued. ""It’s interesting how we turn out. It’s interesting how we end up and what carves us and makes us who we ultimately become in life. So we get to see that for Madame Satan, and learn why she is the way she is.""

True, Madame Satan is inherently evil, and her wickedness will be on constant display throughout Part 2. However, the antagonist will face a few moral difficulties as Sabrina continues to come into her own power, especially since Sabrina represents good and very obviously wants to use her craft as a positive force.
""It’s been difficult to manipulate [Sabrina] to this point, and now she signed her name in [Satan's] book, what is she going to do with that? And how is Madame Satan going to control her now? I would argue she’s not going to be able to,"" Gomez suggested.
The witches do have a general respect for each other. Their interaction in Part 1 proved that, and it's been pretty clear that Sabrina, unaware of who Ms. Wardwell truly is, views the bewitching literature teacher as a mentor of sorts. Their comradery may face some complications, though, when Sabrina's relationship with the Dark Lord starts to develop.
""They clearly like each other, but it’s kind of difficult with Madame Satan because she’s like the best frenemy you could ever have,"" Gomez said.
Speaking of frenemies, there's another one of Sabrina's that could, maybe, one day join forces with Madame Satan.
Although Gomez couldn't confirm the pairing, the actor did note what a killer team her character would make with the Weird Sisters head-witch-in-charge, Prudence, played by Tati Gabrielle.
""We’ve still got a ways to go, so that means we still have a lot more story to tell,"" she said. ""Roberto’s [Aguirre-Sacasa, creator] imagination is off the scale. Who knows what he has in store for all of us, but there’s definitely plenty of fun to be had and more interaction between a lot of the characters. I definitely think Prudence and Madame Satan would have a lot of fun working together."""
