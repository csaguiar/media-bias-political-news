Refugee problem: a practical solution,coldfury.com,Mike,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://coldfury.com/index.php/2019/04/06/refugee-problem-a-practical-solution/,"Francis calls it a “ political wet dream. ”
John Whiteman, Prime Minister of a First World nation that shall go unidentified for obvious reasons, recently announced a change to his country’s “refugee” policies. He can’t change the law, but he can change how it’s observed in practice – and he has. Immediately afterward, he addressed a group of “refugees” that made it to his nation’s shores:
“Refugees, eh? Yet more than ninety percent of you are young men, all of you look healthy, and it looks like most of you have smart phones. What are you running from, the fathers of the girls you knocked up?
“According to our laws, we have to house you ‘refugees’ here…but only until we can return you to your home countries in safety. So here’s the deal: you’ll be living in tents, in this compound, which you won’t be permitted to leave. There’ll be no WiFi, no electricity, and no entertainment of any kind. Yes, there’ll be food and water, but we won’t care about your opinion of the food, and water will be all you get to drink. Clothes? What’s wrong with the clothes you’re wearing?
“The compound is surrounded by crew-served machine gun emplacements that are continuously manned. Anyone who tries to scale the fence will be shot down, no questions asked. His neighbors can dispose of his body; we certainly won’t want it.
“For extra security, you’ll all be wearing ankle monitors. Very special ankle monitors: if you cut through the band that holds them on, they explode. Guaranteed amputation of your lower leg. If one of you is detected outside the compound, he’ll be tracked down and executed wherever he’s found, again no questions asked. Yes, kids too. Some of you ‘teenagers’ have mighty impressive beards.
“We aren’t interested in hearing any demands from you. In fact, the very first demand any of you makes will get all of you loaded onto a raft and dragged a mile out to sea. Think you could make it back?
“Whoever survives this regime will be returned to his homeland when we think it’s safe. You won’t get a vote. After all, we didn’t get one when you decided to leave, and fair’s fair.
“So make yourselves at home! Those of you whose phones are working should call your buddies back in Dumbfuckistan and tell them about the conditions here. Especially you should tell them about the size of this compound – the fixed size of this compound. No matter how many ‘refugees’ arrive here, they’ll all be confined to the space you occupy now. No enlargement will be considered.
“Have a nice day!”
Do read on from there, you’ll like it. Unfortunately, you can safely bet that most Americans would be mortified and shocked by the “inhumane extremism” of the ideas explored therein, which speaks sad volumes about the rudderless moral chaos of our era."
Clarification,coldfury.com,Mike,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://coldfury.com/index.php/2019/04/06/clarification-2/,"Simberg says this quote from a NASA official stuck out to him , and it does me too, though maybe for a different reason.
Neither Bridenstine nor Pence said so explicitly, but these comments reflect their sense that NASA has become too bureaucratic, too tentative, too risk averse. During his town hall this week, Bridenstine had a telling response when asked why, by setting such an ambitious goal of a 2024 landing, was he not putting schedule over safety?
“I would not say it’s a return to schedule over safety, I would say it’s a return to schedule,” he said. “Safety is paramount for everybody at this agency, it always has been. But the number one mission is not safety. If it was, we would all just stay in the ready room and just watch CNN.”
Of course we all already know that safety isn’t the “number one mission” for NASA. “ Muslim outreach ” is."
Gropey Joe goin’ down,coldfury.com,Mike,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://coldfury.com/index.php/2019/04/05/gropey-joe-goin-down/,"by Mike 2 Comments
Too bad, so sad. He musta pissed off somebody important, I guess. On the other hand, he’s a sleazy, duplicitous asshole bereft of even a teeny-tiny shred of integrity, and he always has been. So fuck him .
As he moves toward a presidential run, Joe Biden has been under fire from the Left for his treatment of Anita Hill, but in his 2007 memoir, Clarence Thomas offered a different perspective on Biden’s performance during his confirmation hearings.
Thomas recalled, “Throughout my life I’ve often found truth embedded in the lyrics of my favorite records. At Yale, for example, I’d listened often to ‘Smiling Faces Sometimes,’ a song by the Undisputed Truth that warns of the dangers of trusting the hypocrites who ‘pretend to be your friend’ while secretly planning to do you wrong. Now I knew I’d met one of them: Senator Biden’s smooth, insincere promises that he would treat me fairly were nothing but talk.”
After his initial (USSC) confirmation hearings, Thomas received a visit from the FBI asking him to respond to the (Anita) Hill accusations, which he categorically denied. The one thing Thomas credits Biden for is that Hill had initially requested that her name be withheld from members of the Judiciary Committee when she submitted her statement, but Biden said he would only accept a signed statement.
Initially, the matter was supposed to be kept confidential. Ahead of the vote, Biden told Thomas on the phone that “he was torn over his decision and has brought two statements with him to the committee meeting that day, one for me and one against.” Ultimately, however, Biden said he’d have to vote against Thomas because he disagreed with his beliefs.
At the same time, however, Biden said he’d defend Thomas if the Hill story ever became public, along with another matter concerning a leaked draft opinion from the appellate court that had been drawing criticism.
“Judge, I know you don’t believe me,” Thomas recalled Biden telling him, “but if any of these last two matters come up, I will be your biggest defender.”
Thomas recounted, “He was right about one thing: I didn’t believe him. Neither did Virginia (his wife). As he reassured me of his goodwill, she grabbed a spoon from the silverware drawer, opened her mouth wide, stuck out her tongue as far as she could, and pretended to gag herself.”
Heh. Speaks very well of their intelligence and ability to judge good character—another trait Biden lacks. No matter, though; as I said, Uncle Gropey must have pissed off some higher-up pretty badly, because the recent sudden barrage of bad PR on him ain’t no accident .
This is all taking place in the context of the #MeToo movement/hysteria in which the accusation of imappropriate douchebaggery was sufficient to send Al Franken back to doing whatever the hell he is competent to do. How does a Democrat party that trashed Brett Kavanaugh based on scurrilous fictions accept as its nominee a guy who becomes a human octopus when around women? Electorally, how does a Democrat party that hopes to use preference for women as a political sales pitch in 2020 do that when you have reels of video of their putative standard bearer pawing away? You can’t. And even though Bernie Sanders is getting the heat for being behind this, none of Biden’s rivals have stepped forward to defend him. Which brings me to the next point.
The more interesting phenomenon is happening on the right. As I mentioned above, Biden has a lot of friends on the right side of the aisle who are coming to Biden’s defense.
Why Republicans or conservatives feel obligated to wade into a Democrat circular firing squad to save Joe Biden from his own behavior is simply beyond my comprehension. This whole episode is exactly what Senator Rubio described, that is, it is a cynical and dirty political hit orchestrated by one of Biden’s rivals for the nomination. Who cares? Why should we defend a guy who just last year was fine with Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser being given credence and being protected from any adversarial questioning? Politically, why would we a) want to help the (on paper) strongest Democrat candidate survive an own-goal and b) why would we want to go on record as seeming to defend a groper. Why can’t we agree with the proposition that Biden is a nice guy and, at the same time, let him live under the #NewRules he helped develop?
Better yet, why can’t we acknowledge instead that he’s nothing remotely like a “nice guy” and never has been, seize on any and everything we can use to destroy him utterly just as he would one of ours, and revel in jumping up and down on his stinking carcass after we’re done? Diplomad says enjoy the karma :
A typical old-style corrupt Democrat politician, a poor man’s Edward “Watch-What-My-Oldsmobile-Can-Do” Kennedy, Biden loved cameras, spouted 1980s vintage pedestrian “social justice” slogans, and yet nestled comfortably in the pocket of banking and credit card interests. He tried to portray himself as just, “Uncle Joe, your neighbor. Let’s have a beer.” Yawn. A bore. Only his gaffes, ponderous lectures, and hair-transplant travails made him mildly amusing. I found surprising when Obama picked him as his VP in 2008, but, those wiser explained that it made sense: Biden could bring in some middle class male white vote; perhaps ease the concerns of powerful financial people about Obama’s leftist views; serve as the voice of experience; and, of course, he would not outshine President Obama. A correct calculation? I don’t know. I leave that discussion to pollsters and campaign historians. I know one thing for certain, he did not capture this white dude’s vote, nor allay this white dude’s concerns about the Obama misadministration.
Well, Uncle Joe got himself screwed over in 2016. It seems he thought that eight years as Obama’s loyal sidekick finally would earn him, entitle him, ensure him the machine’s backing for the Democrat nomination that he had sought for some 30 years. Nope. Not so fast, white guy. Obama promised that to Hillary Clinton and her powerful money printing press. Joe was talked out of running, given a “surprise” Presidential Medal of Freedom, and sent off to graze in Delaware. See ya, Joe!
As we can see from the score or so of calamities now running or about to run for the Dem nomination in 2020, the ground in the Democratic Party, the world’s oldest political party, has shifted radically. Poor Joe, apparently, did not get the memo, the one that says white guys not welcome, or he misunderstood it, “That can’t mean me! I love women! I love black people! I don’t want them back in chains!” He thought, I guess, that he could gain an exemption from the identity politics mantra.
Gropey just ain’t fanatically Marxist enough for today’s loony radicals, nor confrontational enough to openly endorse the gang violence that is the modern Left’s bread-and-butter MO. He personifies the incrementalist Old Guard, so they have no more use for a relic like him than they do Hillary!™ . He could declare himself a woman, have his dick hacked off, and release photos of himself sucking random cock in a subway toilet and it still wouldn’t be enough to put him over with the freaks, geeks, and headcases that are now his party’s base.
Elsewhere, Leftards are having shitfits over Trump’s nitwittery and lack of (harrumph harrumph!) gravitas for this bit of lighthearted hilarity: I thought the meme of Joe Biden coming from behind to sniff Joe Biden's hair and giving Joe Biden a backrub during Joe Biden's statement on his touching of others was 100% real. But the media tell me it's ""doctored."" I guess you can't always believe what you see. pic.twitter.com/acb86MlP8p
Know how I always say that Proggies are a bunch of priggish, pinch-faced nags without a sense of humor? Yeah, that .
So long, Gropey Joe, and thanks for all the fish.
Reaping and sowing update! “ There are so many women coming out against Joe Biden that you’d think Trump had just nominated him to the Supreme Court. ”
And yet there are those rushing to Biden’s defense against what is clearly an oppo dump by the other Lilliputian Democrats (ahem: Bernie Sanders) who lack Biden’s stature and — well, we won’t call it gravitas, as that has never been a word applicable to Biden. Who are they?
Naturally, they’re the do-gooder Republican crowd; the same people who still haven’t stopped clucking about Donald Trump’s boorishness and inadequacies.
Marco Rubio called Biden’s travails a political hit job. He said it was “Dirty Politics 101” and lamented that things won’t stop with Biden.
Bill Kristol touted the stories of Biden’s “kindness and compassion” he was struck by.
And Meghan McCain said Biden was “truly decent and compassionate.” One almost gets a Raymond Shaw/Manchurian Candidate vibe out of the NeverTrumpers defending Biden this week.
And once again these are people who ought to be ignored.
Joe Biden isn’t kind, and he’s not compassionate. He’s a garden-variety attention-whore hack politician with personal habits tending toward depravity, and if he’s gobbled up by the left-wing mob before he can touch off yet another failed presidential run, it is of no particular abomination to the right side of the political fence.
Biden made his bed, and made it again and again. Let him lie in it. When someone worth defending against the #MeToo mob is accused, let that be a time to push back against #MeToo excesses.
Not this. This is Social Justice in its true form.
Indeed it is. Let there be one set of rules and one set only, rigidly enforced against everyone. If these are the ones Lefty wanted then they damned well better be the ones Lefty lives by, with no exception or indulgence granted, whether he finds them congenial when his own butt is caught in the blades or not. He and his shitlib confreres should be compelled to stew in their own fetid juices, and to hell with every last one of the sonsabitches."
The Great Unraveling,coldfury.com,Mike,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://coldfury.com/index.php/2019/04/05/the-great-unraveling-4/,"by Mike Leave a comment
The wheels are coming off the bus , so you can look for the space underneath it to get more and more crowded ( emphasis mine throughout—M ).
The recently released transcript of George Papadopoulos’s congressional testimony reveals a significant fact: Papadopoulos’s introduction to Joseph Mifsud—the source of the “Russia has Hillary’s emails” tip that purportedly prompted the FBI to launch an investigation into the Trump campaign—was arranged mere days after Papadopoulos announced he was joining the Trump campaign.
Saturday evening, Papadopoulos rocked Twitter with claims that “a woman in London, who was the FBI’s legal attaché in the U.K. ” encouraged him “to meet Joseph Mifsud in Rome in March 2016.” These new revelations raise fresh concerns that, with the approval of the FBI, foreign governments were meddling in the 2016 election.
Mifsud has long been suspected of holding the key to efforts to target the Trump campaign. But Papadopoulos’s testimony and his tweet now implicate the amorphous London Centre for International Law Practice and the FBI in the plot to put Papadopoulos in contact with Mifsud. From there, Mifsud had but to groom Papadopoulos with promises of Russia connections that would allow him to shine in his new role as a foreign policy advisor to Trump.
It worked, and Mifsud’s supposed tip about the Russian hacking provided the FBI the pretext necessary to launch a full investigation into the Trump campaign for supposedly colluding with Russia.
This all raises lots of questions, chief among them this one: What did Obama know, and when did he know it? But don’t for a moment imagine that Papadopolous was the only one who had a baited Trump trap placed in his path .
For one, a series of stories that appeared in the press in early 2017 heavily implied Lokhova was a Russian agent who tried to suborn Michael Flynn at a dinner hosted at Cambridge on Feb. 28, 2014. Flynn served at the time as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
A year after those stories appeared, The Daily Caller News Foundation reported Halper cozied to three Trump campaign advisers, Carter Page, Sam Clovis and George Papadopoulos. In May 2018, Halper was revealed as a longtime CIA and FBI informant, a revelation that led President Donald Trump to accuse the FBI of planting a spy in his campaign . The Republican coined the term “Spygate” to describe the alleged scandal.
And Trump was right, too. The Deep State apparat attempted to entrap Trump, with the ultimate goal of, first, rigging the 2016 election, then forcing him out of office under false pretenses after that had failed.
“ALLEGED scandal”? My lily white ass. This is nothing less than the biggest, the most heinous and damaging scandal in American history. Too-powerful Superstate bureaucracies have been exposed as thoroughly compromised by bone-deep corruption and malfeasance, from top to bottom. The entire American system—Congress, the Executive branch under Emperor Ogabe, the federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and the so-called “mainstream” media—has wilfully and wantonly stripped itself of any credible claim to trustworthiness or Constitutional legitimacy, perhaps never to regain it.
Every American should consider all of this absolutely intolerable. We now know that our system is rotten, and that we are being misgoverned by a Ruling Class of amoral mediocrities who are patently unfit for the positions they abuse. No matter what you might think of Trump—as a man, as a husband, as a celebrity, or as President—you should be both infuriated…and alarmed."

Regulation Freedom Of Speech Supreme Court Constitutional Law Campaign Finance Lawrence Lessig Jacob Sullum thinks me inconsistent . Surprise, surprise, I think not. He finds my “disdain for a solution [I] endorsed not long ago...a bit startling.” Indeed it would be, if indeed I was ""disdaining"" the “solution” at issue.
But in my op-ed for The New York Times yesterday, I said this (this time with some emphasis added):
But at some point, Congress has got to muster the courage to say what every sane reformer recognizes: that we won’t solve the problem of “big money donors” until Congress begins to say yes. Not just finance limits, but also finance support. Not just ways to restrict, but also ways to enable.
The point is that I am not criticizing the substance of the amendment because I disagree with the idea of limits. I am criticizing the idea of an amendment that only has limits. This isn’t “disdain” for limits. It’s disdain for the idea that limits alone could work.
Now, as Sullum recognizes, the substance of the limits that I had supported is different from the limits in the amendment recently introduced. I believe that Congress should have the power to limit, but not to ban, independent expenditures. That doesn’t mean, as Sullum writes, that my “amendment would authorize Congress to reinstate the restrictions on ‘electioneering communications’ imposed by...McCain-Feingold.” McCain-Feingold banned those expenditures. I believe they should at most be limited. And as I’ve said again and again, properly interpreted, certainly the non-profit Citizens United should have been entitled to spend as it wanted to spend. That spending has nothing to do with the only justification Congress could have for restricting speech in this context—i.e., corruption, properly interpreted.
Finally, Sullum is kind to grant me “credit for coming up with ever more creative ways of dodging the central problem, which is that big government attracts big money because it has so many favors to dole out.” But I think the “dodging” here is from the libertarian right, not from me. You can’t simply assume a libertarian government. You have to show how we can get there. The argument at the core of my book, Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress and a Plan to Stop It , is that so long as elections are financed by large dollar contributions or independent expenditures, Congress will have an interest in maximizing its “favors to dole out.” For if you eliminate the favors, then you weaken the ability to raise campaign funds.
So I get that it feels nice to point to the Epsteinian utopia (for those on the libertarian right) of a world where rent-seeking has been abolished. But even Richard Epstein gets that you can’t simply assume that state. You have to describe a strategy for getting to it. That’s why Epstein was willing to agree that we need a form of public funding for elections. Without it, the thumb will always be on the scale of bigger, and more intrusive government.
Lawrence Lessig is a professor at Harvard Law School and director of the Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics.

Justice Ja’neh was the Justice in Chamber when the Road Fund petition was signed by all five Supreme Court Justices, including Chief Justice Francis Korkpor, who presided over the impeachment proceedings in the Senate, where senators voted to remove Ja’neh from office.
The Maryland County Senator disclosed that he was one of the senators who hooked Ja’neh on that Road Fund, which was one out of four counts leveled against the former Supreme Court Justice.
Majority senators found Justice Ja’neh guilty for granting a Writ of Prohibition filed by owners of Srimax and Aminata, two petroleum dealers, to stop the collection of levy/taxes of US$0.30 imposed on the pump price of petroleum products.
Sen. Brown’s admittance ends doubts about how he voted. Twenty-two senators voted to remove Ja’neh; four voted against his removal, while three abstained from the process amounting to a total of 29.
“All of them are guilty and should be removed. However, removal doesn’t come because I said it; but in the event where someone files a petition for impeachment against anyone who participated in the same act that Ja’neh was removed for and the circumstances avail themselves, I will vote for them to be removed.”
Senator Brown has been a strong voice in the Senate especially when he spoke to issues of Ja’neh impeachment. He was among few senators, who felt Ja’neh’s impeachment was unconstitutional; however, he disclosed that he voted to remove the man in protest of colleague senators, who had allegedly breached their discussions.
Few hours before the senators had gone to cast their votes, nine of them had signed a resolution abstaining from the process. Sen. Brown was one of the nine. According to him, he later decided otherwise because his colleagues made the list of those nine senators public thereby making them to appear as “heroes” in the eyes of some members of the public and demeaning their remaining colleagues. He further argued that by displaying those nine names publically, other senators who did not sign their resolution but had intention to vote against removing Ja’neh changed their minds and voted his removal.
“Two of our colleagues, who gave us their commitments in confidence said, the press conference made them look bad and made heroes of the nine of us. So they were not going to go our way. That press conference exposed our weakness. It showed that we did not have the number so even if nine of us had voted, it would not have made a difference; we needed just one more persons to be added to us. They made we lost it.
“Despite the fact that I knew that former Justice Ja’neh was liable along with the entire bench, I did not decide to vote for his removal as I still feel he should not have been removed because we need a critical voice.”
Even though he voted to remove Ja’neh, the Maryland County Senator regrets the outcome of the voting process.
“My only regret I have honestly in my heart is that is the results we have now. I wish we did not have it. I feel deep in my heart that we need to protect our democracy and to do that we need a critical voice on that bench.
“Even if nine of us still voted in favor, the result would not have changed; we needed one more person. Sincerely, I regret the fact that we could not save the Judiciary. Nobody would have come to me with money because they knew my position.”
The Maryland Senator believes that the independence of the Legislature is a work in progress, admitting that this independence is still far from being achieved.
“Before the 2017 election, many of us saw the need to make the Senate an independent body. We went for a mini retreat. What I desire is for the Senate to be independent and not necessarily mean fighting the Executive.
“We must have independence, that’s how I want the Senate to be. If issues come for debate, we debate them and let the public know we are debating issues. We need to safeguard the institutions that protect our democracy.”
“There is still much room for improvement because I feel my colleagues and I have some works to do in terms of independence. Judging from my understanding of independence, we are not there yet,” Brown admitted.

By Matters India Reporter |
Kochi, March 5, 2019: Bishop Jacob Manathodath, apostolic administrator of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, on April 5 submitted to Rome the enquiry report on the controversial land sale.
The administrator handed over the report to Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, the prefect of the Pontifical Congregation for Oriental Churches, in the Vatican, says a press release from Father Paul Karendan, the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese’s Public Relations Officer.
Cardinal Sandri and Bishop Manathodath spent two hours discussing the land sale controversy as well as court case on fake documents against Cardinal Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church, the larger of the two Oriental Catholic rites in India.
The 75-year-old Argentinian cardinal said he would study the report seriously and take appropriate action. Until then, the Vatican official wants the content of the report kept confidential, the PRO’s note says quoting Bishop Manathodath.
A series of real estate transactions since 2015 reportedly resulted in financial losses for the archdiocese. On November 29, 2017, Cardinal Alencherry set up a committee to investigate. The committee submitted its report on January 4, 2018
The city police initiated an investigation into the real estate transactions after a private citizen, a lay Catholic, lodged a complaint against Cardinal Alencherry, two priests, and a real estate agent.
The Kerala High Court observed that there was prima facie evidence to indicate criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and misappropriation of money. The court also found the complainant had standing to bring the lawsuit because the property at issue was not private property, but assets held in trust with Cardinal Alencherry as caretaker.
Pope Francis on June 22, 2018, appointed Bishop Manathodath as the apostolic administrator of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese.
His appointment, according to Cardinal Sandri, reflected Vatican concern about the real estate transactions as well as “ecclesiastical division” among the clergy and bishops in the archdiocese."
"US sanctions two companies, tanker involved in Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba",gnnliberia.com,Cholo Brooks,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://gnnliberia.com/2019/04/06/us-sanctions-two-companies-tanker-involved-in-venezuelan-oil-shipments-to-cuba/,"Home United States US sanctions two companies, tanker involved in Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba US sanctions two companies, tanker involved in Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba April 6, 2019 Cholo Brooks United States 0 New U.S. Sanctions Seek to Block Venezuelan Oil Shipments to Cuba – The New York Times
WASHINGTON – The Trump administration on Friday levied sanctions against two foreign-owned companies and one tanker involved in the regular shipment of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, the latest in a series of escalating measures to bring pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The sanctions block all U.S.-based assets from and prohibit any dollar transactions with properties owned by the companies, based in Liberia and Greece, along with the Liberian-flagged tanker. An additional 34 ships owned by Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, were blocked
A senior administration official emphasized that the measures were “the first step” to prevent Venezuela from shipping oil, its primary asset, overseas.
“We are continuing to tighten the noose of the financial strangulation of Maduro and his cronies,” said the official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity set by the administration.
The sanctions are aimed as much at Cuba as Venezuela. For the past 20 years, the two countries have had an arrangement whereby Venezuela sends free and subsidized oil to financially strapped Cuba in exchange for the services of Cuban doctors, teachers, and military and security agents.
The administration has said thousands of Cubans are embedded throughout the Venezuelan military and intelligence agencies, where they control and spy on Venezuelan officers. U.S. officials have expressed frustration at the failure of more than a slow trickle of Venezuelan security forces to defect from the Maduro government to support Juan Guaido, the president of the Legislative Assembly whom the United States and dozens of other countries in late January recognized as the interim president.
Although Venezuela once supplied Cuba with as much as 100,000 barrels of oil per day, that rate has dropped precipitously, to 50,000 barrels or less. The opposition, still powerless to enforce its will, voted last month to stop the Cuba deal completely; Guaido, the administration official said, had requested the sanctions.
U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this year prevent PDVSA from collecting money for any oil shipped to the United States, which once imported more than a third of its exports. Overall Venezuelan oil exports have fallen to about 500,000 barrels a day. Much of it goes to Russia and China, although India has been the largest importer in recent months.
The immediate goal of the new sanctions, the administration official said, is to put pressure on the Cuba-Venezuela partnership. “There is going to be a recalibration of that relationship,” the official said.
But a broader objective is to “make things more radioactive” in the shipping industry, said Russ Dallen, a Florida-based managing partner at the brokerage Caracas Capital Markets.
“Most ships, ones not owned by Cuba or Venezuela, are like Uber drivers,” Dallen said. “The computer says ‘here’s the closest ship,’ and you book it.” In the future, “anybody who goes to Venezuela to pick up or drop off” oil, or goes to Cuba, “is going to be wary that they’re going to be sanctioned.”
The newly sanctioned companies are Ballito Bay Shipping, based in Monrovia, Liberia; and ProPer In Management, based in Pireaeus, the Athens port. Ballito owns the tanker, the Despina Andrianna, and ProPer is its operator, according to a Treasury Department statement.
In recent months, the ship has made regular deliveries from Venezuela’s Jose offshore loading dock to Cuba. According to shipping trackers, it is en route to Jose.
Tracking information lists no previous port of call for the ship. Dallen said ships carrying Venezuelan oil have begun turning off their transponders to make locating them more difficult to track – a tactic that Iran also has used to avoid sanctions.
The administration has said its current policy to push Maduro from office is centered on diplomatic and economic measures.
But “there is also a military option, which President Trump has said is on the table and remains on the table,” the administration official said, calling it “obviously, a very serious option . . . that no one would likely to see, but clearly one that is seriously considered as events continue to unfold.”
Maduro has arrested senior opposition officials and threatened Guaido, who the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court has banned from leaving the country. Guaido has called for supporters to take to the streets Saturday in a major anti-government demonstration.
Past such actions have led to violence as masked paramilitary forces, called “colectivos,” have attacked demonstrators.
“We’re watching very closely tomorrow,” the official said, calling on the Venezuelan military to “uphold their constitutional duty” to protect Venezuelans against what he called colectivo “terrorists.”"

The worst thing that can happen now is that people become just so damn bored of Brexit that they throw in the towel Click to followThe Independent Voices The inaptly named Huw Merriman, a Conservative MP, says that Brexit stress and abuse from the public has triggered a rapid loss of weight . Merriman, the parliamentary private secretary to chancellor Philip Hammond, told the BBC Radio 5 Live’s Drive programme that someone had suggested he should be “shot” for “treason”. He added: “Do you know what? I’ve lost a lot of weight, which might be a good thing. I’ve gone from over a 34 to almost under a 30 now. Actually, that’s purely down to what’s going on.” I sympathise. But we need more Brexit, not less. So thanks, Jeremy Corbyn for collapsing your talks with the government ( near enough ), which means we’ll not be leaving the EU “early” on 12 April (or late, depending on your point of view). And thanks to Yvette Cooper for virtually outlawing a no-deal Brexit . We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

Thank you, then, for a whole extra year of Brexit under the one-year “flextension”. By this time next year the 2016 referendum result will be almost four years old. The mandate is getting mouldy. Watch more Leaving the EU has already left Britain crippled for good Brexit is disappearing fast in the rearview mirror. Why, even Theresa May now says we’re going to have European elections too. Can you imagine the fun there? The first seats for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Under proportional representation they don’t necessarily split the vote (although if they poll badly they may live to regret standing against one another). Much the same goes for the new Independent Group/Change UK, pitching for much the same voters as the Lib Dems. They could do rather well also, taking an alternative message to Strasbourg and Brussels. I can hear you lot groaning. “Brexit fatigue” is what they call it, a nasty disease with many of the symptoms of narcolepsy. It is spreading across Britain and indeed the continent. Cases have been reported in Brussels, Berlin and Dublin. Even Jean-Claude Juncker himself has declared himself suffering the typical symptoms of becoming tired and emotional after excessive exposure to the Malthouse Compromise (a political term, not a type of ale). Well, the worst thing that can happen now is that people become just so damn bored of Brexit that they “throw in the towel”.

I agree. I am on your side.” As if. I wonder what she’ll try next? “I’ve got your kids”? Watch more Will May and Corbyn conspire to scupper a Final Say referendum? Getting fed up with Brexit is the last thing we should be doing. Indeed, that truth would apply now to both sides of the debate, both armies in this war of attrition. Remainers suffered under the constant bombardment of “Brexit means Brexit” until suddenly it didn’t. Now it is the Leavers’ turn to feel that sense of dread that their own dream is being pushed further and further towards the horizon. Well, the future of the country is worth getting a bit bored about, don’t you think? Do you really, for example, want to see much of the manufacturing industry, British agriculture and the City destroyed because we couldn’t be arsed to put up some resistance to a no-deal Brexit? Or, being fair, would you prefer to see our United Kingdom permanently under the domination of foreign powers just because you’d rather watch a film than go out on a march, or something? Well quite. You would not want your condition of Brexit fatigue to transmute into Brexit psychosis, would you? And when businesses declare, as they so often do, that the worst thing is “uncertainty”, I beg to differ. If I was getting onto an aeroplane say (no names, no pack drill) I would be much happier being suspended in a state of modest uncertainty as to whether I would get to my destination than the certainty that it was going to crash just so I could plan for it. I’m sure you agree: certainty can be overrated. The way to cure Brexit fatigue is as follows. First, stop going round in circles. Virtually everything now proposed to break the deadlock – talks with Corbyn, a Brexit extension, and indicative votes in the Commons – have been tried before with varying degrees of success. May’s tactics of running down the clock and threatening the other side of the debate have failed. Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds Second, realise that there is no such thing as a soft Brexit. By which I mean that every variation on it is a mere variety of the well-known conundrum of the UK becoming “rule-taker not rule breaker” – the vassal state, as Jacob Rees-Mogg used to call it. The only choice is between a buccaneering, Singapore model, turbo-charged Thatcherite free market hard Brexit; or staying in. If there was a preferential voting system for Brexit I would opt for: 1) Remain; 2) Hard WTO Brexit; 3) May deal/Norway/European Economic Area, etc. It is perfectly logical to hold such a view. A Leaver, by the same token, might prefer to stay in the EU rather than accept May’s deal because at least you can possibly leave the EU – but you cannot necessarily unilaterally leave the backstop in the current withdrawal agreement. Some Brexit options, both sides should agree, represent the worst of all worlds. When the Archbishop of Canterbury and other well-meaning souls talk of “compromise” it all sounds terribly reasonable – but it makes no real sense in reality. It all reinforces the case for making a decision – either in parliament or in a second referendum or both – via preferential voting rather than binary choices. If you can pick a second- or third-choice dish from a restaurant menu then you can handle a ballot paper asking you to rank your preferences. (If you wish. You can just put one choice down anyway.) Thus you will be well on the road to recovery when you realise that the best hope of ending the agony is for the people to finish off the dirty job they gave our MPs back in 2016, and which they, entirely honourably, have failed to discharge. Leavers are now talking about the Leave case for a second referendum. Even though I am unsympathetic to their cause these days, I think it would only be democratic to allow for “WTO Brexit” – a hard Brexit – onto the ballot paper, alongside something like the May deal and the Remain option. That would bring closure, allay the fevers and end Brexit fatigue. I leave you, then, with the words of Uncle Donald: “Even if the hope for a final success may seem frail, even illusory, and although Brexit fatigue is increasingly visible and justified, we cannot give up seeking – until the very last moment – a positive solution.” We should all agree on that. Electorate: heal thyself."

BY PHILIP VANDER ELST Author’s note : This article was originally published in the London based Bruges Group on 17 November 2015 just before our famous Brexit Referendum vote of 23 June 2016.
“The basic question is whether Britain should remain an independent country or become a province in a United States of ‘Europe’. No criticism is levelled at those who genuinely advocate the latter course; at least it is an honest recognition of the total implication of belonging to the Common Market. But every form of criticism should be made of those who avoid the issue, who wilfully conceal it with honeyed words, or who simply don’t bother to study the reality.”
These accurate and prophetic words were written as long ago as 1974, by Neil Marten MP, one of the first and greatest Tory opponents of British involvement in the European project, in his pamphlet, The Common Market: No Middle Way, published in London by the Common Market Safeguards Campaign. In the ensuing four decades, the British political and media establishment has, with rare exceptions, continued to “avoid the issue” and “wilfully conceal it with honeyed words.” The anti-democratic and illiberal origins of the European project
To understand the anti-democratic origins and illiberal character of the European project, one needs to appreciate the traumatic psychological impact of the First and Second World Wars on the thinking of a significant section of the European elite. Horrified by the scale of the destruction they witnessed between 1914 and 1945, and by the rise of Fascism and Nazism in the interwar period, the pioneers of European integration drew two erroneous lessons from these events. The first was that ‘nationalism’ was an inherently evil force, which could not be contained and defeated unless the nations of Europe could be induced to sacrifice their national sovereignty in the interests of peace. The second was that democracy could not be relied upon to build a better future, since millions of Germans and Italians had voted for Hitler and Mussolini, and millions of other Europeans had supported authoritarian nationalist movements in other parts of Europe, including Spain, Hungary, Romania, and even France. For these reasons, they concluded, the creation of a new European State was not only a necessary objective of civilized statesmanship; it was also a goal which, in its initial stages, would have to be approached by stealth, so as not to upset the national sensitivities of the unenlightened majority.
To quote just one of these pioneers of European integration, Peter (later Lord) Thorneycroft, a British Conservative politician who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in the late 1950s and Conservative Party Chairman in 1975: “…it is as well to state this bluntly at the outset – no government dependent upon a democratic vote could possibly agree in advance to the sacrifices any adequate plan [for European Union] must involve. The people must be led slowly and unconsciously into the abandonment of their traditional economic defences…” (Quote from his pamphlet, Design for Europe, May/June 1947).
The long and tortuous process by which this goal of European unification by stealth has been pursued, including a lengthy analysis of its historical and intellectual origins, and its chief protagonists, is described in compelling and scholarly detail by Christopher Booker and Richard North, in their widely acclaimed book, The Great Deception, (Continuum, 2005). They show how the supra-nationalist project of the European Union’s founding fathers has advanced by a gradual and indirect process of economic integration. The most important initial stage was the 1957 Treaty of Rome, establishing a protectionist European customs union (the European Economic Community, or EEC) consisting of West Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg. Today, 56 years and 5 European treaties later, the European Union has ballooned into a supranational Leviathan comprising 28 countries and 24 official languages. (See: europa.eu, the official EU website). The cost so far of in terms of loss of sovereignty
Whether they like it or not, Britons and other European nationals already live in an emergent European State with a common flag, passport, citizenship, anthem, supreme court, executive, parliament, bureaucracy, central bank, and currency (the euro), used by 19 of the member countries, excluding Britain. The foundations have been laid for a future European Army and police force, and the European Union now has its own official diplomatic corps. As a result of all these changes and the development of common European policies in nearly every conceivable field, Britain, for example, has lost control of her agriculture, her fishing grounds, her external trade, decisions about Value Added Tax, aspects of employment law, immigration, and internal trading standards – including weights and measures. Most recently, under the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, which extended ‘Qualified Majority Voting’ [abolishing national vetoes] into 63 new policy areas, the EU has been given new powers over external border controls and internal security, as well as a role in standardizing civil and criminal laws and procedures. It has, in addition, been allowed to appoint its own EU foreign minister, who will conduct the Union’s common foreign and security policy.
In 1992, the then German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, declared: “The European Union Treaty [referring to the 1991 Maastricht Treaty]…within a few years will lead to the creation of what the founding fathers of modern Europe dreamed of after the war, the United States of Europe.” (Quoted in Treaty of Maastricht, Civitas, London, November 2005). Readers can judge for themselves how close the rolling bandwagon of European supranationalism has come to reaching this final destination.
A loss of democratic control previously enjoyed by national electorates over the laws and regulations governing their daily lives, has been an inevitable consequence of the centralizing supranationalist process of European unification. For instance, despite being one of the biggest EU member states, Britain’s decision-making power within EU institutions like the Council of the European Union (representing national governments) and the European Parliament, is extremely limited. British representatives only control around 8% of the total votes. As the European Union expands to include more countries, this loss of democratic accountability through the dilution of national representation at European level, only increases, a problem troubling other European nationals as well as many British observers.
To quote the words of Germany’s former President Herzog, written in January 2007: “It is true that we are experiencing an ever greater, inappropriate centralization of powers away from the Member States and towards the EU. The German Ministry of Justice has compared the legal acts adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany between 1998 and 2004 with those adopted by the European Union in the same period. Results: 84% come from Brussels, with only 16% coming originally from Berlin…” (Article on the 2004 EU Constitution, jointly written with Luder Gerken, Welt Am Sonntag, 14 January 2007).
Whilst popular disenchantment with the process of European integration has increased markedly in recent years, most of all in Britain, the latter’s subordination of national institutions to supranational ones has evoked less opposition than might otherwise have been expected, due to its largely hidden nature. As Mark Leonard, of the Centre for European Reform, explained in 2005: “Europe’s power is easy to miss. Like an ‘invisible hand’ it operates through the shell of traditional political structures. The British House of Commons, British law courts and British civil servants are still here, but they have become agents of the European Union, implementing European law. This is no accident. By creating common standards that are implemented through national institutions, Europe can take over countries without necessarily becoming a target for hostility.” (Booker & North, Op. cit, p. 1).
Resistance to the growing power of the European Union is not only undermined by its partially hidden character, but also by a deep-seated conviction, particularly strong in Germany, that the cause of peace is worth almost any sacrifice of national sovereignty, however initially unwelcome. The visitor centre in the European Parliament building in Brussels, for instance, prominently displays the following quote by Philip Kerr (later, Lord Lothian), a former British civil servant and one of the leading advocates of both European unification and world government during the 1930s (see Booker & North, Op. cit, pp. 24 – 26): “National sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time and of the steady march of humanity back to tragic disaster and barbarism…The only final remedy for this supreme and catastrophic evil of our time is a federal union of the peoples..” The myth about national sovereignty being the cause of war
There is, however, no basis either in history or logic for the belief that national sovereignty is “the root cause” of war and “barbarism”. Religious and ideological divisions, and the dynastic ambitions and family quarrels of emperors and kings, caused plenty of wars in Europe (and elsewhere) long before the advent of the modern nation state. If any one factor can be singled out as the primary cause of war and barbarism down the ages, it has not been national sovereignty, but tyrannical government and the lust for power of rulers and elites, as all the great classical liberals – notably Herbert Spencer, recognized. This has been even truer in the 20 th century, the age of totalitarian socialism in all its variants – Communist, Nazi and Fascist. Anyone who doubts this, should not only read R. J. Rummel’s seminal studies, Death by Government and Power Kills (Transaction Publishers, 1996 & 1997), but also The Coming of the Third Reich, (Penguin Books, 2004), by Richard Evans, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge. Evans’ book is particularly relevant because it shows that Imperial Germany’s authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and aggressively militaristic political culture was the biggest single cause of the First World War as well as the soil in which the seeds of Nazism were planted long before Hitler came to power in 1933.
Since illiberal political cultures are the real enemies of peace and freedom, rather than national sovereignty, the cause of progress is not advanced by the movement towards supranationalism either at the European or the global level. A Europe of independent self-governing nation states, respecting human rights and engaged in free trade and mutual co-operation on an intergovernmental basis, decentralizes power and offers many opportunities for the free movement of goods, people and ideas. As such, it represents the enduring internationalist vision of the great classical liberals of the 19 th century, like Cobden, Bright and Bastiat. The supranationalist alternative of a single European State, by contrast, threatens both liberty and democracy because it creates a new and wholly unnecessary concentration of power which cannot be subject to effective democratic control within a multinational entity comprising 28 different electorates divided by 24 different languages and cultures. As American experience has shown, even the most carefully constructed federal system, buttressed by an originally homogeneous and libertarian political culture, has failed to prevent the growth and abuse of power by the Federal Government in the USA. How likely is it, then, that the European Union will avoid a much worse fate given the authoritarian and collectivist political traditions, and unfortunate history, of so many of its member countries?
The relevance of this question is underlined by what happened after May and June 2005, when the French and Dutch electorates rejected the newly negotiated 2004 European Constitution in their national referendums. The angry and contemptuous response of EU leaders was to re-present the rejected Constitution, minus some cosmetic changes, as the 2008 Lisbon Treaty, and then ram it through their national parliaments without any further referendums. As Czech President Vaclav Klaus noted with disquiet in his speech to the European Parliament on 5 December 2008: “I thought…that we live in a democracy, but it is post-democracy, really, which rules the EU.”
Today, in 2015, post-democracy still “rules the EU” because the continuing process of European unification has created centralized supranational institutions offering increased power and more lucrative careers to the ruling political class. Consequently, as long as it remains in its present form, pursuing its founding goal of “an ever closer union of the peoples of Europe” (Treaty of Rome), the EU will continue to act as a powerful and dangerous magnet, pulling into its orbit, and attracting to its cause, thousands of ambitious politicians, academics, civil servants, and journalists, as well as a host of charities and NGOs whose independence has been compromised by their receipt of EU funding (see: Christopher Snowdon, Euro Puppets, The European Commission’s remaking of civil society, IEA , February 2013). The liberal internationalist alternative to European unification
If, given these dangers, we want to free ourselves from the supranationalist spider’s web of the European Union, and by doing so, contribute to the wider defence of democracy and liberty in Europe, we must rediscover that great old tradition of liberal internationalism mentioned above. We must turn our faces outwards towards what Churchill famously called “the open seas”, conscious of the fact that Britain is a major global trading nation and nuclear power, a ‘Permanent Member’ of the UN Security Council, a key member of NATO, and a significant player in 96 separate international organisations. Furthermore, as Ewen Stewart’s recent Bruges Group paper, Britain’s Global Leadership: the positive future for a UK outside the EU , demonstrates in exhaustive and convincing detail, our economy – including our trade with Europe – is not dependent on our continued membership of the European Union, whose share of world GDP and global trade is in any case steadily shrinking. Not only is the UK “home to the world’s global language, the world’s most global city and many of the most notable global universities and research institutes,” to quote Ewen Stewart’s study, but “As the world’s 5 th largest economy, Britain will not be isolated by leaving the EU. On the contrary, British power would, in some cases, be enhanced. For example, we would swap our 12% EU voting weight at the World Trade Organisation for a 100% British vote.”
We must not only be unafraid of a future outside the European Union. We should positively embrace it, because in rejecting the supranationalist goal of a European State, we would be defending the pluralism and diversity which has been the true glory of European civilization. As Wilhelm Ropke, one of Germany’s greatest liberal economists put it in the 1950s: “In antiquity Strabo spoke of the ‘many shapes’ of Europe; Montesquieu would speak of Europe as a ‘nation des nations’; Decentrism is of the essence of the spirit of Europe. To try to organise Europe centrally…and to weld it into a bloc, would be nothing less than a betrayal of Europe and the European patrimony.” (Wilhelm Ropke, A Humane Economy, Henry Regnery, 1 st English edition, USA, 1960).

CHRIS EDWARDS, CATO INSTITUTE
Housing prices have soared in many U.S. and international cities, which has generated affordability problems for middle- and lower-income families. An article in the Wall Street Journal today by Laura Kusisto and Peter Grant notes, “Across 32 major cities around the world, real home prices on average grew 24% over the last five years.”
Kusisto and Grant imply that the blame should be shared: “Governments haven’t had the money to subsidize new supply … The private sector has also fallen short.” And they say, “But no approach has solved the crises and most have other negative ripple effects.”
But then the reporters undercut their own narratives with news about Tokyo: But one major city has had stable housing prices as a result of pumping out housing supply to keep up with rising demand. Tokyo is one of the few cities in which supply has kept up with demand, keeping a crisis from developing. But that is due largely to deregulated housing policies that other countries would have a hard time reproducing. “It goes against the notion of planning and developing cities in an orderly fashion,” said Laurence Troy, research fellow at the City Futures Research Centre of the University of New South Wales, Australia.
So maybe the idea of imposing top-down “order” is harmful. If the government gets out of the way, businesses can invest, supply will increase, and prices will be restrained.
Not only will supply increase, but Kusisto and Grant report that businesses in deregulated markets respond to the high-price problem by innovating to cut construction costs. Thus, the private sector is not “falling short” in places where it is allowed to work its magic.
On the next page in the Journal today, River Davis reiterates these points in her report on Tokyo’s relatively free housing markets: In the past two decades, home prices in some leading North American and European cities have skyrocketed. In Tokyo, however, they’ve flatlined. So why no affordable-housing crisis in Japan? A big factor, experts say, is the country’s relatively deregulated housing policies, which have allowed housing supply to keep up with demand in the 21st century. With no rent controls and fewer restrictions on height and density, Tokyo appears to be a city where the market is under control—where supply is keeping home prices from rising as drastically as they have in many other major world cities. … Japan’s current level of housing supply is tied to a package of policy changes—implemented around the turn of the century—that were aimed at restoring the profitability of Japan’s land-development industry, according to Andre Sorensen, a professor of urban geography and a Japan housing expert at the University of Toronto Scarborough. The Japanese government began relaxing regulations that had restricted supply, allowing taller and denser buildings in Japan’s capital. Private consultants were given permission to issue building permits to speed up construction. “This created something like a free-trade zone in Tokyo,” Mr. Sorensen said.
With deregulation has come business innovation, which has further restrained prices: Two of Japan’s largest housing construction companies, Daiwa House Industry Co. and Sekisui House Ltd, both say that the easing of land and construction regulations has helped them build in Tokyo. The companies say that deregulation has benefited them particularly in their ability to expand housing units by replacing low-rise residential complexes with much higher ones. “A good environment for housing construction is being created,” says Daiwa House managing executive officer Yoshinori Ariyoshi. To deal with rising construction fees, Mr. Ariyoshi says Japan may have to rely more on prefabricated homes to provide affordable housing. He estimates that about 20% of the country’s homes are already being assembled in increasingly automated factories.

Dairy Farmer Wins First Round to Say that Skim Milk is Skim Milk,selfeducatedamerican.com,SMF,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://selfeducatedamerican.com/2019/04/05/dairy-farmer-wins-first-round-to-say-that-skim-milk-is-skim-milk/,"Dairy Farmer Wins First Round to Say that Skim Milk is Skim Milk 2019-04-05
ANDREW WIMER, INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE
Harrisburg, Pa.— A federal judge in Pennsylvania denied the Food and Drug Administration’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit about whether additive-free skim milk can be labeled and sold as “skim milk.” Current FDA regulations require farmers to add synthetic vitamins into skim milk before sale. Maryland dairy farmer Randy Sowers wants to sell all-natural skim milk without additives. However, the FDA forces him to label his product as “imitation skim milk.” Randy has partnered with the Institute for Justice (IJ) to protect his First Amendment right to accurately label his milk.
“Businesses have the right to tell the truth,” said IJ senior attorney Justin Pearson, “and the government does not have the power to change the dictionary.”
In her decision , U.S. District Judge Yvette Kane agreed with Randy that his suit had merit and would prevent potential harm to his business: “A ruling in Plaintiff’s favor would permit Plaintiff to proceed with its plan to sell additive-free skim milk in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without having to use the ‘imitation’ label to which it objects. Thus, the Court finds that the utility of a judgment on Plaintiff’s claims would be substantial.”
The Sowers family operates South Mountain Creamery on their dairy farm near Frederick, Md. The creamery produces delicious milk, yogurt and cheese. In 2017 Randy contacted the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to find out whether he could sell all-natural skim milk without added chemicals as “skim milk” in Pennsylvania. State officials have no objection to the commonsense use of the term, “skim milk,” but because Randy wants to sell in multiple states, they are forced to follow federal regulations. To protect his right to accurately label his product, Randy and IJ filed suit in April 2018.
“The FDA has defined the product ‘skim milk’ as having three ingredients,” explained IJ attorney Anya Bidwell. “The first ingredient is skim milk, and the other two are additives. Skim milk without the additives is safe to drink and legal to sell, but you are not allowed to call it what it is.”

Norco Homeowner Fights Back With Lawsuit After City Attempts to Take His Home,selfeducatedamerican.com,SMF,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://selfeducatedamerican.com/2019/04/05/norco-fights-back-with-lawsuit-after-city-attempts-to-take-his-home/,"Norco Homeowner Fights Back With Lawsuit After City Attempts to Take His Home 2019-04-05 Institute for Justice for-profit law firm’s attempt to collect more than $60,000 in attorney fees after it lost in court
Conor Beck, Institute for Justice
Two years ago, Norco homeowner Ron Mugar received a notice indicating he had violated the city’s housing code. Ron had admittedly allowed his home and backyard to become cluttered with hobby machinery. But this time, instead of fining him or asking him to bring his property up to code, the city’s private, for-profit prosecutors—lawyers with the firm of Dapeer, Rosenblit & Litvak LLP—declared they were going to take over ownership of his house using a legal process known as “receivership.”
Ron cleaned up his yard, hired a lawyer, and fought back in court—spending his hard-earned savings to defend himself—and won. Ron’s attorney got the receivership halted without a receiver ever doing any work or taking the property. Ron then brought the property into full compliance. Ron also fought the private prosecutor’s demands that he fix things for which he was never actually cited.
The court eventually ruled that Ron had brought his property into compliance and it then vacated the receivership order. But that didn’t stop the city’s hired lawyers from seeking more than $60,000 from Ron in attorneys’ fees. Attempting to collect attorneys’ fees for a prosecution that the city lost is patently illegal, which is why Ron has partnered with the Institute for Justice to put an end to the city’s use of private lawyers to enforce municipal code violations once and for all.
“Ron has always followed orders to comply—there was no need to threaten to take his home. Moreover, it’s unconscionable that he is facing crippling fees after successfully fighting back,” said Joshua House, an attorney at the Institute for Justice, which represents Ron. “By penalizing people for defending their property rights, Norco is violating Ron’s constitutional right to defend himself in court.”
House continued: “There is an old saying that ‘to the victor go the spoils.’ But in Norco, the lawyers working for the city seem to think that’s reversed. They lost in court, but they are nevertheless attempting to recover outrageously large attorneys’ fees. That’s because Norco’s scheme of using a private law firm creates perverse incentives to maximize profits, rather than efficiently and justly enforce the city’s municipal code.”
Receiverships were once intended to be a tool of last resort—meant to fix homes that posed a danger to the health and safety of the community. Receivership laws allow a city to take possession of a home, fix it up and then charge the original owner for the cost of repairs. If the homeowner cannot pay those costs, the receiver sells the home.
But now, an increasing number of California cities are empowering private, for-profit law firms to use receivership laws address minor code violations by threatening to take away residents’ homes. In the process of doing so, these firms charge enormous, sometimes bankruptcy-inducing amounts of money for their “services.” And the more they fine and charge homeowners, the more money they make.
Moreover, California courts don’t allow private, for-profit law firms to prosecute nuisance violations and then seek fees from those they prosecute. The Due Process Clauses of the United States and California Constitutions require city attorneys to be neutral, without a financial stake in the cases they bring. But in Norco, they have a strong financial incentive to seek unnecessary receiverships.
“Norco’s receivership scheme is unconstitutional,” said IJ attorney Jeffrey Redfern. “Both the U.S. and California Constitutions give citizens the right to face a neutral prosecutor and judicial system. By introducing a profit incentive to the system, Norco and the private lawyers it has hired have created an illegal incentive to rack up fines and legal fees, rather than neutrally enforce the city’s laws.”
This is not the first time IJ has sued to stop private prosecutors from abusing citizens’ constitutional rights. In nearby Indio, California, the city had hired a law firm called Silver and Wright LLP to enforce its municipal code. There, the lawyers charged an elderly woman nearly $6,000 in attorneys’ fees because her tenants were keeping chickens in their backyard. Indio no longer uses the firm for prosecution, and it has agreed to settle the lawsuit.
The Institute for Justice has been at the forefront of fighting efforts by the government to use fines, fees and civil forfeiture to raise revenue. Most recently, it secured a unanimous victory at the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states cannot impose excessive fines.

"2019 iPhone rumors: Everything we know about Apple's new phones, including two-way wireless charging.",slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/2019-iphone-rumors-apple-wireless-charging.html,"It’s Time for the Heroic Male Paleontologist Trope to Go Extinct In March, Apple announced a host of new products , including its bundled news subscription service Apple News+, a virtual arcade, a phone-integrated credit card, and an on-demand TV service. As Will Oremus argued in Slate, the announcements were a sign that the company is reimagining itself as the “ ultimate middleman .” But Apple is still set to return to its hardware roots in September when it unveils a new line of devices. Apple is expected to release three new phones in the fall, along with making updates to existing models. We’ve previously heard that some of the models may have three rear-facing cameras, 3D depth sensors, and perhaps Apple Pencil functionality. Now that we’re about six months away from this year’s reveal, here’s a roundup of the latest leaks and rumors. Two-Way Wireless Charging Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, typically one of the main sources of early information about new iPhones, suggests that the 2019 releases will have two-way charging . That means the phones would be able to wirelessly charge other devices, such as AirPods or another iPhone. Samsung’s 2019 Galaxy smartphones have a similar feature called Wireless Powershare, which allows them to charge phones and other accessories. It’s possible that the new iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR may also have this functionality. Bigger Batteries Speaking of battery life: The most recent versions of the iPhone could be getting a nice boost. According to Kuo , the successor to the iPhone XS may get a 25 percent increase in battery life, and the XS Max successor could get a 15 percent increase. According to Tom’s Guide , the XS has around a 9½-hour battery life right now, while the XS Max already lasts for around 10½ hours. The XR’s battery life is around 11½ hours, which should stay the same in the new iteration. Updated Face ID Bloomberg reports that the new iPhones will improve their Face ID capability and the 3D camera that powers it. The camera, which can execute three-dimensional scans of its surroundings, currently has a 25- to 50-centimeter range. Sources familiar with Apple’s plans say that the new camera will be able to operate with a 15-foot range. The ID’s sensors themselves will also reportedly be better able to adapt to interference from invisible lights with the help of a more powerful laser . USB-C? Previous reports had indicated that some versions of the iPhone would finally jump on the bandwagon and feature a USB-C port. The move would make the devices compatible with more accessories and chargers. However, Japanese publication Mac Otakara recently disputed those rumors, reporting instead that the devices would still retain the far-less-ubiquitous Lightning port functionality. As Christina Bonnington wrote for Slate last August, while arguing for Apple to make the switch:
The move to USB-C would have benefits both in unifying and simplifying Apple’s product lines and in unifying the smartphone space as a whole. While it may initially be a hassle for those who’ve accumulated a multitude of Lightning accessories over the years, the switch would be good in the long run by simplifying the masses of cords and accessories we use with our tablets, notebooks, and smartphones and hastening adoption by other hardware makers. It’s high time USB-C fulfilled its destiny. It needs to be mass-adopted before squabbling over the next major connectivity standard comes along. It remains to be seen what the charging options on the final product will actually consist of, but there’s a good chance that you may have to buy a Lightning to USB converter. Better Wireless Connectivity The new phones will likely have faster LTE speeds and Wi-Fi 6 and UWB connectivity. This will improve navigation and operability of augmented reality features. The Wi-Fi 6 capabilities, if true, should be especially impressive, since it will allow the iPhone to have 30 percent faster internet speeds compared with what’s currently available. Only time will tell whether these new bells and whistles will be enough to entice consumers to abandon their current iPhone models and pay what’s likely to be around $1,000 for the next-generation devices. However, Apple’s iPhone sales have been leveling off as of late, so the company is likely hedging its bets as it moves more aggressively into service-oriented products, such as the news subscription bundle and credit card. The iPhone has long been Apple’s backbone, but it’s become clear that the company needs to diversify."
