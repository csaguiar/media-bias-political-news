One of the best safeguards against error is consideration of alternative arguments and viewpoints. An African-American, skeptic, Yale graduate from New York City seems more likely on the surface to present such arguments and viewpoints than a religious midwestern graduate of a midwestern law school. He also might have a wider range of experience relevant to the judicial system. Although I consider my basic inclination to be pretty much libertarian/conservative, I think I would lean toward choosing the black Yale graduate. At worst, his Federalist Society affiliation would be an attempt to mislead, and more likely an indication of openness to viewpoints different from those common where he grew up. It should be possible in an interview to figure out which.
Of course, the African American from New York might be from a family whose considerable wealth goes back several generations. It would be unwise to assume very much from complexion."
