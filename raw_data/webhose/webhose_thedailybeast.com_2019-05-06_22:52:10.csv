"Bernie Sanders’ Fox News Town Hall Was a Ratings Smash, as Pete Buttigieg and Other Democrats Consider One.",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-fox-news-town-hall-was-a-ratings-smash-as-pete-buttigieg-and-other-democrats-consider-one,"CHANGING TIDE Bernie’s Fox News Town Hall Was a Ratings Smash. More Dems May Follow Him There. At least four Democratic presidential campaigns have indicated interest in participating in a Fox News town hall or have begun discussions about doing one. Gideon Resnick 04.16.19 2:56 PM ET
Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) Monday evening Fox News town-hall event was the most-watched town-hall event of the 2020 campaign thus far, according to early Nielsen data. And at least four other Democratic candidates are open to participating in one of their own.
According to early Nielsen data, more than 2.5 million viewers tuned in to hear Sanders , a self-described “democratic socialist,” make his case on Fox News during the 6:30pm hour, prior to primetime. That total viewership bested CNN’s Bernie Sanders town-hall event from back in February; and it doubled MSNBC’s during the same time period on Monday evening, and nearly tripled CNN’s.
The prior town-hall ratings record for the 2020 cycle was a CNN-hosted event with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), which drew 1.95 million total viewers.
Additionally, per Nielsen, Fox’s Sanders event brought in 489,000 viewers between the ages of 25 and 54—a key demographic for cable-news advertisers—trouncing CNN’s 281,000 tally and MSNBC’s 208,000.
The event, which took place in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, saw the Vermont senator discuss a wide range of topics and occasionally spar with moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.
The Democratic National Committee banned the network from hosting one of its sanctioned debates, citing a New Yorker report on the network’s close ties to President Trump. But the success of Sanders’ town-hall event—both in terms of ratings and the headlines generated—comes as at least three other presidential campaigns consider being involved in a similar event.
South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in talks to participate in a Fox News town hall, a campaign aide told The Daily Beast, and he had been prior to the airing of Sanders’ event.
Meanwhile, the campaign for Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)—the latest entry into the crowded Democratic contest—said “he’s willing to do a Fox town hall, and we expect to start discussions with the network soon regarding a time and place.” Discussions about doing so have not yet begun, according to the campaign but Swalwell had previously told The Daily Beast that he makes efforts to appear on the network.
Julia Krieger, communications director for Rep. Tim Ryan’s (D-OH) presidential campaign said that he is also “willing to do a town hall with Fox News,” adding that “the campaign has reached out proactively to the network to express interest in this type of forum.” She said that the network had also reached out to them.
And Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Julián Castro's campaign told The Daily Beast that they are in conversations with the network as well.
""He’s been a red state mayor and has always campaigned hard for every single vote on both sides of the aisle and will do the same thing in his campaign for president of the United States because everybody counts,"" she said.
The network had previously said they hoped the DNC would reconsider its position on hosting a debate on Fox.
“We hope the DNC will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism, from moderating a Democratic presidential debate,” said Bill Sammon, Fox News’ senior vice president and D.C. managing editor. “They’re the best debate team in the business and they offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America, which includes many persuadable voters.”
Update 6:25 P.M.: This story was updated to reflect an additional statement from Castro's campaign."

Department of Homeland Security Advisory Panel Wants Congress To Make It Easier To Keep Migrant Kids Detained - The Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-advisory-panel-wants-congress-to-make-it-easier-to-keep-migrant-kids-detained,"FLORES Department of Homeland Security Advisory Panel Wants Congress To Make It Easier To Keep Migrant Kids Detained The group said current laws act as a ""magnet"" for migrant families seeking to cross illegally into the United States. 04.16.19 4:36 PM ET Edgard Garrido/Reuters
Members of the the Department of Homeland Security advisory council recommended Congress enact emergency legislation to make it easier for the Trump administration to detain children with their parents indefinitely, according to a draft report released to the acting secretary on Tuesday.
The council, which consists of a group of bipartisan members, provides the secretary with advice on how to approach policy decisions across a broad range of homeland security topics. A council subcommittee spent nearly seven months looking at the issue of the treatment of family and children on the southern border and conducted several site visits and conducted more than 100 interviews in the drafting of the report.
The report was formally released to Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan on an advisory council conference call Tuesday afternoon.
“[The report] is probably one of the most consequential reports issued in my time working with the council. The report is incredible,” said William Bratton, former commissioner for the New York City police departments on the conference call. “It paints a way forward in a way that we have not seen in any previous documents that I am aware of.”
The subcommittee recommended “emergency action” by Congress in an attempt to implement what the report dubbed as the “Flores Fix”.
The suggestion includes the the introduction and adoption of legislation that would roll back, not overturn, Flores vs. Reno, known as the Flores agreement, which in 1997 laid out a set of regulations for the detention of unaccompanied immigration children. In 2015, a California court ruled that Flores include children who traveled across the border with their parents. The committee recommended that Congress immediately roll back that decision.
“The magnet bringing these surges of family units from Central America is that under Flores, if they bring a child with them, that they will be able to enter the country, claim asylum and get priority and get released into this country,” said Karen Tandy, the former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the chair of the subcommittee. “And they are getting released into the country without the national security requirements being handled because there are too many of these people who have chosen this path. In part they chose this path because Flores made this possible.”
If legislation that limits Flores to unaccompanied minors is delayed in Congress, then “we recommend that this be done by emergency regulation.”
“The emergency regulation would recognize that, unlike [unaccompanied minors], in some cases family units must be held beyond 20 days,” the report said, adding that the detention could take longer because of issues with establishing identities, conducting interviews, ensuring a child’s healthcare is examined and/or keeping the family intact if it is ineligible for asylum.
The council’s subcommittee formed in the midst of heightened media coverage of the family separation crisis and just a few months after the Trump administration implemented its “zero tolerance policy”—a policy that aimed to criminally prosecute all adults suspected of crossing the southwest border.
Legal advocates and civil rights groups were quick to condemn the proposal, calling the potential modifications to Flores “really concerning.”
“The idea that we should be eliminating critical protections in our laws that are there to protect children and ensure that asylum seekers are protected is deeply problematic,” said Katharina Obser, senior policy advisory for migrant rights at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “It’s been incredibly well documented that DHS’s current family detention practices are traumatizing and harmful, and to allow families to be detained for an even longer period of time is really concerning.”
Laurence Benenson, the assistant director for immigration policy and advocacy at the National Immigration Forum, protested that the “indefinite detention of children with their families, potentially for years, is no ‘fix.’”
“The administration instead should employ alternatives to detention such as community supervision, case management programs or electronic monitoring,” Benenson said.
The administration’s interest in modifying Flores, Obser said, comes two years after it ended a case management program that ensured asylum-seeker compliance with court dates while also allowing family units to be together outside of a detention setting.
The program, which had compliance rates of more than 99 percent, “costs a fraction of any other approach that this administration has taken—not even to mention the emotional cost,” Obser said. “We’re taking about traumatizing, inhumane policies when there is this alternative that meets the government’s purposes and costs a fraction.”
Members of the committee who spoke to The Daily Beast over the last seven months told reporters that on their visits to the southern border they were immediately struck by the overwhelming number of children held in detention facilities, Beyond the sheer number of people held in detention, the members said they were even more disturbed by how long children were being held for processing and the conditions in which they lived.
The subcommittee found that more than 53,000 family units were apprehended on the southern border last month alone and that the number of family unit apprehensions “is likely to exceed 500,000 in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019.” Tandy said the subcommittee recommended the construction of an additional four regional processing centers along the border to help mitigate the flow of people trying to cross the border.
Customs and Border Control will “need to re-assign an increasing number of CBP officers stationed at ports of entry to assist the … in handling the surge in family unit migration,” the report said, adding that border patrol agents should take photographs and biometrics of children, of any age, to “stem the recycling of children at the border and to rapidly determine the legitimacy of parentage claims.”
The report also recommended Congress draft legislation that would allow asylum seekers access to a hearing or a decision on their claim within 20 or 30 days. A so-called “rocket docket”, with the addition of several hundred immigration judges, would accelerate the process for asylum claims of family units. The docket would move forward in tandem with the proposed Flores legislative change.
Members said the interim report will be shared with the White House and a longer, more comprehensive report will be released in May. READ THIS LIST"
FDA Orders End to U.S. Sales of Pelvic Mesh,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fda-orders-end-to-us-sales-of-pelvic-mesh,"an hour ago FDA Orders End to U.S. Sales of Pelvic Mesh
The final two medical device companies selling faulty surgical mesh meant to repair pelvic organ prolapse were ordered by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday to cease the products’ sale and distribution in the United States, The New York Times reports. The FDA issued the mandate against Boston Scientific and Coloplast in the wake of an extensive legal battle over the defective vaginal mesh. The synthetic implant is used in millions of women and is purported to strengthen atrophied pelvic muscles to prevent organs from dropping into the vaginal area. According to the FDA, more than 10,000 women with vaginal mesh have reported serious injury. As of last year, nearly 80 deaths had been linked to the use of the product. “In order for these mesh devices to stay on the market, we determined that we needed evidence that they worked better than surgery without the use of mesh to repair pelvic organ prolapse,” Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, told the Times . “We couldn’t assure women that these devices were safe and effective long term.” "
Lou Dobbs: ‘Political Decision’ to Rule Out Arson in Notre Dame Fire,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lou-dobbs-political-decision-to-rule-out-arson-in-notre-dame-cathedral-fire,"‘TAKING IT AS GOSPEL’ Lou Dobbs: ‘Political Decision’ to Rule Out Arson in Notre Dame Fire The Fox Business host wondered aloud how French officials investigating the cause of the blaze could have ruled out terrorism so quickly, pointing to a history of church vandalism. 04.16.19 9:40 PM ET Fox Business
Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs suggested Tuesday evening that French officials made a “political decision” to quickly rule out arson as the cause of the fire that destroyed much of the historic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.
While French authorities are currently treating the blaze as an accident and have ruled out —for the moment—arson and terrorism, baseless speculation and wild conspiracy theories have run rampant, especially on the right. Conservative host Glenn Beck, for instance, said : “If this was started by Islamists, I don’t think you’ll find out about it, because I think it would set the entire country on fire.”
Noting that French prosecutors are investigating the cause of the blaze, Dobbs said that “within just a matter of hours,” authorities had ruled out arson.
Citing an International Business Times article on recent church vandalism, the Lou Dobbs Tonight host stated that it was “perhaps overlooked” that 875 Catholic churches had been vandalized in 2018, adding that a church had been deliberately set on fire in Paris last month.
“This is context, this is not speculation, this is the situation right now in France and the recent history of what has happened to Catholic churches throughout the nation,” Dobbs declared. “Ignored too often by some covering the tragedy, some who have ruled out speculation about the cause of the Notre Dame fire as they speculate—taking it as gospel that, well, arson was not the cause.”
He added: “That was a decision made within hours. It sounds like a different kind of decision. Perhaps a political decision, rather than one based on careful investigation of the facts. That would amount to speculation, wouldn’t it?”
Interestingly, Dobbs’ questioning the cause of the fire and suggesting French officials are purposely dismissing the possibility it was maliciously set comes on the heels of two Fox News anchors cutting off interviews with guests for pushing conspiracy theories on the air. READ THIS LIST"
Stephen Colbert Mocks Trump’s Terrible Notre Dame Cathedral Fire Advice,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/stephen-colbert-mocks-trumps-terrible-notre-dame-cathedral-fire-advice,"‘SICK BURN’ Stephen Colbert Mocks Trump’s Terrible Notre Dame Cathedral Fire Advice “Does he think every time there’s an emergency in France they’re like, ‘The cathedral is on fire, we must check Donald Trump’s Twitter feed!’” joked the late-night host. Matt Wilstein 04.16.19 9:14 PM ET
Stephen Colbert was still in London on Monday interviewing former First Lady Michelle Obama for her Becoming book tour, so Tuesday night was his first opportunity to weigh in on the fire that nearly destroyed the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
But of course, after saying how “shocked and horrified” he was by the destruction, all Colbert really wanted to talk about was President Trump’s tweet .
“So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,” Trump wrote as firefighters were trying to contain the blaze on Monday. “Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!”
“Does he think every time there’s an emergency in France they’re like, ‘The cathedral is on fire, we must check Donald Trump’s Twitter feed!’” the Late Show host joked in his exaggerated French accent. “‘ Sacre bleu! He says we must act quickly! Get the hoses! Get the water! Why did we not think of water? We’ve been using cheese!’”
President Trump’s unsolicited “advice” prompted the Twitter account of Sécurité Civile, the French civil security agency, to subtweet him by posting the message below :
“Hundreds of firemen of the Paris Fire Brigade are doing everything they can to bring the terrible #NotreDame fire under control,” they informed their followers. “All means are being used, except for water-bombing aircrafts which, if used, could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral.”
“For firefighters, they really know how to give a sick burn,” Colbert added."
‘Burn This’: Adam Driver & Keri Russell’s Big Broadway Blow-Up,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/burn-this-adam-driver-and-keri-russells-big-broadway-blow-up,"DAMAGER ‘Burn This’: Adam Driver & Keri Russell’s Big Broadway Blow-Up ‘Girls’ and 'Star Wars’ star Adam Driver plays an unstable, grieving seducer in Lanford Wilson’s ‘Burn This.’ Will Keri Russell’s Anna fall for this menacing, loud hulk? Oh, yes. 04.16.19 9:01 PM ET Matthew Murphy
Well, here’s a treat if you really miss Adam Driver at his maddest and most threatening and weird as Adam in Girls .
In Lanford Wilson’s Burn This , which opens at the Hudson Theatre on Broadway tonight (to July 14) , his character Pale is really messed up, and really physical; the whole stage and theater reverberates when his profanity-spouting, menacing character barrels across the stage.
This well-known 1980s play was written at a time when mad and messed-up men may have seemed like attractive propositions. Now we know better of the damage of tormented souls, and we certainly know about the damage they inflict on others.
Or do we? Alongside me, two young women watching Burn This sighed sympathetically at every one of Pale’s hurt feelings, or when he buried his head in his hands, and did not seem overly put off by the thunderous threat of violence and general upheaval his presence signaled.
Indeed, the play’s preamble promises, “When a mysterious death brings together two unlikely strangers, their explosive connection sparks a chemistry too fiery to ignore.” The play is “a smoldering story of love and raw attraction.”
It doesn't feel like that. Sure, the relationship of Pale and Keri Russell ’s Anna is the focus, and we are supposed to think, I guess , that opposites (him, rough, working-class restaurant manager; she, dancer, middle-class) will attract. But he is such a nightmare and so unhinged, you would want him out of your apartment and bed, not in them. Pale may be hot (if seething, verbally abusive hulks are your bag), but he’s also call-911 trouble.
But then the play is set in another time, and Pale’s behavior isn’t the only thing that has aged questionably in the 30-plus years since Burn This was first staged in 1987.
Era-wise, we can visually revel in the downtown Manhattan loft, convincingly rendered by Derek McLane, with huge windows and a view of water towers and roofs; and nothing much in it bar a sofa. The pop music between scenes further situates us, as does Clint Ramos’ typically astute costume design: big dresses, boxy, huge suits, and wackily patterned sweaters.
Cocaine is being snorted, champagne is being drunk, and a few streets away you can totally imagine Glenn Close and Michael Douglas having an even worse-idea romantic liaison.
The deaths that have bought Pale and Anna together is that of Robbie, Pale’s brother and Anna’s dance partner, and his partner Dom in a boating accident. She lives with Larry, a gay advertising executive played by the excellent Brandon Uranowitz, and also in the mix is Burton (David Furr), Anna’s boyfriend, a screenwriter so rich he doesn’t have to work.
Burton is a bland and gilded dollar sign. Russell plays Anna with a breezy self-assurance that obscures a deeper grief and frustrated ambition. She has become Burton’s cheerleader; he is not doing the same for her. ( Felicity fans will note, and relish, a line about Anna’s changing hairstyle.)
Wilson was gay, and watching Burn This , the first jarring note in this play is the initial act of gay erasure: the deaths of the unseen Robbie and Dom. Their relationship is barely considered. Robbie himself is hardly mentioned, bar the misty sense of loss of Anna and Larry. We hear more of Pale’s homophobia, which is all “fruit” this and “faggot” that. All unchallenged, of course. And yes, the audience in 2019 laughed at the words, because Pale is a volcanic lunatic, and what’s not to love about a volcanic lunatic who’s also homophobic?
Another kind of gay erasure unfolds in front of us. Uranowitz plays Larry as well as Larry is written. Uranowitz is as funny and piercing as he was in Falsettos ; he finds depth with Wilson's scant signposting and is a fine physical performer of pratfalls and eye-rolls. He tells truths about desire, he asks tricky questions.
But Larry is also dismissed in this play; at one key moment, Burton asks him has he thought that he eventually will be rejected and left by Anna.
There are so many odd things about this supposed moment of profound truth. Wilson doesn’t conceive that Larry himself could be happy and settled with someone. Instead, Larry is imagined as bereft and unmoored without his heterosexual friend and flatmate; just another lonely queer.
Larry doesn't say anything in response to this dismissive prophecy. He doesn’t reply, for example, that he and Anna have a friendship that a straight man would never know, and it may be one that may survive all kinds of currents in their personal lives. Larry, as a character, accepts his disposable gay destiny.
Wilson, a gay playwright who is confident enough to write his gay character talking about sex and desire, leaves him stranded. (Wilson wrote other plays with notable gay characters; Lemon Sky , for example, and Fifth of July . He wasn’t in retreat from homosexuality as a theme.)
This critic thought about the year of this play, first performed in 1987: this was a play written in the horror of the first years of HIV and AIDS, cutting such a horrific swathe through what would have been Larry and Anna’s circle, and surely Wilson’s too. And yet, in Burn This , nothing. Is the boat accident a metaphor? Why would such a literal playwright need one?
Burton reveals a same-sex encounter. Maybe in 1987 this would be considered transgressive; here Wilson also tantalizes us with Larry flirting with Burton and, lesser so, Pale. It feels half-hearted, and this critic noted that every playful flirtation by Larry was met with a gruff disavowal by the nearest heterosexual male.
Gay playwrights are under no license to write exclusively gay-themed plays, but you'd hope for more when it came to writing a gay character.
Similarly, even if one were not watching Burn This with a 2019 cultural filter, the relationship between Anna and Pale feels unconvincing to the point of preposterous. Robbie and Dom feel like meaningful ghosts, displaced by a heterosexual relationship of questionable depth and a gay character testing his own strength of voice.
With such a variety of LGBT voices on stage and screen today, it's easy to forget how scarce (with notable exceptions, like Larry Kramer's The Normal Heart ) they still were in 1987.
The actors here make as best sense out of it as they can. Driver looks huge on stage (and if you sit on the left-hand side of the theatre you will catch a glimpse of him in purple briefs as his character steps out in Anna’s purple kimono). He is, as any Girls fan knows, a superior bull-in-a-china shop, but like the other characters, Wilson never successfully signals to us why you would want to spend longer than five minutes with Pale without a prison guard or stun gun.
Wilson does write Anna as questioning Pale’s presence. She doesn’t want him in this apartment, she says at one point. ( Yes , you think.) But still he comes back, and she takes him back for reasons best known to the playwright. Even if you accept Anna wants Pale, the play never really explains why; what changed?
In today’s universe, Pale's pursuit might be called stalking; in a play featuring such a character today, one would hope the female object of his attention or at least someone near to them would voice some dissension around his violence, temper, sexism, and homophobia.
Not in Burn This . All Pale has to do is coo one vaguely nice thing, or not be a threatening asshole for 20 seconds, and Anna is putty again. And yes, so were the women next to me. Playing the damaged bird is an effective seduction tactic of the abuser, and Driver-as-Pale plays that damaged, damaging bird extremely well.
As the play ended, this critic thought about another—sadly invisible—play about desire, grief, need, and sexuality standing somewhere off in the shadows, while center stage Burn This stood shakily on its feet, bursting with energy and completely out of time. READ THIS LIST"

Trump’s GOP Challenger Bill Weld: Only Thing Trump and I Have in Common Is We’re Both ‘Big Orange Men’ ‘We really have nothing in common,’ the GOP ex-governor claimed, adding that he is an ‘economic conservative’ while Trump has yet to ‘cut a dime.’ 04.16.19 5:03 PM ET MSNBC
A day after officially announcing he will challenge President Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld blasted the president as a “would-be emperor” who praises dictators, adding that the only he has in common with the president is they’re both “big orange men.”
Weld, who was the Libertarian Party’s vice-presidential nominee in 2016, was asked by MSNBC host Kasie Hunt on Tuesday afternoon whether he actually thought he could successfully take on Trump considering the president’s popularity among Republican voters .
The former Bay State governor suggested that GOP voters have been “buffaloed” by the RNC and that they have not truly seen how “mean-spirited” Trump is to the “little people.”
“But the more that’s known about the president’s business conduct and his conduct in office, the more I think people will come to question whether they really think it’s such a great idea being behind this commander-in-chief in office,” Weld noted.
“He’s insulted our military allies, he’s praised dictators abroad,” he continued. “Sunlight is the best disinfectant, as they’ve said, and as more is known about his record and whether or not this would-be emperor has new clothes, I think the better for the ultimate result.”
Hunt then wondered if Weld offered any substantial policy differences with the president, prompting the 6’4” ex-governor to reference the two men’s similar skin hues and heights. (Trump is listed at 6’3”.)
“The one thing we have in common is that we’re both big orange men,” Weld joked as Hunt snickered. “And he’s even bigger than I am, I’ll grant him that. Not in terms of height, but otherwise.”
He added that “we really have nothing in common” before calling himself an “economic conservative” while claiming Trump has “never cut a dime in spending.” Asked whether he’d vote against Trump’s tax cut plan, Weld pointed to his own record of cutting both taxes and spending before once again taking on Trump personally.
“He certainly is an isolationist to a fault,” Weld exclaimed. “He wants us to despise people from every other country and frighten the American public into thinking that they're under siege from people in every other nation. That he calls being a nationalist. It really just means to him it's more important that we hate everybody else.”"

Right-wing personalities are pushing conspiracy theories about Monday’s fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, even after French investigators said the case is not being investigated as arson or terrorism.
Within minutes of the fire breaking out yesterday, pro-Trump commentators rushed to portray it as a symbol of Western decline. “The West has fallen,” declared Mike Cernovich.
Others were eager to suggest, without evidence, that Muslims were behind the fire. Gateway Pundit dredged up a three-year-old terrorist plot to blow up Notre Dame as proof that this fire was caused by terrorists. Fox News anchors had to repeatedly shut down guests who tried to push the idea that the fire was caused by terrorists. QAnon believers produced a wide range of theories, blaming the fire on everyone Michelle Obama to the deep-state to Pope Francis.
On Tuesday, French fire investigators said there was no evidence that the fire was caused by arsonists or terrorists. Rather than tamping down the conspiracy theories, though, the French statement has only fueled the idea on the right that terrorists were behind the fire. Instead, they’re treating the announcement as proof that the investigators can’t be trusted.
Pardes Seleh, a former Mediaite writer and Ben Shapiro acolyte, has become one of the leading arson truthers.
“Lemme put it this way: i'd be very shocked if it was an accident,” Seleh tweeted on Tuesday. “And no, french authorities announcing at the start of an investigation that they're ‘treating it as an accident’ doesn't count. french authorities are incompetent, we'd confirmed that long ago.”
Pizzagate promoter Jack Posobiec, now a reporter at the pro-Trump One America News cable channel, also suggested without evidence that the fire investigation was a coverup.
“Fastest arson investigation in history,” Posobiec tweeted.
The groundwork for the idea that the French investigation can’t be trusted was laid out Monday night by Glenn Beck, who has recently abandoned his attempts to style himself as a lonely voice of reason in the Trump era and gone back to his conspiracy theory roots.
Beck claimed that, if the fire was caused by terrorists, the truth would never be revealed.
“If this was started by Islamists, I don’t think you’ll find out about it,” Beck said in an appearance on The Blaze. “Because I think it would set the entire country on fire.”
Since the French investigators announced the lack of arson evidence, Beck has been joined by several other right-wing figures. Stefan Molyneux, a Canadian YouTube personality, questioned the validity of the fire investigation. So did Emerald Robinson, another reporter at One America News.
“Dear media: you are already reporting that Notre Dame has been declared an accident. But the investigation just started,” Robinson tweeted. “And the restorers had already left for the day.

Scouted: The Outdoor Voices Clifton Running Shoes Come In New Styles — Making It Even Easier to Upgrade Your Sneakers,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.grudo@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Grudo),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/outdoor-voices-releases-new-clifton-shoes-styles,"Scouted By The Beast
Outdoor Voices is all about redefining our outdoor and fitness activities into normal parts of our lives (they call it “Doing Things” ), making it a point to turn customer feedback into its future products and launches. And that comes out clearly in their Clifton collection of running shoes, whose new styles Lilac and Cloud launched today.
The Outdoor Voices Cliftons come in men’s and women’s sizes and are designed to carry you at high speeds when you want or be comfortable when you’re just hanging around. Essentially, the biggest value here is reliability. No matter what you need your sneakers to do, the Cliftons can handle it (as is true with most of Outdoor Voices products). They’re lightweight and speedy with a structure that propels you forward when you’re on the move. And the cushioned midsole keeps you comfortable for any activity (even none) — not to mention, their breathable mesh will keep you from overheating. The Cliftons are a collaboration with HOKA ONE ONE and its Clifton 4 running shoes, but in a new palette.
Combining reliability with seasonal designs and letting you choose how to incorporate you next running shoes into your own activities makes the OV Cliftons a great choice to consider for a spring footwear upgrade.

On Monday just before 8 p.m. local time, an audible gasp rippled through the streets of Paris as bystanders watched the spire that towered above the Notre Dame Cathedral topple over in a fiery rush. The steeple had served as a symbol of cultural achievement, national pride, and faith for generations in France and the world over, and it was now gone.
It wasn’t the first time that the spire had been forcibly separated from the cathedral, but it was the most devastating. Since the very first stones were put in place for a grand church that would rise on the banks of the River Seine over 850 years ago, Notre Dame has not just borne witness to history, it has had parts of that history inscribed into its very architectural bones.
As the centuries passed, Notre Dame has garnered attention from forces both good and evil. There were the insurgents during the French Revolution who took issue with the church’s symbol of authority and decided to do some painful redecorating, and then their ideological descendants less than 100 years later, whose attempt to burn it down was thwarted. There were prominent cultural figures whose misguided aesthetic judgements resulted in painful losses, and those who came after to right the damage with a little extra editorializing. And then, of course, there were the everyday challenges of a massive cultural monument—maintenance, upkeep, and extreme weather.
Each time Notre Dame Cathedral has been imperiled, whether by acts of human or God, it has risen stronger than before and as an even greater beacon for the universal hopes of humanity. But after suffering a devastating fire on Monday that began in the roof and quickly spread, “Our Lady in Paris” faces its greatest challenge yet.
Construction on Notre Dame began in the 1160s and didn’t stop until well into the 14th century. One could say destruction was built into its foundation—a Romanesque church was torn down to make way for the cathedral, as had been done to a pagan temple before that. But on this patch of the Île de la Cité that had been selected for worship by prior generations, a magnificent French Gothic cathedral rose from the rubble.
It was a towering achievement and one that continued to evolve for over 100 years as new advancements were made in the field of architecture. By the end of the 14th century, the grand Notre Dame Cathedral was complete—for now—and it had taken its place on an island in the Seine in both the heart of the Catholic Church and of the city.
“Paris in the Middle Ages is a very international, cosmopolitan place, probably much more multicultural than most people today tend to assume,” Jacqueline Jung, associate professor of art history at Yale and a specialist in medieval art and architecture, tells The Daily Beast. “People are coming from all over to study at the university there and, while they are there, they’re seeing this Cathedral because it’s visible from all over the place.”
For over 300 years, the cathedral was largely left alone to be admired. Then, in the 1770s, the first misguided attempts at improvement began. Apparently, clear glass windows were all the rage at the time, and the beautiful, stained glass masterpieces that filled the cathedral were deemed déclassé. So the glassmaker Pierre Le Vieil was hired to remove some of the latter and replace them with the former.
As he smashed the rejected, “very crude” panes to bits, he “paused for a moment to admire the ‘brilliance of the colors, particularly the blue,’” according to a 1963 article in Life Magazine .
Around this time, it was also decided that the Portal of Judgement on the Western facade of the church, the one that has become the iconic photograph prized by tourists, wasn’t sufficiently large enough to stage grand processions. So, the entryway was widened , sacrificing some of the original masonry and at least one major sculpture.
But the real trouble for the cathedral began with the 18th century rumbles of revolution. Before the tragic fire of 2019, it was during the French Revolution that the cathedral took its biggest hit.
When the commoners rose up against their class overlords, they not only took down the rulers of the country, they also wanted to do away with the symbols of their oppression, including the Catholic church. No king was safe and in 1793, the sights of the new government turned on Notre Dame. Nine months after King Louis XVI was introduced to Madame Guillotine, 28 stone sculptures depicting the Kings of Judah were removed from the facade of the cathedral and beheaded by the fearsome lady. Nearly 200 years later, 21 of these heads were discovered. (Only fragments of their other remains were found.)
The revolutionaries renamed the cathedral the Temple of Reason , staging festivals that pilloried its religious roots and promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment. During the course of the merriment, the treasures inside were fair game and much of the interior was looted. While the spire didn’t seem to engender any specific ire in the revolutionaries, it had fallen into disrepair and was starting to loll. In the interest of safety, it was removed.
Notre Dame might not have been respected by the leaders of the French Revolution, but its star had not dimmed in the eyes of the world. Almost immediately after Napoleon seized power, he set about the rehabilitation of the church namely by staging his 1804 coronation in the cathedral.
But it was the French author Victor Hugo who sealed its fate. In 1831, he published The Hunchback of Notre Dame which was in many ways a love letter to the cathedral and a call to action to right the cultural wrongs of its neglected state.
“Victor Hugo used it as a kind of rallying cry for people to look at these monuments like Notre Dame that seemed to represent a sort of old order that was really dead, but now to look at it as a historical monument, as a sign of French ingenuity, French pride, French history, European history, human history,” Jung says.
It worked. A massive renovation was undertaken under the guidance of Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in the 1860s. While the architect deserves commendation for the work he did, he went far beyond bringing the building back to its former glory. As Jung explains, the project became a “showpiece of the restorer’s art” and he rehabilitated the building and its decorations according to what the then-modern day view dictated a medieval showstopper should be. The gargoyles, for instance—those are a Viollet-le-Duc original.
Jung says that it is nearly impossible for a casual observer today to distinguish between the original medieval features and the restorer’s additions—the original and the restoration have been intertwined and the latter masked to look like the former as was Viollet-le-Duc’s intention.
“The things that he did were imposing much more of the individual 19th-century man’s craft onto the building that today we wouldn’t really like to see. But on the other hand, you know, it’s a pretty good job,” Jung laughs.
In the centuries following Viollet-le-Duc’s restoration of the Cathedral to its original glory (and beyond), Notre Dame has become more than just a beacon of the church; it is a global symbol of humanity and our feats of cultural heritage. This high profile has helped to protect the building through the tumultuous waves of history, though there have been a few near misses over the decades.
During the Paris Commune in the spring of 1871, left-wing revolutionaries took over the streets of the city and set their sights on important landmarks including Notre Dame. Historian Robert Tombs writes in The Paris Commune 1871 that they began to set buildings on fire “partly to block the way of the advancing troops, and also as symbolic acts of defiance.” Notre Dame stood as a symbol of the “superstition” of the state, but when a group of revolutionaries tried to set the cathedral on fire, a fire brigade intervened.
The World Wars that ripped apart the global fabric and stitched it back up with new boundaries and new ideologies in the first half of the twentieth century also managed to largely bypass one of the most recognizable landmarks in Paris despite the City of Lights becoming a key battleground.
Powerful black and white pictures attest to the vulnerability of the cathedral: sandbags packed tall and dense in its doorways during WWI; machine guns stationed in the Square Jean-XXIII; and armored tanks flanking the building and filled with American soldiers and celebrating locals following the city’s liberation at the end of WWII.
The church didn’t survive completely unscathed—in October 1914 a German bomb struck the roof of the church—but the damage was relatively minor. This escape was perhaps miraculous given that, as scholar Ronald C. Rosbottom wrote in 2014 , the Germans dropped over 200 bombs on Paris in early 1918 in a desperate attempt to make inroads in the city, and a large portion of these fell on the neighborhoods surrounding the cathedral. It turned out, the Germans were using Notre Dame as a guiding landmark from the air.
But the cathedral was not so lucky a century later when a fire that authorities believe started in the roof broke out. While the blaze was eventually extinguished, and some of the art is believed to have been saved, a few aspects of Notre Dame’s history have been lost forever.
Some of the medieval stained glass that escaped Le Vieil’s hammer is thought to have been lost (though the stunning Rose windows are believed safe). Jung says that the deeply saturated colors of these 800 year old works, the texture and thickness of the glass, the compositions that tell of sacred history, and the medieval artisans’ hours of labor and unique talent that they represented are irreplaceable. Also, much of the timber work that sat between the stone vaults and the roof was part of the original 13th-century construction, a very rare find in Gothic cathedrals today. All of it is thought to have gone up in flames.
But still, there is hope. Pledges are already rolling in from both the French government and wealthy donors committed to helping Notre Dame rise from destruction once again. While there will be features that cannot be saved, the restoration will add a new mark of tragedy and survival onto the bones of the church.
As Jung says, the history Notre Dame Cathedral has witnessed has mapped itself onto the building, often in physical ways. In return, “It’s played a role in all of these [historical events] and, along the way, it’s become this symbol of Frenchness, of great design, of intelligence, of religious devotion, of politics. Every aspect of human culture is embedded into this building…[Notre Dame] has shaped this place and it has shaped people’s thinking and imaginations in a way that few other buildings have.” READ THIS LIST"

Synagogue of Enabling ‘Systemic, Regular’ Sexual Abuse of Preschoolers The lawsuit claimed the school overlooked the ‘most grievous, demeaning and damaging forms of sexual abuse’ against eight toddlers between ages 2 and 4. 04.16.19 11:49 AM ET Getty
A group of parents are suing a prominent Washington D.C. synagogue, alleging one preschool teacher sexually abused eight toddlers for more than two years and the school ignored the warning signs.
The 239-page civil lawsuit, filed anonymously by eight parents in Superior Court for the District of Columbia on Monday evening, alleged that the toddlers between the ages of two and four, “were subject to systemic and regular sexual abuse on school property” by an assistant teacher at the Washington Hebrew Congregation.
The alleged abuser, Jordan Silverman, joined the preschool in 2016 after a career as a Vermont photographer. Although Silverman is not named as defendant in the lawsuit, he is named for the alleged “grievous, demeaning and damaging forms of sexual abuse.”
“On what we believe was a daily basis, Silverman would remove a small group of children, maybe two or three children at a time, and he would take them to remote locations both inside and outside the building,” Michael Dolce, who is representing the families, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. “We believed that is where he abused the children. He was able, and sometimes encouraged, to be alone with these children, despite it being a direct violation of D.C.’s ‘two-deep’ policy.”
The Reform Jewish synagogue and its director of early-childhood education, Deborah “DJ” Schneider Jensen, are the focus of the complaint, which claimed the administration failed to “protect children from a known and avoidable risk of sexual abuse.”
The lawsuit also noted that the preschool teacher was given the opportunity to be alone with students despite city regulations that state “at least two adults must be present with toddlers in licensed child development centers.”
“Silverman was hired to teach and care for children despite having no professional background in teaching or providing child care,” the complaint stated, additionally claiming the school failed to properly train staff on ways to reduce the opportunity for child sexual abuse and to recognize the warning signs.
About a month after starting at Washington Hebrew, teachers and parents allegedly reported Silverman’s inappropriate behavior to Jensen, which included being “late returning children when he had been alone with them and was not reachable or responsive to efforts by co-workers to locate him and the children.” The congregation and Jensen allegedly ignored these claims, sometimes even defending Silverman.
In one instance, when one parent raised concerns about possible abuse, Jensen allegedly said he had a “‘sick mind’ and insisted that Silverman would not abuse a child” despite increasing amounts of reports that preschoolers were “behaving abnormally” after spending time with the assistant teacher.
“Ms. Jensen was given countless opportunities to protect these children and instead, she never investigated any claim against Silverman, never restricted his access to children, and never even reported the claims to city officials,” Dolce said.
The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia confirmed to The Daily Beast on Tuesday a police investigation into alleged child sexual abuse at the school is ongoing after the school reported a preschooler claimed to have been abused last August .
Police could confirm whether Silverman was a suspect, citing the “ongoing investigation.”
“In August 2018, Washington Hebrew Congregation immediately reported the allegations to D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPDC) and Child Protective Services as soon as we learned of them,” Amy Rotenberg, a spokesperson for the congregation told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. “Since that moment and for the past eight months we have continually and fully cooperated with the ongoing criminal investigation.”
Silverman, who was fired from the school last August, could not be immediately reached for comment.
The families are suing for an unspecified amount of damages, claiming the school’s negligence has left a lifetime of emotional distress, medical costs, and therapy for the children. To maintain the integrity of the police investigation and protect the children, the lawsuit did not go into detail about the alleged abuse.
“At the end of the day, this man performed horrible and significant sex crimes against small children and the people that were supposed to protect them turned a blind eye,” Dolce said. “Silverman is only one part of this horrible story.”
As of Tuesday morning, the Washington Hebrew Congregation have offered “no apology and no medication” to any of the alleged victims, Dolce added."

NBC
Ellen DeGeneres has made it very clear that President Donald Trump is not welcome on her show.
During a 2017 interview with Matt Lauer— of all people —the since-disgraced Today show host asked DeGeneres, “Why wouldn’t someone like you want to sit down opposite the president of the United States?” She replied, “Because I’m not going to change his mind. He’s against everything that I stand for.”
And yet around that same time, The Daily Show ’s Trevor Noah was describing President Trump as a “dream guest.” When DeGeneres asked him what he meant by that on Tuesday’s episode of her daytime talk show, he revealed he had changed his mind.
“It used to be Trump,” Noah said, “and then after watching his interviews over the last few years, I understand what’s going to happen. I would interview him, he’s going to tell me how well he’s doing. I’ll ask him about something, if he doesn’t know the answer, he’ll make an answer up.
“I know the game,” he added. “So now, genuinely, I want to interview Melania Trump. She’s my new dream guest,” he said. “Because I want to know if her ‘Be Best’ anti-bullying campaign online is, like, a long-term dig at her husband. I genuinely want to know that.”
Earlier in the interview, Noah told DeGeneres that when he took over The Daily Show in 2015, his predecessor Jon Stewart told him the “one upside” he had was Donald Trump, predicting that he would be fun to cover during the campaign. “And he won’t be around forever, so just enjoy him while he’s here,” Stewart said at the time.
“And I’m still waiting for that part to happen,” Noah said, four years later, “because he’s still here!”"

Universal Standard’s ability to treat clothing in a, well, universal approach to elevated basics is a breath of fresh air in an industry that treats people, especially women, with a waist size bigger than a preconditioned limit as “other.” The Rodarte collaboration brings that elevation to everyone in a simple but beautiful execution.
Each piece has a bold, romantic silhouette. The ruffles that fall across the shoulders, wrists, and neck on the blouse are more sophisticated than costumey (a hard thing to do). The skirt has strategically-placed waterfall ruffles that allow a simple bias cut some movement and will flatter a multitude of body shapes. The jumpsuit and dress have just the right amount of structure.
The collection has the same utility as other Universal Standard pieces and comes with the same sizes, from 00 up to 40.

GOP Ramps Up Senate Super PAC Machine,www.thedailybeast.com,Lachlan.Markay@thedailybeast.com (Lachlan Markay),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-ramps-up-senate-super-pac-machine,"$$$ GOP Ramps Up Senate Super PAC Machine Deep pocketed Republican donors are wasting no time funding the effort to keep the Senate in GOP hands. 04.16.19 9:58 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
The Republican Party’s outside spending apparatus is kicking into gear ahead of efforts to flip some key Senate seats in next year’s election and defend a pair of vulnerable incumbents.
The GOP’s top donors are already stepping up to finance the effort. In February, Illinois industrial supply magnate Richard Uihlein wrote a half-million-dollar check to Americas PAC, a leading Republican super PAC focusing on key 2020 senate races, according to a Federal Election Commission filing this week.
Uihlein, the second most prolific GOP donor of the 2018 cycle, behind only casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, also donated the legal maximum last month to Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, among the 2020 cycle’s most vulnerable Republicans. But his real political heft in past cycles has come through his extensive financial support of Independent expenditure groups, particularly super PACs.
He is this the only contributor so far this year to Americas PAC, which Uihlein funded to the tune of more than $5 million last cycle. So far this year, the group has used his financial support to run radio and digital ads attacking incumbent Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Tina Flint Smith (D-MN).
Meanwhile, another Uihlein-backed group, Restoration PAC, is taking out digital ads attacking “Senator Shaheen and the party of death” over Senate Democrats’ opposition to recent late-term abortion legislation. Restoration PAC, to which Uihlein donated more than $8 million last cycle but which has not disclosed donors yet this year, is also going after Sens. Doug Jones (D-AL), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Dick Durbin (D-IL).
As Americas PAC goes on offense, two new super PACs show signs of an effort by big-money Republican groups to play defense in two states where GOP holds will be crucial to the party’s effort to maintain a Senate majority.
Both of those groups, Our Colorado PAC and The Maine Way PAC , are made to sound local. Both of their mailing addresses are rented mailboxes in their respective states. But both also show signs of involvement by national Republican groups with deeper pockets and a track record of setting up state-specific political outfits.
Colorado and Maine are key Senate battleground states this cycle, where Gardner and Sen. Susan Collins are expected to face tough reelection fights. And Our Colorado and The Maine Way happen to share the same treasurer, Benjamin Ottenhoff, the former chief financial officer of the Republican National Committee.
Ottenhoff was also the treasurer in 2018 for Defend Arizona PAC and Mountain Families PAC. Named to sound like localized political groups, both were in fact funded almost entirely by the Senate Leadership Fund, Republicans’ top Senate-focused outside spending group, and focused on competitive 2018 Senate contests.
A Senate Leadership Fund spokesman did not respond to questions about the group’s involvement with Our Colorado and The Maine Way.
Such state-specific front groups are a bipartisan phenomenon, and Democrats’ SLF counterpart, Senate Majority PAC, has bankrolled its fair share as well. It’s not clear whether SMP has helped set up or fund any such groups so far this cycle. Neither SMP nor SLF has yet filed a quarterly financial report with the FEC."
"‘Game of Thrones’ Fan Theories: Arya kills the Night King, The Night King is the Mad King, Daenerys flips",www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-premier-triggers-multiple-conspiracy-theories-arya-kills-the-night-king-the-night-king-is-the-mad-king-and-daenerys-flips,"Travel Got Any Ideas? ‘Game of Thrones’ Fan Theories: Arya kills the Night King, The Night King is the Mad King, Daenerys flips The new series debut has prompted a whirlwind of theories on fan boards about how the series will end, such as, who will get to kill the Night King, and will Daenerys join him? 04.16.19 8:59 AM ET Alberto E. Rodriguez
Arya kills the Night King, The Night King is the Mad King reincarnated, Sansa Stark dies, Daenerys flips sides and joins forces with the undead so she can be with her beloved dragons forever and a fourth dragon will be born.
These are just some of the many theories proliferating on social media as fans digest the Season 8 premier of Game of Thrones , which has now screened across all major markets and is believed to be one of the highest rated TV shows of all time, with as many as 100 million viewers .
Some of the plot predictions are intensely plausible, while others seem about as unlikely as HBO really deciding to bring the world’s biggest TV franchise to a shuddering halt (did someone say ‘prequel?’)
Perhaps the most eagerly discussed theory circulating on fan sites, ground zero of which is this reddit thread , is that Daenerys Targaryen will turn into the Night Queen.
In season 2, Daenerys had a vision of herself in a destroyed throne room covered in snow to a voice over declaring: “The mother is reunited with her babies, and you’ll be with them through winter, summer, then winter again.” Given that one of her beloved dragons is already a member of the undead army, if another one (or two) was killed why wouldn’t she flip?
Viewers of a certain vintage may be reminded of the words of the similarly undead Kiefer Sutherland in The Lost Boys : “Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It’s fun being a vampire.”
Adding fuel to this icy fire is the suggestion that the Night King is a Targeryan himself.
One redditor observed that David Benioff said on the official after-show show that Jon Snow should have realized he was a Targaryen because “only Targaryens can ride dragons.” It would be kind of cool, if complicated at Thanksgiving dinner, if the Night King was an incarnation of Aerys Targaryen, aka The Mad King, aka Dany’s father and Jon Snow’s grandpa.
For those who believe that a mere two live dragons and their one undead counterpart are leaving the skies above Westeros a little lonely, the possibility that a fourth winged monster could join the fray is an appealing theory. And one fan theory gaining prominence is based on an observation that at the end of the new opening credits, there are four dragons etched into the sword alongside a comet.
The comet may be the most reliable hint as sword etchings of a comet were also seen back in season two when the original three dragons were born, according to The Daily Mail .
A rival theory suggest that Arya Stark will kill the undead dragon and its rider.
She has emerged as one of the most powerful women of Westeros, and it’s therefore not hard to see the scriptwriters giving her the job of slaying the Night King. In this season’s debut episode, Arya gave blacksmith-turned dragon glass expert Gendry a sketch of a dragon glass tipped missile she wants him to build for her.
Bringing down a zombie dragon looks like exactly the kind of application this little gadget is designed for.
Plus, when the dragons swooped into Winterfell and everyone else was running around screaming, Arya spent her time coolly surveying them. Was she sizing up their weak spots?
We do know that lots of people are going to die . Will Sansa Stark is be one of them? This post by actress Sophie Turner got people talking.
Perhaps only one thing is certain; no one has any idea what will happen on a show that has always made it clear that anything could. READ THIS LIST"

When it comes to upgrading your basics, you should consider just how often you wear them. Me? I have an entire section of my T-shirt drawer dedicated to white tees. I take finding the perfect white T-shirt very seriously. I’ve found there are a few that rise above the rest, in quality and in cut, because not all T-shirts are created equal. Upgrade your basic white T-shirt to one of these.
Boxy Semi-Crop , $30 from Mott & Bow: The Boxy Semi-Crop tee is the perfect length for a t-shirt. I can easily tie it to wear with high-waisted jeans or a skirt, but it also can be half-tucked for a more put-together look. It’s sturdy but not stiff and has a soft, silky feel thanks to the 50/50 blend of Pima cotton and Modal.
Frances de Lourdes Johnny Round-Neck T-Shirt , $289 from Matches: Cashmere isn’t always made for sweaters. The Johnny Round-Neck t-shirt from Frances de Lourdes feels almost incomprehensibly soft. The cashmere and silk blend gives this a lightweight feel and a relaxed fit that is perfect for layering under a blazer for a casual but elevated look.
Women’s Fitted Crew , $28 from Known Supply: This T-shirt is probably my favorite white tee. It’s 100% Pima cotton and comes pre-washed, so it’s already soft and ready to go. It has a relaxed but structured fit so it can stand on its own as a great utilitarian t-shirt, but I recommend getting some embroidery as an added flair.
Linen V-neck Pocket T-shirt , $40 from J.Crew: This is the T-shirt I bought over and over again throughout college and still have in my drawer today. The linen fabric is breathable and lightweight, but not too sheer. The V-neck is a great length that shows enough skin to feel modern but won’t leave you feeling too exposed.
Women’s Scoop V Tee , $34 from Richer Poorer: Normally, I hate a scoop neck but the Scoop Tee from Richer Poorer has a modified scoop that’s more like a curved V-neck. The longer sleeve length means you can roll them if you want (I usually do) or keep them unrolled for a more elevated look. Made from 100% organic cotton and washed in a silicone wash to break it in, this should be your go-to tee.
Women's Second Skin Crew Neck Tee , $55 from Tommy John: The Second Skin line from Tommy John is made from unshrinkable, wrinkle-resistant Pima Cotton/Modal/Spandex blend. It had enough stretch to feel comfortable but will never get stretched out of shape.

Going 10 Rounds With Top Bartender Myles Burroughs,www.thedailybeast.com,noah.rothbaum@thedailybeast.com (Noah Rothbaum),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/going-10-rounds-with-myles-burroughs-beverage-director-of-seattle-based-derschang-group,"Going 10 Rounds With Top Bartender Myles Burroughs The beverage director of the Seattle-based Derschang Group tackles our speed round of questions. 04.16.19 5:40 AM ET The Derschang Group
What do you like to drink after a shift? “After shift has such a varied connotation at this point in my career. But if it’s earlier in the evening, I’ll usually opt for a glass of wine or a beer as I probably haven’t eaten anything in eight hours or so. If it’s after a bar shift, I’ll often opt for a light/refreshing cocktail like a Daiquiri or a Paloma that I can enjoy without too much consideration. In Summer, it’s Txakolina wine pretty much exclusively.”
What is the all-time best dive bar jukebox song? “I’d lose my job if I didn’t include a song from the ‘old’ Sub Pop Records catalog and I’m from Seattle, so I guess I’d say either “Lounge Act” by Nirvana or something produced by Quincy Jones. In all seriousness, I am terrible at picking one anything and there are so many different types of dive bars in the world. I would be stoked for anything by Patsy Cline, James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Led Zeppelin, Joni Mitchell, George Benson, Barrington Levy, Grace Jones...”
After all these years bartending and creating drinks, do you still enjoy going out to bars? “I absolutely do. Though you’d be hard pressed to find me at a bar I’m not working at on a Friday or Saturday night at this point. I really enjoy the conviviality of our profession, bars with the right ambiance, the right style and/or vibe often just feel nice to be in…whether I’m imbibing or not. Also, a vast majority of my friend group is involved in food and beverage and I’d have a hard time seeing them if I didn’t poke my head in from time to time.”
Name the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. “I celebrated my 21st birthday at Linda’s Tavern more times than I should admit. (Sorry Linda.) While I can’t say I had anything transformative or life affirming on those occasions, there are few drinking moments as memorable as my first Rainier Beer and well whiskey ordered at an honest to God dive bar in Seattle. But it’s hard to remember when or where my first good drink was, as I was indoctrinated through the late ’90s and early ’00s, which wasn’t exactly fertile ground for great cocktails in the Pacific Northwest…I’d have to give the nod to Zig Zag, though I can promise you I don’t remember either the drink or leaving the bar that night.”
What book on cocktails or spirits is your go-to resource? “I’m currently obsessed with Death & Co’s Cocktail Codex and have so many notes in Dave Arnold’s Liquid Intelligence one might think I was actually a good student. Amy Stewarts’s Drunken Botanist and The Joy of Mixology by Gary Regan, anything from David Wondrich or Dale DeGroff . Off the subject a bit but another passion of mine in beverage is natural wine and the writing of Alice Feiring ( The Battle for Wine and Love and Naked Wine ) is a must read.”
What’s your favorite cocktail and food pairing? “Depends on the day, but it’s hard to go wrong with a Dry Gin Martini (hold the orange bitters, olive and a lemon twist) with moules-frites for lunch on a sunny patio or a solid Michelada and chilaquiles for brunch. (I’m a strong proponent of day drinking in my advancing age.) Though not a cocktail, strong runner up consideration to chilled vodka and caviar.”
What drink are you most proud of creating? “I’m reticent to cite a specific drink as at this point a truly ‘original’ cocktail is somewhat of a unicorn and we’re all mostly playing in the Mr. Potato Head sandbox of cocktail creation. Ingredient wise, however, I make a fantastic dry hopped ginger beer that is one of my favorite creations, delicious either on its own or as a cocktail ingredient and an absolute life saver for the occasional ‘dry’ month. The thing I’m most proud of in regards to cocktails in my career is the recent development of nitrogen-infused tap cocktails. Using a process very similar to making nitro cold brew, we are forcing nitrogen into solution with classically stirred cocktails and dispensing them through a stout faucet as you would a Guinness or other nitro beer. The results have been a bit of a revelation for me and I’m super excited to continue to evolve the process to effect both the development of flavors through immediate aeration and augmenting the textural component of cocktails.”
Is there one person (dead or alive) you’d like to make a cocktail for? “There’s a well-noted love affair between authors and their bartenders, I have a short list I would love to make a drink for…In no particular order Upton Sinclair, Hunter S. Thompson, Ralph Ellison and Kurt Vonnegut. And I would be remiss not to include my Great Grandmother who owned a tavern in Missouri and whom I never had the chance to meet.”
What’s your favorite shot-and-a-beer combination? “ Mezcal and a juicy sour beer; a Miller High Life pony and a bonded bourbon (preferably Old Grand-Dad or Henry McKenna 10 Year Old); or Green Chartreuse and root beer.”
What is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you’re traveling for business? “Underberg Bitters, we will undoubtedly eat too much. CBD pills, we will undoubtedly drink too much. Business cards and the interminable will to actually follow up with those who I exchange cards with. You absolutely never know when or where you will meet new friends and future associates.”
Myles Burroughs is the beverage director of the Seattle-based Derschang Group, which runs Linda’s Tavern, Oddfellows, Smith, King’s Hardware and Queen City.

U.S. Government Tells Fashion Label in Supreme Court Case: Stop Trying to Make ‘FUCT’ Happen,www.thedailybeast.com,alaina.demopoulos@thedailybeast.com (Alaina Demopoulos),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-government-tells-fashion-label-in-supreme-court-case-stop-trying-to-make-fuct-happen,"WORD POWER U.S. Government Tells Fashion Label in Supreme Court Case: Stop Trying to Make ‘FUCT’ Happen When the U.S. government told Erik Brunetti his fashion label ‘FUCT’ was too dirty to trademark, he took his case to the Supreme Court. 04.16.19 5:40 AM ET Damian Dovarganes/AP
The U.S. Supreme Court held G-rated arguments over an R-rated word on Monday while debating whether “ FUCT ” is too scandalous to trademark.
The eight-year saga of an L.A.-based clothing line founded by artist Erik Brunetti came to Washington, D.C., as justices heard his case against the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
It started in 2011, when Brunetti’s trademark application for FUCT—which, according to CNN , stands for “Friends You Can’t Trust”—was denied on the grounds that it violated the Lanham Act. (Representatives for the brand did not respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.)
A provision of the Lanham Act, which was passed in 1946, says that “scandalous or immoral” words cannot be trademarked, as names that cause offense should not be endorsed by the government.
Unlike George Carlin ’s famous “Seven Dirty Words” monologue, which was referenced many times in court on Monday, there is no tangible list of what can and cannot be trademarked. It is up to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to arbitrate what is appropriate.
In the 2017 case Lee v. Tam , the court ruled in favor of an indie pop band The Slants, who were denied a trademark for their name because the antiquated slur for Asian-Americans “disparaged” a race of people.
The all-Asian music group argued that their name reclaimed the word—and the highest court in the land unanimously agreed that the trademark should be granted.
Simon Tam, founder of The Slants, filed an amicus brief in support of Brunetti. He called the Lanham Act “ Victorian ” and in direct opposition to modern interpretations of the First Amendment, where “speech may not be restricted for the purpose of preventing listeners from being offended.”
“I think we would be in a lot of trouble if all of our laws reflected the morality of the 1930s, which is when the Lanham Act was written,” Tam, who just released a book documenting his experience navigating the Supreme Court, told The Daily Beast. “Our society and our laws have been changing since then, and it’s past time for our trademark office to reflect these kinds of updates.”
“These prohibitions have been around for 70 years,” Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, told The Daily Beast. “The Supreme Court has signaled First Amendment challenges to a lot of things that are more welcome than they used to be.”
During Monday’s arguments, the Department of Justice’s Malcolm L. Stewart spoke of how the U.S. Trademark Office exists to “protect unwilling viewers from material they find offensive.” He also said that if the “scandalous” clause were struck down by the court and word FUCT was granted a trademark, then “sexually explicit images” could ostensibly be granted the same protection, too.
Stewart claimed that FUCT “would be perceived by a substantial segment of the public as the equivalent of the profane past participle form of a well-known word of profanity and perhaps the paradigmatic word of profanity in our language.” “Considering what’s involved in this case, if you were to take a composite of, say, 20-year-olds, do you think. . .they would find it shocking?”
But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg countered that the word means different things—and has varying levels of offensiveness—depending on its audience.
Citing the streetwear line’s target customer, she asked, “Considering what’s involved in this case, if you were to take a composite of, say, 20-year-olds, do you think... they would find it shocking?”
While the patent office was denying Brunetti’s application for a trademark, the government was not telling him he could not sell his clothing altogether. As Justice Stephen Breyer said, “This is simply not forbidding use of any word in any place, but you just can’t put a little R next to it.”
Brunetti’s lawyer John Sommer argued that calling FUCT “scandalous” violates his client’s First Amendment protections, and that the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office is engaging in “viewpoint discrimination” by decreeing morality.
”A substantial number of Americans think that gambling, drinking, eating some types of meat, eating meat at all is immoral,” Brunetti said. “There’s no way to make a sensible determination between those that come in and those that must stay out.”
The lawyer went on, “Steak n' Shake can’t be registered because a substantial portion of Americans believe that eating beef is immoral.”
Susan Scafidi, a fashion law professor at Fordham University, believes that Brunetti’s case is “cleaning up the bits” left over after Lee v. Tam . “Truly, it’s a struggle to determine what is in fact scandalous today without engaging in viewpoint discrimination.”
“During today’s arguments, the government was hard-pressed to define a difference between ‘disparaging,’ which was dealt with in Tam,and Brunetti’s closely-related issue of ‘scandalous’ marks,” Scafidi said. “It almost sounded like this case was pre-decided in some ways. Truly, it’s a struggle to determine what is in fact scandalous today without engaging in viewpoint discrimination.”
Scafidi also pointed out that the clothing label French Connection UK has a trademark for its acronym FCUK, which sure looks a lot like the disputed FUCT. “That’s at the heart of the vagueness problem here,” she said. “The statute says ‘scandalous,’ but it really depends on which examiner you happen to draw and how that examiner is feeling on a particular day.”
The justices will hand down their decision by July. Until then, we can take comfort in the delicious irony of an “ outsider ” fashion brand wanting official government approval badly enough to take their case to the highest court in the land.
“It can be hard to maintain authenticity in the face of sudden mainstream popularity, particularly if the nature of your authentic self is to be transgressive, to be a rebel, to be an outsider,” Scafidi said. “On the other hand, this case shows that there is nothing to say that being an outsider and being a commercial success are mutually exclusive.”"
"Media: Julian Assange Is a D*ck, but He’s Our D*ck",www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/media-julian-assange-is-a-dck-but-hes-our-dck,"WAYS AND MEANS Media: Julian Assange Is a D*ck, but He’s Our D*ck Julian Assange’s detractors in the media are many, but they also say that charging him over his WikiLeaks activities would amount to an attack on journalistic practice. 04.16.19 5:39 AM ET Jack Taylor/Getty
Former New York Times executive editor Bill Keller knows Julian Assange better than most American media types.
“He's a narcissistic dick, and nobody's idea of a journalist,” Keller told The Daily Beast concerning the spectacle of plainclothes British police officers dragging the disheveled, wildly bearded WikiLeaks founder from London’s Ecuadorian Embassy building, where Assange has been camping out for the past six and a half years, under diplomatic asylum, to evade arrest and extradition on rape charges in Sweden (allegations he denies).
Keller’s comments—in reaction to last week’s unsealed indictment of Assange by Donald Trump’s Justice Department for alleged “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion” with court-martialed former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning —reflect a general attitude of the American journalism establishment: He may be a narcissistic dick, but he’s our narcissistic dick.
In the wake of the 47-year-old Assange’s arrest last Thursday—a scene captured on video by RT , the Kremlin-funded television network on which Assange once hosted his own show —Keller was quick to stress that “the government should be very careful not to criminalize the act of publication or the legitimate journalistic pursuit of newsworthy information.”
Keller became acquainted with the Australian computer hacker more intimately than he might have liked in 2010 when Assange shared half a million purloined classified U.S. government documents on the military adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Times, Britain’s Guardian and Germany’s Der Spiegel . “Journalists, regardless of whether they’re likable or not, should not suffer criminal repercussions for journalism”
“Arrogant, thin-skinned, conspiratorial and oddly credulous,” Keller described Assange in a lengthy account of the Times ’ relationship with the WikiLeaks leader that likened him to “a bag lady… wearing a dingy, light-colored sport coat and cargo pants, dirty white shirt, beat-up sneakers and filthy white socks that collapsed around his ankles” who also “smelled as if he hadn’t bathed in days.”
“Journalists, regardless of whether they’re likable or not, should not suffer criminal repercussions for journalism,” said Courtney Radsch, director of advocacy for the Committee to Protect Journalists. “The key is that the First Amendment, at least in the United States, has a specific carve-out for freedom of the press, and that is not qualified by whether or not the individual involved is a nice guy.”
As HBO’s resident investigative satirist, John Oliver, put it on Sunday’s Last Week Tonight : “It is easy to dislike Julian Assange… Alongside the valuable information that WikiLeaks has helped release, they’ve also recklessly published the sensitive personal data of hundreds of ordinary people, potentially putting lives at risk. And that’s not even getting into the fact that WikiLeaks’ publication of hacked emails in 2016 helped elect Trump president.” “You are allowed not to like him, but America’s current attempts to extradite him hang on a specific charge that many press advocates find unsettling”
But Oliver continued: “You are allowed not to like him, but America’s current attempts to extradite him hang on a specific charge that many press advocates find unsettling.”
Fox News’s Sean Hannity, who interviewed Assange at his embassy lair in 2017 and even offered him a guest-hosting gig, was something of an outlier in offering his locked-up friend unreserved accolades .
“If you look at WikiLeaks’ record, they never printed a single thing proven untrue in like 12 years,” Hannity, who has frequently echoed Trump’s claim that the mainstream media is “the enemy of the people,” declared on his cable show. “Whether you like their work or don't, that's a much better track record than the fake news media mob here in America that has been doing nothing but lying and peddling you conspiracy theories for two-and-a-half years.”
The Assange indictment is limited to a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion—alleging that he helped Manning try “cracking a password” for unauthorized computer access, though it doesn’t indicate that the alleged attempt succeeded.
But—troubling to many—the indictment includes descriptions of what otherwise would be considered legitimate interactions between a journalist and a confidential source.
While the New York Times editorial board praised the Trump Justice Department for limiting the scope of the indictment—“The administration has begun well by charging Mr. Assange with an indisputable crime”—Norman Pearlstine, executive editor of the Los Angeles Times , said he isn’t sure that failing to crack a password is illegal.
“You and I receive stuff all the time [from confidential sources],” Pearlstine told The Daily Beast. “But if you were handed the key to my apartment in order to break into it, and you try the key and it doesn’t work, is that sufficient to merit an indictment? I don’t know if that is an indictable offense.”
On Sunday’s installment of CNN’s Reliable Sources media criticism program, Intercept D.C. bureau chief Ryan Grim pointed out that the Obama administration was aware of the password-cracking attempt years ago, and opted not to indict Assange. “The debate over who is and who isn’t a journalist sometimes misses the point. Let’s look at: what are the acts involved”
“This is a threat to press freedom particularly in the way that the Department of Justice has kind of convinced the press, in its reporting of this, to slit its own throat, by taking the word of the Justice Department,” Grim said, adding that the indictment indicates that Assange was trying to help Manning obtain files to which his security clearance already gave him access, but anonymously. “They put ‘hacking’ in the press release, but it doesn’t appear anywhere in the indictment. Yet all the news coverage around it is, ‘Oh, Assange is not a journalist, he’s a hacker.’”
“The debate over who is and who isn’t a journalist sometimes misses the point. Let’s look at: what are the acts involved,” the CPJ’s Radsch said. “We are concerned about criminalizing such things as talking to sources, protecting the identity of confidential sources, gathering information and other issues that are really integral to the news gathering process…There is potential concern that [the indictment] is construing normal journalistic activity as part of a conspiracy.”
Perhaps ironically, Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, was notorious for deploying a little-used, century-old law, the Espionage Act, to punish leaking by whistleblowers, at one point threatening New York Times investigative reporter James Risen with jail unless he revealed a confidential source; amid an outcry by journalists and advocacy organizations, Holder ultimately backed down.
“Under the Obama administration we saw that the Espionage Act was used more than all other administrations combined to try to get at leakers and whistleblowers,” Radsch said. “We’ve now seen that this [Trump] administration…has used at least six subpoenas of journalists, looking at the Espionage Act. The fact is that this precedent of using the Espionage Act to get at confidential sources was set by the prior administration, and this [Trump] administration is continuing that trend.”
Former Time magazine editor Rick Stengel, who served in the Obama administration as Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, pointed out that the Assange arrest and indictment could have alarming implications for journalists worldwide.
“It's not unreasonable to think that any prosecution of Assange emboldens autocratic leaders to crack down on journalists or whistleblowers,” Stengel told The Daily Beast.
“But the tragic thing is that if you look at any of the countries we might be talking about—Turkey, China, Saudi Arabia and others—they do not have laws that protect freedom of the press and they do have laws that punish those who criticize the government. That's why it's so dangerous to be a journalist in those places, and why it may become even more dangerous.”
Ryan Grim agreed.
“None of this going to be viewed with the nuance that we’re bringing to it by authoritarian governments,” Grim said on CNN. “What they’re going to see is, ‘Oh, the U.S. in cracking down on press freedom, we can crack down on press freedom.’ They’re not parsing the indictment to see whether or not he was gaining access anonymously.”
Grim said the Justice Department’s effort to extradite Assange, a process that could take many months, is potentially even more ominous for journalists.
“A lot of things I’ve published break laws in, say, China, or the United Arab Emirates,” Grim said. “These countries have power over Interpol”—the international police organization. “Why can’t they now issue arrest warrants for me and other journalists as we travel and say ‘Look, the U.S. indicted Assange, who’s not an American citizen, for violating American laws, we want to extradite these American citizens, and let them face trial in our country?’”"

The outpouring of grief from around the world when Notre Dame erupted into flames Monday quickly turned into a determination to rebuild—and the crowdfunding effort to help repair the damage has now reached just under $1 billion. French President Emmanuel Macron set a hugely ambitious five-year deadline Tuesday to restore the iconic 12th-century cathedral back to its former glory. He'll be helped by the huge war-chest which has been raised in just a day and a half since the fire shocked people around the globe. Contributions came from from Apple as well magnates who own L’Oreal, Chanel and Dior, and smaller donations came from Catholic parishioners and small towns and cities around France and the world. A huge crane and planks of wood arrived at the site Wednesday morning, and Macron is set to hold a special Cabinet meeting later today which will be dedicated to setting out a response to the Notre Dame disaster.

Bitcoin Couple Nadia Thepdet and Chad Elwartowski Face Death Penalty for Seasteading Off Thailand - The Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bitcoin-couple-nadia-thepdet-and-chad-elwartowski-face-death-penalty-for-seasteading-off-thailand,"SUNK Bitcoin Couple Faces Death Penalty for Trying to Build Home in International Waters Nadia Thepdet and Chad Elwartowski wanted a slice of libertarian heaven off the coast of Thailand—but the country says their dream is actually a very serious crime. 04.17.19 5:12 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTube
Nadia Thepdet takes beautiful photos of the ocean. One recent picture on her Instagram shows the sun setting over the waves. In another, she stands on a boat off Thailand’s coast, holding a golden coin with bitcoin logo.
But Thepdet’s love of bitcoin and the sea could cost her her life.
She and her boyfriend Chad Elwartowski are cryptocurrency evangelists who tried to live out the libertarian idea of seasteading. The concept, beloved by tech types like Peter Thiel, proposes a set of floating islands in international waters. The idea is to escape countries and laws.
Now the law is coming for Thepdet and Elwartowski. The couple moved into the first off-shore house by seasteading company Ocean Builders earlier this year. Their new home was located atop an oil rig-like structure 12 miles off the Thai coast, technically in international waters—but Thailand says they weren’t far enough from the coast. Thai authorities accuse the couple of breaching a law prohibiting acts that endangers Thai sovereignty, according to the Bangkok Post .
Breaking the law is punishable by death, or life in prison. Now Thepdet and Elwartowski say they’re on the run.
“This is ridiculous,” Elwartowski wrote in a Monday Facebook post. “We lived on a floating house boat for a few weeks and now Thailand wants us killed.”
At its heart, seasteading is like living on a glorified houseboat. The idea has a strong fan base among a certain fringe of libertarians and anarcho-capitalists who believe in establishing a new society with little to no government.
One of seasteading’s earliest and most notorious failures was “Operation Atlantis,” a 1968 effort to build libertarian civilization aboard a boat in international waters. The plan sank with the boat, which caught fire while leaving New York and went belly-up in a hurricane near the Bahamas. (The plan’s founder later tried to build paradise on an offshore oil rig that was also swept away in a hurricane.)
More modern visions of seasteading have imagined entire cities built across boats or oil rigs. Ocean Builders, which is run by early bitcoin adopters, says it wants to build the first seasteading homes. If all goes according to plan, those houses might become the beginning of a city at sea.
Some of seasteading’s biggest backers come from the cryptocurrency community, where Thepdet was a minor celebrity, posting as “Bitcoin Girl Thailand.” The pair claimed to have generated their wealth from the untraceable digital currency, which is a favorite of libertarians.
In a Facebook post last year, Thepdet envisioned luxury homes floating on the ocean. The reality was less glamorous.
In February, Ocean Builders announced it had constructed “the world’s first seastead in international waters 12 nautical miles out from Phuket, Thailand.” Thepdet and Elwartowski’s new home was very basic: a short, round room atop stilts.
It was also very illegal, Thailand authorities allege. “If it is left untouched, it will hinder ship navigation since the route is used for the transport of oil to Phuket,” a government source told the Bangkok Post . The government reportedly alleges the structure was in Thai maritime waters.
One seasteader said the couple’s plan to live 12 nautical miles off the coast came with legal setbacks.
“12nm [nautical miles] is not ‘the high seas,’” Patri Friedman, founder of the Seasteading Institute, wrote on Facebook. “It is the Contiguous Zone, where a state has many rights, several of which seem likely to pertain here. Do not listen to anyone who tells you that the high seas starts at 12nm; it means they haven’t even spent 5 minutes reading Wikipedia.”
Friedman, who has pushed an anti-democratic brand of libertarianism , is one of seasteading’s leading proponents and previously led an aborted effort to create a libertarian city in Honduras.
“Even the actual ‘high seas’ (roughly 200+ nm from land) are not a magical realm of freedom where you can just plant a flag and be an independent polity,” he continued on Facebook.
With Thai authorities searching for them, the couple is now denying allegations that they tried to undermine Thai sovereignty.
“Nadia and I did not design, construct or pay to have the seastead constructed,” Elwartowski wrote on Facebook. “We promoted it and lived on it. We helped out by giving the builder updates and we participated in the launch. We did not decide where to put the seastead. We are enthusiastic supporters of the project who were lucky enough to be the first ones to stay on it.”
The couple were back on the mainland when they started reading news reports about Thai officials raiding the seastead, they told Motherboard .
In a follow-up Facebook post, Elwartowski said he and Thepdet were safe, and that they were trying to find a way out of the country. Elwartowski is a U.S. citizen, but Thepdet is Thai and might try to apply for asylum in the U.S., he said.
“Hunting us down to our death is just plain stupid and highlights exactly the reason someone would be willing to go out in middle of the ocean to get away from governments,” he said."
"Sol Pais, Woman Wanted by FBI Near Columbine, Dead: Report",www.thedailybeast.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/columbine-threats-colorado-school-districts-closed-as-massive-manhunt-continues-for-sol-pais,"2 hours ago ‘Armed’ Woman Wanted by FBI Near Columbine Dead: Report
A massive manhunt for a woman who made credible threats against Denver schools and was considered “armed and dangerous” has ended, according to a local report . Sol Pais, 18, is dead, the report said. More than a dozen Colorado school districts were closed Wednesday as authorities conducted a “massive manhunt” near the base of Mount Evans for the 18-year-old Pais, who has an alleged “infatuation” with the Columbine massacre, NPR reports. Authorities believe that Pais flew to Denver from Miami yesterday, and “immediately” purchased a shotgun and ammo. FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Dean Phillips said at a press conference that Pais was last seen in the foothills of Jefferson County—and that there wasn’t a specific threat to any particular school, but authorities believed there was a “credible threat certainly to the community and potentially to schools.” The 20th anniversary of the Columbine massacre is this Saturday. "
"Father of Sol Pais, Hunted by FBI Near Columbine, Just Wanted Her to Come Home",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/father-of-sol-pais-hunted-by-fbi-near-columbine-wants-her-to-come-home,"04.17.19 11:58 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos Colorado Police / Jefferson County Police Dept
Gardi Pais begged his Columbine-obsessed daughter to “just come home,” hours before she was found dead in the foothills outside Denver, during a manhunt for threats she made related to the infamous Colorado school shooting.
Sol Pais was found dead by a “self inflicted gunshot wound” near the base of Mount Evans on Wednesday following a two-day manhunt, law enforcement said. Authorities previously said Pais, 18, was “extremely dangerous” because she purchased a shotgun after arriving in Denver “infatuated” with the 1999 massacre.
“Please just come home, Sol,” Gardi Pais told his daughter in an interview with The Daily Beast, hours before her death. “Everyone is looking for you and we just want to make sure you are OK and don’t do anything you will regret. This whole situation has been a nightmare, I don’t know why she would do this.”
The FBI said she “made threats to commit an act of violence in the Denver metropolitan area,” prompting a statewide manhunt days before the 20th anniversary of the mass shooting, in which 13 people died.
On Wednesday, Sol’s father confirmed his daughter’s interest in Columbine, but said it was “nothing that stood out as dangerous.”
“She may have a mental problem,” he said, though he didn’t elaborate. “Sol never really had too many friends growing up and when we moved to Miami she didn't branch out. She kept to herself a lot,” describing her as a “quiet soul.”
Pais was seen by her family on Sunday afternoon and reported missing on Monday, the Surfside Police Department said. Her father said it was not “out of the ordinary” for his daughter to wander off sometimes.
“She kept to herself and sometimes that meant she would leave for hours at a time,” he said. “This is a bad dream I never could imagine she would do something like this.”
Over the past year online, Pais wrote she felt unhappy and predicted her life was nearing its end. “I think this story’s almost/completely done,” she wrote in an entry dated June 2018 viewed by The Daily Beast. Around the same time, she wrote about her wish to get a gun. Last month, she inquired about Colorado’s firearm laws on a gun forum for what she said was an upcoming trip. Through it all she appeared to idolize Dylan Klebold, who killed himself after murdering teachers and students in Columbine. (Klebold’s accomplice, Eric Harris, also killed himself.)
Twenty years after the Columbine High School massacre, the shooting endures as an icon of infatuation and inspiration. It has become the subject of a dark fascination by some online “true crime” communities that upload pictures of school shooters and serial killers. And while some of the writers say they have an academic interest in killers, others treat the murderers like rockstars.
More ominously, Columbine has become a template for other school shootings and attacks.
Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza was obsessed with Columbine, his online records show . The man who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech University in 2007 name-checked the Columbine killers in his manifesto. In 2015, police arrested three people who glamorized the Columbine perpetrators for planning a mass-shooting at a Halifax, Nova Scotia mall . In December, the FBI arrested an Ohio couple who visited the Columbine High School campus for also allegedly planning a mass murder. The pair were allegedly caught taking pictures of the school.

Police Stop Alleged Terrorist Plan to Attack Spain's Holy Week - The Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/police-stop-alleged-terrorist-plan-to-attack-spains-holy-week,"FOILED Police Stop Alleged Terrorist Plan to Attack Spain’s Holy Week Police in Spain and Morocco arrested a student over a plan to bomb Seville’s Holy Week processions, days after ISIS threatened a similar attack. 04.17.19 3:05 PM ET David Carbajo/Getty
A 23-year-old man has been arrested in Morocco, in a joint anti-terrorist operation with Spain, over an alleged plan to attack Spain’s Holy Week festivities.
The suspect’s name is Zouhair el Bouhdidi and he is a student at the University of Seville. According to police sources in Spain, the young man was preparing an imminent attack against the processions of Holy Week in Seville, one of the most important events of the Catholic calendar. According to the newspaper El Confidencial , el Bouhdidi has already confessed to the Moroccan police his plans to commit a “large-scale massacre” in the Andalusian city. The Spanish secret services had reportedly been following him for several weeks.
Holy Week in Seville is a celebration declared as a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest . Nearly 70 brotherhoods come out in procession with wooden sculptures depicting scenes of the Passion of Christ between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday. The procession called La Madrugada— on the night of Thursday into Good Friday—brings together hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world, crowded through the narrow streets of Seville.
El Bouhdidi allegedly intended to attempt the attack this week in Seville with a homemade explosive known as “the mother of Satan.” It is the same type of explosive that terrorists prepared in the attack on Barcelona ​​in August of 2017, and in the attack on the Bataclan in Paris in November 2015.
Spanish police are now investigating the home of the alleged jihadist. El Bouhdidi lives in Su Eminencia (‘His Eminence’), a humble neighborhood of Seville. Neighbors say that he had never caused problems, although he did not really associate with others, and that the blinds in his house used to be closed. His recent trip to Morocco has been interpreted by the police as a possible farewell visit to his family.
Spain’s CNI (National Intelligence Center) is investigating whether el Bouhdidi was inspired by, or connected to, a video that the Islamic State published in recent days , in which they threatened to attack the religious celebrations of Holy Week in Spain. The video has been broadcast by several jihadist groups on Telegram and includes images of the attacks in Barcelona and crowds of people participating in the processions of Holy Week in Spain.
The threats against Spain have been spread on social networks by the Muntasir Media Foundation, which is responsible for propagating jihadist messages and which had already threatened Spain last December. The recent video encouraged attacks against Holy Week in Andalusia, the region of Spain that corresponds to Al Andalus, which was Muslim territory before the Reconquest. Recovering Al Andalus is an old obsession for jihadists and often appears in many of their propaganda messages.
The thwarted attack would have taken place only 11 days before the general elections in Spain. In 2004, three days before the general elections, the Madrid bombings ripped through the heart of Spain’s capital, leaving 193 dead and more than 2,000 injured. Since then, the Spanish police have doubled up on terrorism protection in the days before each major election.
A suicide attack in Holy Week in Seville would have certainly claimed many victims, in addition to causing a huge international media panic. On the other hand, one of the great dangers of La Madrugada— the most famous procession—are the stampedes: In 2017, more than a hundred people were wounded after a stampede was set off by eight mischief-makers, who had been recruited through social networks for a dangerous prank.
One of the issues on the table in the electoral campaign is the possibility of tightening laws and borders to prevent the entry of jihadists, potentially hiding among other immigrants, into Spain. This is one of the proposals of the far-right party VOX, which has been growing in popularity in Spain according to all the polls. The president of Spain and main socialist candidate are both against hardening the laws. In recent weeks the controversy over the entry of jihadists in Spain has been present in all media and is generating polarized positions among the Spanish."

For now, we wait.
It’s a song as old as time; wait for the last breath of media attention before a long holiday weekend then drop the stinking oppo, the bad news, the terrible financial report. The Holy Week Mueller News Dump is sure to be a classic of the form that borders on the blasphemous; most Americans look forward to Easter as a time for faith and family, not for scrying the meaning of text under oceans of black redaction marks.
The idea of the news dump is that no one will be watching (and if they are they’ll hear Barr’s summary again first ). It won’t work this time, but it will mean people who give a damn about the truth of this investigation will be parsing what little we expect to get from a Justice Department head dedicated not to the law or our security, but to protecting Donald Trump’s ample ass.
There are a lot of very smart legal minds standing by to parse the document Attorney General William Barr (R-Trump’s Pocket) drops on Thursday.
When Trump toady Matt Schlapp tweeted on Feb. 14, 2019 , that the president now had a fully operational attorney general, he said the quiet part loud.
He signaled to everyone who would listen that the fix was in, Mueller was done, and whatever report hit his desk would be diluted, redacted, and memory-holed just as far as he could.
Four weeks ago, Barr proved it. He gave Donald Trump a peerless political gift; a four-page get-out-of-jail-free card that allowed the president and his hallelujah chorus to scream to the heavens, “No Collusion! No Obstruction!” They’ve screamed it until they’re hoarse, desperate to close the long chapter of the Mueller investigation.
Tomorrow, Bill Barr will continue his shenanigans by releasing a version of the Mueller report that is expected to be so heavily redacted that we may not be able to see much besides the words “a” “and” and “the” on many pages. Barr’s sweeping interpretation of what he chooses to redact has already been previewed for Congress and the American people, and his answer is everything he damn well pleases. If they hurt Trump, expect a black box to cover every single word.
There will be many who throw up their hands in frustration and anger. That’s a feature of the Trump/Barr/Giuliani strategy. Their stonewalling hasn’t been punished by Congress or the courts at any turn, and they feel invincible. They’re counting on exhaustion and fury to be the primary reaction to one more outrage, one more coverup, one more example of Trumpian corruption and lawlessness.
Shake it off, people.
Those who oppose Trump and value our institutions will see that even this limited release of the Mueller report is one more battle in a long war.
The biggest fear of Trump and his allies is that the report will say, “Well, if Trump were a civilian, we’d indict his ass, take him to trial, win, and slap his fool ass into a SuperMax pour encourager les autres , but DOJ policy says we can’t indict a president.” That outcome is high on the bad-case scenario list; it will supercharge the congressional impeachment fires.
What else might we learn? For starters, Americans are likely to get a much more detailed understanding that Trump won the election with the help of friends in the Russian intelligence agencies tasked to destroy America from within.
Even from the currently filed indictments and documents that have come to light, we know that the counterintelligence aspects of the Mueller investigation almost immediately, and in granular detail, identified the Russian influence operation that successfully manipulated the 2016 election.
We’ll likely learn quite a bit more about this, even though some of it will have been derived from SIGINT and COMINT channels that will remain classified. This will be an education on the vulnerabilities of our elections, our media, our social media platforms, and an indelible confirmation that President Donald Trump will always have a Cyrillic asterisk next to his name, even without a demonstrated quid pro quo.
Next, we’ll get to see the grasping, venal eagerness Trump had to build a tower in Moscow. Between Mueller, Cohen, and Felix Sater, this is already coming to light, but Trump has always acted with a degree of boot-licking obedience to Vladimir Putin that borders on comic. He didn’t want to be president; he wanted to build a branded tower in Moscow. Spoiler: He still does.
Even among Trump’s most fervent followers, there’s a creeping sense that the victory lap may have been too much. The chest beating, the declaration that revenge was coming, endless gloating based on nothing more than a four-page letter seemed to the brighter members of the Trump orbit to be an invitation for some karmic comeuppance of the first order.
NBC reported Tuesday that many in the White House now, or those who were fired or limped away, are nervous that the Mueller report will show them to be either subjects or cooperators. Trump’s notorious vengeful streak is going to make for some awkward conversations and ugly tweets. One jumpy Trump ally asked me rhetorically, “Do you think he’ll be pissed if Mueller says he and the campaign were too stupid to take the Russian help?”
Trump is the god of projection, our umber O.J. Simpson, taunting and winking at the audience, writing his own version of “If I Did It” with every tweet. Familial omerta and tribal protection are more valuable than gold. He proves a case darker than just campaign collusion with moments like Helsinki and Paris, where we clearly see who is the master and who is the servant in the Trump-Putin relationship. Spoiler: It’s Vlad holding the leash.
Trump’s allies have been trying to discredit Mueller for two years, and they saw this release as a complete vindication of their theory that it wasn’t Trump and the Russians conspiring, but the nefarious, imaginary deep state.
Trump and his friends at Fox have led a constant drumbeat that it’s vital now to investigate the investigators, to track down those dastardly deep staters. That’s the next major turn of the public messaging strategy on the part of Fox, and the louder that is, the more you know the details of the Mueller report are hitting home.
It won’t matter to the MAGA yokel crowd and the QAnon loons, but what we’ll see from the report will be the serious men and women from the SCO, FBI, DOJ and intel community facing up to urgent national security threats and rampant obstruction, not a rabid pack of partisan Democrats chasing Trump and his blameless allies. Instead of a witch hunt, we’ll almost certainly see that this was a fine-grained, highly professional investigation of the leads that generated a broad, well-sourced, and fully justified effort.
The Mueller investigation has already given us an idea of the scuzzy, sleazy behavior of several of Trump’s close advisers, including Michael Cohen, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort. We’ll see more, and it won’t be pretty.
In many ways, this 400-page redaction is the tip of a big, slimy iceberg. Mueller was a cagey player from the start, and he likely gamed out scenarios where Trump would try to derail the course of justice. The dispersal of cases out to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the Eastern District of Virginia, and the DC US Attorney means he built a legal hydra resistant to interference and decapitation. Those cases are ongoing, and like a minefield, still dangerous to Trump and his cronies.
The media, which never fail to get pranked by the Trump enterprise, the sense that the Russia story is over, done, kaput, and that Trump emerged unscathed will get a mountain of new leads, new storylines, and new evidence. Congress will have more work than it can handle, and if this game of redaction and coverup doesn’t shake the Democrats into sudden, vicious action, nothing can save them.
The wheels of justice grind notoriously slowly, but they grind fine. Sorry, Donald—the game is still on. READ THIS LIST"
Former Congressman Keith Ellison: Trump’s Attacks on Ilhan Omar are 'Violent Incitement',www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/former-congressman-keith-ellison-trumps-attacks-on-ilhan-omar-are-violent-incitement,"BEEN THERE Former Congressman Keith Ellison: Trump’s Attacks on Ilhan Omar are 'Violent Incitement' “I don’t know if they don’t realize they’re risking her safety or they just don’t care,” said the first Muslim member of Congress and Omar’s Minnesota predecessor. 04.17.19 6:17 PM ET Win McNamee
Former congressman Keith Ellison has a theory for why President Donald Trump is working to make Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) public enemy number one.
“She, simply by her existence, is a person who he doesn’t believe belongs,” Ellison said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast. “She’s a Muslim, she’s a woman, she wears a hijab, she’s black, before she ever opens her mouth she’s offensive to him.""
Omar has been a constant lightning rod for controversy since arriving in Washington, where her comments about the Israel lobby have drawn intense criticism from her Democratic and Republican colleagues alike.
After conservatives seized on a snippet of a speech in which Omar appeared to downplay the September 11th attacks, the president took his criticism of her to a new level, tweeting to his millions of followers last weekend a video of the congresswoman’s remarks, superimposed with images of the Twin Towers burning.
Ellison, now the attorney general of Minnesota, has an idea of what the freshman lawmaker who holds his old seat is going through. He arrived in Congress in 2007 as the first Muslim to ever serve in that body, and faced suspicion and allegations of disloyalty from his colleagues from the moment he was sworn in on a copy of the Quran. Twelve years later, there are three Muslim members of Congress, and more Muslim-American officeholders around the country than ever.
But the environment that Omar faces, said Ellison, is probably the most hostile one ever for a Muslim elected official – which is saying quite a bit, considering that Ellison faced death threats of his own and casual suggestions from his colleagues, like former Rep. Michele Bachmann and Rep. Steve King, that he was aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood and failed to sufficiently renounce Sharia law.
Since Trump tweeted the video of Omar, death threats on her have increased exponentially, her office has told media. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is moving to increase the congresswoman’s security detail, as Trump insists he was right to go after the congresswoman and claims she has “a way about her” that is “very, very bad for our country.”
Asked if he worried for Omar’s safety, Ellison sighed. “Sure I do. There’s crazy people out there,” he said. “We live in a very dangerous political environment and she’s in the danger zone as much as anyone. I pray for her and I urge people to calm the rhetoric down.”
Ellison also urged Twitter to do more to censure Trump’s video. “That is incitement, that’s violent incitement,” he said of the video. “There’s no two ways about it.”
“Everyone knows what happened to Gabby Giffords,” he went on, referencing the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head during a constituent event in 2011. “It makes it difficult for you to engage the public because you don’t know where the hostility is coming from, and it is unnatural to be the target of that much unwarranted hatred. It’s strange, it’s weird. She’s bearing a burden.”
Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), the number two Republican in the House, Ellison noted, was also shot at a baseball practice in 2017.
To congressional Republicans who have spent months going after Omar and forcing all Democrats to answer for her, Ellison also had some choice words. “It’s wildly irresponsible,” he said. “I don’t know if they don’t realize they’re risking her safety or they just don’t care… ‘Just don’t care’ is a real option, because they have every reason to suspect their rhetoric could lead to some very negative, foreseeable consequence. They should know it.”
Ellison predicted things would get worse before they get better, and tied Trump’s rhetoric on Omar to his 2020 reelection strategy. “I keep thinking there’s gotta be a floor with him but there absolutely simply is no floor, there’s no low depth he won’t go to,” he said. “It’s clear to me he is trying to whip up nativism, tribalism, bigotry of all kinds, and turn the country against itself for his own benefit.”
He cautioned Omar against getting pulled into these spats, advising that she focus instead on why she came to D.C. in the first place.
Omar, said Ellison, “should pivot back to those issues that made her want to be a member of Congress, and just stay on them. She wanted to do something about student debt, jobs and the economy, the environment… Get back to that, and don’t let them pull you off. Use the heightened profile to raise the issues you’re passionate about.” READ THIS LIST"
Mueller Report Rollout Won’t Have Mueller,www.thedailybeast.com,justin.miller@thedailybeast.com (Justin Miller) sam.stein@thedailybeast.com (Sam Stein),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-report-rollout-wont-have-mueller,"04.17.19 6:16 PM ET Yuri Gripas/Reuters
The Mueller report isn’t out yet, but the rollout is and it’s already causing controversy.
The Justice Department will hold a press conference Thursday morning about the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report —but Mueller won’t be there and the document may not be released until after Attorney General William Barr speaks about the nearly 400 pages he went through to redact.
The House Judiciary Committee has been told it will not get the Mueller report from DOJ until 11 a.m. or noon—after Barr’s press conference scheduled for 9:30 a.m.
“They are making Al Capone look straight,” one committee member told The Daily Beast.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler ripped Barr’s plan to speak about the report before lawmakers, the media and public have a chance to review it.
“Rather than letting the facts of the report speak for themselves, the attorney general has taken unprecedented steps to spin Mueller’s nearly two-year investigation,” Nadler said at a press conference on Wednesday night.
“The Attorney General appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump, the very subject of the investigation at the heart of the Mueller report,” he added.
If the report is heavily redacted, Nadler said, “we will most certainly issue the subpoenas in very short order.” He said they “will probably find it useful” to ask Mueller and members of his team to testify.
Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said not to trust what Barr says on Thursday.
“Bill Barr sent a letter purporting to summarize Mueller’s conclusions. He took it upon himself to reach a conclusion on obstruction. He adopted the President’s “spying” smears. Now, he will spin a report no one has read,” he wrote. “My advice: Wait to read Mueller’s words for yourself.”
Rep. Val Demings (D-FL) was one of the first Democratic lawmakers to voice concerns, tweeting, “Pretty convenient of the Attorney General to take questions on the report before anyone has a chance to read the report.”
A Justice Department official briefed on the report told The Daily Beast that “it will give the White House some heartburn” but won’t be as dramatic as some people expect.
Meanwhile, the New York Times reports DOJ officials have briefed the White House on Mueller’s findings while President Trump’s team prepares a public-relations offensive against the investigation that Trump has called an illegal “witch hunt” for two years. Nadler also tweeted he is “deeply troubled” by the Times report.

Doctors Have New Ways to Detect and Treat It. The FDA is looking into a device and revolutionary pee test that could help stave the leading cause of maternal and fetal deaths. 04.17.19 4:43 PM ET VALERIE MACON
Beyonce’s revelation that she suffered from pre-eclampsia during her pregnancy highlights a dangerous condition that affects 5% of women and that scientists have recently developed new ways to detect and treat.
In her new Netflix documentary, Homecoming, the superstar says she had an “extremely difficult pregnancy” due to high blood pressure before she gave birth to twins Sir and Rumi in 2017.
“My body went through more than I knew it could,” she says.
That’s not an understatement. Preeclampsia can cause liver and kidney damage, seizures, stroke, and severe bleeding. It can trigger preterm labor and is the leading cause of premature births and maternal and fetal deaths in the U.S.
The most effective treatment is delivery since many drugs to lower blood pressure aren’t safe during pregnancy—but the FDA has just given approval for development of a device that could be an alternative.
Advanced Prenatal Therapeutics says its Targeted Apheresis Column for Preeclampsia (TAC-PE) can remove “disease-causing factors from the mother’s blood.”
A 2003 study on pregnant rats published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation suggests that overproduction of an enzyme called sFlt1 causes pre-eclampsia. Theoretically, the new device could remove that from the blood, which would then be reintroduced to the patient.
One of the challenges of pre-eclampsia is that it is difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are common conditions in pregnancy. Women can have the disease for weeks without knowing, which ups the chances of severe complications.
But there have been advances on that front, too. In a paper published last month in Lancet’s E-Clinical Medicine, researchers at Ohio State University showed a simple, three-minute urine test might help. The Congo Red Dot is a small paper with a red dot in the middle. When a pregnant woman urinates on the spot and it starts to fade and get bigger, the woman probably has the condition.
In the study 346 pregnant women used the test, which had an accuracy rate of 86%—far superior to current tests. The developers of the test are currently waiting for FDA approval. READ THIS LIST"

President Trump on Wednesday took stock of potential Democrats he could face in the 2020 election, singling out three in particular.
“It could be Bernie, and it could be Biden,” he told SiriusXM host David Webb after a long-winded rant that included references to Venezuela and Vermont. “And I think Sleepy Joe’s going to have a hard time. He’s, you know, 1% Joe. I don’t think he’s going to make it and I don’t, I don't know that Bernie—it may be Bernie has the most spirit over there right now.”
He continued, referring to South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg : “Could be the mayor from Indiana. I think I’d like running against him, too.”
On Tuesday, Trump tweeted his thoughts about Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce his candidacy soon.
“I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)! I look forward to facing whoever it may be,” he tweeted. “May God Rest Their Soul!”
In another tweet, the president seemed especially irked that the Vermont senator appeared on a highly rated Fox News town-hall event the day prior.
He had also expressed some consternation about the senator's appearance on Fox earlier in the week, saying it was “ so weird to watch .” Sanders’ appearance generated the highest ratings of any town-hall event so far in the 2020 cycle and a number of Democrats are now either in talks to do one or are considering the possibility."

Twitter Erupts In Fury. The ‘Times’ has been accused of being 'disgusting’ and 'pathetic,’ as well as sexist, after it contacted and quoted the mother of former Hillary Clinton aide Neera Tanden. 04.17.19 4:03 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty/AP
Mother’s Day is almost a month from now, yet already a bitter dispute has erupted over The New York Times ’ decision to interview the mother of a profile subject for a front-page story that featured a liberal Washington think tank.
It’s one of those quarrels that probably could only have occurred among media, political and policy elites in the Beltway bubble of Washington, D.C., who have suddenly decided to impersonate scorpions in a bottle.
Fighting words such as “disgusting” and “pathetic,” along with allegations of sexism against the newspaper, have been part of a fusillade of invective launched by former Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama aide Neera Tanden , the president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, and an army of sympathizers who clearly hated Tuesday’s report, which focused on the think tank head’s mutual antipathy with the Bernie Sanders campaign.
“Good summary,” Tanden tweeted over a post from Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks: “WTF, ‪@ nytimes - Would you run an article about a *male* political leader’s relationship with a rival political campaign that relied mainly on quotes from...his mom? And would it be newsworthy for a male leader to be viewed as ‘aggressive’?”
Tanden also retweeted the remark of one of her communications staffers, Colin Seeberger, who opined : “Disgusting ‪@ nytimes — shame on you for exploiting ‪@ neeratanden ’s mother.”
The double-bylined authors, Elizabeth Williamson and Kenneth P. Vogel, have also been feeling the heat after Williamson obtained a number of salty and revealing comments about Tanden from her 78-year-old mother, Maya, who offered up such insights as:
•Her daughter “can be very aggressive.”
•”She’s not going to let anyone rule over her, and she has loyalty to Hillary because Hillary is the one who made her.”
•“Those Bernie brothers are attacking her all the time, but she lets them have it, too…She says Sanders got a pass” in 2016, “but he’s not getting a pass this time.” “I didn’t slug him, I pushed him”
The Times story led with a 2008 anecdote in which then-Clinton aide Tanden, angry over ThinkProgress interviewer Faiz Shaikir’s confrontational question to candidate Clinton about her support for the Iraq war, allegedly punched Shaikir, who today is Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager.
“I didn’t slug him, I pushed him,” Tanden was quoted in the Times story headlined “The Rematch: Bernie Sanders vs. a Clinton Loyalist.”
The dispute over the Times story became so toxic that after former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul took to Twitter to criticize the Times’ use of Maya Tanden’s quotes about her daughter, Vogel blocked him—which opened a whole new line of attack.
“A ‪@ nytimes reporter, ‪@ kenvogel , has blocked me on ‪@ twitter . 1st time ever,” McFaul complained on the social media platform. “I have interacted with Mr. Vogel in the past, trying to help his reporting. Can someone from ‪@ nytimes please justify this behavior? I find it unethical.”
A Times spokesperson declined to weigh in on Vogel’s blocking of McFaul, who is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.
Vogel—who in the wee hours Wednesday, after McFaul’s complaint and much chatter on Twitter, reversed himself and unblocked the former ambassador—didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Tanden likewise was unavailable, her spokesperson said.
McFaul—who is banned from traveling to Russia as an adversary of Vladimir Putin—told The Daily Beast: “When I woke up this morning, I wasn’t blocked…I thought it was odd that for one of the two people [Tanden and Shaikir] being featured in the story, her mother would become a source. It would be like calling my mother in Montana and asking her about my dispute with Putin. Why is that relevant? She’s not an expert on Russia. I don’t know Neera Tanden’s mother, but it doesn’t seem like she’s an expert commentator on the particular story they’re talking about.”
McFaul added that he took issue with the Times story, and not Vogel personally, in the spirit of constructive criticism: “In my profession, and in our academic culture, we criticize people’s work, we have peer review, to make it better, and I don’t quite understand why journalists should be treated differently.”
Vogel—who had tweeted out the story with the provocative remark “THANKS, MOM,” also blocked other critics, including Fordham Law School Professor Jed Shugerman, who tweeted : “Remember when the ‪@ nytimes closed down its ombudsman office & invited readers to serve that role on social media? Today I called ‪@ kenvogel 's tweets on ‪@ neeratanden 's mom ""gratuitous,""""prurient,""&""unbecoming."" That was it. So guess how he responded? He blocked me.”
Several hours after the story was published, Neera Tanden’s mother, released a statement implying that the Times reporter had somehow tricked her into talking. “I didn’t understand my words would be used in the story and once I understood they could be, I called her back to clarify that. Only then did she tell me my words were ‘on the record,’ a term I’ve never heard before. I feel very misled, and it is shameful the New York Times would use my words to hurt my daughter”
“For the first time in my life, a reporter contacted me out of nowhere and said she wanted to talk to me for what I thought was a nice story about Neera,” Maya Tanden’s statement said. “I didn’t understand my words would be used in the story and once I understood they could be, I called her back to clarify that. Only then did she tell me my words were ‘on the record,’ a term I’ve never heard before. I feel very misled, and it is shameful the New York Times would use my words to hurt my daughter.”
The Times responded: ""Our story focuses on ideological divisions in the Democratic party and the Center for American Progress, a think tank/political organization with a $60 million combined budget. The story provides an in-depth look at the center’s president, Neera Tanden. It includes accurate, on-the-record comments by Maya Tanden, Neera Tanden's mother. Maya Tanden is knowledgeable about Democratic politics and her daughter's career, and has been active in local Democratic politics.""
Neera Tanden was not impressed: For the record,” she tweeted late Tuesday night, her mother “was active in her home town of Bedford’s Democratic committee decades ago. This is a pathetic rationalization. Truly pathetic.”
Yet there are those who remain unconvinced that ethical journalism forbids a reporter from reaching out to a profile subject’s mother. “How they handled it once they talked to her, I have no idea. But, heck, I got profiled by my hometown newspaper once, and the first person they called was my dad”
“Of course it’s permissible,” said Lucy Dalglish, dean of the University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College of Journalism. “As with any other source, you’re trying to talk to people who can give you a picture of the person you’re profiling. I have no idea why they would have called the mother, but presumably they had a good reason for doing so. How they handled it once they talked to her, I have no idea. But, heck, I got profiled by my hometown newspaper once, and the first person they called was my dad.”
As for the boiling rage over the Times article, Dalglish cited the wisdom of her three-year-old niece Caisley, a fan of the sayings of Fred Rogers: “When you’re so angry and you want to roar, take a deep breath and count to four.” READ THIS LIST"
Scouted: Dagne Dover’s Landon and Dakota Commute Bags Are the Best All-Around Commuting Bags I’ve Ever Experienced,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.grudo@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Grudo),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dagne-dovers-landon-and-dakota-commute-bags-can-handle-your-gym-office-and-evening-needs,"Scouted By The Beast
For a while now, I’ve been searching for one perfect bag to use everyday : one that could take me to the gym, to the office, and later for a night out. That meant I was looking for function, professional form, and stylish looks in this one bag. Expecting just one bag to meet each of these set a high standard — one that Dagne Dover hit out of the park.
They sent me a few bags to try out — the Landon Carryall Duffel Bag and the Dakota Backpack . The biggest challenge I faced, to be honest, is deciding which one I liked more as my next everyday bag. After weeks of switching between the two during my commute from Brooklyn and into Manhattan, stops at the gym before going to the office, and evening events or dinners afterward, I’ve concluded that both of them work for work, for the gym, and for life. I do prefer one of them and I do love both of them (that’s kinda what it’s like when you have kids, right?) and will use them interchangeably in the coming months. Dagne Dover's Dakota BackPack
Dakota Backpack , $135 at Dagne Dover: This is my favorite Dagne Dover bag. With the medium size in tow, I was able to fit my running shoes, gym clothes, toiletries, 13-inch Macbook Pro in a case, Kindle, headphones, charging cables for everything, and lunch, to mention the important stuff. The bag comes with a dedicated zippered wallet you can store important things in, from your keys to some Advil, and there are sleeves throughout to sequester your cords, cables, or whatever other tchotchkes you need with you. Best of all, the medium backpack is compact and its bottom sits above my butt when I’m walking, so it’s extremely versatile and allows me full comfort and movement as I navigate the city. If I had to break into a run to meet a train or cross a street, I wouldn’t even know I was carrying a full day’s essentials on my back.
Oh, yeah, and despite walking with it to work in a sudden and heavy downpour, the 100% Neoprene fabric not only kept everything completely dry on the inside, it also stayed looking really good even when wet. Two zippers on each end of its padded back allow you to store something like a wallet or phone (in my case, one in each) and zip them up, protecting them while allowing for very easy access to them. On the inside, this bag blows me away still. The far wall has three zippered compartments on its inside: one for its bottom half and two up top, slicing the top half into two sides. All that zippering means you can get very intentional with where things go and how secure they’re kept. It would be very hard for a bag to beat the flexible style and massive function that the Dakota achieves — I’m a huge fan. You can get the Dakota in 13 different colors and sizes Small , Medium , and Large . Dagne Dover's Landon Carryall
Landon Carryall Duffel Bag , $155 at Dagne Dover: Funny but the Landon is the first bag I used during this weeks-long trial and it changed everything I thought I understood about duffels. I got it in Bay Blue but like with the Dakota, you have that and 12 other colors to choose from. And like the Dakota, the inside of this bag is wild. It’s got a dedicated sleeve for your laptop and also comes with a mesh wallet-sized compartment for your valuables. It’s got massive handles that you can wrap atop your shoulders for a tote-carry and a detachable cross-body strap that easily installs or uninstalls for a different kind of carry. It’s constructed with the same neoprene. Its main zipper extends past its body and lets you either let it loose for a larger bag or you can snap that zippered extension to either or both sides of the bag, instantly turning it compact . In the world of duffels and totes, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a bag that looked so good and worked so well for me. The Landon sets a high bar for commute bags.
Of the two, right now I’m more prone to use the backpack because my needs are minimal and it fits all my gym stuff. But if I know I’ll be shopping or otherwise want to fit a few more things into the bag, I’ll easily transfer to the Landon. Tonight, for example, I’m flying out of town and will be using the Landon instead of the Dakota (yeah, it will fit under the seat) — along with my Victorinox carry-on .
If you’ve been looking for the perfect bag that works at the gym and works at work, I’m pretty sure you’ve just found it.

Beyoncé’s ‘Homecoming’ Is a Testament to Her Unrivaled Genius,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyonces-netflix-film-homecoming-is-a-testament-to-her-unrivaled-genius,"Beyoncé’s ‘Homecoming’ Is a Testament to Her Unrivaled Genius Courtesy of Parkwood Entertainment via Netflix The behind-the-scenes documentary chronicles all the hard work that went into her history-making Coachella performance, including her comeback from a traumatic childbirth. Amy Zimmerman 04.17.19 2:45 PM ET
I n 2016, Beyoncé cemented her legendary status with Lemonade , a stunning visual album that set a whole new standard. On Lemonade , Beyoncé flexed her complete command as both an artist and a mega-celebrity, proving that she could take in infidelity rumors and scandal and churn out groundbreaking art, topping the charts while simultaneously changing the conversation. Even before Lemonade , Beyoncé was effectively in a league of her own. When she raises the bar, as she always does, she’s one-upping herself; it’s not a question of intimidating challengers, but of legacy, and of proving to her incredulous fans that she can go even higher.
Last year’s “Beychella” performance was yet another example of Beyoncé being way better than anyone has been or needs to be. As the festival’s headliner, she pushed the absolute limits of the form with a spectacular, nuanced, and all-around jaw-dropping ode to HBCU culture and black excellence. As The New York Times summarized , “Beyoncé’s show brought more than a century of black musical traditions to America’s biggest music festival, with quotations and techniques joining her hits with Houston’s slowed-down screw music, Washington, D.C.’s percussive go-go rhythms, New Orleans’ brass bands and bounce artists, the Nigerian Afrobeat of Fela Kuti, the Jamaican dancehall of Sister Nancy, the Atlanta crunk of Pastor Troy, and even a moment for ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing,’ the early 1900s hymn long called the black national anthem.”
Now, a year later, the terrifyingly prolific artist and businesswoman has written, directed, and executive produced Homecoming , a Netflix documentary about her Coachella performance. She also surprise-released a live album of the festival set tied to the film, because of course she did. Beyoncé’s still-evolving legacy is one of total creative control. Homecoming is an incredible concert film, because of course it is, but it’s also a testament to the totality of Beyoncé’s vision, the fact that she gave us a groundbreaking performance and then, a year later, showed us how to watch it. The real beauty of Homecoming isn’t the incredible performance footage or the flashes of Beyoncé’s inner life; it’s the latest opportunity to see this mind at work.
Homecoming is artfully arranged, with behind-the-scenes content book-ended by swathes of Beychella, contextualized with quotes from black artists and intellectuals from Toni Morrison to W.E.B. Du Bois and Audre Lorde. In voiceovers, Beyoncé shares her vision, an homage to historically black colleges and universities, saying, “I always dreamed of going to an HBCU.” Naturally, there’s a bigger picture here. Beyoncé assembled a massive team of steppers, musicians, vocalists, and dancers, noting, “The amount of swag is just limitless…It’s just so much damn swag.”
Beyoncé conceived of her Coachella performance as an homage to an HBCU homecoming, as well as a personal return to performing after giving birth to twins. Against home footage of sonograms and her newborn babies, Beyoncé explains how she was supposed to headline Coachella the year before, but got pregnant “unexpectedly.” She recalls, “My body went through more than I knew it could. I was 218 pounds the day I gave birth.” She goes on to describe the pregnancy as “extremely difficult”, culminating in an emergency C-section when one of the babies’ heartbeats “paused a few times.”
“It’s my first time back home, on the stage, after giving birth; I’m creating my own homecoming,” She narrates. “All of my mistakes, all of the triumphs of my 22-year career into my two-hour homecoming performance.”
Reflecting on the weight of being the first African-American woman to headline Coachella, Beyoncé notes that, “It was important to me that everyone that had never seen themselves represented felt like they were on that stage with us.” She continues, “Black women often feel underestimated, and I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process.” “ Black women often feel underestimated, and I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. ”
“I wanted everyone to feel grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty, thankful for their freedom…We were able to create a free, safe space where none of us were marginalized.”
“When I decided to do Coachella, instead of bringing out my flower crown, it was more important that I brought our culture to Coachella,” Beyoncé explains. In a voiceover, Nina Simone intones, “I think what you’re trying to ask is why am I so insistent upon giving out to them that blackness, that black power, that black—pushing them to identify with black culture…I have no choice over it…to me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, black people.”
Naturally, bringing a HBCU homecoming-inspired career retrospective to life was a months-long, exhaustive endeavor. Homecoming gives viewers a peak into Beyoncé’s meticulous process. “I personally selected each dancer, every light, the material on the steps, the height of the pyramid, the shape of the pyramid,” she explains. “I’m super specific about every detail.”
Performance prep included four months of rehearsals just with the band followed by four months of dance rehearsals. Beyoncé is incredibly hands-on, leading the group in prayers and pep talks and then reviewing and giving notes after every single rehearsal. One particularly revealing scene shows Beyoncé handing out her notes after a long day, Jay Z sitting silently beside her, nodding. Only after the meeting ends do we learn that it’s their anniversary.
Beyoncé’s dedication to realizing her vision is extreme. It means time away from her family and her newborns, not to mention “rebuild[ing]” her body and tackling intense choreography. In addition to SoulCycle and day-long rehearsals, that meant cutting out bread, carbs, sugar, dairy, meat, fish, and alcohol. “I’m hungry,” Beyoncé admits at one point. Reflecting on the uphill journey to Coachella, Beyoncé swears that, “I will never push myself that far again.” But it’s hard to believe her.
Despite all of the sacrifice, Homecoming is full of joy, from the “family” that Beyoncé put together on stage to the screaming, crying fans mouthing along to her every word. The concert footage finds extremely personal, almost intimate moments buried in the massive spectacle. From this vantage point, we can see the easy, ecstatic way Beyoncé interacts with her husband and her “best friends,” the other members of Destiny’s Child, onstage. Behind the scenes footage of Jay Z and Blue Ivy at rehearsals confirms that this performance is inspired by and dedicated to her family, “my weakness and my strength.”
As the film comes to an end, Beyoncé notes that, “I feel we made something that made by daughter proud.” Footage flashes of Blue Ivy singing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the “black national anthem” that Beyoncé featured in her set. She continues, “Made my mother proud, my father proud, and all of the people that are my brothers and sisters around the world, and that’s why I live.” As the documentary builds up to the final portion of the performance, a Maya Angelou voiceover exhorts, “Tell the truth, to yourself first. And to the children. Live in the present, don’t deny the past. Live in the present, and know the charge on you is to make this country more than it is today.” The camera pans over the assembled Coachella crowd, somehow blurring it into something beautiful."
Pills for Sex: Feds Charge Dozens of Doctors in Illegal Opioid Prescription Busts,www.thedailybeast.com,Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pills-for-sex-feds-charge-dozens-of-doctors-in-illegal-opioid-prescription-busts,"‘ROCK DOC’ Pills for Sex: Feds Charge Dozens of Doctors in Illegal Opioid Prescription Busts Sixty were charged in the crackdown on illegal opioid prescriptions. A dentist was accused of pulling his patients’ teeth to justify doling out more of the highly addictive pills. 04.17.19 2:23 PM ET John Moore/Getty
More than 50 medical professionals were charged by the Department of Justice on Wednesday with illegally distributing more than 32 million opioid pills, including one doctor who allegedly exchanged pills for sexual favors and a dentist who “unnecessarily” pulled patients’ teeth to justify prescribing the highly addictive drugs.
The charges are the result of a widespread investigation conducted by the Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force, created last year to target a region of the country that’s been particularly ravaged by the ongoing opioid epidemic, which has already claimed tens of thousands of American lives. Investigators and confidential informants infiltrated suspicious clinics, using cameras and tape recorders to capture the alleged crimes, The Washington Post reports.
“That is the equivalent of one opioid dose for every man, woman and child in the five states in the region that we’ve been targeting,” said Brian Benczowski, an assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s criminal division. “If these medical professionals behave like drug dealers, you can rest assured that the Justice Department is going to treat them like drug dealers.”
As a result of the investigation, 31 doctors were charged, alongside seven pharmacists, eight nurse practitioners, seven other licensed medical professionals, and seven others, the DOJ said in a press release . The charges include unlawful distribution or dispensing of controlled substances by a medical professional, health-care fraud, and conspiracy to obtain controlled substances by fraud.
A whopping 32 people face charges in Tennessee, including one doctor, the self-branded “Rock Doc,” who was accused of exchanging the highly addictive drugs for sexual favors. In just three years, the press release states, the Rock Doc allegedly prescribed “500,000 hydrocodone pills, 300,000 oxycodone pills, 1,500 fentanyl patches, and more than 600,000 benzodiazepine pills,” sometimes in exchange for sexual favors, and sometimes in “powerful and dangerous” combinations.
Similar charges were brought against a doctor in Alabama, who stands accused of recruiting prostitutes and other young women with whom he’d had sexual relationships to become his patients—and opening up his home for their illicit drug use. Another Alabama doctor allegedly doled out prescriptions to patients he knew to be addicts, collecting a “concierge fee” of $50 per visit or $600 a year. Yet another is accused of handing out “excessive” quantities of drugs to some patients that amounted to up to 15 pills a day.
In the Eastern District of Kentucky, a dentist stands accused of pulling patients’ teeth unnecessarily to justify prescribing opioids. A doctor was accused in the same district of prescribing opioids to his Facebook friends, who would come to his home to pick up their doses. That doctor also allegedly signed off on prescriptions for his office manager, who would deliver opioids to patients’ home in exchange for cash.
In Ohio, six people were charged, including a doctor who was believed at one time to be the highest prescriber of controlled substances in the state, and several others who allegedly ran a “pill mill” in Dayton that gave out 1.75 million pills between October 2015 and October 2017 alone.
This isn’t the first time federal prosecutors have gone after illegal narcotics schemes. Last summer, the Justice Department charged 162 people —including 76 doctors—with prescribing and distributing opioids and other dangerous drugs.
Federal officials say this is just the beginning. “Today’s takedown demonstrates the FBI’s unwavering commitment to working alongside our Strike Force partners, including the HHS-OIG and DEA, to fight the opioid epidemic and related criminal activity in the Appalachian region,” FBI Executive Assistant Director Hess said in the press release.
“We will not stand by and allow the harmful and oftentimes deadly practice of over-prescribing highly addictive drugs to continue unchecked. The FBI will pursue medical personnel who misuse their positions of trust to blatantly disregard others’ very lives for their own financial gain.”"
Fox’s Maria Bartiromo Loses It After Guest Says Wealthy Should Pay More Taxes,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-business-host-maria-bartiromo-loses-it-after-guest-says-wealthy-should-pay-more-taxes,"TOUCHY Fox’s Maria Bartiromo Loses It After Guest Says Wealthy Should Pay More Taxes The long-time Wall Street reporter was simply not having it when a guest suggested capital gains be taxed the same as income. 04.17.19 2:00 PM ET Fox Business Network
Things got a bit heated Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network when host Maria Bartiromo took issue with a guest’s assertion that the rich aren’t paying “their fair share” of taxes.
During a discussion on the latest fundraising hauls by 2020 presidential candidates, Republican strategist John Thomas said that Democratic frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is tarnished by the recent revelation that he’s a millionaire , claiming it undermines his “fundamental brand promise” that “millionaires and billionaires are evil capitalists.”
This prompted Fox contributor Richard Fowler to push back, stating that Sanders never said that millionaires are evil, but simply insisting that “everybody should pay their fair share.” That line got Bartiromo— a long-time Wall Street reporter —to get involved.
“Who’s not paying their fair share?!” she shouted at Fowler. “Just tell me who’s not paying—this is really—this is such a talking point that bothers me!”
As Fowler explained that they’d had this conversation in the past, Bartiromo claimed the top-ten percent wealthiest Americans pay 71 percent of the taxes, and chastised her guest for using a “talking point.”
After calming Bartiromo down, Fowler went on to say that they “almost agree on this point” and that he is mostly talking about taxes on those who make their income from capital gains or real-estate investment when it comes to paying “their fair share.”
Bartiromo, however, was not done, accusing Fowler of “putting apples together with oranges” by grouping together capital gains and income. After she and Thomas tag-teamed Fowler on capital gains and how it’s “an essential part of this country and entrepreneurship,” Fowler said he wasn’t arguing we shouldn’t have capital gains but that “we should level the playing field” while using investor Warren Buffet’s example that he pays taxes at a lesser rate than his secretary.
“It is level, that's another talking point, and you're confusing it,” Bartiromo lectured Fowler. “Warren Buffett, when he talks that he has to pay less in taxes than his secretary, it’s two different things.”
The segment would go on like this for another minute or so, with the rest of the panel pummeling Fowler for having the audacity to want capital gains taxed at a rate similar to income."

How Arya Stark Actress Maisie Williams Sat In Bed Eating Food with Her On-Screen Sister During Her Depressive Phases,www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/game-of-thrones-how-arya-stark-actress-maisie-williams-sat-in-bed-eating-food-with-her-on-screen-sister-during-her-depressive-phases,"Travel Strong Women How Arya Stark Actress Maisie Williams Sat In Bed Eating Food with Her On-Screen Sister During Her Depressive Phases Starring roles on the world’s biggest TV show took their toll on Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, who played sisters Sansa and Arya Stark. 04.17.19 7:57 AM ET Alberto E. Rodriguez
Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones , broke down in tears as she told a podcast how she was overwhelmed by her sudden fame, and even considered suicide as a result.
She told Dr Phil’s podcast, Phil in the Blanks , how she fell into a depressive spiral with her friend and co-star Maisie Williams, who plays her sister Arya in the hit series which came back for its eighth and final series this week. She said the two of them would often sit inside after gruelling filming schedules, eating food in bed.
“Maisie is just a year younger than me and we were growing up together. She was my best friend, and she was the only one I really told about everything. I think being friends with each other was quite destructive because we were going through the same thing.
“We would get home from set, go to a Tesco, a little supermarket across the road, and just buy food. We’d go back to our room and eat it in bed. We never socialized for a couple of years.”
Turner was 13 when she was cast in the role of Sansa and she became fixated with the criticism she received from trolls, who called her “fat” and “a bad actress.”
“I would just believe it,” Turner said. “I would get [the costume department] to tighten my corset a lot. I just got very, very self-conscious.”
As Turner’s depression progressed, she said, “I had no motivation to do anything or go out. Even with my best friends, I wouldn’t want to see them ... I would cry and cry and cry. Just having to change and put on clothes, I said, ‘I can’t do this. I can’t go outside. I have nothing that I want to do.’”
Turner told Dr. Phil that she had experienced suicidal thoughts from a young age and broke down in tears when Dr. Phil said teenage girls in America were committing suicide because of depression and low self-esteem.
“People shouldn't be ashamed of it,” Turner said, wiping away tears. “So many people are kind of plagued with depression or anxiety or body issues. More people than people realize. If people just opened up to their friends and family, it would be OK. All you have to do is to speak to someone, and you can get the help that you need.”
Turner said that she is on the road to recovery thanks to a work break, and the help of a therapist and medication.
She also praised her fiance, 29-year-old Joe Jonas, for boosting her self-esteem.
“I’m now with someone that makes me realize, you know, that I do have some redeeming qualities, I suppose, and when someone tells you they love you every day, it makes you realize why that is, and I think it makes you love yourself a bit more.” READ THIS LIST"
How Sansa Stark Became the Savviest Person in Westeros,www.thedailybeast.com,melissa.leon@thedailybeast.com (Melissa Leon),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/game-of-thrones-how-sansa-stark-became-the-savviest-person-in-westeros,"OVERLOOKED How Sansa Stark Became the Savviest Person in Westeros The show hasn’t always highlighted the transformation, but Sansa has undoubtedly emerged as the smartest leader still playing the Game of Thrones. WARNING: Spoilers. 04.17.19 7:52 AM ET HBO
On a show where dragons take down armies and ice zombies threaten humanity, it’s easy for the emotional maturing of a naive young girl to fly under the radar. But in Season 8, Game of Thrones finally seems ready to acknowledge what we’ve already seen: Sansa Stark is the cleverest player of the game, its most cunning politician, and a leader whose instincts and judgment are invaluable. She is not a conqueror, a warrior, or a queen, but she is a survivor—and if the living intend to stay that way, they should look to the Lady of Winterfell.
Sansa’s arc for so long involved victimization at the hands of tyrants and megalomaniacs who dismissed her potential because of her girlishness. While her siblings became warriors, led wars, or adventured north of the Wall, Sansa was trapped in the homes of her family’s enemies. This necessarily made her journey a subtler, more internal transformation, and one of the show’s most fascinating; it’s what we glimpse through gritted teeth as she learns to let enemies hear what they want to hear, to reflect what they want to see.
It’s why she’s proven unpopular with fans who mistakenly insist she doesn’t “do” anything, just because she doesn’t swing swords or swap faces or enter the minds giants. It’s exactly because of how easy she is to underestimate that Sansa survived for so long under her enemies’ noses. It’s how she learned to understand their thinking, what information to withhold, and how to make the most of dire situations—it’s how she learned politics.
It was gratifying then, to hear Arya Stark inform Jon Snow in the first episode of Season 8 that Sansa is “the smartest person I’ve ever met,” fizzling his attempt to bond through mutual eye-rolling at their sister. Not for the first time, Tyrion—whom she left to take the fall after Joffrey’s death at the purple wedding—expresses respect for Sansa’s instincts, too: “Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now,” he tells her. More importantly, Sansa asserts her own growth from a naive girl blinded by fairy tales to a sharp leader who can see through a lie even Tyrion can’t: “I used to think you were the cleverest man in the world,” she tells him, in a crushing expression of disappointment.
Sansa has risen from a horrific past to the position of Lady of Winterfell, and cuts a taller, more regal figure onscreen these days than she did in King’s Landing. But more than any survivor on the show, Sansa’s life has depended on making sure that enemies underestimated her. She had to convince Cersei Lannister, Joffrey, and Ramsay Bolton that she was useful yet harmless enough to keep alive—for years at a time, in a delicate balancing act that the more impulsive Starks, like Arya or Jon Snow, likely would fail.
Some attribute her savviness to the time she spent up-close with master manipulators Cersei and Littlefinger, but Sansa has played the game almost instinctively from the start, always with her cards pressed close to her chest. Think of how she flattered her tormentor, Joffrey, and negotiated for her father’s life (and succeeded until the last second when Joffrey broke his word on a whim). How deftly she made sure never to give Cersei reason to suspect her or discard her. How she refused, even two seasons later, to confess a single honest opinion about Joffrey to Olenna Tyrell, whom she had just met. Sansa’s commitment to staying alive is tougher than Valyrian steel.
She’s certainly got the best poker face, a calculating mind, and superhuman resilience. And she hasn’t let herself forget the “lessons” her enemies taught her—she can never afford to. Too much depends on how well she turns intimate knowledge about those foes to her advantage. She knew Littlefinger, for instance, would be good on his word to deliver the Knights of the Vale and help win the Battle of the Bastards. Just like she knows that Cersei, whatever Tyrion was tricked into believing, would never lift a finger to help the North.
Her gift for strategy has proved difficult for the show to illustrate coherently in its latter seasons—which is a shame since that’s when Sansa’s arc began to pay off most dramatically. Her last-minute entrance in the battle against Ramsay should have been a triumph; instead, the moment was nearly overshadowed by confusion. (Why hadn’t she told Jon reinforcements might be on the way? The show never answered.) Her feud with Arya last season felt similarly contrived. We’re to believe that the sisters bonded offscreen and laid a trap for Littlefinger. But that was so unclear in the plot’s rushed execution that instead it read like both sisters suffered short bouts of psychosis then snapped out of it when no one was looking.
Still, Season 8 begins with loud and clear recognition of Sansa’s abilities. And it hints that her mistrust of Daenerys isn’t exactly unjustified. (Sansa’s loyalty has always been with the North and her family; Daenerys, meanwhile, wants a throne; she expects subservience, not a relationship between equals.) The show’s handling of female conflict still lands awkwardly—the two are reduced to passive-aggressive sniping and long, petty glares across a table. But by this point, we know we shouldn’t dismiss Sansa’s instincts or her intelligence. It’s about time she gets some recognition—a little more respect would be nice, too. READ THIS LIST"

There are few things we love more at the Beast than things thought lost. We have a whole series called Lost Masterpieces that dives into works of art that were destroyed or never completed. We’ve also talked in the past about how nowadays, so much of discovery travel isn’t unexplored places but those that have been forgotten.
That’s why few books this spring got us as excited as the latest from Phaidon, Ruin and Redemption in Architecture by Dan Barasch. And thus why it’s the latest selection for our twice-a-month series on gorgeous travel-related coffee table books, Just Booked . The book with its snazzy half-cover in reflective gold is divided into three parts. The first dives into places that are gone--from the Hall of Nations in New Delhi to the Singer Building in NYC . The second section focuses on those that are still standing, but have been abandoned--from the Torre de David in Caracas to the Council of Ministries in Georgia. And the final, and perhaps most fun for travelers, section focuses on once abandoned places that have been redeemed by designers and architect with vision. Think the Grain Silo Complex (now the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art and the iconic Silo Hotel ) in Cape Town or the former Laverstoke Mill in Hampshire, England which is no the Bombay Sapphire Distillery.
So whether you enjoy journeying to places where your imagination can act like AR and recreate a lost masterpiece, you love abandoned places, or you have a passion for creative reuse, this book is right for you."
The Right Way to Make Passover Matzo Ball Soup,www.thedailybeast.com,Joan Nathan,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/passover-matzo-ball-soup-joan-nathans-recipe-from-the-new-book-the-100-most-jewish-foods,"2 Tbsp Finely chopped fresh parsley, dill, or cilantro 1 tsp Kosher salt, plus more as needed Coarsely ground black pepper Directions for Making the soup:
Put the chicken in a large pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches (about 4 quarts). Bring the water to a boil, skimming off the gray scum that rises to the top. Reduce the heat to medium-low so the soup is at a gentle but visible simmer.
Add the onions, parsnips, celery, carrots, parsley, 4 tablespoons of the dill, and the salt and pepper. Cover the pot with the lid ajar and simmer for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let the soup cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or up to overnight so the soup solidifies to a gel-like consistency and the schmaltz (fat) rises to the top and solidifies. Skim off the schmaltz and reserve it for the matzo balls. Directions for Making the matzo balls:
In a large bowl, using a soupspoon, gently mix the eggs, schmaltz, stock, matzo meal, nutmeg, ginger, and parsley, dill, or cilantro. Season with salt and 2 to 3 grinds of the pepper. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour and up to overnight.
When ready to cook the matzo balls, bring a wide, deep pot of lightly salted water to a boil. With wet hands, take some of the mix and mold it into the size and shape of a golf ball. Gently drop it into the boiling water, repeating until all the mixture is used.
Cover the pan, reduce the heat to a lively simmer, and cook for about 20 minutes for al dente matzo balls, and closer to 45 minutes for lighter matzo balls. To test their readiness, remove one with a slotted spoon and cut in half—the matzo ball should be the same color and texture throughout.
Just before serving, strain the soup, setting aside the chicken for chicken salad. Discard the vegetables, and reheat the broth. Spoon a matzo ball into each bowl, pour soup over the matzo ball, and sprinkle with the remaining dill sprigs. Note:
Like many Jewish foods, matzo balls are polarizing. First, there’s the size: Some prefer a boulder big enough to occupy most of the soup dish, while others like a ball small enough to fit two or three to a bowl. Then, there’s the texture. The larger balls, usually leavened with baking powder or seltzer, err on the light and airy side, aka “floaters.” The more petite kneidlach typically correspond to a dense, “sinker” consistency. This recipe, which balances heft and fluff, lands somewhere in between.

Charles Key Needs to Go to the Bathroom. Tennessee Won’t Let Him Because He’s Trans.,www.thedailybeast.com,samantha.allen@thedailybeast.com (Samantha Allen),04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/charles-key-needs-to-go-to-the-bathroom-tennessee-wont-let-him-because-hes-transgender,"Discrimination Charles Key Needs to Go to the Bathroom. Tennessee Won’t Let Him Because He’s Trans. The Tennessee state legislature is weighing a bill to protect the state’s anti-transgender bathroom access policies. A raft of other anti-LGBT policies may follow. 04.17.19 5:12 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty/Shutterstock
When Charles Key needs to use the restroom, he can’t go where the other boys go.
Instead, the high school junior has to use a teacher’s restroom on the other side of school from his classes.
The reason? He is transgender , and his Hendersonville, Tennessee , high school is one of many in the state—and in the country—that don’t allow transgender students to use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity .
“I really just want to use the restroom,” Key told The Daily Beast. “I don’t want to have to take time away from class, and nobody else has to [use the teacher’s restroom]—just anyone who’s trans.”
Now, the Tennessee state legislature is weighing a bill to protect policies like the one that keeps Key out of the boy’s bathroom. HB 1274–as the bill is called in the Tennessee House—would require the state attorney general’s office to defend local school districts that do not have transgender-inclusive restroom policies.
The bill itself, however, fastidiously avoids using the word “transgender,” stating instead that the attorney general should defend—or pay for the defense of—any “policy or practice designed to protect the privacy of students from exposure to others of the opposite biological sex” [ PDF ].
HB 1274 is part of what LGBT advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign and Freedom for All Americans are calling a “slate of hate” —a number of anti-LGBT bills that have been moving through the Tennessee state legislature this spring.
Other bills include one targeting transgender restroom use through Tennessee’s indecent exposure law and another targeting same-sex adoption and foster care.
“There is a really dangerous slate moving in Tennessee,” Hannah Willard, associate director of campaign communications for Freedom for All Americans, told The Daily Beast. “And we are especially concerned about the movement of HB 1274 in the last two weeks—[a bill] that specifically targets transgender grade schoolers like Charles.”
HB 1274 has been moving steadily through the Tennessee House this month—and has already been recommended for passage by the House Judiciary. The draft legislation is scheduled make its final stop in the Finance, Ways, and Means Subcommittee on April 17 before possibly advancing to the floor for a vote.
A companion bill in the Senate—SB 1499–was scheduled for deliberation in the Tennessee Senate Judiciary on Tuesday, but was instead moved to next week.
Key told The Daily Beast that he is worried a bill like HB 1274 will “make it more likely for schools to make these transphobic policies” if they can count on the state backing them against any legal challenges.
If school administrators know they the attorney general will defend from them lawsuits, the logic goes, they will be that much more willing to risk litigation by implementing trans-exclusionary policy.
The Human Rights Campaign shares that concern, labeling the bill on its website “an obvious attempt to encourage school districts that want to deny transgender students access to the correct bathrooms and locker rooms.”
Transgender students like Key are in an especially vulnerable position right now: In 2017, the Trump administration rescinded Obama-era guidance instructing schools to allow students to use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Reports quickly followed that the Department of Education had stopped handling restroom-related complaints from transgender students.
What that means is that in states like Tennessee —where there are no formal state-level legal protections for transgender people—school districts can adopt anti-transgender restroom policies without much fear of intervention from the Trump administration .
But because transgender students can still sue school districts— often successfully —for restroom protections under Title IX, a bill like HB 1274 is meant act as a shield against litigation. In essence, the Human Rights Campaign notes , the taxpayer ends up footing the bill to defend anti-transgender bathroom policies from transgender students.
Key wants state legislatures to realize that policies like the one at his school end up taking a toll on student well-being—and that the progress of a bill like HB 1274 only makes matters worse.
“I would like them to know that it’s not just affecting us as trans people, it’s affecting us as students in Tennessee,” he told The Daily Beast. “It’s affecting our school work when we have to take time out of class, it’s affecting our school work if we are being bullied. It’s affecting us—and it can even affect other [non-transgender] students—when there’s a negative climate like that at school.” “Tennessee is on the brink of becoming the next North Carolina—and the first state in the nation to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation this year.”
Ever since North Carolina passed its sweeping anti-transgender “bathroom bill” in 2016 , anti-LGBT legislation has become more specific, as The Daily Beast previously reported , zeroing in on areas like child welfare or religious-based service refusals. LGBT advocates have successfully fended off most of those bills, which only makes them more nervous about the possible passage of HB 1274.
“Tennessee is on the brink of becoming the next North Carolina—and the first state in the nation to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation this year,” Kasey Suffredini, president of strategy for Freedom for All Americans, told The Daily Beast, warning that the state would likely suffer the “economic consequences of passing laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people,” as North Carolina did three years ago.
Key says “it’s difficult” to live under a threat like HB 1274–and that it’s “definitely been impacting [him].” Even still, he wants the rest of the country to realize that Tennessee is not defined by the anti-LGBT legislation that some lawmakers propose every year.
“This is not a good representation of Tennessee,” he told The Daily Beast. “These bills make Tennessee into its stereotype, and not into what it truly is.”"

‘Hadestown’: The Broadway Musical That Takes Its Sweet-Sounding Time Going to Hell and Back,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hadestown-the-broadway-musical-that-takes-its-sweet-sounding-time-going-to-hell-and-back,"Love Story ‘Hadestown’: The Broadway Musical That Takes Its Sweet-Sounding Time Going to Hell and Back There is a lot of energetic, excellent music and dancing in the Broadway musical ‘Hadestown,’ even if the story and coupling of Orpheus and Eurydice feels wan and underpowered. 04.17.19 9:21 PM ET Matthew Murphy
Hadestown has so much fun telling, as it puts it, this “sad tale” that even though this retelling of a well-trodden Greek myth feels slight, it also makes for a joyful performance. Anaïs Mitchell’s musical, which opens on Broadway tonight at the Walter Kerr Theatre (to September 1 ), is delicious to look at and listen to—truly, my new earworm is “Way Down Hadestown”—even if its story is as wan as its central couple.
Much else, including Bradley King’s notably stunning lighting and an orchestral landscape that embraces folk, jazz, blues , and Americana, is glorious.
It is directed by Rachel Chavkin, the multi-award winning and nominated director of Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812 , which Hadestown shares certain artistic echoes with: the richness of the music, the presence of an excellent orchestra of musicians among the actors, the recasting of an intense, serious story into something extravagant and lush.
The manner and mode of the storytelling is more important than the story itself. In Hadestown that is immediately made clear by the wonderful André De Shields as Hermes, who invites us into this tale with a hearty cry of welcome, echoed to the performers and musicians.
De Shields, with his clear, commanding voice, is the perfect narrator: he knows how the story goes, but he also knows why we tell the story no matter how sadly it turns out. In a beautiful shiny blue suit, he saunters in a way any human wishes they could saunter, like a swaggering, languid cat. At 73, would we all look as dashing and limber as André De Shields.
That story he narrates is a version of the story of Orpheus (Reeve Carney) and Eurydice (Eva Noblezada). Hadestown is the factory presided over by Hades (Patrick Page), a world below connected to the world above ground by a train on which occasionally travels Hades’ wife Persephone (Amber Gray) to party and, no pun intended, hellraise.
Persephone is a bawdy lush, staring at us pie-eyed, and screeching and singing all at once in ‘Our Lady of The Underground,’ a good-time party person at a painful loss herself. Page’s Hades is a deep, bass-and-then-some-voiced baddie, who’s not so bad. Apparently he’s just forgotten how to love, and instead is enlisting the residents of Hadestown—made up of the extremely energetic “workers’ chorus”—to build a wall “to keep us free,” as the song goes. Despite the sharp resonance with President Trump’s desired barrier, this was written long before that particular campaign pledge.
Choreographed by David Neumann, Afra Hines, Timothy Hughes, John Krause, Kimberly Marable, and Ahmad Simmons may be the best company of singers and dancers on Broadway right now.
The company is gathered on a Rachel Hauck-designed set that looks like a distempered mansion with winding stairs, perches, and dugouts. But this one-set-fits-all comes to be confusing, with no differentiation between the world above ground and world below.
When it comes time for Orpheus and Eurydice’s epic, perilous journey, it doesn’t feel that perilous and epic, as they are required to walk around in circles on the same bit of stage we have been watching them sing and dance on for the last two hours. Commanding Orpheus not to turn around in such circumstances feels a little absurd; he's going to have to.
As for the ill-fated young lovers themselves, both Noblezada and Carney are charming performers, but their relationship never takes off enough to care about it. Dull and docile Eurydice and Orpheus are subsumed by the fuss and pizazz around them. They fade into the background in their own story.
They meet, he magically produces a red flower, and then all too suddenly Eurydice (at least in the plot of Hadestown ) is inexplicably making a deal with Hades to consign herself to the underworld.
Delight instead in Carney’s mournful falsetto, as his song of love and connection melts Hades’ hardened heart. Also delight in the Fates—Jewelle Blackman, Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer, and Kay Trinidad—whose perfectly sung harmonies are as sweet-sounding as their presence is menacing to the young couple.
The music and dancing has a lot of work to do because Hadestown ’s main story circles and recircles itself (complete with reprises of songs) like a plane waiting to land, until—with not much stage left to trek—Orpheus makes the worst decision at the worst moment.
The musical most ill-serves Eurydice: where has she come from, what does she want? How does the spunky, punky independent-seeming woman who arrives in town become quickly so battered down and victim-y?
As repetitive as the musical becomes, Chavkin’s busy, warm staging and its wonderful music and energy means Hadestown is like listening to an epic song around a roaring fire. As De Shields intimates at the end, when he describes why this particular myth is told and retold, Hadestown is about the art of storytelling—less a tragic love story than a rousing celebration and affirmation of a craft.

Bernie's Former Top Strategist Talks to de Blasio About 2020 Run,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernies-former-chief-strategist-tad-devine-talks-to-bill-de-blasio-about-2020-run,"Bernie's Former Top Strategist Talks to de Blasio About 2020 Run The New York City mayor hasn't decided yet. But he's talking to some intriguing folks. 04.17.19 9:35 PM ET Natan Dvir
Tad Devine, one of the primary strategists involved with Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 2016 presidential bid, met with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio about a possible 2020 bid last weekend.
Devine said he had not been planning to partake in the primary race after his firm parted ways with Sanders ’ 2020 operation shortly after the Senator announced his second bid. But de Blasio’s staff reached out about having a meeting and he obliged, meeting with the mayor and his wife Chirlane McCray at Gracie Mansion this past Saturday to discuss what a presidential run would take.
Devine, who did not attempt to keep his dinner secret, cautioned that the mayor was not on the cusp of making a decision. But he said that he was impressed by both de Blasio and his wife and would be “very happy” to talk to him about a potential role should he ultimately decide on a run. He said that he came away from the conversation believing that the Mayor had a story to tell.
“He got in touch because he’s thinking about running for president,” Devine told The Daily Beast on Wednesday afternoon. “I think he’s looking at it seriously and I think he’s a serious person.”
As more and more candidates jump into the 2020 primary, with former Vice President Joe Biden likely the largest name expected to enter in the coming week, de Blasio has continuously flirted with doing so himself. The New York City mayor has traveled to three early primary states , created the Fairness PAC, and has two aides reportedly working on a possible campaign.
So far, the early indicators have not been positive for a national bid for the 57-year-old mayor who is currently serving his second term. A Quinnipiac University poll from early April found that 76 percent of New York City respondents said that de Blasio should not run for president.
Yet he, like many others still joining a field that has ballooned to 19 candidates, hasn’t appeared to be deterred by signs that a potential candidacy would not go as planned.
“Time and time again, people will tell you what you can’t do,” de Blasio recently said at the National Action Network convention in New York. “But don’t let anyone tell you what you can’t do. Don’t let anyone talk you out of your own power.”
Should he choose to run, and should he bring Devine on board to help, it would be interpreted as a minor shot across the bow at Sanders; not just because de Blasio occupies a similar ideological lane but because Devine knows the Senator better than almost any other consultant. He worked on Sanders’ past Senatorial campaigns and helped craft much of the advertising for the 2016 presidential bid.
A spokesperson for de Blasio did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the nature of the conversation or any other preparatory work that they had done for a possible run. But as he meets with potential advisers, de Blasio also is facing bad headlines at home, including a Wednesday report detailing alleged violations of conflict of interest rules pertaining to a previous non-profit he formed.

Lou Dobbs Wonders Who Ilhan Omar Represents ‘Because It Isn’t America’,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/foxs-lou-dobbs-wonders-who-ilhan-omar-represents-because-it-isnt-america,"LOYALTY TEST Lou Dobbs Wonders Who Ilhan Omar Represents ‘Because It Isn’t America’ His comment comes on the heels of Brian Kilmeade and Jeanine Pirro questioning Omar’s patriotism. 04.17.19 10:18 PM ET Chip Somodevilla/Getty
Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs continued right-wing media’s weeklong outrage cycle over Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar’s comment about 9/11 by accusing her on Wednesday night of not representing America.
For days now, Fox opinion hosts and Republican politicians have taken aim at the Muslim-American lawmaker for remarks she made last month , claiming she minimized the 9/11 terror attacks when she said Muslim-Americans were treated as second-class citizens because “some people did something.” This resulted in President Trump tweeting out an inflammatory video targeting the freshman congresswoman—a video Omar says sparked new death threats against her.
Speaking to Republican strategist Amy Tarkanian on Lou Dobbs Tonight, Dobbs blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not stripping Omar of her committee assignments over her remarks.
“She won’t remove Congresswoman Omar from the foreign relations committee because why?” Dobbs wondered. “Because she thinks so little of America?!”
The Trump-loving host—who occasionally gets patched into Oval Office meetings —went on to question the Minnesota lawmaker’s loyalty to the United States.
“Who is she representing?!” Dobbs exclaimed. “Because it isn’t America with her thoughts and her regrettable remarks about September 11th and 3,000 victims who lost their lives that day.”
Dobbs’ accusation that Omar doesn’t represent America comes on the heels of Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade saying last week that “you have to wonder if she is an American first,” remarks he somewhat walked back later. And last month, during another Omar-related controversy, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro found herself suspended for two weeks and “strongly” condemned by the network for suggesting on air that Omar didn’t believe in the Constitution because she wears a hijab.

"Man In Custody After Bringing Gas, Lighters into St. Patrick’s Cathedral in NYC",www.thedailybeast.com,chelsia.marcius@thedailybeast.com (Chelsia Rose Marcius) Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/st-patricks-cathedral-arrest-marc-lamparello-in-custody-after-bringing-gas-lighters-into-nyc-church,"04.18.19 12:27 AM ET Mike Segar/Reuters
A New Jersey man was taken into custody on Wednesday night after he tried to enter St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City carrying cans of gasoline, lighter fluid and butane lighters, police said.
Police said they do not know the man’s “mindset” but noted that the excuse he gave for having the gas was bogus, and that the incident happened just two days after the devastating inferno at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
“It’s hard to say what his intentions were, but I think the totality of circumstances—of an individual walking into an iconic location like St. Patrick’s Cathedral, carrying over two gallons of gasoline, two bottles of lighter fluid, and lighters—is something that we would have great concern over,” NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller told reporters.
Because the man was not immediately charged, police did not release his name. However, a family member identified him as Marc Lamparello, 37, of Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.
His brother, Adam Lamparello, told The Daily Beast he was stunned by news of the arrest.
“Oh my god. I’m shocked this could even be true. I’m almost speechless,” he said. “This is something that is so not him. I don’t know what to even say.”
Police said the incident unfolded just before 8 p.m. while visitors were inside the Neo-Gothic Manhattan cathedral, the seat of Catholic power in New York City.
Lamparello drove to the area in a minivan, unloaded the flammables and lighters, and headed up the church steps.
“As he enters the cathedral, he’s confronted by a cathedral security officer who asked him where he’s going and informs him he can’t proceed into the cathedral carrying these things,” Miller said. “At that point, some gasoline is apparently spilled out onto the floor as he’s turned around.”
As Lamparello left, the cathedral employee alerted two officers stationed outside, who followed him down the street and began to question him.
“His answers were inconsistent and evasive,” Miller said.
Lamparello claimed he was cutting through the church with a pair of two-gallon cans because his car was out of gas, but police inspected the vehicle and determined that was not the case, Miller said.
He was then taken to a police station for questioning. Miller said the suspect “is known to police” but did not provide further details.
“We don’t know what his mindset was, what his motive was,” Miller added.
He said that while there are always police stationed outside the historic cathedral, security has been increased since the apparently accidental blaze at Notre Dame. READ THIS LIST"

Sudan’s longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir has been removed in what military leaders are calling a coup after more than three decades leading a brutal regime that faced allegations of genocide in Darfur. Sudan's Minister of Defense, Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf, said on national television that al-Bashir would be replaced by “a transitional military council.” Protests that have gone on for months have often become bloody, with al-Bashir’s forces opening fire on groups gathered to call for his removal. At least five protesters have been killed. The ousted president is now being held on house arrest, according to local media reports. The fall of the Sudanese president is the second such removal of a dictatorial leader after the fall of Algeria’s president last week. “The overthrow of two entrenched dictators in less than two weeks reminds us again of the fragility of authoritarian government in the region and the widespread demand for an end to corrupt and stagnant rulers who fail to respect the rights and aspirations of their peoples,” Middle East Policy expert Timothy Kaldas told The Independent . Shortly after his arrest, AFP reported that all political prisoners held by al-Bashir had been immediately released. Sudanese President Ousted After Months of Protests Cheat Sheet ®"
But Where are the Lederhosen?

Mike Cernovich Models Male Fashion Giving us Pizzagate was not enough. Mike Cernovich now wants to be a fashion critic, warning against cargo shorts and telling The Daily Beast, ‘My job is to help people look nice.’ 04.18.19 2:34 AM ET Photo illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos via Mike Cernovich
No one asked for fashion advice from Mike Cernovich, the prominent far-right internet troll. But then again, no one asked for Cernovich to push Pizzagate , write that “date rape does not exist,” or spread misinformation about Hillary Clinton’s health.
So here we are. The 41-year-old former lawyer and YouTube personality posted a sartorial manifesto on Tuesday in the form of a 25-tweet-long thread.
“I will start posting outfits for men to wear,” Cernovich began. Those with any self-preservation skills would have clicked away from the tweet so fast they risked bruising a finger; the rest of us scrolled on to see photos from ghosts of “Cernos” past.
“I will post some lewks of Cerno throughout the years,” he wrote. “Each served a purpose at a specific time. Remember a Women notice [sic] shoes immediately.”
Cerno attached a picture of himself at what appeared to be a party, holding a drink and wearing aviators, a bland gray cardigan, and dark wash jeans.
The chick magnet shoes he was referring to were a standard-issue pair of black boots. The look was completely devoid of any personality that would presumably draw women in. (First, said ladies would have to get over Cernovich’s years-long history of sexism and rape denial.)
The newly minted critic went on to tweet, “With fashion you must ask—what reaction do I want?” A pink floral-printed shirt, chinos, and brown mules “softens my image and makes me more approachable,” quoth the man who once wrote , “Misogyny Gets You Laid.” “The biggest fashion mistake straight men make is being afraid of colors. They blend in rather than stand out. I always stand out”
The modern day Carrie Bradshaw nobody asked for but we might all deserve repeated many times in his column that heterosexual men should dress boldly. “The biggest fashion mistake straight men make is being afraid of colors,” Cernovich wrote. “They blend in rather than stand out. I always stand out.”
One shot showed Cernovich kicking back at an outdoor restaurant, with a mug of beer and a plaid button-up Donald Trump, Jr . might gravitate toward.
“Most men are invisible dressing like they are in Maoist China,” Cernovich mused. The solution? “Always wear patterns / colors.”
The provocateur seems to fancy himself a poor man’s Roger Stone , toting the Dirty Trickster’s more-is-more fashion philosophy through mid-priced brands. (Stone dresses in suits from Savile Row; Cernovich looks like he’s headed to an Olive Garden birthday party.)
Cernovich rallies against “cargo dorks” and men who wear flip flops. Despite his penchant for tight, fitted jeans, “shorts are allowed,” as long as they are pastel-colored and hit just above the knee.
Cernovich told The Daily Beast that he decided to play fashion blogger when he tweeted “Show me a man in cargo shorts and flip flops, and I’ll show you a man who isn’t serious about life” earlier this month.
“It was just a joke, G-rated, but I got nasty, nasty emails from people,” he said. “So OK, fuck all these people, I’ll do a fashion thread because a fashion thread from me would be something that everyone would love to hate.”
But it wasn’t completely a joke. “A lot of people would get some good tips from it, too,” he said. “I’m never being fully serious [on Twitter], but do I think I actually look good in those pictures? Yeah, as a matter of fact I do. That kind of self-confidence triggers people.”
Both fashion and news sites have lampooned Cernovich’s thread. Esquire ’s Jonathan Evans wrote , “Conspiracy Ghoul Mike Cernovich Doled Out Some Hilariously Bad Fashion Advice on Twitter,” and Splinter ’s Sophie Weiner called his suggestions “deeply cursed.” “When I look at how a lot of the people who dunked on me dress—they were very slovenly, and if I clicked on their accounts, their outfits are very boring. Very, very conventional”
Though Cernovich has faithfully retweeted or posted these stories on his Instagram stories, he told The Daily Beast he is not offended by the reaction.
“When I look at how a lot of the people who dunked on me dress—they were very slovenly, and if I clicked on their accounts, their outfits are very boring. Very, very conventional,” he said.
Growing up, Cernovich would turn to Esquire and GQ for fashion advice. Esquire lambasted him on Tuesday. “My response to them would be that they work for advertisers and their job is to sell people on as many accessories as possible, rather than keeping focus on what looks good,” he said. “Their job is to say, you need 15 different accessories, or these $499 shoes. My job is to help people look nice.”
Cernovich counts Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling as “fashion icons,” along with “gay men at Coachella .”
Aaron Schock, a disgraced GOP representative from Illinois spotted partying with gay men at Coachella—and making out with one man—despite his anti-gay voting record, looks “very nice” in his festival garb, according to Cernovich. “Gay men are more risk-taking, and that’s what good fashion is about.”
J.Crew shoppers in the greater Los Angeles area, be warned: you might see Cernovich perusing your local outlets’ racks soon. He told The Daily Beast that the chain is his go-to, along with Nordstorm’s semi-annual sale and the Dutch fashion line Scotch & Soda. “The last time I went shopping my credit card was declined for fraud because I haven’t made a clothing purchase in about a year”
He used to shop at French Connection, but his wife Shauna Gee found the UK-based retailer too “over-the-top,” or, as Cernovich put it, “Euro-trashy.”
Despite his self-proclaimed sartorial prowess, the father of two told The Daily Beast that he is not a frequent shopper. “I don’t ever clothes shop now because I have two daughters,” Cernovich explained. “The last time I went shopping my credit card was declined for fraud because I haven’t made a clothing purchase in about a year. ”
Jonathan Evans, fashion director and author of the Esquire piece, told The Daily Beast over email that he sees Cernovich’s “lewks” as living somewhere in between the lands of “Standard Bro” and “Middle-Aged Guy Trying to Look Younger.”
“Some of his outfits are merely meh, but he has a tendency to go with suited looks that I’d generally classify as try-hard,” Evans wrote.
While Evans does not think there is anything wrong with the idea of tweeting out clothing advice, he does see Cernovich’s recommendations as overly prescriptive. “People make fun of me to signal their ‘in group’ status. ‘Look at us, we’re the cool fashion people, look at this scrub he’s definitely not.’ It’s all high school”
In his words, “Doling out these kinds of fashion mandates is outdated, and making it all about rules is downright boring.”
Cernovich will not be bothered by Evans or any other detractor. “People make fun of me to signal their ‘in group’ status,” he said. “‘Look at us, we’re the cool fashion people, look at this scrub he’s definitely not.’ It’s all high school.”
Through it all, there is something that Cernovich has in common with the “cool fashion people.”
When asked for his opinion on cargo shorts, Evans cautioned: “Use at your own discretion. And maybe risk.”
Cernovich’s take? “Cargo shorts are worn by a lot of different people. Some people fish, and it’s utility. But it became sort of Guido hip a few years ago to wear cargo shorts and white shoes, and those people really do think it looks cool. It doesn’t. Shorts look better above the knee—everybody agrees with that.” READ THIS LIST"
Colbert Unloads on Trump’s Immigration ‘Monster’ Stephen Miller,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/stephen-colbert-unloads-on-trumps-immigration-monster-stephen-miller,"'Late Show' host Stephen Colbert unloads on Trump's immigration ""monster"" Stephen Miller. CBS
Like the rest of the country, Stephen Colbert is eagerly awaiting the imminent release of the Mueller report , joking in his monologue Wednesday that he is “counting his chickens” before they hatch and “placing in one basket” for safe keeping.
But until then, the Late Show host turned his attention to one member of the Trump administration who has grown even more powerful in recent weeks : “White House senior adviser and suspicious mole on the neck of America, Stephen Miller.”
After playing the clip in which the Trump aide disputed the message of inclusiveness on the Statue of Liberty , Colbert added, as Miller, “Also, and I don’t want to get into a whole thing, but Frankenstein is the name of the doctor. I am the monster.”
“Miller has reportedly been on an anti-immigrant rampage,” the host continued. “After forcing out Homeland Security Chief Kirstjen Nielsen, he’s been pushing an extreme agenda, including overturning court-ordered protections for migrant children and calling people at ICE and telling them to release detained immigrants in Nancy Pelosi’s district.”
And in response to Miller reportedly telling immigration officials that they should be so focused on their job that “sometimes you shouldn’t go to bed,” Colbert replied, “He has a point. I, for one, don’t know how anyone who works for Trump can sleep at night.”
With that, Colbert welcomed Stephen Miller (comedian Peter Grosz, who previously played Mike Pence on The President Show ) to make his case to viewers.
Asked if it’s true that he instructed officials not to sleep until they ended protections for migrant children, Colbert’s Miller answered, “Yes, that is correct, they should not be sleeping. I know I don’t. I lie awake in bed at night, worrying that we have made the world a safe place for children.”"
What It’s Like to Be Targeted by an (Alleged) Private Spy,www.thedailybeast.com,Keir Giles,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-its-like-to-be-targeted-by-an-alleged-private-spy,"TALK TO ME What It’s Like to Be Targeted by an (Alleged) Private Spy AP reported Wednesday that an undercover agent apparently working for Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab had targeted researcher Keir Giles. This is his side of the story. opinion Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos from Getty
I bear no grudge against Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based cybersecurity company. I’ve only met Eugene Kaspersky, the firm’s founder, once, briefly, at a cybersecurity conference years ago. He was thoroughly charming. And friends in the business tell me that Kaspersky Lab ’s technical expertise is top-notch.
However, it is true that I wouldn’t want to see their software installed on any system that contains information that shouldn’t be shared with the Russian government. And it’s that view that apparently brought me to the attention of shadowy figures working undercover, with a specific interest in discrediting people who say it publicly. That’s what led to bizarre encounters in a smart London hotel with a mysterious individual pretending, not very well, to be a Far Eastern investment consultant wanting to talk about Russia. Meeting “Lucas Lambert”
It all started at the end of April 2018, with an email out of the blue to my address at Chatham House, the London-based think tank, asking me if I would be willing to speak at a conference. That’s not so unusual—I do get invitations like that, including from organizations I’ve never heard of before. In this case, it was supposed to be an investment consultancy with offices in Tokyo and Hong Kong, and the “senior partner” who contacted me asked to meet up in London to discuss it further.
That meeting was odd, but not so odd that I was sure it was a set-up. Mr. Lambert, my senior partner, said he was from Belgium but didn't have a French or Flemish accent—instead, he sounded central European. He said he lived in Hong Kong, so since I know it well I asked him where; his answer didn’t sound like anything people who really live there usually say. And when I had looked up his company before the meeting, the website seemed generic, vague and anonymous. But all of this was within the bounds of possibility for being genuine. “What seemed definitely off key was the topic of the conversation. Lambert kept steering the conversation back to Kaspersky Lab.”
Instead, what seemed definitely off-key was the topic of the conversation. From the general chat about the presentation on Russia and cybersecurity that he was asking me to give, Lambert kept steering the conversation back to Kaspersky Lab, and why the previous year I and other people commenting in the media had been urging caution on using their products. Who were we doing this for, he asked?
The answer I gave him, consistently and repeatedly, was that nobody had told or paid me to advise against Kaspersky. Instead, it seemed to me completely logical that you shouldn’t have Kaspersky antivirus software on a computer that contains anything you would rather the Russian government didn’t see. It’s pretty straightforward really: antivirus software scans the contents of your computer to check for malicious content, and reports back on what it finds to a central server. So far so normal, only in the case of Kaspersky, at the time I was talking to the media about it those servers were in Moscow.
So, I said, even if Kaspersky Lab is being completely open and truthful about being innocent of any collusion with the Russian government for espionage purposes, simple prudence would dictate that if you want to keep something confidential from Russia—like, for example, the contents of any computer belonging to a Western government—you shouldn't put Kaspersky anti-virus software on it. It’s easy enough to think of the reverse situation—no Russian government computer would be installing American antivirus software, because of exactly the same concerns. “Speak up, please”
But Lambert wasn’t satisfied. He asked again and again whether there had been any ulterior motives behind negative media commentary on Kaspersky. He wanted to know if I, or anybody else who had been quoted in the media, had been induced to do so by Kaspersky’s competitors in order to drive down their market share and cost them business. And throughout the conversation, he reminded me that I should speak up and speak clearly and from time to time asked me to repeat myself because, he said, he was hard of hearing.
So by the end of that meeting I was willing to continue the conversation, but warily. Lambert set a provisional date for me to travel out to Hong Kong to deliver the keynote talk and stay on for a day of consultations. He offered flights, accommodation and a fee of US$10,000 for doing so. The fees that people like me earn for sharing our knowledge and expertise vary hugely from job to job: in this case, the offer was well towards the generous end, but not so crazily as to be suspicious. Lambert also asked me to put him in touch with friends and colleagues in the same situation, who could contribute to his conference. He wanted an introduction to Michael Daniel, a former U.S. government official now with the Cyber Threat Alliance, which I couldn’t give. Instead, I contacted a cyberexpert friend working at a U.S. think tank, and explained the offer.
My job involves dealing with Russia, and as a result I may be a little more suspicious about unsolicited approaches than the average person. I’ve had some pretty sophisticated attempts at hacking my email accounts and computers in the past—and of course, you only know about the ones that fail, and can never be sure that something else has not succeeded.
Earlier this year I published a book about Russia , which was immediately used as bait in a cyberattack against Chatham House colleagues. They received emails from a spoofed address made to look like mine, with a note from somebody claiming to be my (non-existent) personal assistant, and a link which claimed to be to sample chapters from the book. But what gave the game away for most of them was the follow-up phone call to their personal numbers from somebody with a thick Russian accent still claiming to be my assistant and urging them to click on the link.
So when I contacted my cyberexpert friend, I also warned him that I was suspicious about Lambert’s company. My friend laughed, and joked about us arriving in Hong Kong and being kidnapped and paraded on Chinese television making a confession. As it turned out, that wasn’t what we needed to worry about. Round Two
Lambert later asked me for another meeting in the same hotel, and I agreed. And it was at that meeting that I became convinced I was being set up. Not only did the conversation keep coming back to Kaspersky, but Lambert told me that at our previous meeting I had actually said that I and others had urged against using Kaspersky software because we were being induced to do so by Kaspersky’s competitors. That just wasn’t true, and I said so straight away. The conversation continued, with Lambert reminding me again and again to speak directly toward him, speak up, and repeat myself. All of that left me fairly confident by the end of the conversation that the aim was to record me saying something incriminating that would discredit me or colleagues. And finally, Lambert asked for yet another meeting—only this time I must have the lunch he kept offering me, and “talk about something other than work.”
By now the faint alarm bells I thought I heard earlier were ringing loud and clear. So it was at this point that I decided to drop any further contact with Lambert, and forget about the prospect of a $10,000 fee and business-class flights to Hong Kong. He carried on writing to me, about once a month, before giving up in the middle of October after a final message about the supposed conference being postponed. Meanwhile, my U.S. colleague had also met Lambert, and come away with a similar offer—as well as similar questioning about Kaspersky.
I still had my doubts about whether Lambert and his company might in fact be genuine, but just odd. And those doubts persisted right up to the point when journalist Raphael Satter, working with Associated Press, told me what he had found during his investigations into a group of high end private investigators that had targeted Citizen Lab , a Canadian organization working on information technology and human rights. Those investigators have since been linked to the Israeli intelligence company Black Cube in a Canadian court case. And now, Raphael told me, somebody was using exactly the same techniques against people who had been seen to be critical of Kaspersky Lab. As I told him about my own experience, it seemed gradually to tick all the boxes. And the result was Wednesday’s news story describing me as the “Kaspersky opponent” who was targeted by undercover operatives in a sophisticated sting operation trying to discredit Kaspersky’s critics.
There is no direct evidence that Kaspersky ordered incriminating evidence to be collected in this way—when asked by AP, however, they didn’t deny it. And there is no direct evidence that they hired Black Cube as intermediaries to do so, or that “Lucas Lambert” works for Black Cube. However, AP and their sources at Citizen Lab noted that almost exactly the same techniques had been used in Black Cube operations, right down to the same surname for the front man.
But whatever the truth, for me it’s been a fascinating and slightly bizarre glimpse into a parallel world where nobody is quite who they claim to be—and firmly convinced me that it’s a world I want nothing to do with. At this point I am just hoping that the story is over. But I’ve had the warnings that whoever was behind this operation could still be willing to attack or smear me, with a cyberattack, or manipulated video, or fake news, in revenge for it being exposed.
In fact, the silliest part of the whole affair is that whoever commissioned Mr. Lambert to grill me could just have asked me what they wanted to know. There was no need for the secrecy, the deviousness or the pantomime. I would have just told them anyway. READ THIS LIST"

Fox News host Laura Ingraham was clearly appalled that Chrissy Teigen was named one of Time magazine’s top 100 influential people. “Speaking of glamour, model and wife of John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, was also chosen as one of the 100 most influential,” Ingraham said on her program, making air quotes when she said the word “influential.” The Fox host went on to describe Teigen as “also known for her vicious attacks on President Trump.”
But Ingraham, who was not on Time ’s list, seemed most infuriated that Teigen’s write-up included a reference to food and the word “fuck.”
“She was chosen, according to the profile, because quote, all her life Chrissy Teigen has liked to eat. She’s not shy about that or anything else really.”
Ingraham then added, “Well that’s nice, and innovative, I guess ... eating.”
“But did most Americans like her take on female empowerment during last week’s Democratic Retreat?” Ingraham asked before showing a clip from a recent interview in which Teigen said that the one thing women should say more is “Fuck you.”
Ingraham then looked shocked and responded, “Well. Ok then.”
The clip made Twitter rounds and Teigen herself responded by tweeting, “Corny monster. There were 1 million other ways to try and take me down and this is what you choose? Fuck you.”
She later added, “When time comes out with their 100 most influential white supremacists list, I promise I won’t question your worthiness, @IngrahamAngle.”
And Teigen capped things off by sharing a GIF of Ingraham addressing the crowd at the 2016 Republican National Convention with what many found to be eerily similar to a Nazi Sieg Heil salute.
Back in September of last year, Ingraham’s brother Curtis told The Daily Beast that he thinks his sister is “a monster”; claimed that she used to mock her black roommate at Dartmouth by “speaking jive”; and insinuated that she was a “Nazi sympathizer” like their father.
Teigen, meanwhile, donated $20,000 on Wednesday to a crowdfunding campaign to rebuild three black churches in Louisiana that were burnt down. The campaign was spread on Twitter by journalist Yashar Ali, and her donation helped the fundraiser hit its $1.8 million target. READ THIS LIST"
The Rebirth of One Puerto Rican Bar After Hurricane Maria,www.thedailybeast.com,Wayne Curtis,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-puerto-rican-bar-la-penultima-reinvented-itself-after-hurricane-maria,"After the Storm The Rebirth of One Puerto Rican Bar After Hurricane Maria The inspiring story of how San Juan bar La Penultima reinvented itself after Hurricane Maria, and helped its community to come back from the storm. 04.18.19 5:26 AM ET Courtesy Madeline Northway
The evening after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico in September 2017, Stephen Hoppe drove to La Penultima, the bar he and his brother, Christopher, had opened 11 months earlier. It was normally a short hop from Old San Juan to the Santurce neighborhood a few miles east, but it took a while longer that night. Like in a real-life video game, he had to double back every so often to avoid downed power lines and toppled trees, and looters he saw emptying a furniture store.
When he arrived, he was relieved—the place had survived mostly intact, save for a toppled passion fruit tree in their courtyard. The tall buildings surrounding the bar apparently funneled the Category 4 winds such that their building escaped the brunt of the damage.
They’d purchased a small, 8,000-watt generator earlier to use during construction. One of the first things Stephen did was to pull it out and power it up to keep refrigerators going and put on some lights, switching out plugs every so often so as to not overtax the power source. “We had to be strategic about what we were running,” Stephen said.
At one point he plugged in their internet router. Why not? And this stunned him: it actually worked—he was connected to the outside world. He would later learn that he was one of just three establishments in San Juan that had working internet.
And that thin line to the outside world, the Hoppe brothers discovered, changed everything. “It’s what really launched us,” Stephen said.
Christopher didn’t plan to open a bar when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2008 — he came to the island with the idea of being a teacher. But he liked the island’s DIY culture, that anyone with an idea and a modicum of wherewithal could create a business. “It doesn’t take much more than hard work to make something happen here,” he said.
When he opened his first spot, a craft beer bar called La Taberna Lupulo, in Old San Juan, he did so without refrigerators to start—he just had some coolers he filled with ice every day. He then opened a well-regarded Thai restaurant called Mai Pen Rai in Santurce. And then he convinced his brother—a furniture maker and part-time bartender in Chicago—to move down and help him launch La Penultima.
They leased a squat, semi-squalid building with a small courtyard that had housed five different business over seven years, including a bakery. “It was a dump,” said Stephen. They gutted it and built out most everything themselves. And when they opened, they quickly became known as a bartender’s bar. “We did a lot of carbonated cocktails, clarified cocktails, and some with liquid nitrogen,” he said.
While they usually opened early each evening, it didn’t get hopping until after midnight, when other bars closed up and industry folks made their way over. It did not have the vibe of a neighborhood bar. “It was novel. People were skeptical of us in the neighborhood—a couple gringos opening a bar,” said Stephen. Their nearest neighbors were a senior citizen complex across the street. “They gave us a lot of side-eye.”
And then came Hurricane Irma, which grazed Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, two weeks before Maria. Although the eye of Irma passed 60 miles north, it lashed the island with 30-foot waves and 110-mph winds. Still, the damage was manageable: the water still ran, and the cell towers still worked. “It seemed the mood in all of San Juan after Irma was pure elation,” said Christopher. “We really felt like we dodged a bullet—it was one of the happiest days of our lives.”
Irma knocked power out for a couple of weeks, so the brothers decided to shut the bar for a time and not rush the repairs and re-opening. “We weren’t that busy anyway, so we thought, why not take a week off?” said Stephen.
The day the power came back on, Christopher happened to board a plane along with some of his employees to attend the wedding of one of his chefs, back north in Minneapolis. It was the Friday before Hurricane Maria blew up seemingly out of nowhere. “On Sunday, that’s when we knew it wasn’t looking good,” said Stephen. Christopher tried to hustle back down from Minnesota immediately after the wedding, renting a car and driving to Chicago to try to catch one of the last flights to the island. It didn’t work out. He was marooned north.
Stephen had stayed behind to re-open the bar after the power returned, but quickly switched gears to preparing for the next hit. He boarded up windows and bolted down everything he could. “And then I just crossed my fingers,” he said.
In a backhanded way, Hurricane Irma had proved a blessing. The interval without power had served as a rehearsal, giving the Hoppes practice in running the place off a small generator. When Stephen got back in to the bar after Maria, he knew what to do. “In the two weeks in between we really figured out a system to get this place powered up on that little generator,” he said. (He was aided by his girlfriend, who had come to visit from New York for a long weekend and found herself unable to get off the island for two weeks. “It was very much a bonding experience,” he said. “We were very casual, and then it went to the next level.”)
Having power, even if scant and intermittent, was a huge boon. They could keep the refrigerators reasonably chilled, and had light when they needed it. They set up grills for cooking in the courtyard, and chefs without generators came by with perishables. “The said, hey, we’ve got all this food, can we come cook it?” said Stephen. One chef came by, cooked up a mess of pork, and then walked the streets handing out sandwiches.
Even ice made with contaminated water proved useful—the senior center across the street could use it for keeping their insulin and other medicines chilled. A sense of purpose pulled the staff all together. “We were just a bunch of rowdy degenerates, but we all took turns to wake up at 4:30 a.m. or 5 a.m. to wait in the lines to get fuel for the generator, and get us through the day,” said Stephen. “What blew me away was the way people come together—the way that people came here to share their food and any resources they had.”
“This was way more than a bar,” said Christopher. “We had a friend who was a barber do a pop-up—he cut people’s hair in the courtyard.” And all this when they couldn’t even sell liquor—for 11 days after the storm, alcohol sales were banned. No one could even buy a legal beer after a sweaty day of clearing debris.
But the most important factor may have been the internet. Thanks to a new fiber optic line they’d had installed, and the fact that the internet provider was just across the street, they could offer a digital bridge to an outside world, where so many locals had relatives fretting on the mainland United States. People from the neighborhood came in with tablets and laptops, and charged their phones on power strips Stephen set up.
Christopher, meantime, had been trying everything he could to get back to the island. He made it to Miami and tried flights from there. He got on one flight three days after the storm and made it halfway to the island, but the flight had to turn back because they lost contact with the island’s control tower. Four other flights he’d booked after that were canceled.
When he finally got on a flight with six huge duffel bags of supplies, 12 days after the storm, he was almost alone on board. Planes were headed south mostly to get people off the island.
The day after Christopher got back to Puerto Rico, the island lifted the “dry law” and beer and liquor started flowing again. The bar was open for business again, as a bar.
But this time, less as a hip, bartender’s bar—although the drinks continue to be innovative and well-crafted. “The cocktail program got less nerdy,” said Christopher. “And we went from being an industry bar to being a real community bar.”
Instead of opening at 6 p.m. each evening, they now open at 11 a.m.. People in the neighborhood stop by for coffee or a drink. “Our clientele now represents the neighborhood,” said Stephen.
Even the seniors, the same folks who once gave them side-eye, have become regulars. “Some of the old ladies who live across the street, they get dressed up and come here for birthdays,” said Christopher. “They order Shaffer Beer on ice with a straw.” Penicillins and Paper Planes are also popular among older Puerto Ricans, they added.
“Maria was a hard thing to get through,” said Christopher. “But we prospered, we thrived through it. If we can do that, there’s so much more opportunity. There’s so much more room for growth in this industry in Puerto Rico right now.
“After the storm,” he added, “I was like, damn, I feel so proud to be here.” READ THIS LIST"
Fear The Mountain: Game of Thrones’ Imposing Monster Speaks,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hafpor-julius-bjornsson-game-of-thrones-imposing-monster-the-mountain-speaks,"Fear The Mountain: Game of Thrones’ Imposing Monster Speaks Macall B Pollay/HBO Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson—the half-dead, feared knight Ser Gregor Clegane on ‘Game of Thrones’ and the reigning World’s Strongest Man—is surprisingly soft-spoken. Joseph Longo 04.18.19 5:24 AM ET
S er Gregor of House Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, the Knight of Clegane’s Keep, Protector of Cersei Lannister , brother of The Hound, the head-exploder , the Zombie of Westeros, the Executor badly in need of eye cream.
And now: brand ambassador for Reign Total Body Fuel .
Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, who often goes by the moniker Thor, is best known for playing the feared yet revered knight The Mountain on Game of Thrones , currently airing its final season . But this week he’s waging a different war. Standing in New York City’s Greeley Square, Björnsson wears a black tank top and matching pants while clenching a plastic shield with a silver helmet insignia. Sitting beside him on a makeshift throne built of energy drink cans is not his loyal queen Cersei of House Lannister bur rather former WWE Total Diva Natalie Eva Marie, now of House Reign.
The duo is flanked by an army of buff models and workout instructors probably on their lunch breaks from Barry’s Bootcamp or SoulCycle. They’re ready for battle—and today that’s convincing you to purchase Reign Total Body Fuel.
The new workout energy drink by Monster promises increased concentration, electrolytes and reduced fatigue. It makes sense Björnsson would partner with a product with “Total Body Fuel” right there in the name. He quite literally epitomizes the totality of the human form.
The Icelandic native is the reigning World’s Strongest Man ( He can do a 10-rep, 770-pound axle deadlift ). He weighs 450 pounds and is 6-foot-9. He’s a hulking presence, making him ripe for fan photos and more than a little intimidating to interview.
Björnsson, who grew up outside Reykjavik, hasn’t always been so big. His first successes came on the basketball court, where his height and slender frame made him a towering yet agile presence. That is until two severe broken ankles in two years ended his career. It would’ve been impressive enough: small-town boy leaves family farm for an illustrious yet short-lived Division I basketball career.
But soon after, he met former four-time World’s Strongest Man Magnús Ver Magnússon, bulked up, and found a new calling on the Icelandic bodybuilding circuit. Björnsson entered his first World’s Strongest Man competition in 2011 and finished 6th. It’s the lowest he’s ever placed.
“I haven’t lost a competition since 2017 actually,” Björnsson says, surprisingly soft-spoken for his stature. “I won everything last year and everything this year. It’s going well for me.”
To his word, Björnsson is the current reigning World’s Strongest Man, beating out longtime rival Brian Shaw of America two years ago and holding the title ever since. They’ll face off again in a month for the 2019 title in Bradenton, Florida. Björnsson, who as Ser Gregor Clegane has killed Faith Militants, stabbed his hefty sword straight through King’s Landing commoners, and caused others to faint by simply leaning forward, isn’t worried about his odds. “I’m going to the 2019 competition to defend the title,” he said.
But right now, he’s focused on press tours. In addition to Reign Total Body Fuel, Björnsson is knee-deep in Game of Thrones promotion. He and his 5-foot-2 wife Kelsey Henson walked the Season 8 New York premiere red carpet in early April. He wore a teal, fitted blazer and black bow tie and gave The Rock a run for his money as Hollywood’s best-dressed bodybuilder.
Expectedly, he’s tight-lipped about the final season. HBO is the only entity that could take him down, so he’s following strict no-spoiler orders. Though he’s happy to talk about the iconic battle against Oberyn Martell , played by hot actor Pedro Pascal. Like most of his fans, it’s also his favorite kill scene. “It was my first season. Everything about it—the training that went into it, the location, the people I shot with, the directors—I just loved shooting that scene,” he says.
Since the ill-fated battle where he dies after being sliced by a sword doused in venom, The Mountain has become an ominous presence in Westeros. Hand of the Queen Qyburn resurrects him from death, but the man behind the full-body armor remains a mystery—save for a single Season 6 scene revealing his mangled, discolored face while torturing Cersei’s prisoner the Unella, otherwise known as the “shame, shame” bell lady.
How did Qyburn resurrect The Mountain? Is he Westeros’ first zombie? Why are his eyes bloodshot but his skin blue? Björnsson will not be providing answers today. “I’m something ,” he says, refusing to give an inch. “I’m coming from death. Not much more I can really say on that.”
He’s also equally coy when speaking about real-life controversy. This week, his admission to having previously used steroids, stated during a 2017 ESPN E:60 special , resurfaced online. “Yes, I have,” he said in the documentary. “When you want to be the best, you do whatever it takes.” When the reporter pressed him, he remarked, “Can we just skip those questions?”
Now two years later, he’s won’t clarify his statement or declaratively state that his steroid use is fully in the past. Maybe that’s by design. Björnsson is just doing as he always has: His body speaks for itself.
“I’ve been competing at the World’s Strongest Man competition for the past eight years,” he told The Daily Beast. “I never failed a drug test, so that really answers your question.”"
The Anti-Vax Movement Is Now Infecting the Pet World,www.thedailybeast.com,Jen Reeder,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-anti-vax-movement-is-now-infecting-cats-and-dogs,"Getty
Grazyna Medynski believes rabies vaccines are dangerous.
She cites her three pets as examples: Her cat Doeno has a twitch, her dog Max had a painful eruption, and her other dog Min is now afraid to go up and down stairs.
“He’s just created all these kinds of fears,” Medynski said of Min’s inability to use the stairs. “Is it the rabies? I don’t know. But is that what rabies can do? Yeah, it can.”
Medynski is one of a growing number of anti-vaxxers whose beliefs are influencing their pets. The debunked claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism in children is influencing pet owners, too—even though autism spectrum disorder doesn’t occur in dogs and cats.
“In my lectures around the country and outside of the country, we’re getting a lot of feedback from practitioners that their clients are challenging the need to do vaccination,” Richard Ford, an emeritus professor of medicine at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and co-author of the American Animal Hospital Association Canine Vaccination Guidelines and Vaccination Guidelines for the American Association of Feline Practitioners, told The Daily Beast.
Ford said pushback is gaining momentum. “We’re getting a lot of feedback from practitioners that their clients are challenging the need to do vaccination.” — Richard Ford, North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine
One of the biggest indicators of this trend is the number of clients who request an antibody titer—a blood test that measures the concentration of antibodies in the blood—for their dog or cat to help determine if they are protected from a specific disease. Ford said he has surveyed over 3,000 veterinarians and asked, “What is the number one reason that you would do a titer instead of giving the vaccine?”
“Interestingly, 98% say the owner requested it,” he said, noting that the market is growing for the test. “It’s actually driven by the client, not the veterinary professional. It’s because of clients concerned about over-vaccination.”
Ford said adverse reactions are rare—he estimated less than 1% based on past studies and observation.
As a precaution, Ford recommends spacing out vaccinations by 3-4 weeks in small dogs (adults weighing less than 20 pounds). The reason is that excipients—inactive ingredients such as proteins that are present in vaccines—can cause reactions. Those excipients are not the actual immunizing antigens. In those cases, Ford recommends core vaccines like rabies be administered first.
Still, veterinarians and now pet owners email him frequently with the question, “Why don’t we just reduce the volume of the vaccine for these small dogs?”
“It’s time, not volume, that seems to decrease the reaction rates,” he asserted. “The fact is, if the dog is truly allergic to a protein in the vaccine, putting half of it down the drain isn’t going to make a difference. They’re still going to be hypersensitive to the proteins that are in it… and the risk is doing that may not immunize the dog. With rabies, it is illegal to do that in law. You don’t want to be messing with the volume of the vaccine.”
One of the driving forces behind the movement to change rabies vaccination laws did just that. In 2017, the Connecticut State Board of Veterinary Medicine ordered a 25-year license probation for John Robb, a veterinarian who was giving partial doses of rabies vaccines to smaller dogs, which is illegal. He can no longer administer rabies vaccinations.
Now Robb is an outspoken proponent of titer testing in lieu of rabies vaccinations. Connecticut State Representative Fred Camillo told The Daily Beast he introduced legislation that would have made it legal for veterinarians to perform titers instead of rabies vaccinations (depending on the results) after speaking with Robb.
HB 5659 was defeated in 2017. A similar bill was defeated in New Hampshire earlier this year; Robb testified in favor of it as well.
Robb told The Daily Beast, “We all know that a titer indicates immunity”—but that is a point of contention in the veterinary community. The Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control by the National Association of Public Health Veterinarians states that “Rabies virus antibody titers are indicative of a response to vaccine or infection. Titers do not directly correlate with protection because other immunologic factors also play a role in preventing rabies and our abilities to measure and interpret those other factors are not well-developed. Therefore, evidence of circulating rabies virus antibodies in animals should not be used as a substitute for current vaccination in managing rabies exposures or determining the need for booster vaccination.” “You can’t control what animals do as much as you can children. That’s even more reason to keep them vaccinated, you know?” — Barbara Hjermstad, hospital manager at Riverview Animal Hospital in Durango, Colorado
That doesn’t temper Robb’s vitriol toward current rabies laws. While he can no longer administer rabies vaccines, he does have a business in which clients can submit blood draws from their pets. After sending it to a lab for titer testing, he sells rabies immunity certificates to pet owners, who must sign a “clarifying statement” that it is not a legal document.
“I’m not trying to fool people to go in and think they can license their dog with it,” he told The Daily Beast. “But it’s a true document and they can use it as they wish. I do 15 certificates a month, maybe 20. I’m pushing the change.”
Medynski said that her anti-vax views for her pets began with Robb, and that his work inspired her to start her anti-rabies activism by starting an online petition to support a state bill to loosen rabies laws.
Though the proposed New Hampshire bill was soundly defeated, she vows the fight isn't over. “We’re not giving up. No. There’s no reason for it [administering rabies boosters]. It’s causing injury, doing it.”
Medynski went so far as to claim that veterinarians were profiting because “It’s all about money.”
Veterinarians, however, disagree. Heather Loenser, a senior veterinary officer for the American Animal Hospital Association, emphasized in an email to The Daily Beast that rabies vaccination recommendations are centered on public safety and the health of the pet—not fiscal gain. “Vaccines cost $26-$30 while titers cost $175. Hjermstad noted that vaccines are 'not a money maker.'”
“I do not know of a veterinary hospital that relies on rabies vaccines to maintain their financial profits,” she said. “Veterinarians often volunteer their time to immunize pets at local low-cost, state/municipal sponsored rabies clinics to support public health in their local area. Others will travel throughout the world to protect pets and people in impoverished areas.”
She noted that rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease, and that according to the CDC , nearly 60,000 people die each year from rabies around the world, with over half of the deaths occurring in children, typically in areas where vaccinating stray and pet dogs is not done routinely.
“We have a reservoir of rabies in the wildlife population, so our unvaccinated pets are only one bite away from contracting it in their own backyard,” she cautioned. “In our veterinary oath , in addition to protecting animal health and public welfare, we swear that we will use our scientific knowledge and skills to ‘promote public health.’ Rabies vaccination falls squarely into that category.”
Ultimately, the issue boils down to whether clients trust their veterinary team. Barbara Hjermstad, hospital manager at Riverview Animal Hospital in Durango, Colo., said the practice hasn’t seen much pushback about vaccines, though about once every six months, someone will request a titer.
She noted that vaccines cost $26-$30 while titers cost $175, so vaccines are “not a money maker.”
Hjermstad feels it’s particularly important to vaccinate pets since they can’t speak. They can’t tell us if they’ve been in contact with a rabid racoon while hiking, or feces infected with parvovirus.
“You can’t control what animals do as much as you can children,” she said. “That’s even more reason to keep them vaccinated, you know?” READ THIS LIST"
Lori Loughlin’s Daughter Under Criminal Investigation in College Cheating Scandal,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lori-loughlins-daughter-isabella-giannulli-under-criminal-investigation-in-college-cheating-scandal,"OPERATION VARSITY BLUES Lori Loughlin’s Daughter Reportedly Under Criminal Investigation in College Cheating Scandal The celebrity spawn deleted her popular Instagram account ahead of allegations she is under a criminal probe. 04.18.19 5:11 AM ET Frazer Harrison/Getty
Just days after Lori Loughlin pleaded not guilty in the college admissions bribery scam , media reports suggest one of her daughters could be next to face a criminal probe.
Loughlin and her designer husband Mossimo Giannulli are each accused of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering after allegedly paying $500,000 for each of their daughters to be USC rowing recruits despite neither being active in the sport. Each count carries a maximum 20-year prison term.
Their eldest daughter, Isabella Giannulli, 20, deleted her popular Instagram account late Wednesday just as reports surfaced that she received a formal letter from prosecutors that could lead to potential charges.
The Daily Mail reports that Loughlin’s daughter received a letter of intent from federal prosecutors in Massachusetts in early April as part of the ongoing Operation Varsity Blues investigation. Last week, the Wall Street Journal also reported that several students had received ‘target letters’ from federal investigators in cases where the student may have been complicit.
Several students whose parents are accused of buying or bribing officials to ensure their children’s college admission have been suspended, but so far none have been criminally charged.
The Daily Mail , quoting an unnamed source, reported that Loughlin’s daughter had received a letter. “It is a not-so-veiled threat. [The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts] is making it pretty clear that they have evidence that very strongly suggests she knew of the illegal plot.”
Loughlin’s younger daughter Olivia Jade , 19, who is also implicated in the ordeal, still has her very popular Instagram account up though she has not posted anything since Feb. 28.
This week the famous couple rejected a plea bargain that would have potentially kept them from serving jail time in exchange for a guilty plea. An associate of Loughlin told CNN that she felt she had to plead not guilty.
“Lori doesn’t understand why she’s getting so much criticism for pleading not guilty,” the friend told CNN. “People must not realize that she had no choice. The plea deal has been taken off the table, and this is the only way they've been told she and Mossimo can avoid jail time and get another plea. They are hoping justice will prevail.”
Felicity Huffman, who is one of 13 parents accused in the scandal, did enter a guilty plea this week along with several other parents embroiled in the scandal."

Facebook announced Wednesday that it had added CheckYourFact.com, part of The Daily Caller, as a media partner in its controversial fact-checking program. The program is supposed to debunk false stories on Facebook to help stop their spread. But the Caller has faced repeated accusations of running false and offensive content itself, including articles from white supremacists like Jason Kessler, the organizer of the deadly 2016 Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally.
A Harvard report on disinformation in 2016 said the site had a “key role” in “creating and disseminating stories” that promoted “anti-Muslim sentiment” and “stoked the belief among core Trump followers” that Hillary Clinton was “criminal and treasonous.” The Check Your Fact section of the site claims it is “non-partisan” and “loyal to neither people nor parties.”"
Scouted: This Stainless Steel OXO Salad Spinner Has Made My Salads So Much Better,www.thedailybeast.com,Jessica Booth,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-salad-spinner-from-oxo-improves-any-salad,"Scouted By The Beast
When it came time to make my wedding registry last year, I had a few items on my mind that I knew absolutely needed to be on there, and a salad spinner was one of them. Luckily, in my search for the perfect option, I came across the OXO Stainless-Steel Salad Spinner , a beautiful silver colander that promised to keep my greens dry and ready to go.
The whole reason you get a salad spinner is to get your greens dry enough to make a pleasant salad that isn’t watery. You can dry your greens yourself, of course, but after doing that for months and then switching to this OXO device, I found that the salad spinner was a much, much better alternative. It speeds up the drying process and truly gets rid of all the excess moisture without leaving you with a sopping pile of green-tinged paper towels.
This particular salad spinner offers some nice features that you don’t get in other spinners. The in-lid pump operation is probably my favorite: instead of spinning the greens yourself with a lever on top, you simply push down on the pump top a few times and it goes off on its own. There’s also a one-touch brake button that allows you to stop the spinning instead of waiting for it to slow down, which is a nice option if you’re very impatient (like me).
The other thing I appreciate about this salad spinner is that it has a nonskid base that stays put on the counter no matter how many times you pump the top. I just press the pump button a few times and walk away, leaving it to do its thing while I get a different part of my cooking done, without worrying about it skidding off the counter (something my mother’s plastic one has done to me many times).
This can also be used as more than just a salad spinner. The stainless steel bowl is nice enough, and large enough, to double as a salad bowl when you’re ready to serve guests, which is great. The colander inside can easily be taken out and used on its own for just about anything you want to wash, and it’s a nice size and doesn’t collect water at the bottom. Plus, the whole thing is dishwasher safe, and the top easily comes apart to be cleaned.
Perhaps my favorite thing, though, is the stainless steel look: it feels more durable than plastic, it looks nicer, and it’s still in perfect condition after nearly a year of constant use. That said, if plastic isn’t a big deal to you, OXO sells a similar plastic salad spinner that has most of the same features and is cheaper. Either way, you’re giving yourself the perfect salad set-up.

Fox & Friends , the president’s most loyal morning show , on Thursday lauded Attorney General William Barr for opting to hold a press conference hours ahead of releasing the much-anticipated report compiled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
The Department of Justice has said that Barr will hold a news conference at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday to talk about the findings of the probe, which investigated ties between President Trump and Russians who meddled in the 2016 election. Officials will hand over the color-code redacted report to Congress on compact discs, between 11 a.m. and noon on Thursday. The report will be posted online for the public at an unspecified time afterward.
“What more can he do?” Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt asked. “Transparency at its finest, but still the Democrats aren’t happy.”
She’s right—the Democrats aren’t happy .
Many lawmakers have taken issue with the fact that Barr’s press conference will take place before anyone has had the chance to read the report—thus maximizing the administration’s ability to spin it in advance, and potentially avoid any tough questions.
“Bill Barr sent a letter purporting to summarize Mueller’s conclusions,” tweeted Rep. Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee. “He took it upon himself to reach a conclusion on obstruction. He adopted the President’s ‘spying’ smears. Now, he will spin a report no one has read. My advice: Wait to read Mueller’s words for yourself.
Meanwhile Rep. Jerry Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, chimed in : “Attorney General Barr wrote to me on April 1: ‘I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report.’ I agree. So why is the AG holding a press conference tomorrow morning to go over the Mueller report?”
Back on the curvy couch, Judge Andrew Napolitano at first complained about the delay but then said: “It’s been two years, we can wait a few more hours.”
“Would I like to be at the press conference? Yeah,” Napolitano said. “Would you like to have read the report before the press conference? This is just his style. I actually give him credit for doing that. Except that I’m here at 5 in the morning here to read this thing and now I find out I’m not going to get it until like 11 or 11:30.”
Ed Henry, filling in for Friends co-host Steve Doocy, added: “But he’s going to testify probably in the next few weeks anyway after everyone’s had a chance to read the report. It seems like it’s just partisanship.
“He’s putting it out there!”"

Nearly two years after the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, Attorney General William Barr has submitted a 448-page report to Congress penned by Mueller and a team of investigators detailing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in support of President Donald Trump, as well as ten instances of potential obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
According to the report, based on hundreds witness interviews and the examination of thousands of documents furnished by the White House and the Trump campaign, the president waged a public and private campaign to discourage potential witnesses from cooperating with the investigation, and privately attempted to “control” the investigation as it delved into the conduct of himself and his closest advisors during and after the presidential campaign.
Meanwhile, some of his closest aides and advisors alternately attempted to curtail the president’s potentially destructive impulses or cover them up—even lying to the press.
While the special counsel determined in the report that “the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize a president for obstructing justice,” inquiries intended to determine whether the president obstructed justice with a corrupt motive “should not impermissibly chill his performance of his constitutionally assigned duties.”
Congress, however, may apply the obstruction laws to the president’s actions with more liberty, Mueller said. “The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president 's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.”
Here are some of the report’s highlights: Trump: ‘I’m Fucked’
According to the report, the president had a near-meltdown after learning that Mueller had been appointed on May 17, 2017, to investigate his campaign’s potential ties with the Russian government—screaming that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had “let [him] down,” and that “you were supposed to protect me.”
According to Sessions’ recollection, Trump “slumped back in his chair” and said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.”
Trump then began lashing out at Sessions, asking “how could you let this happen?”
“Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency,” Trump said, according to Sessions. “It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”
The president then told Sessions that he should resign, a demand to which Sessions originally agreed before backing off, the report says. According to former White House communications director Hope Hicks, the president was more despondent than she had seen at any other point than the publication of the Access Hollywood tape. Trump Screamed ‘I Don’t Have A Lawyer’ After Sessions’ Recusal
One day after Sessions recused himself from overseeing the special counsel investigation, Trump met with then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, then-White House advisor Steve Bannon and White House Counsel Don McGahn in the Oval Office—opening the conversation by stating that “I don’t have a lawyer,” and bringing up that he wished former mentor and all-around crook Roy Cohn could be his attorney.
Citing Bannon, the special counsel report states that Trump grilled McGahn about the relationships between other presidents and their attorneys general. “You’re telling me that Bobby and Jack [Kennedy] didn’t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?” Bannon recalled that Trump “was as mad as Bannon had ever seen him and that he screamed at McGahn about how weak Sessions was.”
Sessions, according to the report, “had the impression that the president feared that the investigation could spin out of control and disrupt his ability to govern.” It was the then-attorney general’s feeling that if he had not recused, Trump felt he “could have helped avert” that disruption. McGahn Refused to Participate In ‘Saturday Night Massacre’
According to the report, “substantial evidence” supports the conclusion that Trump ordered McGahn to order Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the Mueller investigation following Sessions’ recusal, “to have the special counsel removed.” McGahn resisted ordering Mueller’s firing at Trump’s behest in June 2017, saying that he did not want to “participate in events that he described as akin to the Saturday Night Massacre ,” when President Richard Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliott Richardson to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor that was investigating Watergate. Richardson resigned rather than follow that order, as did his deputy attorney general, whom Nixon fired.
McGahn, the report says, called his lawyer, drove to White House, and packed his office in anticipation of submitting a letter of resignation. McGahn told Priebus that the president had asked him to “do crazy shit.” Priebus and Bannon urged McGahn not to quit, and McGahn ultimately backed down from his attempt to resign—as the president backed down from his demand that McGahn order Mueller’s firing.
According to the report, Trump would later float the possibility of firing McGahn for not lying about Trump’s order to fire Mueller. In a request to then-White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, Trump asked him to “create a record” asserting that he had never ordered McGahn to push for Mueller’s firing. Porter, who resigned after being accused of domestic abuse by both of his ex-wives, told the special counsel that Trump said something to the effect of “if he doesn’t write a letter, then maybe I’ll have to get rid of him [McGahn].”
The special counsel report notes that “substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that he was ordered to have the special counsel terminated, the president acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn’s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the president’s conduct towards the investigation.” Trump Ordered Lewandowski to Get Sessions to Cover For Him
Two days after telling McGahn to fire Mueller and end the investigation, Trump “made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation,” according to the special counsel report. During a one-on-one meeting with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , the president “dictated” a message for him to give Sessions.
That message: Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was “very unfair” to the president, and that the president had done nothing wrong. At another private meeting a month later, Trump asked Lewandowski about the message to Sessions “to limit the special counsel investigation to future election interference,” which Lewandowski reassured Trump “would be delivered soon.” Hours after that meeting, Trump lashed out at Sessions in an interview with the New York Times , saying that he would have selected another attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself.
Lewandowski did not want to deliver the president’s message personally, according to the report, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it. “Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through,” the special counsel notes. Trump’s Lawyers to Cohen: ‘Stay On Message’
Longtime Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who is serving three years in federal prison on charges of tax fraud and lying to federal investigators, told a judge in December that he had covered up the president’s “dirty deeds.” According to the special counsel report, evidence exists that Cohen’s coverups were encouraged by the president and his legal team, who, Cohen alleges, told him to “stay on message” and not contradict Trump during congressional testimony.
According to the report, Trump’s conduct towards Cohen “changed from praise… when he falsely minimized the president's involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when he became a cooperating witness.”
Cohen told Mueller that ahead of congressional testimony in 2017 in which he lied to Congress about the number of times he had briefed Trump about the project, Trump’s personal counsel told him to “stay on message” and not contradict Trump on the matter. After the FBI searched Cohen’s home and office in April 2018, Trump privately passed messages of support to Cohen, who discussed pardons with Trump’s personal attorneys.
After Cohen began cooperating with the special counsel in the summer of 2018, Trump publicly called him a “rat.”
Mueller later determined that while there was evidence that Trump knew Cohen had provided false testimony to Congress about the project, “the evidence available to us does not establish that the president directed or aided Cohen’s false testimony. Trump Encouraged Witnesses ‘Not to Cooperate’
Following the firing of James Comey as director of the FBI and the appointment of Mueller as special counsel, the report states, the president’s behavior towards the FBI and its investigation into Russian interference in the election became hostile, both in public and private: “At that point, the president engaged in a second phase of conduct involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both private and public to encourage witnesses not cooperate with the investigation.”
While the president’s public attempts to tell witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation were “unusual,” the report states, “no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to the justice system’s integrity is the same.”
President Trump’s statements that he “felt badly” for former campaign chair Paul Manafort and that “a lot of it is very unfair,” Mueller contends in the report, “combined with the president’s commendation of Manafort for being a ‘brave man’ who ‘refused to break,’ suggested that a pardon was a more likely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate with the government.”
The special counsel contended that “some evidence supports a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence [Manafort’s] jury,” but said that “alternative explanations” for Trump’s comments —including that “he genuinely felt sorry for Manafort”—prevented a firm contention that the president had a corrupt intent behind his encouragement. Mueller: Trump Told Comey to Kill Flynn Investigation
One day after the resignation of Michael Flynn as national security advisor, Trump met with Comey in the Oval Office and told him that he “hope[d] you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” adding that he was “a good guy.” Comey would later tell Congress that he understood those remarks to be a request to “drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.”
According to Mueller’s analysis, the circumstances of that conversation “show that the president was asking Comey to close the FBI’s investigation into Flynn.”
“[B]ecause the president is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he ‘hopes’ a subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the president wants,” Mueller determined. Why Mueller Didn’t Subpoena President Trump
Trump’s legal team was prepared to wage a war to keep the president from being subpoenaed into testifying under oath before the special counsel, but that battle never came—Mueller never sought to legally compel the president to testify. In the report, the special counsel writes that while lawyers had determined that the special counsel possesses both the authority and the legal justification to issue a grand jury subpoena, he declined, “in view of the substantial delay that such an investigative step would likely produce at a late stage in our investigation.”
Mueller also felt that, “based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the president’s actions and his public and private statements describing or explaining those actions,” investigators had sufficient evidence to assess the truthfulness of the president’s testimony. ‘Some Evidence’ Trump Knew of Flynn’s Conversations with Russian Ambassador
Flynn served as national security advisor for a mere 24 days before his resignation, after reports surfaced that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his past conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. During the transition, Flynn had discussed rolling back Obama-era sanctions on Russia and Russian citizens with the ambassador, and then lied to the FBI about those conversations, a crime to which he pleaded guilty and has not yet been sentenced—in part because he has “substantially” assisted the Mueller investigation, according to a sentencing memo released in December 2018.
According to the report, “some evidence suggests that the president knew about the existence and content of Flynn’s calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be relied upon to establish the president’s knowledge” until White House Counsel McGahn was informed by then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates that Flynn had been “compromised” by the Russian government. Manafort Shared Campaign Data With Former Russian Intelligence
As suggested months ago in court filings, the report states that Manafort shared Trump campaign polling data with alleged former Russian intelligence officer and longtime pal Konstantin Kilimnik during a 2016 meeting about a potential peace plan in Ukraine, which has been under partial occupation since Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014.
“Both men believed the plan would require Trump's assent to succeed” if he were to be elected, the report states, noting that Manafort and Kilimnik “also discussed the status of the Trump campaign and Manafort’s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states.” Months before that meeting, Manafort “caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik and the sharing continued for some period of time.” Sarah Sanders Admitted She Made Up ‘Rank-and-File’ Criticism of Comey
After Trump fired Comey in May 2017, then-deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters in a press conference that “ the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director,” prompting Comey’s firing. When told by a reporter in the briefing that the vast majority of FBI agents supported the former director, Sanders responded that she had heard “from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.”
When asked by the special counsel about the source of that statement, Sanders described the statement as a “slip of the tongue,” made in the heat of the moment “that was not founded on anything,” according to the report. Jared Kushner Gave Russian-Made ‘Reconciliation Plan’ to Rex Tillerson
After being introduced to a friend of Jared Kushner—the presidential son-in-law and White House advisor—Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, collaborated with the friend on a “short written reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia” during the presidential campaign. The plan, Dmitriev intimated, had been approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
That friend, the report states, gave the proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and “Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.” READ THIS LIST"

Rapper Kodak Black, who is already facing a sexual-assault charge, was arrested Wednesday night at the U.S.-Canada border for possessing several guns and marijuana while on his way to a performance at Boston’s House of Blues, New York State Police told The Daily Beast.
The 21-year-old Florida rapper―whose legal name is Bill Kapri― and Jeantony Saintmelus, 22, were charged with third-degree criminal possession of a weapon and unlawful possession of marijuana. Two other men in Black’s car, 24-year-old Stetson President and 20-year-old Madarrow Smith, were also arrested on weapons charges.
Police confirmed that Black and his crew were detained at the Lewiston-Queenston International Bridge, which connects Lewiston, N.Y., to Queenston, Ontario, at around 7:30 p.m. after troopers noticed their car had “a temporary California registration.”
“Kapri was found to have marijuana,” a New York State police spokesman told The Daily Beast. “Further inspection of the Cadillac revealed a Glock 9mm pistol that was undeclared by all the occupants.”
A Porsche that was traveling with Black was also detained by police at the border, and authorities said they found a shotgun and marijuana in the trunk of that car. The driver, Saintmelus, also admitted he had two loaded handguns in the backseat, police said.
All four men were arraigned in Lewiston Court in Canada and taken to the Niagara County Jail in lieu of $40,000 bail, police said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed to The Daily Beast they are working with law enforcement in Canada regarding the arrest and possible extradition.
Black was scheduled to perform at the House of Blues in Boston on Wednesday night, the venue tweeted . His absence, which was blamed on “unforeseen issues,” caused fan frustration―leading to an altercation outside and fans chanting “ fuck Kodak ,” Boston police told The Daily Beast.
Police confirmed at least one arrest was made during the fight after a man was seen “assaulting a security staff member” as he attempted to re-enter the House of Blues.
“It could have been a lot worse honestly,” a police spokesman told The Daily Beast. “A lot of unhappy patrons, but it was resolved quickly.”
Wednesday’s arrest is the latest in a series of legal troubles for the South Florida rapper. In 2016, Black was indicted on first-degree criminal sexual conduct charges in South Carolina after he allegedly sexually assaulted a woman.
According to the Florence County Sheriff’s Office, the rapper was accused of raping a teenage girl at a Comfort Inn hotel after a November concert at the Treasure City nightclub. The girl, who has not been publicly identified, first reported the alleged incident to her school nurse, who contacted the authorities.
The rapper, best known for his songs “Tunnel Vision,” “No Flockin,” and “Wake Up in the Sky,” is also under fire for his comments earlier this month about Nipsey Hussle’s girlfriend in the wake of the rapper’s death.
On Instagram live, Black said he could wait for actress and Hussle’s longtime girlfriend Lauren London, adding that he would be “the best man I can be for her.”
“I’ll give her a whole year,” the rapper said in the video . “She might need a whole year to be crying and shit for him.” Black eventually apologized for any “disrespectful” comments he may have made."

Even though I have organized and re-organized my drawers, things still tend to get wrinkled. I’m human. I tend to leave my clean laundry in a “folded” pile for a few days. And when I lived at my parents’ house, I co-opted my mom’s stand-up steamer every morning. Now, I have to resort to an iron every single day. It’s not great.

Nadler Announces Subpoena for Full Mueller Report and Underlying Evidence,www.thedailybeast.com,Erin.Banco@thedailybeast.com (Erin Banco),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nadler-announces-subpoena-for-full-mueller-report-and-underlying-evidence,"SEE YOU IN COURT Nadler Announces Subpoena for Full Mueller Report and Underlying Evidence House Judiciary chairman wants grand jury information DOJ did not disclose, setting up a legal battle. 04.18.19 1:32 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photo by Getty / Shutterstock
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said Thursday that he would issue a subpoena seeking Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury information and underlying evidence following the Department of Justice’s release of the heavily redacted Mueller report.
""Because Congress requires this material in order to perform our constitutionally-mandated responsibilities, I will issue a subpoena for the full report and the underlying materials,” Nadler said Thursday.
The Justice Department is expected to reject the subpoena, setting up a legal fight that could go all the way to the Supreme Court.
The move by Nadler comes after weeks of demands by Democrats on Capitol Hill that Attorney General William Barr give Congress the full, unredacted report and its accompanying documents. Barr refused to do so, saying in Hill testimony earlier this month he was working with Mueller to redact classified information, grand jury information, and any information that would hurt the reputation of individuals who were not charged.
The report, which was released Thursday morning, lays out in more than 360 pages what the special counsel’s office found during its two-year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The document says that Mueller’s team did not find any evidence of collusion or coordination by members of the Trump campaign, or any American, with Russia’s efforts to interfere in the election. It also says that the special counsel’s office chose not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. The report is peckered with redactions of information related to grand jury testimony.
Hours before the release of the Mueller report Thursday, Barr said in a press conference that he would present a fuller report to certain members of Congress but asserted that he would leave grand jury information redacted.
“I believe that this accommodation, together with my upcoming testimony before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, will satisfy any need Congress has for information regarding the Special Counsel's investigation,” Barr said.
Democrats began their fight for the release of the full report immediately following the end of Mueller’s investigation last month when Barr released a memo, initially described as a summary, of the special counsel’s findings.
Barr told Congress in that memo that Mueller’s office did not draw a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice. Barr wrote he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded the evidence was not sufficient to establish the president had committed an offense. Since then it has been reported that some of Mueller’s investigators felt that the report was more damaging to Trump than Barr reflected in his letter.
Democratic staffers on the Hill met behind closed doors this week with members about how best to tackle the redactions in the Mueller report both from a legal and public relations standpoint. Members of the House Intelligence Committee were warned, for example, not to analyze the Mueller report live on television following its release, according to two sources with knowledge of the conversations. the House Judiciary Committee, too, discussed ways to pressure Barr and the DOJ to release the report’s findings, even if in a classified setting.
Meanwhile, several House committees are pursuing investigations into Trump and his associates. The judiciary committee is seeking records from more than 80 individuals who were connected to the Mueller investigation. The intelligence committee is carrying out its investigation of Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, with a specific focus on money laundering. The committee has also said it is looking to bring back Trump associates for further questions about their work on or related to Trump’s campaign. READ THIS LIST"

Herman Cain Accuser Threatens to Describe His Private Parts to Congress if He Doesn’t Withdraw ‘He should be disqualified from any government position, because truth matters,’ attorney Gloria Allred said at a Thursday press conference. 04.18.19 3:43 PM ET Eric Thayer/Getty
A woman who has accused Herman Cain of having a long-term consensual affair threatened on Thursday to describe “certain parts” of his body to the Senate Banking Committee “to corroborate her testimony” if he doesn’t withdraw his name from consideration for the Federal Reserve Board.
Ginger White first claimed she had a 13-year affair with Cain in 2011, during the Tea Party activist’s presidential campaign. At least four other women stepped forward at the time to accuse Cain, who’s been married for nearly 50 years, of sexual harassment. Two of those women, including Karen Kraushaar , received settlements from the National Restaurant Association over sexual harassment claims they made against him in the late 1990s.
Cain, in an interview during his campaign, acknowledged that White was a “friend,” but denied having had any sexual relationship with her. “I have nothing to hide,” he told CNN at the time .
Famed attorney Gloria Allred, who represents White, said at a press conference Thursday afternoon: “If it is true that Mr. Cain had a 13-year affair and if it is true that he sexually harassed women when they either sought a job or had a job when he was the employer, then he should be disqualified from any government position, because truth matters.”
Allred also represents Sharon Bialek, who accused Cain of groping her when she interviewed for a job at the National Restaurant Association, where Cain worked as the president and CEO in the late 1990s. Bialek’s accusations surfaced with the others when Cain unsuccessfully ran for president in 2011.
When she objected to Cain’s alleged attempts to force her head into his crotch, Bialek claimed that Cain replied, “You want a job, right?”
Allred said on Thursday that both White and Bialek are willing to testify under oath about their allegations.
“Ginger, if asked at the United States Senate Banking Committee hearing, will also be willing to identify certain parts of Mr. Cain’s body to corroborate her testimony,” she continued.
Appearing beside Allred, White threatened: “I ask Herman Cain, if I never had a sexual relationship with you, how would I be in a position to describe parts of your body that are not visible?”
Allred added: “This testimony will not be necessary if Mr. Cain withdraws his name from the vetting process and or the President decides not to formally nominate him. We call on Mr. Cain to do the right thing and spare all of us another bruising and painful confirmation hearing in the United States Senate.”
It is not clear how the Senate committee would verify White’s testimony about Cain’s body.
Cain, for his part, has repeatedly denied all of the allegations against him and earlier this week told The Wall Street Journal that he is “very committed” to remaining in consideration for the Federal Reserve Board.
President Trump, meanwhile, told The New York Times earlier this month that Cain is “a truly outstanding individual” and said, “I’ve told my folks that’s the man.”
At least four Republican senators—including Kevin Cramer (ND), Cory Gardner (CO), Lisa Murkowski (AK), and Mitt Romney (UT)—have said they would not vote to confirm the former presidential candidate for the post."
QAnon Believers Crushed After Mueller Report Fails to Lead to Hillary Clinton’s Arrest,www.thedailybeast.com,William.Sommer@thedailybeast.com (Will Sommer),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-believers-crushed-after-mueller-report-fails-to-lead-to-hillary-clintons-arrest,"QANON-EVENT QAnon Believers Crushed After Mueller Report Fails to Lead to Hillary Clinton’s Arrest QAnon fans thought Mueller would take down the Democrats. Instead, Sebastian Gorka made fun of them. 04.18.19 3:30 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty
While most of Donald Trump’s allies braced for the release on Thursday of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, believers in the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory approached the long-awaited publication with a sense of thrill.
For years, QAnon fans have been mocked for believing that Mueller was secretly in league with the president, working hand-in-hand to uncover Satanic rituals committed by top Democrats before shipping them off to Guantanamo Bay. They had been told it was ridiculous to base their entire political worldview on a series of anonymous clues posted on internet message boards — including one that claimed Hillary Clinton was secretly arrested in October 2017.
Now, after all the chanting and waving of “Q” signs at Trump rallies, their hour of vindication was at hand.
Liz Crokin, a leading QAnon promoter, predicted on Wednesday that Mueller’s report would uncover leading Democrats committing crimes that are “punishable by death.”
“I think the Mueller Report will reveal some indicators that the real crimes that took places were committed by Hillary Clinton, Obama, and some of their associates,” Crokin told The Daily Beast.
Crokin wasn’t alone. “Patriots’ Soapbox,” a 24-hour YouTube livestream devoted to decoding QAnon clues, urged viewers to check back Thursday for a “BIG day.” Joe Masepoes, a QAnon promoter whose pro-QAnon videos have been shared by celebrities like former baseball star Curt Schilling, urged his followers to “be here tomorrow.”
But when the Mueller report arrived on Thursday morning, it contained none of the bombshell, global pedophile cabal-destroying revelations QAnon fans had predicted. Instead, it detailed the a Russian campaign of electoral subterfuge that benefit Trump’s election efforts along with repeated attempts by the president to impede investigations into his conduct.
Unhappy QAnon believers were left to grapple with the letdown. As the report’s lack of QAnon proofs became clear, the Patriots’ Soapbox livestream quickly moved on to other topics like human trafficking. The channel’s viewers weren’t fooled, though. The comment section quickly filled up with disappointed QAnon fans.
On Voat, a Reddit-style forum alternative popular with QAnon fans, believers lamented the fact that they had been duped again.
“Trump is toast,” said one poster who said he wouldn’t vote in 2020 after the disappointment. “Lied to us to extend his re-election. Good luck Q peeps. I'm done here.”
This isn’t the first time QAnon loyalists have been promised confirmation of their bizarre ideas, only to be disappointed. In June 2018, “Q” — the anonymous person or group of people behind the vague clues that have been strung into QAnon — had promised that a Department of Justice inspector general report would bring down Clinton.
That report didn’t include the revelations QAnon believers were promised either. One angry, armed QAnon believer responded to that let-down by shutting down a bridge near the Hoover Dam with an improvised armored truck.
While QAnon believers grappled with what the Mueller report actually meant, the movement’s foes —including those in Trumpworld—took the opportunity to gloat. Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, whose frequent attacks on QAnon have made him a top enemy of Q-heads, took to Twitter on Thursday to urge QAnon believers to “#LeaveTheCult.”
“As of this morning: Q and QAnon are dead,” Gorka tweeted. READ THIS LIST"
Man Charged With Trying to Set St. Patrick’s on Fire Was Arrested at Newark Cathedral Days Earlier,www.thedailybeast.com,Pervaiz.Shallwani@thedailybeast.com (Pervaiz Shallwani) Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/st-patricks-marc-lamparello-charged-with-attempting-to-set-fire-to-iconic-church-had-been-arrested-at-newark-cathedral-on-monday,"04.18.19 4:27 PM ET TIMOTHY A. CLARY
Days before a 37-year-old philosophy professor allegedly tried to set fire to the iconic St. Patrick’s Cathedral in the heart of Manhattan, he was arrested for refusing to leave a church in New Jersey—setting off a bizarre 48 hours for a man who previously had little interaction with law enforcement.
According to an arrest report of the incident at Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart obtained by The Daily Beast, Marc Lamparello was charged Monday night after he refused orders from an Essex County Deputy Sheriff to leave the Newark church.
The cathedral was closing and Lamparello, who was seated in a pew according to the report, allegedly told a sheriff who asked him to leave: “If you want me to leave tonight, you’re gonna have to handcuff me and arrest me tonight and take me to jail.”
A few moments later, as two sheriffs tried to get him to leave, Lamparello apparently threw himself onto a pew and yelled “no.” Then, as officers tried to take him into custody, he resisted, and at one point threw himself onto the church floor, stating, “I’m not leaving. God wants me here. I know all the sins the priests have committed.”
Details of the arrest emerged as authorities in New York charged Lamparello Thursday afternoon with attempted arson, reckless endangerment, and city code violations related to illegally transporting flammable materials in public places. It was not clear when Lamparello would be arraigned. He was transported Thursday afternoon to the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital for evaluation, police said.
Police are still working to determine Lamparello’s motive, but John Miller, the head of the NYPD’s Counterterrorism Bureau, said investigators with the NYPD and FBI in New York reviewed the case throughout the night and determined there “doesn’t appear to be any connection to any terrorist group or any terrorist related intent here.”
But, Miller added that based on Lamparello’s movements and the fact he had gasoline, lighter fluid that is used for igniting a grill, and a bag filled with lighters, police believe he was planning to set fire inside St. Patrick’s
“There is significant reason to doubt the veracity of his statements and his intent with those items seem to be to set a fire,” he said.
Police were particularly concerned since the incident took place days after an accidental fire destroyed parts of Notre Dame in Paris.
“You would have to say from our standpoint...there was certainly attention to that when he showed up at an iconic church,” Miller said, adding that he could not say that Lamparello made any statements related to the Notre Dame fire.
The charges capped a bizarre two days for Lamparello, who teaches philosophy and published a book on the subject titled Reason and Counterpoint , in 2016. Before Monday his only run-ins with the law included a drug possession charge in 2005, a senior law-enforcement official said.
Lamparello has worked as a professor at several colleges and universities, including Brooklyn College , Seton Hall University , and Lehman College, where he is a part-time online professor lecturer and PhD candidate in the philosophy department. The schools confirmed Lamparello’s previous or current employment.
“We are aware that an individual was arrested last night after an incident at St. Patrick’s Cathedral,” Lehman College spokesperson Sarah Ramsey said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “The individual was hired at Lehman College during this academic year and was a part-time online instructor this semester.”
After his arrest, however, Lehman confirmed that it will terminate Lamparello’s employment with the college.
The New Jersey native has ties to the Catholic Church. As recently as 2013 , Lamparello was the music director at St. Joseph’s Church in East Rutherford, New Jersey, according to a church bulletin posted online. Church bulletins suggest he was in the role for at least three years, beginning in 2011 . The church did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.
It all seemed to unravel around 10:30 p.m. Monday when he was approached by police in Newark. According to the arrest report in New Jersey, Lamparello was charged with resisting arrest and obstruction and released after being evaluated by medics that responded to the scene. Lamparello did not have any flammable materials in New Jersey, police said.
Miller said police determined that Lamparello has homes in both New York and New Jersey but had been living in a hotel the past few days.
Investigators also learned that on Wednesday morning before he left for New York, Lamparello booked a $2,800 flight to Italy that would have departed at 5:20 p.m. Thursday, Miller said.
The NYPD determined that Lamparello arrived in the area near St. Patrick’s around 6:30 p.m. Wednesday night, Miller said. Surveillance video from the area and security cameras at the building show his van circling the block as well as getting in and out of the vehicle.
Around 7.55 p.m., Miller said he returned to the van, opened a back door and took out the two cans of gasoline, two containers of lighter fluid, and a bag filled with lighters. About a minute later, he entered St. Patrick’s Cathedral through the front door and walked about 20 feet before he was confronted by a church usher.
“He is approached by the usher, who is working at the front door, who tells him he cannot proceed into the cathedral with these items,” Miller said. “When he puts it down, some of it spills on the floor. He picks it up and leaves.”
The usher then alerted members of the NYPD’s counterterrorism bureau who were stationed outside. Two officers followed Lamparello down 50th Street and engaged him in a conversation for “some time” in an effort to vet his story and locate his vehicle, Miller said.
“He explains that he was trying to locate his vehicle, that his vehicle was out of gas,” Miller said. “That’s why he possessed the gasoline. At this point he is walking away from his vehicle, which is parked on Fifth Avenue, and not towards it.”
The officers determined that Lamparello’s van was not out of gas or located in the direction that he was heading and arrested him for questioning, Miller said.
Concerned, members of the joint terrorism task force, which includes the FBI and the NYPD, questioned Lamparello through the night, before determining that the incident appeared to be isolated."
"Fox’s Judge Napolitano: Trump’s Behavior Is ‘Immoral, Deceptive, and Repellent’—But Not Criminal",www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/foxs-judge-napolitano-trumps-behavior-is-immoral-deceptive-and-repellent-but-not-criminal,"Fox’s Judge Napolitano: Trump’s Behavior Is ‘Immoral, Deceptive, and Repellent’—But Not Criminal The judicial analyst did, however, suggest the Mueller report outlined multiple impeachable offenses. 04.18.19 4:17 PM ET Fox News
Shortly after the public release of the redacted Mueller report , Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano on Thursday said the documents show the president is “immoral” and “repellent,” but that his behavior doesn’t rise to the “level of criminality.”
Asked by Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner about how Democrats will officially respond to the findings, Napolitano said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is “herding sheep” as she has one wing that “wants to undermine the president” and a moderate group concerned “that the rush to impeachment might actually backfire.”
At the same time, the judge—who has emerged as Fox’s “ lonely truth-teller ” when it comes to Trump matters—noted there were items in the report that Attorney General William Barr failed to hint at during a pre-spin press conference on Thursday morning.
“The president—the behavior of the president is immoral, deceptive, and repellent,” Napolitano exclaimed. “But it doesn’t rise to the level of criminality. And that’s kind of apparent.”
The judge went on to explain that House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY) will look at the potential incidents of obstruction listed in the report and decide if it’s enough of a basis to move forward with impeachment
“That is a political judgment and not a legal one,” he reminded Faulkner.
As for the president directing a misleading statement in response to news that his son, Donald Trump Jr., met with Russians at Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, Napolitano pointed out that this was not redacted in the report because it shows the president using a government asset (Air Force One) to perpetuate a public fraud, which is an impeachable offense.
“Do they want to go there?” Napolitano wondered aloud. “I hope they don’t. I lived through two impeachment efforts in my life. I don’t want to go through this again. I don’t think a country wants to go through it.”
Prior to his segment with Faulkner, Napolitano said on Fox Business Network that the Mueller report shows Trump’s “pattern of deception and instruction to underlings to deceive” and that it could “gin up an investigation by the Southern District of New York.”"
Justice Fell Short After Mueller Report.

Congress Can Finish the Job. Democrats can win the spin on this report in the coming days—there’s enough there. But if they use this to start howling for impeachment, they’re going to blow it. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
Well, after all that, the bad news is that this changes nothing.
And the good news? This changes nothing.
Donald Trump is not going to be perp-walked out of Mar-a-Lago next weekend. Trump defenders and Julian Assange acolytes and deep-state paranoiacs can crow.
On the other hand, the Mueller Report has plenty of chapter and verse on sleazy behavior by Trump and his subordinates —and, interestingly, it documents some incidents where subordinates refused to do sleazy things Trump clearly wanted them to do.
It does not clear Trump. Here’s the last sentence of text of the whole thing, on page 180 of Volume II, the obstruction part: “Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
If that sounds wishy-washy, it should, and it reflects the structure of the whole thing. Take the section on Trump’s firing of James Comey. The report does come down on the side of saying that the official reason for Comey’s firing, the Rod Rosenstein memo that cited the FBI director’s mishandling of the Clinton email investigation, was nonsense. It cites what Trump said to Lester Holt on NBC, that he fired Comey over Russia. Then (Volume II, page 74), it takes up the question of whether the firing constituted obstruction.
“Firing Comey,” the report says, “would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect of interfering with or impeding the investigation.” It seems obvious that that was the intent. Trump was mad that Comey wouldn’t say publicly that Trump personally was not under investigation, and Trump was clearly enraged about the investigation itself. Why else would he fire the guy?
But then, in the next paragraph, the report says: “The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation.” In other words, Comey wasn’t conducting the investigation single-handedly, so firing him didn’t impede it!
Well, maybe that’s what the letter of the law says. But it’s not what common sense says. The report is like that over and over again. Act A would qualify as an obstructive act if A, B, and C conditions are met. We found considerable evidence that A, B, and C conditions were met. However, they weren’t met enough for us to identify a clear crime.
And that’s where the report has left us, more or less where we were before it hit, with a few damning new details and the certainty that the courts aren’t going to resolve this. So now what?
This is what I meant above when I wrote that the good news is that nothing changes. Democrats should still pursue their investigations. They need to get Bill Barr, who dirtied himself further Thursday morning in breathtaking ways, back up on the Hill. They need to hear from Mueller. They need to keep pushing for an unredacted or less-redacted report—huge chunks of the Wikileaks section in particular are blacked out—as Jerry Nadler vowed they would do at his press conference Thursday afternoon.
The report suggests that that’s what Mueller wants. A key sentence, Volume II, page 8: “The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President 's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.” In other words: Keep at it, Jerry!
But: The Democrats who’ve been engaging in impeachment talk should follow their leaders and cool it. This report says plenty of bad stuff about Trump. The public will drink it in and will, I think, come to basically the right conclusions. Trump did a lot of fishy things--maybe, out of some combination of good lawyering and stupid luck, just on the good side of the law. No one outside of MAGAville is going to read this as a clean bill of health.
In other words, the Democrats can win the spin on this report in the coming days—there’s enough there. But if they use this to start howling for impeachment—which barely more than one third of the public supports right now—they’re going to blow it.
I understand all the arguments against the one I’m making. But picture this. The House votes articles of impeachment along strict party lines sometime this fall. Then, a year from now, or 15 months from now—and Mitch McConnell would time this exquisitely; say, the week before the Republican convention—the Senate votes to acquit on all charges, which it would do.
That’s a gift to Trump, and perhaps even more so, to the Republicans running for Senate in all those red states where Democrats need to win if they’re going to have a chance of recapturing the chamber (North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia). It could well help reelect Trump. Are articles of impeachment that are doomed to fail in the Senate anyway worth four more years of Trump and McConnell, and possibly two more right-wing Supreme Court justices, and the death of Obamacare, and all the rest?
This isn’t a movie. No one’s going to break down on the witness stand and confess everything. It’s also not a moot court competition, where the law reigns supreme and people decide things on the merits. It’s politics, at its most gruesome. Unassailable legal arguments don’t win you a political fight.
That does not mean Democrats should drop all this and stick to preexisting conditions. As I said above, Mueller gave them a lot of material. This was no witch hunt. There are witches. The Democrats should haul them all before Congress. They need to push hard on every door this report opened, from Trump Tower to Erik Prince to Hope Hicks and the emails and everything else that’s there. They need to make sure the American people know that Trump said “I don’t remember” 30 times and refused to testify. They need to keep putting pressure on the administration. They need to ask smart and tough questions, hold the high ground and hold politically vulnerable Republicans to account for ceding it to stand with Trump.
A clearer verdict on obstruction of justice may someday emerge.
Mueller kicked it to Congress. Now Congress has to do its job. Aggressively—but smartly. READ THIS LIST"
Scouted: The nodpod Weighted Sleep Mask Is The One Thing That Helps Me Get a Good Night's Sleep,www.thedailybeast.com,Rachel Krantz,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-nodpod-sleep-mask-helps-anyone-sleep-better,"Scouted By The Beast
When I received the nodpod weighted eye mask for review, I was more than a little skeptical. It didn’t look like it could possibly be comfortable. Wouldn’t having something weighted on my eyelids disrupt my sleep or feel somehow claustrophobic? And the fact that the weighted sections wrapped around not just my eyes, but also my ears, seemed impractical — wouldn’t that get in the way of sleeping on my side?
So imagine my surprise when this eye mask became the single most essential addition to my (already obsessive and gadget-ridden ) sleep hygiene. No one product has done more to help me fall asleep and stay asleep than the nodpod, so much so that I now always travel with it wherever I go.
Using polyethylene beads, nodpod molds to the contours of your face, creating a custom, light-blocking effect that’s much more effective than the dozens of eye masks I’ve tried over the years. But it’s not just that it blocks light better than other eye masks — it also really does help me fall asleep. The idea behind weight therapy, also known as Deep Touch Pressure, was pioneered by Dr. Temple Grandin. Gentle pressure calms your central nervous system, taking us back to being an infant. “It is the type of surface pressure that is exerted in most types of touching, holding, stroking, or swaddling,” Dr. Grandin explained. When I slip the nodpod on, I feel genuinely safe and insulated from the outside world, from light getting to my eyes and noise to my ears. It’s become a genuinely Pavlovian response that I am “ready” for sleep.
The nodpod has two sides to it, which I appreciate as well: a cooler jersey cotton side (the one I use most) and a microfiber side. Most effectively-light-blocking eye masks are made of a harsher foam-like material, and it feels much better on my sensitive eyes to have cotton touching them. Also surprising is that though the nodpod wraps around my entire head, it doesn’t interfere with side sleeping for me at all. The weighted beads seem to adjust perfectly around any of my motions, and I only notice it around my ears insofar as it helps block out sounds.
Also important to me, the nodpod is washer/dryer safe and doesn’t break down over time the way I’ve found other eye masks have. While you can’t microwave the nodpod for some added heat therapy, you can put it in the freezer or fridge. I sometimes use it for a headache or lying down meditations as well.
I gush about this eye mask to anyone I know who has sleep issues. It is well worth trying out, even if you think it looks weird and cumbersome. And if for some reason it doesn’t work for you, they also offer a 30-day money back guarantee. So, sleep on it.

Trump Did Disastrous Lester Holt Interview Because He Didn’t Trust His Own Staff,www.thedailybeast.com,andrew.kirell@thedailybeast.com (Andrew Kirell),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-did-disastrous-lester-holt-interview-because-he-didnt-trust-his-own-staff,"THAT EXPLAINS IT Trump Did Disastrous Lester Holt Interview Because He Didn’t Trust His Own Staff The president infamously told on himself during a May 2017 televised interview. The Mueller report reveals he only did the sit-down because he didn’t trust his own team. Andrew Kirell 04.18.19 3:55 PM ET
President Trump only sat down for a disastrous May 2017 interview with NBC because he did not trust his own communications staff, the Mueller report reveals.
Two days after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump sat down for an interview with NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt and proudly contradicted his and his staff’s own previous statements about the decision to axe the top cop.
“The President told the White House Counsel’s Office attorneys in advance of the interview that the communications team could not get the story right, so he was going on Lester Holt to say what really happened,” reads the Mueller report , which was released in redacted form on Thursday.
The revelation gives further insight into the behind-the-scenes chaos surrounding Trump’s decision to boot Comey—from the White House’s fumbling excuses for the firing to the president’s eventual contradiction of previous statements on the matter.
During that chat with Holt, Trump admitted to having been determined to fire Comey even without a recommendation letter from the Justice Department.
“Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,” Trump boasted to Holt.
That admission directly contradicted the White House’s oft-repeated line that Comey’s firing was the result of a contentious face-to-face meeting and a letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein asking that the FBI chief be replaced. (Another common refrain, famously uttered by Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was that Trump spoke with “countless” FBI agents who “lost confidence” in Comey. Sanders later admitted to having made that up entirely, the Mueller report reveals.)
The president’s contradictory confessions during the Holt interview led to weeks worth of bipartisan outrage and concerns that Trump fired Comey in order to squash an investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference.
That same evening, the New York Times reported that, shortly after inauguration, Trump repeatedly demanded Comey pledge loyalty to him, and the FBI director sternly declined. The news further fueled suspicion the president’s actions were not simply based on thoughtful recommendation.
The bungled NBC Q&A also kicked off a lengthy period in which the president refused to do televised interviews with any outlets outside a select few Trump-friendly hosts at Fox News, Fox Business Network, and Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network. READ THIS LIST"

After the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) told CNN that impeachment of President Trump is not worth the trouble with an election just 18 months away. “Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,” Hoyer reportedly said. “Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgement.” Earlier Thursday, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said that impeachment was “one possibility.” “We obviously have to get to the bottom of what happened and take whatever action seems necessary at that point,” he told reporters in a news conference. “It’s too early to reach those conclusions. It’s one reason why we wanted the Mueller report, we still want the Mueller report in its entirety and we’ll want other evidence too.” Cheat Sheet ®"

Plus, ‘Socrates’ at the Public. ‘Hillary and Clinton’ treads well-worn territory: the 2008 primaries, Bill’s infidelities, and Hillary’s trouble wooing the masses. Plus, Michael Stuhlbarg livens up ‘Socrates.’ 04.18.19 7:37 PM ET Courtesy Julieta Cervantes
Hillary Clinton is a familiar Broadway visitor; the show doesn't go on until the crowd stops applauding her. But one would imagine a trip to the Golden Theatre this spring might be a little too meta for comfort.
Laurie Metcalf and playwright Lucas Hnath have returned to the Golden Theatre, after the Tony-winning success of A Doll’s House, Part 2 , in 2017. And here again, on the relatively blank canvas of Chloe Lamford’s set, Metcalf is playing a woman at a crossroads, trying to forge a victorious path away from male obstruction and the baleful judgement of those around her.
In Hillary and Clinton ( booking through July 21 ), Metcalf is playing Hillary Clinton, at a key moment during her 2008 duel with Barack Obama (Peter Francis James). The New Hampshire primary is about to happen. She's in a hotel room. Her campaign has stalled, what should she do? Accept Obama’s offer and give up her campaign, and join him as his running mate? Fight on? Have Bill Clinton ( John Lithgow ), her husband, the crutch she does not want but may well need, come and join her campaign? Her adviser Mark Penn (Zak Orth) wants her to fight on, but without Bill.
The play is as zippy as A Doll’s House, Part 2 , but whereas that felt new, fresh, and subversive, Hillary and Clinton feels like very old and well-trodden ground, a mash-up of every single argument you’ve ever heard (with very little new insight) in favor and against Hillary Clinton.
Further air is deflated from its tires from the simple slice of knowledge that we know what happened next, and we know what happened after that and after that and after that. We are watching another raking over of extremely old coals in a life that has been endlessly chronicled and analyzed; this pre-Trump battle royale slice of Hillary history feels like a distant curio.
Metcalf plays Hillary with an impressive, defiant lack of Clinton affectation. Instead, in private she and director Joe Mantello imagine a candidate of equal parts exasperation and careworn determination. She wears an old patterned jacket and trackpants; in the hotel room, she paces, she challenges, she interrogates, she won't let go.
This is no drag act or cod-impersonation; Metcalf and Lithgow are playing characters called Hillary and Bill. Mark Penn (Zak Orth) is ‘Mark,’ and Peter Francis James is ‘Barack.’ There are no wigs or pant suits, or tried-on voices.
In his notes for the play, Hnath says: “Do not play for easy recognition. Don’t imitate. Don’t even try to cast actors who look like these people. Instead, imagine that the audience watching this play has never heard of the Clintons or Obama and that this is an opportunity to create these characters anew.”
All the actors do as instructed; Metcalf’s Hillary is a candidate of many weathers, which Metcalf skillfully commandeers: variously intelligent, morose, angry, despairing, determined, and resigned. But the play also feels as airless as the hotel room we are in; it cannot tell us anything new, so what can it make up and still maintain its marriage to reality?
Performers “interpreting those roles must invent the sound of the characters, the look of the characters, the physical movement of the characters, and they must base their interpretations entirely on the text and its dramatic requirements,” writes Hnath.
“Treat this play in the same way. Play the text and not the persona that exists outside of the text so that you may elevate these characters beyond a facile tabloid reality.”
The company follows his set of instructions to the rule, but it’s intriguing for Hnath to scorn “facile tabloid reality” when this play, on one level at least, is a piece of gleefully imagined voyeurism. It does not interrogate Hillary Clinton’s policies, it focuses almost entirely on the nature of her marriage to Bill and her failures and strengths as a human being. It is very personal. It is all about her as person, not her manifesto. Hillary and Clinton may be on stage, but it has a distinctly tabloid instinct itself.
The hotel room is really four white walls, not padded but resembling its own psychiatric holding facility. There is a swivel chair and mini-bar in it; throughout the 90 minutes of the play clothes, cans, and wrappers fall to the floor.
The character called Hillary is also a narrator of a kind, taking us into the room after first contemplating “the infinite number of planet earths” out there in space. In the hotel room, candidate Hillary considers how abysmally she is doing, just days before the New Hampshire primary; Metcalf evoking both the seasoned player and aggrieved victim of voter spurning. This Hillary knows she would be a good president; just what is people’s problem with her.
Mark will do all he can to help her except ask Bill Clinton to join the campaign. A neat little directing tweak occurs in the next split second: the sight of Bill’s head; he’s come to join his wife on her request.
Lithgow’s Bill is a withdrawn schlub, a seen-it done-it languid ex-president of leisure. He has, in no particular order: stomach pains, concerns he has been cursed by a witch doctor, is upset he was banished by his wife, and puzzled as to why she wants to see him.
Another lovely moment happens when they go to hug, and touch foreheads, then awkwardly maneuver into a hug that actually becomes what the best hug should be: loving, and a salve. “She wakes some mornings to whatever new controversy there is and wonders if a twin Hillary has been up at night undoing all her good work”
But this amity doesn’t last. She notes his selfishness, how everything is about him (as he kvetches that Obama has copied his ideas). She was there for him, now he should be at her beck and call. He notes her apparent coldness, and that people “vote on emotion,” which she scorns. “You’re better than everyone, and you act like it all the time, and it makes people feel like shit,” he tells her.
All her life, people have been judging her emotional response to things, including his sexual indiscretions, as appropriate or not, a weary Hillary notes. She can do no right. She wakes some mornings to whatever new controversy there is and wonders if a twin Hillary has been up at night undoing all her good work.
Hnaf imagines Hillary rationalizing people’s dislike of her as because they believe she stayed with Bill because she wanted a career in politics herself. The theory is left hanging.
Act Two begins with a snap of Metcalf’s fingers; no usual stage segues here. It’s two days later. Some more ripped-from-the-headlines zingers fly. Bill tells Mark no one will remember what a lobbyist did; Mark tells Bill when they remember Clinton, they’ll remember him for his sex scandals.
By now, Hillary has been deemed to have shown ‘natural’ emotion—tears—at a public event, and Lithgow as Bill is in a pair of reveal-nearly-everything running shorts. She has won New Hampshire, but the power she feels is a self-deluded illusion, which becomes immediately clear in her meeting with Obama, where she tries and fails to flex her political muscles.
Hnath imagines Obama having dynamite information on Bill Clinton's charity finances as his own ace.
The play ends as it began with an observation of the universe, and the possibilities of that universe offering, in one configuration somewhere else out there, the chance of victory as well as many other outcomes.
This copout ending may be one for the still-grieving Hillary voters. However, Hillary and Clinton is ultimately a play about the minting of a loser. It doesn’t prize one theory above another in its analysis of Hillary Clinton. Was her political loss in 2008 her fault for not seeing herself in relation to the voters? Or the voters' fault for not seeing Clinton for all she was?
Metcalf shows a person who knows her capabilities and strengths, who feels she has not been able to fully show them in the public realm, and who feels she is being prevented from using them in the office she feels so well suited for. This restrained play may not tell us anything new, but it imagines a moment of personal history sympathetically. It is more frustrated lament than mischievous post-game analysis.
Socrates
Tim Blake Nelson’s play Socrates , running at the Public Theater to May 26 , is extremely long, and feels extremely long. It is, proudly and unapologetically, a play of ideas; so if you want a long bath in those, buy a ticket. It is ideas’ night, my friends, a philosophy-palooza. On a very spare stage, a mainly male cast evoke the life of the great philosopher, whose struggle to speak what moral truths he believed to be true cost him his life.
The political forces that seek to silence him have markedly Trumpian-era echoes; references to corrupt leaderships of Ancient Greece bought many groans of recognition at the performance this critic saw.
Thank goodness in this arid, almost three-hour brainbox-joust, Michael Stuhlbarg is in the title role. He gives human shape to all the intellectual huff-puffery, and some emotional scaffolding to the weighty thinkiness of the play. His fury is both a roar and also precise. “He treats both sets of people almost the same—as saps who wither under his fierce, and always right, moral argument. And this a play of arguments, rather than character”
Teagle F. Bougere plays a very gentle Plato, narrating events to Niall Cunningham's ‘Boy,’ who does a phenomenal job of looking very interested. Other actors play characters and rulers Socrates either counts as acolytes or enemies. He treats both sets of people almost the same—as saps who wither under his fierce, and always right, moral argument. And this a play of arguments, rather than character.
Miriam A. Hyman's as Xanthippe, Socrates' wife, was apparently the only person when Socrates was alive to challenge him to behave like an ordinary human for the sake of his family. Socrates declines to do so. (In this play she also appears to be the only woman in Ancient Greece.) By the end of this epically long intellectual pummeling, conducted in dusky half-light, the time comes for Socrates to drink his hemlock—and then one of the most painful-looking death scenes on the New York stage this spring.

The Mueller report answers lots of questions but leaves one big one lingering: Why were so many Russians so eager to ingratiate themselves with Trump World?
The report is in one sense a story of meetings, pitches, and introductions that were entertained but ultimately unfulfilled. “In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offers” of Russian help, “while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away,"" the report says. In any case, no one broke the law with a criminal conspiracy.
Special counsel Robert Mueller reaffirmed the intelligence community’s conclusions that the Russian government directed an online campaign of hacking and trolling to help Donald Trump in 2016. What’s less clear are the intentions of the many Russians who reached out to the Trump campaign offline and whether they were well-connected covert emissaries of the Kremlin or just hucksters trying to latch onto the coattails of a potential president.
Parsing the motivations of the various Russian supplicants is difficult in part because many of them were a mirror image of their counterparts in Trump World: D-listers in their own political hierarchy for whom the line between state policy and personal gain is unclear.
In previous court filings and in the special counsel’s final report, prosecutors wrote that the FBI believes Konstantin Kilimnik , a former partner in Paul Manafort’s consulting business in Ukraine who had worked for the Soviet army as a translator in the 1980s, has “ties to Russian intelligence.” Kilimnik held a Russian diplomatic passport as recently as 1997, and a number of his former associates relayed their belief that the dual Russian-Ukrainian national was, at least at some point, a spy.
Kilimnik, the report reveals, received not just a single briefing from Manafort on Trump campaign polling and messaging strategy in August 2016 but continuous updates via text messages from Manafort’s aide Rick Gates . In turn, Kilimnik passed along a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort himself recognized as a “backdoor” to recognizing Russia’s de facto annexation of rebel-held parts of the country.
Prosecutors concluded they could “not reliably determine” why Manafort passed along the polling data. Viewed in one light, it certainly can appear as though Kilimnik, a former intelligence officer, was a mere cutout for Manafort to pass Trump campaign information to the Russian government. But prosecutors couldn’t determine what Kilimnik did with the information, and both Manafort and Gates suggested an alternate explanation for the exchange: money.
Manafort had run afoul of Oleg Deripaska , a wealthy Russian oligarch, when an investment fund he tanked lost Deripaska millions and prompted a lawsuit. The report says Manafort had been trying to get back in his good graces ever since he’d taken a job at the Trump campaign. At the Aug. 2, 2016, meeting where Manafort had raised polling and fielded a peace plan, he also discussed the possibility that Deripaska could drop the lawsuit filed after the collapse of the investment fund. Kilimnik, in that sense, was Manafort’s way to kiss up to Deripaska again.
Deripaska’s deep pockets and litigiousness may have drawn Manafort’s focus, but he’s more than just a money man. The Trump administration sanctioned him in 2018 for acting as a representative of the Russian government. His aide, Victor Boyarkin , who the report says ferried messages to Manafort via Kilimnik, is a former GRU officer whom the Treasury Department sanctioned for “providing Russian financial support to a Montenegrin political party ahead of Montenegro’s 2016 elections” shortly before Russia allegedly tried to pull off a coup in the country.
Deripaska’s interest in Manafort may have not been just money either. In January 2017, the report says Manafort traveled to Madrid to meet a Deripaska aide and discuss “recreating [the] old friendship” between the two men but also “global politics.” Manafort sent an email to Trump’s incoming deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland , when he got back to the U.S. three days later about “important information” he had picked up “on my travels over the last month.” Manafort claimed it was about Cuba; the special counsel’s office couldn’t say whether that was true. In any case, no one appears to have followed up.
Not all of the Russians pitching the Trump campaign had sinister backgrounds in the spy world.
When the special counsel’s office charged Michael Cohen with lying to Congress, it offered the tantalizing detail that he had met with someone who promised “ political synergy ” from the Russian government and the ability to set up a meeting with President Vladimir Putin and then candidate Trump. Stripped of his anonymity, synergy man seems a far less impressive operator. Mueller’s final report identifies him as Dmitry Klokov, the director of public relations for a Russian electrical transmission company who had once been a spokesperson for a former Russian energy minister. If he could’ve set up a Putin meeting, he didn’t try very hard—Cohen dumped him after a few phone calls.
Or Natalia Veselnitskaya , the lawyer at the center of the infamous Trump Tower meeting in 2016. The Trump side of that meeting’s intentions were obvious enough from Donald Trump Jr.’s exclamation of “I love it” when Veselnitskaya claimed that she had dirt on the Clintons compliments of the Russian government.
Her hints at government sources have since been borne out by an indictment in New York that alleges that she lied about ghostwriting correspondence for Russian officials to send to their American counterparts. And her clients—wealthy Russians who’ve had money seized on corruption charges—have interests that dovetail directly with one of Moscow’s most pressing foreign policy priorities: the removal of sanctions against Russian nationals and companies. So was she representing her clients at that meeting or the broader interests of the Kremlin? Mueller doesn’t say, but the bait she offered—unsupported allegations about money laundering she couldn’t connect to Hillary Clinton—was far short of tempting."

Donald Trump’s ardent defenders had a new line of defense after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s hotly anticipated report came out on Thursday, detailing the president’s repeated attempts to interfere in the probe.
A whole lot of lines, actually.
The report still exonerated the president, they stressed, but it was also laden with errors, if not outright lies—particularly the parts about estranged Trump ex-fixer Michael Cohen. And even if those claims were correct, that wouldn’t matter, since he never actually managed to obstruct anything—and even if he had obstructed something, he would have been well within his rights. Oh, and in the end, it was all Barack Obama’s fault .
Though Mueller ultimately punted on answering that question, his 400-plus-page report detailed 10 episodes in which the president appeared to meddle with the Mueller’s probe. And though the report noted it “did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government,” investigators did establish “multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government.”
But prominent members of Team Trump shrugged that off on Thursday. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway called it “the best day since he got elected.” Not too far from the West Wing, Trump’s outside legal team—which set up shop for the big day at the offices of the American Center for Law & Justice —also declared victory and defended Trump’s behavior.
“There are a lot of disputes about recollection, and how [different] people saw things, but so what? It didn’t happen,” said Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, regarding obstruction of justice allegations. “He didn’t do it, [even though] he had every right to fire Mueller—as long as he replaced Mueller with someone else, and as long as he didn’t do it with coercion, or anything like that… If it’s done with an innocent motive, meaning you’re doing your job and getting rid of someone who’s a bad FBI director [ like James Comey ] or a bad special counsel…you’re allowed to do it.” “Nothing was hidden, burned, destroyed, thrown away by the president. So it’s very tough to conclude that someone committed obstruction.” — Rudy Giuliani
Giuliani, reiterating his belief in Trump’s innocence, added, “Nothing was hidden, burned, destroyed, thrown away by the president. So it’s very tough to conclude that someone committed obstruction [and] Mueller couldn’t do it… They couldn’t [even] cobble together a charge.”
This was merely part of the latest Trumpworld attempt to barrel through a crisis that has plagued this president for almost two years. By the end of this week, everyone in Trump’s inner sanctum had a similar refrain: The boss isn’t guilty, but even if he had done it, it wouldn’t be illegal.
Well before the Mueller report was made public, and before Attorney General William Barr delivered his remarks to the press on Thursday, Giuliani knew what was coming. Jay Sekulow, another one of Trump’s personal attorneys, confirmed to The Daily Beast on Thursday morning that he, Giuliani, and Jane and Martin Raskin (all members of the president’s outside legal team) were welcomed into the Department of Justice to view a version of Mueller’s report ahead of its release—on Tuesday late afternoon, and again on Wednesday. Sekulow said the team had “put in a formal request” late last week, which Barr approved.
To Trump’s current and former lawyers, however, Mueller’s report isn’t simply exonerating—it’s also problematic.
“For example, half of what they attribute to [Trump’s former fixer and lawyer Michael] Cohen is lies,” Giuliani alleged, going after one of his recurring enemies . “I don’t know why they even put in a Cohen section. A lot of that report is extremely unfair.”
John Dowd , an attorney who represented Trump for nearly a year in the 21-month-long investigation, took exception to one of his cameos in the report. In late 2017, after the president’s fired national security adviser Michael Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement and started cooperating with investigators, “the President’s personal counsel” left a voicemail for Flynn’s lawyers “reminding them of the President’s warm feelings towards Flynn,” according to the report.
On this message, the unnamed counsel—who appears to be Dowd—asked for a “heads up” if Flynn knew any “information that implicates the President,” the report reads. When Flynn’s lawyer responded that Flynn could no longer share that kind of information, “the President's personal counsel was indignant and vocal in his disagreement,” according to the Mueller report. Trump’s “personal counsel said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn’s actions reflected ‘hostility’ towards the President.”
“There was no hostility on my part,” Dowd said on Thursday. “We understood that they had a strong case and thought that they could talk the [special counsel] out of any charges. We didn’t understand there’d be any charges. And I first learned about the Joint Defense conclusion in the press. I called him and that was it. I did not get upset, nor was I upset. I was supporting Gen. Flynn.”
Regarding the Mueller report’s characterization of his tone and intent, Dowd replied, “That’s not true. That’s false.” Trump’s former attorney also insisted that Mueller’s team “never raised [this subject] with me and I saw [Mueller’s colleague] Jim Quarles every week and Bob Mueller once a month.”
Conway, for her part, trumpeted Mueller’s findings as a pure vindication of the president and those around him, even as she attempted to dismiss findings that could be politically tricky for the president, or give lie to the administration’s previous public statements on the matter.
Asked by reporters about Mueller’s findings that Trump tried, on numerous occasions, to hinder the Special Counsel’s investigation, Conway shot back, “that’s punditry, that’s not sophisticated legal analysis.” She added that she was “using my very expensive law degree today.”
And while many of Trump’s prospective 2020 Democratic opponents have been hesitant to harp on the Russia issue on the campaign trail, Trump’s counselor nevertheless took the opportunity to ding the Democratic presidential field with the special counsel’s findings.
“You have 15, 18 people running for president and not a single message doesn't involve Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump,” Conway said.
“The Democrats have nothing,” she added. “They banked everything on this.”
Heading into the holiday weekend, President Trump jetted off to Mar-a-Lago, his private Florida getaway, to mark Easter and keep celebrating. “‘Donald Trump was being framed, he fought back. That is not Obstruction,’” the president tweeted on the way to his club, live-tweeting a comment made on Fox News by Trump-loving host Jesse Watters. “I had the right to end the whole Witch Hunt if I wanted. I could have fired everyone, including Mueller, if I wanted. I chose not to. I had the RIGHT to use Executive Privilege. I didn’t!”
As Trump closed out his Thursday, he appeared both in a good spirits and focused on cable news. According to one of his personal attorneys, that’s exactly how he began his Thursday, as well.
Giuliani told The Daily Beast that both he and Sekulow spoke by phone to the president twice on Thursday, shortly before and then after the report’s release. Trump was in a “great mood,” per Giuliani, and both lawyers briefed the president on which TV news programs—on CNN, on Fox—they would appear on through Easter Sunday.
“We always tell him what shows we’re going to be doing,” he said."
Mueller Report: Julian Assange Smeared Seth Rich to Cover for Russians,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-report-julian-assange-smeared-seth-rich-to-cover-for-russians,"LIES Mueller Report: Assange Smeared Seth Rich to Cover for Russians Julian Assange repeatedly blamed Seth Rich, the murdered DNC staffer, for Russia’s leaks. The Mueller report shows that Assange was lying from the start. 04.18.19 8:57 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photo by Getty
Julian Assange not only knew that a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer wasn’t his source for thousands of hacked party emails, he was in active contact with his real sources in Russia’s GRU months after Seth Rich’s death. At the same time he was publicly working to shift blame onto the slain staffer “to obscure the source of the materials he was releasing,” Special Counsel Robert Mueller asserts in his final report on Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election.
“After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking,” the report reads. “According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. congressman that the DNC hack was an ‘inside job,’ and purported to have ‘physical proof’ that Russians did not give materials to Assange.”
Thursday’s long-anticipated release adds new details about Assange’s interactions with the officers in Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate. Still, it leaves one question unanswered: Why was Assange so determined to exonerate the Russian intelligence agents who gave him the material?
As laid out by Mueller, Assange’s involvement in Russia’s election interference began with a June 14, 2016 direct message to WikiLeaks’ Twitter account from “DC Leaks,” one of the false fronts created by the Russians to launder their hacked material.
“You announced your organization was preparing to publish more Hillary's emails,” the message read, according to Mueller’s report. “We are ready to support you. We have some sensitive information too, in particular, her financial documents. Let's do it together. What do you think about publishing our info at the same moment? Thank you.”
A week later, WikiLeaks reached out to a second GRU persona, Guccifer 2.0, and pitched WikiLeaks as the best outlet for the hacked material. On July 14, 2016, GRU officers used a Guccifer 2.0 email address to send WikiLeaks an encrypted one-gigabyte file named “wk dnc link I .txt.gpg.” Assange confirmed receipt, and on July 22 he published 20,000 DNC emails stolen during the GRU’s breach.
By then, it was no secret where the documents came from. The computer security firm CrowdStrike had already published its technical report on the DNC breach, which laid out a trail leading directly to Moscow and the GRU. Analysts at ThreatConnect independently presented evidence that Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks were fictional creations of that agency.
But rather than refuse to comment on his sources, as he’s done in other cases, Assange used his platform to deny that he got the material from Russians, and make statements at an alternative theory. On August 9, 2016, WikiLeaks’ Twitter feed announced a $20,000 reward for “information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.”
For some, the cryptic tweet was their first introduction to a grim and fantastical conspiracy theory rooted in a real-life tragedy that occurred the early morning of July 10, 2016 on a Washington DC sidewalk.
Rich was a 27-year-old DNC staffer when he was gunned down in what police have described as a robbery gone wrong. The unsolved murder timed shortly before Assange’s DNC leaks spoke volumes to inhabitants of the far right wing fringe, where it’s long been an article of faith that Hillary Clinton has her enemies killed.
Assange fanned the flames even higher on August 25, 2016, when he was asked in a television interview, ""Why are you so interested in Seth Rich's killer?""
""We're very interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged Wikileaks sources,” Assange answered. “If there's someone who's potentially connected to our publication, and that person has been murdered in suspicious circumstances, it doesn't necessarily mean that the two are connected. But it is a very serious matter .. that type of allegation is very serious, as it's taken very seriously by us.""
Assange never came out and said it, but his “ statements about Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails,” Mueller notes.
With Assange behind it, the Seth Rich hoax moved into the almost-mainstream, spawning a quickly-retracted report on Fox News, and a series of “investigations” by Assange ally Sean Hannity . It also wreaked havoc in the lives of Rich’s surviving family, particularly his anguished parents who later begged perpetrators of the charade “to give us peace, and to give law enforcement the time and space to do the investigation they need to solve our son's murder.”
Even as he was ruthlessly framing Rich to protect himself, the GRU, or both, Assange was privately communicating with his real sources to arrange the transfer of the second election leak, material the GRU stole from John Podesta’s Gmail account.
The Mueller report quotes from cryptic emails and messages exchanged between WikiLeaks and the GRU accounts in September 2016, and based on metadata, Mueller suspects the transfer occurred on September 19. But the actual transmittal of the massive Podesta haul evidently took place in a channel that Mueller couldn’t crack. The report notes the possibility that, this time, the files were simply carried into the Ecuadorian Embassy by one of Assange’s visitors.
“Both the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications, which has limited the Office's ability to collect all of the communications between them,” the report notes. “The Office cannot rule out that stolen documents were transferred to WikiLeaks through intermediaries who visited during the summer of 2016.”
In the end, the most charitable interpretation of Assange’s “dissembling” as Mueller calls it, in the Seth Rich hoax is that he genuinely couldn’t rule out the possibility that Rich was his source. The Mueller report demolished that final moral refuge. Rich had been dead four days when Assange received the DNC files.
WikiLeaks reacted to the Mueller report Thursday with a Trump-like tweet claiming vindication. “WikiLeaks has always been confident that this investigation would vindicate our groundbreaking publishing of the 2016 materials which it has,” the group wrote. Adding a cavieth calling for “full transparency” from the Justice Department.
“We disapprove of the large redactions,” WikiLeaks wrote, “which permit conspiracy theories to abound.” READ THIS LIST"
Doctors Finally Figure Out What's Causing the Mysterious AFM Illness Among Kids,www.thedailybeast.com,tanya.basu@thedailybeast.com (Tanya Basu),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/doctors-finally-figure-out-whats-causing-the-mysterious-afm-illness-among-kids,"Breakthrough in Mysterious Polio-Like Illness Paralyzing Kids Six kids in Minnesota provided the crucial turning point. 04.18.19 9:30 PM ET Shutterstock
Federal researchers have confirmed for the first time a frightening polio-like condition that strikes children can be caused by a respiratory infection called enterovirus D68—a step toward unraveling the mystery of the paralyzing illness.
Scientists have long suspected a link between enterovirus and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) but a study published by the Centers for Disease Control on Thursday revealed that doctors had found D68 in an afflicted child’s spinal fluid.
“This is the first true confirmation that we've had,” Dr. Heidi Moline, lead author, told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune .
AFM is a neurological condition that affects the spinal cord’s gray matter and damages nerves and muscle-movement coordination. The symptoms are similar to polio: sudden onset of facial drooping, limb weakness, and an inability to speak.
The disease first came to public attention when it was found in 2014 in Colorado. Cases were eventually confirmed in 120 people in 34 states, and two years later, there were 149 cases occurred in 41 states. In 2018 there were 228 confirmed cases across 41 states.
Researchers believed that either enterovirus D68 or A71, viruses in the same family as polio, were attacking the nervous system, instigating AFM.
In the study published Thursday, a team in Minnesota, working in tandem with the CDC, followed six children, ages 1 through 9, who were hospitalized between Sept.r 19 and Oct. 1 of last year. AFM was confirmed in each.
D68 was found in the spinal fluid of one of the six children, a girl who reportedly lost all motor function and remains in the hospital. The researchers told the Star-Tribune that they presumed D68 is likely the cause of AFM for the other five children in the cluster, one of whom tested positive for D68 on a nasal swab.
Although significant, the research results don’t mean D68 is the sole culprit. Other viruses that have not yet been detected, or something else in the environment, might play a role.
Clearly not every child exposed to D68 develops AFM and researchers have not figured out why some children get it and others in the same environment don’t. Beyond age, the pool of AFM sufferers doesn’t share many characteristics. They live in different places. Some are boys and some are girls. Some have underlying health conditions, while others do not. Some report common cold symptoms while others report more symptoms like headaches and vomiting before the paralysis sets in. READ THIS LIST"

Since taking over the House, Democrats have fended off questions about impeachment using a mantra they returned to again and again: let’s wait for Robert Mueller’s report.
On Thursday, with most of Mueller’s report finally public, Democrats hit the pause button again, saying they want to wait for even more material to emerge—congressional testimony from Mueller, underlying evidence that supports his findings, grand jury information—before fully grappling with the question of impeachment.
The report, a 400-plus page document recounting attempts by President Trump to interfere with the Mueller investigation and details of his team’s comfort with Russia interfering in the 2016 election, sent shockwaves through the broader political and legal universe. But the impact was especially acute within the Democratic Party, where members expressed bewilderment over how the party had not developed a cohesive response to a document they’d been anticipating for nearly two years.
Two veteran House Democratic lawmakers said they were caught off guard when House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) declared that impeachment should not be in the cards. “Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,” the House’s number two Democrat told CNN . “Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgment.”
The majority leader would later walk back his comment. But his initial missive sparked eye rolls on the Hill, where a senior House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast that the majority leader was “clearly off-message.”
Hoyer’s office did not respond to request for further comment. But his dismissal of impeachment seemed geared towards alleviating fears among swing-district freshmen Democrats who would prefer to keep Mueller news off the front page for fear that it will galvanize Trump voters in the lead up to a general election.
But while Hoyer was giving moderates cover, he was leaving progressives in the party alarmed that such a conclusion had been reached on such a weighty matter just hours after the report was published. Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who has invested millions of dollars in a grassroots impeachment movement, said that Mueller’s report represented an implicit test for Democratic leadership.
“Should they choose deliberately not to uphold the Constitution and not to uphold their sworn duty,” he told The Daily Beast, “they [would be] saying we are going against the rule of law. It would be a statement that the rule of law is too much of a pain in the ass to uphold.”
Faced with these dual pressures, most House Democrats were content not to rule out impeachment but to argue, as they have since the Russia investigation began, that more information was needed before making a definitive decision on the matter.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY), whose committee would originate any impeachment proceedings, offered a different vision on Thursday, declaring it was “too early to talk about” impeachment without implicitly ruling it out. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), a member of that committee, said that Mueller’s report provided a “road map” to begin building up a public record that could launch impeachment proceedings. That road map included calling Mueller and Attorney General William Barr to testify, obtaining underlying grand jury material, and holding as many open hearings with witnesses as possible, Lieu said.
“The purpose of this investigation is to decide whether or not we should impeach the president,” Lieu told The Daily Beast. “If we’re going to do it, we have to do it right, and make sure we get all the evidence, that we do the investigation correctly, and then based on what our investigation concludes, we can as a Democratic caucus make a decision at that point.”
“We need to round out the story,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), also a member of the Judiciary Committee. “We have some very tough legal, political, moral and constitutional questions to confront.” Responding to Hoyer’s comments, Raskin said “no one is ignoring the election” but added “all of us have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law, and we can’t run away from that responsibility.”
Obtaining additional information from the special counsel could take months or even years if tied up in the legal system. Nadler has promised to begin the process shortly by issuing a subpoena for the redacted portions of Mueller’s report. But Democratic lawmakers realize that the clock is ticking. Lieu said they should decide by the end of the year if they are going to pursue impeachment or not.
But the cause of impeachment did get some juice on Thursday from one of the Democrats’ most visible members. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) declared on Twitter that Mueller’s findings prompted her to sign onto an impeachment resolution sponsored by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).
“Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment. I didn’t campaign on it, & rarely discuss it unprompted,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez . “But the report squarely puts this on our doorstep.”
“It’s almost impossible for a person to not look seriously at impeachment,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN), another Judiciary Committee member.
Cohen, who has been one of the chief House advocates for articles of impeachment , told The Daily Beast he understood concerns that it could hurt the party politically but “there is still a responsibility for us in Congress to look at it, and I think there’s several of us who have continued to look at it and consider it, even though the politics of it and the likelihood of a conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate is rather dim at the present time.”

Pete Buttigieg to Seth Meyers: Mueller Report Won’t ‘Change Much’ for Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-to-seth-meyers-mueller-report-wont-change-much-for-trump,"MOVING ON Pete Buttigieg to Seth Meyers: Mueller Report Won’t ‘Change Much’ for Trump The 2020 presidential candidate said that ‘if we really want to send Trumpism into the history books, the best thing we can do is defeat it decisively at the ballot box.’ 04.18.19 9:50 PM ET NBC
For all of the damning revelations about President Donald Trump and those who surround him in the long-awaited release of the Mueller report on Thursday, at least one major Democratic presidential candidate doesn’t think it will change the calculus for 2020.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg sat down with Seth Meyers on NBC’s Late Night and appeared to downplay its impact when the host asked him for his initial reactions.
Buttigieg predicted that even though it confirmed “we have a president who acts in a self-serving way” and engaged in behavior that was “at best unethical” and “legally problematic, to put it charitably” that “politically” he doesn’t “think it will change much” for Trump.
“It’s one more reminder that if we really want to send Trumpism into the history books, the best thing we can do is defeat it decisively at the ballot box in 2020,” he added.
As the crowd cheered wildly, Meyers joked, “I’m very good at judging how the audience feels about something and they’re split right down the middle on that one.”
The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who served as a Naval Intelligence Officer, took more offense at the way President Trump has routinely dismissed and disregarded military intelligence while trying to frame himself as a bigger supporter of the military than Democrats are.
“To see the way that intelligence is being politicized, to see the way that military families are being used as props by this president is demoralizing,” Buttigieg said. “And it’s one more reason why it might not be a bad idea to have someone in the White House who actually served.”"
