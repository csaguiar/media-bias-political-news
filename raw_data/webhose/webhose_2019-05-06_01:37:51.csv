You have a right to your opinion, but it is much better for the United States to have friends in the Middle East, because most assuredly if it does not, Russia and/or China will gladly fill the gap. Russia, China, and Iran are intent on expanding the boundaries of their influence, control, and in some cases actual posession of additional lands.
What many isolationists do not realize is: the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are no longer a guarantee of the safety of the United States in the age of intercontinental missiles and hydrogen bombs.
