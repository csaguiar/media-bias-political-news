Senate bills threaten to chill educator speech,www.teachthevote.org,Mark Wiggins,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.teachthevote.org/news/2019/04/02/senate-bills-threaten-to-chill-educator-speech/,"Teach the Vote: Where Texas Educators Find the News that Matters Most Senate bills threaten to chill educator speech Senate State Affairs Committee meeting, April 1, 2019
The Senate State Affairs Committee met Monday, April 1, and considered two bills that present serious concerns about free speech rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — particularly when it comes to educators.
Both bills relate to the use of public funds for political advertising, which is already prohibited by state law. ATPE agrees with the current statutes and ethics rules that prohibit public resources from being used for political purposes. Electioneering on school time and with school resources should be illegal. However, the two bills heard by the committee Monday morning would criminalize behavior that is not only nonpolitical, but in some cases even required under state law. Together, they threaten to undermine all of the positive work the Texas Senate has done for public educators so far this session.
Sen. Pat Fallon (R-Prosper) filed Senate Bill (SB) 1569 , which would dramatically expand the legal definition of electioneering solely as it applies to educators.
Electioneering is currently defined as advocating for or against a candidate, political party, or ballot measure. For example: A communication created on school district time or using school district money in support of Proposition X or Candidate Y clearly constitutes electioneering and an unlawful use of public resources. As filed, SB 1569 would include activity that advocates for or against “a political philosophy” or “a matter of public interest.” Neither term is defined in law or in Sen. Fallon’s bill, and ATPE contends that each phrase is subject to widely varying interpretation. For example, extolling the virtues of American democracy and our free enterprise system could be considered advocating for a “political philosophy” under this bill – despite the fact that both are required elements of Texas public schools’ curriculum. Likewise, a sign on a school bulletin board promoting a food drive for Hurricane Harvey victims could easily be construed as advocating for “a matter of public interest” if SB 1569 were to be enacted.
Perhaps even more troubling, SB 1569 would expand the definition of “political advertising” to include any political communication “directed to an individual person or multiple persons through any form of communication (emphasis added) .” This could treat private conversations between co-workers as political advertising and subject to criminal penalties. As a whole, SB 1569 would impose a separate set of restrictions on the speech of public school employees that is far more expansive than restrictions imposed upon any other category of public employees.
Read ATPE’s written testimony against SB 1569 here .
SB 904 by Sen. Bryan Hughes (R-Mineola) aims to prevent third party organizations from sending political advertising to public e-mail addresses, subjecting the sender to a $100 fine per e-mail. This seemingly straightforward idea is complicated by a number of technical factors. First, most political websites allow a visitor to enter their e-mail address and receive automatic campaign updates. This simple process could potentially be abused, either intentionally or unintentionally through “bots” and e-mail spoofing, to rack up massive fines.
SB 904 also extends prohibitions against political advertising to include the use of public communications systems, including WiFi networks. This could have the absurd effect of criminalizing the act of accessing a campaign website from a personal mobile device while off the clock and sitting in a school parking lot. It could also jeopardize a majority of computer use in the Texas State Capitol, where visitors are offered free public WiFi and politics is a major topic of discussion.
Read ATPE’s written testimony against SB 904 here .
Public resources clearly should not be used for electioneering, but such activity is already expressly prohibited in state law. ATPE believes expanding current law in an attempt to broadly restrict the speech of educators as proposed by SB 904 and SB 1569 is unnecessary, discriminatory, and raises serious concerns about potential violations of the First Amendment. Taken together, these bills would likely have a severe chilling effect on educators’ speech.
We urge you to contact your state senator and ask them to OPPOSE SB 904 and SB 1569. ATPE members can use our simple tools at Advocacy Central to send a message to their legislators about these and other bills."

Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Regional Economic Development Fletcher Tabuteau has announced Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) support to bolster capacity for those working on the frontline of regional economic development.
Up to $200,000 a year of funding per region for up to two years will be made available to organisations in regions eligible for PGF funding, Mr Tabuteau said.
Having capacity funding available to regional economic organisations will address short term capacity issues and give organisations the ability to progress key regional and national economic goals such as job creation and reducing unemployment.
People living and working in our regions already know the opportunities in their patch and work hard every day to capitalise on those opportunities , but need capacity support to accelerate key projects through the PGF.
The funding is open to regional economic development agencies (EDAs) or other groups working in regional economic development, and applications for funding will be subject to standard assessment processes.
This PGF investment is a great example of how our Coalition Government seeks to work, creating an environment which will bring communities on board in shaping the outcomes that affect their place.

10 Issues to Watch in Albany’s Post-Budget Legislative Session,www.gothamgazette.com,Samar Khurshid,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/8419-10-issues-to-watch-in-albany-s-post-budget-legislative-session,"IT news
(photo: governor's office)
Although the state budget approved earlier this week included several progressive priorities for Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state Legislature, there are still three months left in the legislative session this year and a list of remaining items on which the governor and legislators have promised action.
Taking advantage of their party’s newfound control over both houses of the Legislature, Democrats moved a long list of bills already this year, both prior to and in the budget. Though there has been a level of expected divergence on some bills within the legislative chambers, and a more unexpected degree of infighting between the legislative leaders on one hand and the governor on the other, long-sought Democratic priorities have nonetheless advanced, from voting reforms to women’s reproductive rights to gun control and much more.
In a Sunday news conference outlining the details of the budget agreement that included congestion pricing, criminal justice reform and other new policies, Cuomo also laid out some unfinished business for the days ahead including legalizing the adult use of marijuana.
“We have not legalized cannabis, adult use cannabis. The political desire is there, I believe we will get it done,” Cuomo said. The governor had intended to use much of the estimated $300 million in annual revenue that would be raised from taxing marijuana sales to fund the MTA. But the proposal was pulled in different directions and it became apparent a few weeks before the April 1 budget deadline that a deal on all the intricacies of legalization was unlikely.
On the one hand, more conservative legislators and law enforcement officials raised concerns (some unfounded) about public safety, with several county leaders indicating they planned to opt out of allowing sales, and, on the other, lawmakers of color and criminal justice reformers wanted to see both opportunity and revenue go towards communities most impacted by marijuana enforcement. “It is complicated to come up with a program that does it and protects public safety, and does economic empowerment for communities that have paid the price,” Cuomo said. “And the best way to do it was not in the race of the budget.”
He also spoke of a desire to update the so-called public works bill to ensure workers receive a prevailing wage on construction projects receiving state benefits, and reform the state’s rent regulations, which expire in July. Along with marijuana legalization, rent regulations are expected to be the most controversial issues taken up in the remaining session.
In a Tuesday interview on WNYC’s The Brian Lehrer Show, Cuomo in particular addressed reforming the Major Capital Improvements (MCI) law that allows landlords to substantially increase regulated rents after undertaking significant renovations. It is one of a small handful of rent regulations that legislators plan to strengthen -- others include preferential rents, the so-called vacancy bonus, and vacancy decontrol.
“That’s going to be I think a great reform for tenants and I believe we’ll get more than people have ever gotten before,” Cuomo said of MCI changes, “because it wasn’t just the real estate lobby, but there was a reluctance to deal with the details of how these laws actually work and we now have three months to focus just on these laws because we got so much done in the budget.”
On MCIs, Cuomo indicated what has become a popular Democratic position that even some in real estate see as potentially tenable: that landlords should be able to pass along some of the costs of improvements to tenants, but not necessarily in perpetuity. Some legislators want to abolish the MCI program altogether, though others, as well as real estate representatives, warn that could lead landlords to drastically limit investments in their buildings.
Cuomo also included several other priorities in his executive budget proposal that weren’t included in the adopted budget and could potentially be addressed in the next few months. He floated a proposal to allow municipalities to legalize the use of electronic scooters and bicycles, which criminal justice reform and immigration advocates in New York City are particularly eager to see approved. The city has been cracking down on e-bikes -- which are regularly used by restaurant delivery workers who are often immigrants -- and the City Council has been awaiting authorization from the state to legalize them.
The governor has also proposed ending the state’s ban on paid surrogacy and just last week urged lawmakers to act. “It is unconscionable that people need to leave the state to have a child due to New York State's antiquated surrogacy laws,” he said in a statement. But surrogacy was not legalized in the budget.
Though there has been little discussion of legislation favorable to charter schools -- which have stronger allies in the Republican Party but also enjoy support from Cuomo and some Democrats -- there is a possibility that the state could look at expanding the cap on the number of charters in New York City, a threshold that was met for the first time this year.
In the Assembly, Speaker Carl Heastie said Tuesday that his chamber would be “laser focused” on rent regulation, though he did not say whether it would take priority over marijuana legalization. “I don’t wanna say what’s bigger than the other but I think there’s 20-something years worth of history with rent regulations that I think has to be spoken about, talked about and fixed,” he told reporters outside his office, according to audio provided by a spokesperson. “So I’d say it’s going to be a huge, major focus of ours.”
He also said “there’s support within the conference to do universal rent control. In the Assembly we don’t just wanna seem like we care about the tenants in New York City...We want to protect tenants all across the state.”
Two significant proposals that gained little traction, outside of advocacy circles, prior to the budget were the New York Health Act and the Climate and Community Protection Act.
The NYHA, led by Assemblymember Richard Gottfried and Senator Gustavo Rivera, would establish a single-payer health care system in the state. Cuomo has supported the principle, but insists that it should be federally funded rather than putting the state’s finances in jeopardy. It remains to be seen if the bill will gain any momentum in the three remaining months of session. Supporters rallied for it on Tuesday in Albany, trying to establish it as a key priority for the next several weeks. It’s unclear if either Democratic majority in the Legislature has the stomach for pursuing the policy and forcing a broader conversation on what would make for a major overhaul of health care and insurance in the state, as well as the state tax code.
The CCPA is a roadmap to moving the state economy towards entirely renewable energy and creating jobs in the process, akin to a version of the Green New Deal being championed by national progressive Democrats. But Cuomo proposed his own version of “New York's Green New Deal,” which was a somewhat less aggressive alternative proposal that only dealt with the energy sector. Neither moved towards passage before the budget and will likely be a matter of discussion as the post-budget session moves ahead.
One aspect of the budget agreement that left government reform advocates particularly disappointed was the omission of any new anti-corruption measures targeted specifically at the state’s scandal-ridden economic development programs. The budget included funding for a “database of deals” that will purportedly outline projects receiving state assistance, but did not include statutory language about the structure of the database, which will apparently be at the discretion of the Cuomo administration and its Empire State Development.
The governor also agreed to administratively restore the state comptroller’s authority to pre-audit contracts handed out by SUNY and CUNY affiliates, rather than give it legislative power.
Heastie said Tuesday that those two measures could end up in statute, something legislators have been threatening for years. “I think that we did agree that on ethics we wanted to engage in three-way conversation so I think those discussions will happen in the second half as well,” he said, echoing comments he’s made in the past.

In February, the Assembly and Senate held the first joint hearing in decades on workplace sexual harassment, hearing from several women who had experienced harassment when employed by former state lawmakers. The women testified to the inadequate protections against harassment in state law and insisted that the Legislature must work to improve them, as well as the broader culture in Albany.
Both Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins have said they support holding additional hearings that could potentially take place in the next few months and set the stage for further legislative action. The former legislative aides, some of whom have formed the Sexual Harassment Working Group, have a set of proposals to strengthen the state’s anti-harassment laws, and there are several legislators who appear ready to work with the advocates to advance those priorities, which would apply to both the public and privates sectors, as did anti-harassment laws passed last year.
Ineffective state response to sexual harassment in part points to the oft-maligned Joint Commission on Public Ethics (JCOPE), which victims have said is incapable of appropriately handling sexual harassment complaints against those in government. JCOPE has also been criticized as lacking independence from the very officials it is supposed to investigate, leading to calls -- and legislation -- to replace the commission with a new body. It’s unclear if there will be any momentum in the coming months to explore that option or a host of other reform bills, some proposed by Cuomo, like extending the Freedom of Information Law to the Legislature.

The 82-year-old rarely appeared in public after a stroke in 2013. Nacerdine Zebar / Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned Tuesday after weeks of mass protests against his 20-year rule.
The move accelerated his promise earlier this week to resign before the end of his term on April 28. It followed a demand on Tuesday from the country's military chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Gaid Salah, that Bouteflika be declared unfit for office immediately.
""This decision is triggered by my eagerness to prevent that the verbal excesses that unintentionally mark the situation turn into potentially dangerous drifts, and for the protection of persons and property which is the main prerogatives of the State,"" he wrote in a letter released by state-owned Algeria Press Service.
Hundreds reportedly took to the streets of the capital Algiers in celebration, blaring car horns and waving flags.
Persistent protests began after the 82-year-old Bouteflika announced plans in February to seek a fifth term. He then reversed that decision but had delayed new elections.
Since suffering a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public and has been represented by a portrait at public events.
Under the country's constitution, the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Abdelkader Bensalah, will run the country as interim leader for a maximum of 90 days until new elections are held, France 24 reports. The news site reports that 76-year-old Bensalah has been a Bouteflika loyalist and has taken Bouteflika's place at public events. Bensalah has been leader of the upper house since 2002.
Bouteflika had appointed a caretaker government on Sunday, consisting of 27 ministers and headed by Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui, another ally of Bouteflika.
But demonstrations are likely to continue as protesters reject any continuation of a government that bears the influence of Bouteflika and his allies.
""We will have a 100 percent democratic transition, this is very important,"" one man, Selmaoui Seddik, reportedly told Reuters . ""We need to remove the whole previous regime and that is the hardest thing.""
Protests have notably been peaceful in contrast to other demonstrations against longtime leaders of the Middle East and North Africa.
A group of political elites, business leaders and military officials known as le pouvior has effectively managed the country behind the scenes for years, according to analysts. Bouteflika's party, the National Liberation Front, has ruled the country since gaining independence from France in 1962. Copyright 2019 NPR.

Transparent Wood That Stores and Releases Heat Created by Scientists,www.newsweek.com,Hannah Osborne,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/transparent-wood-stores-releases-heat-1384442,"Scientists have created transparent wood that can absorb and release heat. This wood could one day be used in the construction industry to make eco-friendly buildings, researchers presenting their findings at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Spring 2019 National Meeting & Exposition said.
In 2016, a team led by Lars Berglund from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm announced it had developed a type of transparent wood . The research team removed a component from the cell walls of balsa wood that absorbs light and then incorporated acrylic into the wood to make it transparent. Like most woods, it could bear heavy loads, making it a promising material for construction.
“Wood is a renewable and abundant material that has been used for centuries as building material,” Céline Montanari, a researcher on the project, told Newsweek . “It has many advantages, including excellent mechanical performance, low density and excellent thermal insulation properties when compared with glass.
“However, it cannot be used as light-transmitting material as it is. In a perspective of reducing artificial lighting in buildings and developing new functional wood-based material, we chemically modified wood to make it transparent without losing the mechanical properties. This suggests that it can be used for light-transmitting structures, such as windows, with the advantage of being much more insulating than glass.”
Building on this research, the team then set out to improve the performance of the wood so it could absorb and emit heat—allowing it to save costs on energy if it were to be used as a building material. To do this they added polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the wood they had previously developed.
PEG is a compound that melts when it reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit, storing energy in the process. By adding it to the wood, the team was able to boost its energy efficiency. If a house were built from the wood, it would mean that on a sunny day the material would absorb heat, keeping it cool inside. At night, this heat could then be released indoors, meaning a constant temperature could be maintained.
“In this work, we not only managed to make the wood transparent so it can transmit light, but we also added an extra functionality: heat storage,” Montanari said. “This means that this transparent wood is multifunctional and fulfilled to high-demanding functions in the building sector: Transparency to reduce artificial lighting, and heat storage to reduce energy losses.
Laboratory image showing transparent wood. American Chemical Society “Transparent wood is already a great insulating material when compared with glass. However, in order to reduce the energy consumption even more we added a material that can absorb and store heat inside the wood when outdoor temperature is high, and that can release it later on when the outdoor temperature decreases.”
This, she said, would allow for considerable energy savings as the wood would act as a “thermal battery” to store heat that could be redistributed later when it is needed. “Transparent wood has the advantage of transmitting light but it is also very hazy,"" she added. ""This means that it diffuses light very well and enables privacy to be kept—such as in frosted windows where glass and plastic are used today. So in a house fully built of transparent wood, you would have a very nice natural lighting in all the rooms with maintained privacy.”
Scientists involved in the research, funded by the Wallenberg Foundations and the European Research Council, are now working to scale up the production process in the hope of making it commercially viable. “We have a patent on transparent wood, which is owned by an industrial company and they are working on industrialization aspects and technology obstacles,” Montanari said.
The material has the potential to be more environmentally friendly than materials like concrete and plastic. Both the wood and the PEG are biodegradable—the acrylic currently used to reduce light-scattering could potentially be replaced with another polymer, Berglund said in a statement.
“From an environmental perspective it is important to increase the use of materials coming from renewable resources and reduce the use of materials made from limited resources, which also contribute to CO2 emissions,” Montanari said. “Wood is the most used bio-based material in the building sector and we show with the development of transparent wood that new applications of wood-based materials are still emerging. Research related to wood is under fast development internationally, and there will be promising renewable solutions in the future that can be applied in the building sector.”

The government and Parliament cannot agree how to proceed with Brexit. For some, the solution is for the government to prorogue Parliament and implement its Withdrawal Agreement without the confidence of the Commons. David Howarth argues that given the Fixed Term Parliament Act means a general election will not necessarily follow from such a loss of confidence, a new government formed by MPs from across the Commons is a viable option. Picture: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor , via Parliamentary Copyright
A basic rule of the British constitution is that governments are not allowed to govern unless they retain the confidence of the House of Commons. We can have interim governments that are not, to use an old term, ‘responsible’ governments, that is governments in which the Commons has confidence, but only responsible governments can exercise the full range of governmental powers.
But more recently, in response to moves by the Commons to give itself more time to debate Brexit, several commentators, including a former very senior civil servant and two Oxford professors , have suggested an additional principle: that Parliament only exists if it retains the confidence of the government.
They say that if the government believes that the Commons acts in ways to which the government objects (acting ‘unconstitutionally’, to use their language, though in their scheme the government alone decides what is ‘unconstitutional’), the government can neuter the Commons. They say, for example, that the Prime Minister can ask the Queen to veto bills passed by Parliament or even, according to Professor John Finnis, suspend Parliament completely by asking the Queen to ‘prorogue’ it, that is to end the current session of Parliament and deliberately to delay starting the next one.
The idea that Parliament needs the government’s confidence is startling, but it is not completely unfounded. Our system requires the existence of responsible government and for responsible government to be re-established quickly when an existing government fails. Before the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, following a precedent of 1784, prime ministers who lost the confidence of the House were normally entitled to a dissolution of Parliament and a general election, the point of calling the election being to re-establish responsible government in a new House of Commons.
But the Fixed Term Parliaments Act removes the government’s entitlement to an election, putting the power to call elections into the hands of the Commons itself. And so now, the only route for quickly re-establishing responsible government when an existing government fails, and Parliament is unwilling to call an election, is for the government to resign and for a new government to be formed without an election .
The current situation is unsatisfactory precisely because Theresa May’s government has in reality lost the confidence of the House, but no one seems willing to recognise it. The fact that we are even talking about a prime minister asking the Queen to veto a bill illustrates the point. A prime minister who asked for the exercise of the veto would by that very act be acknowledging that she had lost the confidence of the House.
And yet the government struggles on, hoping that the next vote will re-establish its control. Perhaps it will. But in the meantime, the system is in limbo, with a government that is not responsible pretending to be a responsible government.
It cannot be right for a government whose own legitimacy is in doubt to be allowed to look for new ways to undermine the Commons. That would be a denial of parliamentary democracy. Moreover, the ways suggested for carrying it out bring the Queen into politics and threaten constitutional monarchy. Most of all, these manoeuvres leave the problem of the lack of responsible government entirely untouched. Closing down Parliament cannot count as a way of establishing that the government has the confidence of the House of Commons.
The constitutional way out of the problem, if Parliament is not willing to call an election (and, politically, that would be entirely understandable) is to form a new government drawing majority support from across the House. That is why MPs have already started to talk about a government of national unity. These MPs understand the constitution better than any number of former civil servants and Oxford professors.

"'Native Son' Is Reborn, In 'Still Kind Of The Same America'",www.gpb.org,Mandalit del Barco,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/native-son-reborn-still-kind-same-america,"By Mandalit del Barco • 17 minutes ago Ashton Sanders plays main character Bigger Thomas in the new film adaptation of Native Son , the Richard Wright novel. HBO Listening... /
In the classic 1940 novel Native Son , 20-year-old Bigger Thomas dreams of a life beyond his impoverished Chicago neighborhood.
As in the book, the new Native Son movie begins with Bigger killing a huge rat in his house, where he lives with his siblings and their single mother. His troubles accelerate after he gets hired as a driver for the Daltons, a wealthy white family.
But this time, the story is set in contemporary times. The new retelling of Richard Wright 's novel debuts on HBO this Saturday, April 6. Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks wrote the screenplay. And the adaptation was directed by artist Rashid Johnson.
Ashton Sanders, who was in the Oscar-winning movie Moonlight , plays Bigger. In this version, he sports green hair and a graffiti-covered leather jacket. On set, Sanders explained Bigger is into both punk music and Beethoven.
""Along with the pressures of being a black man in this America, he's also dealing with the pressures of being this other other in America — being this Afro-punk and dealing with his circumstances and his environment,"" Sanders says.
Bigger is tasked with driving Mr. Dalton's wild-child daughter Mary (Margaret Qualley). Mary rebels against her privilege and impetuously tries to connect with Bigger. Mr. Dalton (Bill Camp) may fancy himself as a liberal, but Mary and her boyfriend Jan (Nick Robinson) fashion themselves as political radicals.
At the movie's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, writer Suzan-Lori Parks talked about how she updated their story.
""In the original novel, Jan was a member of the Communist Party,"" Parks says. ""So the Communist Party these days is not the same kind of party as it was back in the day. So immediately I said: Well we've got some parties that are also relevant, like Occupy or the anti-fascist movement, that a young person might want to join in that might cause some consternation in the hearts and minds of progressive wealthy parents.""
There are a few other changes. In Wright's bestselling novel, Bigger was a rapist and a murderer — portrayed as a victim or product of his environment.
That characterization has been controversial. Novelist James Baldwin once wrote a critique: In his 1955 book Notes of a Native Son , Baldwin blasted Bigger's portrayal as stereotypical and unsympathetic.
But Native Son remains popular. Over the years, it's been adapted for stage, and also made into a movie twice. Author Richard Wright himself played Bigger Thomas in the 1951 movie. ( Here he is doing his screen test .)
The character Bigger Thomas still resonates, says Ashton Sanders.
""It's always been rough for a black man living in America,"" Sanders says. ""You know, there's always pressures that are put on us. You know, I feel like the black man walks around with an anxiety because of the way that America views him, the world views him, you know? And so yeah, it's still very relevant, because this is still kind of the same America."" Rashid Johnson directs Ashton Sanders and Nick Robinson on set. Thomas Hank Willis / HBO
At his film's Sundance premiere, director Rashid Johnson explains why he thinks Wright's book is timely.
""His story Native Son — however divisive — is an incredibly complicated telling of how we're to examine some aspects of the black psyche,"" Johnson says.
Johnson also examines the black psyche in his artwork, which has been shown at major museums and galleries around the world. Just before he took off to direct Native Son , he had an art opening at the David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles.
It was a packed house and featured live music, poetry, paintings and sculpture. His work explores cultural identity and race. He mixes media: shea butter, potted plants, stacks of books, vinyl records.
Visitor Kidogo Kennedy pondered one of Johnson's recurring images , a square, black skull scribbled with big, swirly eyes.
""It reminds me: This is Bigger,"" she says. ""That's who I'm looking at when I look at these grimaces and eyes that are bulging. I think of him, I think of Native Son , I think of Bigger.""
A few weeks later, Johnson was on location in Cleveland, Ohio shooting Native Son . Before the cameras rolled on one scene, he spray-painted a similar skull image on a brick wall — one iteration of the characters he calls Anxious Men.
""I just kind of put it in the background,"" he says. ""I think this film has quite a bit of moments of anxiety, and alludes to the idea of anxiety and how it functions in our characters, as well as in society as a whole.""
On the wall of an alley for another scene, Johnson spray-painted the word ""Run"" — another theme he uses in his artwork.
""The idea of escape has been thematically a big part of my practice,"" he says. ""And so it also lives in this film, as far as how Bigger is negotiating with what he's done. And the idea of running and escape I think are also strong themes that live in this film and in my work simultaneously.""
That is, he put a little bit of himself into the film.
""I think it's hard not to,"" he says.
Johnson's 7-year-old son Julius makes a cameo in one scene. And gallery owner David Kordansky plays a record store owner in the film.
Johnson has made short films before, for commissions at the Guggenheim and the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow. But Native Son is his debut as a feature film director.
""This dialogue, this is not easy, this part,"" he says. He quotes one of Bigger's lines from the screenplay. ""Thank God I am not acting in this movie.""
Still, Rashid Johnson seems at ease directing the actors — quite the opposite of an anxious man.

"Afternoon Ethics Warm-Up, April 2, 2019: Maddow, Schultz, Pugh, Fosse, AOC, And All That Jazz…",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/02/afternoon-ethics-warm-up-april-2-2019-maddow-schultz-pugh-fosse-aoc-and-all-that-jazz/,"/ Jack Marshall Good afternoon!
1. If anyone cared, this would do in Rachel Maddow. The fact that so many of my otherwise intelligent and reasonable liberal friends insist that Rachel Maddow is God’d gift to journalism was a mystery to me when she first brought her perpetual smirk to MSNBC. It perplexed me greatly as she so obviously hyped and twisted her commentary, and once she became the #1 Russia-Trump conspiracy theorist on TV, I admit that I have lost the edge of respect for anyone who still watches her. Rachel Maddow bottomed out, I’d say, yesterday, when she was saying this last week:
“It’s hard to believe that they’d leave the newly appointed Attorney General William Barr to himself to personally pick through the [Mueller] report to try to figure out which mentions in this 400-page report might pertain to an open case”They wouldn’t leave that to Barr to do that. Mueller would have done that!
Mueller’s team would have done that as part of producing anything that they handed over outside their own offices. They’ve done that with every other document they have produced in the course of this investigation. You’d assume they’d be able to do that for this document too. But William Barr says, [exaggerated sigh] it’s taking him a really long time because he’s having to do all that himself.”
While was saying that it was suspicious that Barr wouldn’t seek Mueller’s assistance with the redactions, the chyron underneath her read,
“Barr: Special Counsel Is Assisting with Redactions”
Unlike the much-mocked Fox News gaffe, in which the talking heads were correctly reciting the story while the chyron said that Trump was pulling aid from “three Mexican countries “, this time the chyron was right, and the talking head was wrong. It might just be me, but I’d rather the actual reporters to be telling the truth, and graphics be messed up.
2. Well, that’s one more old white guy who won’t be President. This morning I heard Howard Schultz, the Starbucks CEO purporting to be running for President as an Independent, say that he absolutely believed that controlling illegal immigration at the border was essential, but that he believed that the issue of illegal immigration was more than just law but “humanity,” and that immigration was what made America great. Huh. So that’s what an independent is, is it: A candidate that advocates all sides of a controversial issue simultaneously?
As if that wasn’t enough, Schultz, whom I had never heard speak before, has all the charisma of Steve Forbes.
3. What this struggling, racially divided city needs is a corrupt African American mayor! Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, whose self-dealing prompted Gov. Larry Hogan to call for criminal investigation,, announced Monday that she will take an indefinite leave of absence because of her, ah, cough, cough, (eye roll) health . She had been revealed to have negotiated a no-bid deal with the University of Maryland Medical System to purchase self-published books she had authored featuring a young girl named Healthy Holly, aimed at promoting exercise and good diet. Under the deal with the medical system, UMMS, which included Pugh on its board, paid the mayor $500,000 for copies of the books, $100,000 in each of five transactions in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2018, buying 20,000 copies at $5 per book. to be fair, she wasn’t the only crook on the board: nine members of the 30-person UMMS board had contracts or other business deals with the medical system.
The Democratic mayor’s office issued a statement yesterday:
“With the mayor’s health deteriorating, she feels as though she is unable to fulfill her obligations as mayor of Baltimore city.To that end, Mayor Pugh will be taking an indefinite leave of absence to recuperate from this serious illness.”
The statement did not address the scandal over the books, which I’m sure had nothing to do with the mayor’s decision. By not resigning but only going on “indefinite leave,” Pugh gets to keep receiving her salary. 4. Even New York Times features are fake news now. In a piece headlined, “ ‘Fosse/Verdon’ Has Magic to Do. And Undo,” the New York Times explains that finally, the true story of how iconic Broadway choreographer Bob Fosse abused everyone in his life and himself: “[Verdon’s] inclusion…suggests a narrative informed by the #MeToo movement, a way to reframe the myth of the lone male auteur, of the man who behaves badly, but still, my God, those steps. If “Fosse/Verdon” succeeds, it could inform how we now tell stories about men like Fosse. Assuming we should tell these stories at all. Because if Fosse was a great man, he wasn’t necessarily a good one. He had genius, he had charm, but coercion and scapegoating colored his rehearsals, and he rarely met a chorus girl he didn’t try to bed. (Would he take no for answer? More or less. But his seductions often constituted an ugly abuse of power.)”
Hmmmm. ..that story sounds like one I saw in a movie once. What was it? It’s right in the tip of my tongue– oh yeah! The movie was called “All That Jazz,” which won four Oscars in 1980 while also being nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, and it was written and directed by Fosse himself as a brutal, self-damning indictment of his miserable conduct. Wouldn’t you think that a puff piece about a new series covering exactly the same ground with exactly the same intention might mention, for those not up on their theater history, that this has been done before, and not only that, that the film was an all-time classic that had the added authority of being made by the very man it was eviscerating? Even more bizarre is the fact that the Times piece refers to the film once without saying what it was, and in another place, includes the sentence, ” [Fosse’s} addictions — pills, sex, all that jazz — were legion.”
What is this, a game? Blue’s Clues?The idea is to mislead readers into thinking the series covers new ground when it isn’t, but to leave little hints for those in the know?

"The Absurd Media, Feminist And Progressive Hypocrisy Regarding Joe Biden’s Sexual Misconduct, PART II: “The View” Weighs In",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/02/the-absurd-media-feminist-and-progressive-hypocrisy-regarding-joe-bidens-sexual-misconduct-part-ii-the-view-weighs-in/,"(Part I is here.) Some additional observations: Jazz Shaw and other conservative pundits are writing that Joe’s handsy act “isn’t sexual harassment.” Wrong. If it was unwelcome, it was sexual harassment, and even if it wasn’t and made others in Joe’s workplace proximity uncomfortable, that was “third party” sexual harassment. To his credit, CNN’s Jake Tapper reached down deep and accessed his recently slumbering common sense and integrity to correctly point out that other men who behave in the same way would get “reprimanded” or “potentially even fired” from their jobs. Shaw and others are also harping on the timing of the harassment allegations. Are they politically motivated? Sure they are, just as Anita Hill’s sudden realization that she had been harassed after more than a decade was politically motivated; just as the sudden appearance of women claiming Donald Trump harassed them coincidentally occurred while he was running for President. In a word—well, two— so what? Biden belongs to a party that has taken a strict liability, no-tolerance, “believe all women” stance following the #Me Too eruption. He knew it, and progressives with eyes knew that Biden was a serial toucher/hugger/groper/nuzzler/sniffer/fondler. Given their professed position, it was hypocritical that Joe got away with his Dirty Uncle bit for so long, and arrogant (or stupid—it’s Biden, remember) that he thought he could get away with it forever. My head had a serious aftershock when the enabler and apologists for Joe settled on the “that’s just the way he is”; “he doesn’t mean anything by it”, and “he’s a decent man” talking points. KABOOM!
See, there’s another one; even writing about this is dangerous.
If “that’s just the way he is,” then what he is is a serial sexual harasser. “He didn’t mean anything by it” has been a lamer than lame rationalization for misconduct and criminal activity since the Madison administration, usually to excuse the mentally challenged. Finally, if he keeps fondling/touching/sniffing/nuzzling/ and kissing when all of his political kith are shouting to the skies about men being sexual predators, he’s not decent. Like the late George H.W. Bush, who told young women with his grasp that his favorite magician was “David Cop-a-Feel,” he’s willing to use his position and status to abuse women. Finally, if this brace on the top of my head holds, let me annotate the beyond moronic comments made on “The View” yesterday, as the ladies lined up in support of Biden: Whoopi Goldberg : “Listen, in the old days we would call Joe—some folks of a certain age would say he’s overly familiar.” Yeah, and in the old days, you might be Scarlet O’Hara’s mammy. See, you idiot, we learn things over time, and what was considered Ok “in the old days” isn’t any more. I can’t believe Whoopi said this. Whoopi: “But it would have been nice if she turned to him and say, ‘You know what, I don’t really like this. Please don’t do this, Mr. Vice President. I’m not comfortable with this.’ Something, because he’s standing right there.” Because it’s so easy to tell the Vice President of the United States, “Take your hands off of me; you’re creeping me out.” Or to tell the President of the United States, “Yuck! No way I’m giving you a blowjob!” This is the power inequality factor that feminists used to emphasize, until they decided that Bill Clinton’s support of abortion rights was more important than opposing workplace predators. Joy Behar : “It’s a long way from smelling your hair to grabbing your hoo-ha… I don’t think it rises to the point we’ve been listening to like Harvey Weinstein and the rest of these people. “ BOY , Joy is a cretin! Naturally, she gravitates to the worst rationalization of all, #22, “There are worse things” Come to think of it Joy, raping a woman is worse than grabbing her hoo-ha, and, you know, gang-raping her is worse than raping her…and certainly killing her, cutting her up into pieces and feeding her to the aquarium is worse than just gang raping her. You make America dumber every time you open your mouth. Behar: “..he’s so friendly. He’s a close talker. He comes right up into your face, and you’re thinking I hope my breath is good. Or more important I hope he is. He talks close, he touches. That’s what he’s like. I feel it would be unfortunate if we got rid of everybody who’s an affectionate kind of person. Those are nice people too.” The work place, and in high office, are not appropriate places to show “affection,” you stupid, stupid, woman . Sexual predators are “friendly;” abusive bosses think they are just being “friendly.” Being friendly for real means not imposing your will on those with less power than you. Abby Huntsman: “I always wonder when these things come out, what is the motive for this person? Is it simply to let people know, I was uncomfortable, which you could have done in private? Or is it because you want someone else to win and you want him to have doubts about announcing or the presidency?” If the wrongful conduct can be proven, the motives of the victim reporting it is 100% irrelevant to the accountability of the author of the conduct. Huntsman: I’ve had concerns about the #MeToo movement from the beginning about getting to this place where you can’t have normal interactions with each other. You must be talking to Joy too much. See those photos above? Those are not “normal interactions” except to a man who thinks that he has the right to touch any women he wants to. Huntsman: “Are we going to get to a place where we can’t shake hands or hug each other? I worry about that.” Shaking hands and hugging are not equivalent: nice straw man. “Hugging” without consent is called “copping a feel.”"

"The Absurd Media, Feminist And Progressive Hypocrisy Regarding Joe Biden’s Sexual Misconduct, PART I: Why My Head Exploded",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/02/the-absurd-media-feminist-and-progressive-hypocrisy-regarding-joe-bidens-sexual-misconduct-part-i/,"And by the way, KABOOM! This made my head explode.
Fans and supporters of Joe Biden were shocked–SHOCKED!–that anyone would accuse nice old Joe of non-consensual sexual touching and sexual harassment. Conservatives aren’t any better: so eager are they to discredit the whole concept of “believe all women” and sexual harassment — ah, for those good old days when bosses could chase their comely secretaries around the desk, secure in the knowledge that Miss Buxley would regard it as good clean fun and part of her job! —that they are making idiotic comparisons between the unethical Democratic smearing of Brett Kavanaugh and what has befallen Biden. There is no comparison. The accusations against Kavanaugh was based on uncorroborated, decades old alleged conduct while he was a high school student; the two accusations (so far) against Biden are workplace-related, took place not only when he was an adult but when he was Vice-President.
How can anyone be shocked, or even surprised, much less indignant? Biden has been engaging in unconsented to touching, kissing, and groping of women repeatedly, for decades, in front of cameras . Who knows what Biden has done when no photographers were around? He has corroborated the accusations against him all by himself.
There is no excuse for this. Biden isn’t deaf, dumb and blind; he knows about sexual harassment, and how it works. He’s been given a pass by his party, its supposedly victim-sensitive supporters, and the news media, just like Bill Clinton was for so long, but that doesn’t mean he can’t read. Nor is there any excuse for the Democrats and progressives who are lining up to defend Biden for what is, at this point, indefensible.
The utter idiocy of the Left exclaiming “Sexual harassment? What sexual harassment?” after Weinstein, Lauer, Keiller, Lasseter, Kozinski, Levine, O’Reilly, Ailes, Franken, Singer, Moonves, Farenthold, Conyers, Rose, and so, so many others is hard to overstate. Some of these individuals engaged in far worse conduct than Biden, but some engaged in very similar conduct. We have been talking about #MeToo for more than a year; sexual harassment law has been out there for decades, and what Biden did, and does, was a textbook no-no then.
Another reason the Left’s sympathy for Joe made my head explode is that his situation is not just sort-of but exactly what I tried to explain to NPR audiences in 2017 before I was rudely shut down (because, they felt, I was mitigating the alleged harassing conduct of President Trump). I explained that a young man of power and influence who is attractive to women often develops the habit of aggressive flirtatious conduct because he received positive reinforcement from the women he subjects to it, even though it is not consensual. This is especially true of people like Biden and Trump, who reached adolescence in the Fifties.
These habits persist, but times change, and worse, they change: middle-aged and senior Trump and Biden are no longer so likely to have their advances appreciated by women who now see themselves as victims, not flattered objects of affection. The targets of these powerful men may public eschew complaints because of the men’s position and perceived power for years, and may even decide that, in retrospect, what they thought was harmless or even “welcome” at the time is unwelcome now. They now say they were harassed. And they were. The simple fact is that such workplace conduct as touching, hugging, kissing, sniffing, nuzzling and groping was always inappropriate. The workplace is not a singles bar. This shouldn’t be hard.
Readers here know that I predicted months ago that Biden’s history of inappropriate conduct with women (and even female children) ensured that he would never be the Democratic nominee in 2020, that Democrats, especially after the Kavanaugh debacle, had trapped themselves into nominating a woman, no matter how awful their female options are, and they are awful indeed. This forecast didn’t require any special acumen; it just required paying attention. The fact that Biden, and his advisors, and his supporters, and my Facebook friends, didn’t see all of this coming tells us something, and what it tells us is alarming and sad. Either the public, and worse, the news media, are inexplicably ignorant about sexual harassment, or they feel free to use it as a weapon against those they oppose, and excuse it, or ignore it, when the harasser is sufficiently useful.

"Naked Teacher Principle, The Selfie Variation",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/02/the-naked-teacher-principle-selfie-variation/,"/ Jack Marshall Pure as the driven snow! Especially if her breasts really look that THAT…
The Naked Teacher Principle (NTP ) states that a secondary school teacher or administrator (or other role model for children) who allows pictures of himself or herself to be widely publicized, as on the web, showing the teacher naked or engaging in sexually provocative poses, cannot complain when he or she is dismissed by the school as a result.
Ah, would that it were always this simple! In the past, we have had to deal with the “naked teacher who paints with his butt and naughty bits on camera with a bag over his head” principle, for example. Another teacher got fired when the naked photos of herself she had on her own tablet inadvertently was sent to the students in her class.
Now, from Long Island comes the saga of a middle school teacher—in NTP scenarios, they are the worst kind—who was fired last week when an old topless selfie that she sent to a former boyfriend ended up in the in the hands of a student
Lauren Miranda, the 25-year-old Bellport Middle School math teacher is suing, claiming that she was wrongfully dismissed for not being a proper school role model. In many of the stories in the press, “role model” is in quotes. Does the news media now dispute that teachers are supposed to be role models? If teachers aren’t role models for kids, what are they?
Miranda said the image was obtained without her consent–I’ll buy that — and that there was nothing “inherently offensive” about the image anyway. The issue isn’t whether in the abstract a naked female form is offensive, but whether a female teacher’s early adolescent students should think of their teacher as a sex object.
“It’s pure,” Miranda said of her bare-breasted selfie. Oh! If that’s true, why don’t you use it as your official photo on the school website?
Miranda doesn’t seem too bright, and her lawyer is stretching like an aerobics instructor. They contend that a male teacher would not have been subjected to the same treatment in similar circumstances. Well, there’s precedent on that, and they are just flat-out wrong. They may recall, or should, that in their very own sate, a rising national legislator lost his job for sending a crotch-shot selfie to an object of his desire. Elected officials are also supposed to be role models, or should I say, “role models.”
I don’t know what kind of contract she signed, and I don’t know how Long Island’s school labor rules work. What I know is that it isn’t that difficult, if one is in a position that involves being thought of by kids in one’s charge as a dignified, responsible adult that parents can reasonably feel is trustworthy, to avoid this problem: don’t send nude selfies. How hard is that? It is also prudent, as this scenario proves. Don’t send naked pictures of yourself, even “pure” ones, to anyone, and you won’t have to sound like an idiot later when you say, “Gee, I have no idea how that picture ended up in the hands 12-year-old Frankie, who drooled all over it.” Share this:"

Jenifer McKim / New England Center for Investigative Reporting Listen Listening... /
Jacqueline Davis walked into the Bronx's housing court hoping to stop her landlord from evicting her from the one-bedroom apartment she has lived in for nearly 30 years.
The 74-year-old retiree says her landlord moved to kick her out after she deducted part of her rent when a pipe burst and the ceiling collapsed, damaging her kitchen.
Worried about becoming homeless, Davis unexpectedly found some good news in the crowded hallways of New York City's busiest housing court, where more than 80,000 eviction proceedings were filed last fiscal year.
She's one of a growing number of residents in the city who qualify for a first-in-the-nation program to provide free legal services to low-income tenants facing eviction.
""I think it's great,"" Davis said. ""We had no legal representation before, and now you have someone to speak for you.""
The right to counsel program, signed into law in 2017, is meant to address the legal disparity in a city where historically only one in 10 tenants in housing court had a lawyer, while most landlords had legal representation. The program has become a model for other cities and states trying to limit displacement and homelessness amid rising rents and advancing gentrification.
San Francisco and Newark , N.J., have passed similar legislation over the past year. Now lawmakers in Massachusetts , Connecticut and Minnesota are considering statewide proposals to provide free attorneys to struggling renters.
A recent study by the Community Service Society of New York found that evictions declined more than five times faster in ZIP codes where the right to counsel law was in effect than in ZIP codes where the law was not. Loading...

The interest comes amid what some call an ""eviction epidemic"" — nearly 900,000 households across the U.S. were evicted in 2016, according to data provided by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Advocates argue that tenants facing eviction are ill-prepared to defend themselves in court, while the stakes are high — recovering from an eviction can be insurmountable.
""The right to counsel for tenants facing eviction is the biggest step forward in access to justice in a generation,"" said New York Law School professor Andrew Scherer. ""It's really the next frontier.""
Scherer said he grew convinced about the need while working as a young legal aid attorney in New York City in the late 1970s and witnessing how tenants who received legal help often were able to stay at home. He said the initiative advances legal rights given to defendants in criminal proceedings more than 50 years ago by the Supreme Court .
The New York City legislation was the result of a years-long push from tenant organizers and other community leaders that was launched by a Bronx-based advocacy group, Community Action for Safe Apartments. Randy Dillard, a 63-year-old retired brick mason, said he pushed for the campaign after fighting to save his own home a few years earlier. He has now been to court to make sure the program is working.
""The fantastic part is to see the expression on the tenant's face when they realize they are going to receive a lawyer,"" Dillard said.
The program is being phased in over five years. Steven Banks, commissioner of the New York City Department of Social Services, said 30 percent of tenants facing eviction now have lawyers and all eligible tenants should be receiving help by 2022.
By then the city will be paying $155 million a year to fund the program – a cost, Banks said, is worth it to reduce homelessness. Already, he said, the city has seen a drop in evictions — with 84 percent of households represented by lawyers in the last fiscal year able to stay in their homes.
""It's a dramatic expansion and a sea change in the way that the housing court has operated,"" Banks said. Thirty percent of New York City tenants facing eviction now have lawyers, and all eligible tenants should be receiving help by 2022, says Department of Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks.

Jean Schneider, supervising judge for the New York City Housing Court, supports the change. She said judges have long struggled to help tenants without attorneys defend themselves — with limited success. The influx of tenant lawyers has changed court culture, she said. ""I think all of us may respond differently by the fact that we have a level playing field with lawyers on both sides,"" she said.
Not everybody is convinced. Mitch Posilkin, counsel for the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents New York City landlords, said the benefits of the law are overblown. He attributes a multiyear drop in evictions to an influx of New York City funding to struggling tenants to cover housing arrears.
""Even with the best attorney, the housing court is going to be faced with the ultimate question of does the tenant have the money to pay the rent or not,"" he said.
Others argue that money is just one part of the equation. Davis said she deducted money from her rent only after her ceiling collapsed. A representative of the landlord could not be reached for comment.
The round-faced, soft-spoken senior said her landlord would not accept the partial rent and instead is pushing her to move out. After going to court, she was connected to attorney Sarah Joy Faliks of Bronx Legal Services.
Faliks said Davis' case is all too common: Tenants with homes in disrepair don't know their legal rights and are forced to pay money they don't owe or are forced out by landlords. Faliks plans to push the landlord to give Davis back money for damages and dismiss the eviction.
Davis is relieved to get the help. ""I hope they don't evict me"" she said. ""I want to live my last years in a nice, quiet apartment with heat and hot water.""

What Else Could Robert Mueller's Report Reveal About Trump And Russia?,www.gpb.org,Philip Ewing,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/what-else-could-robert-muellers-report-reveal-about-trump-and-russia,"By Philip Ewing • 1 hour ago President Trump arrives for a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on March 28, 2019.

The headline findings by special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a political shot in the arm for President Trump and Republicans, they say — how long it lasts may depend on the full document.
Attorney General William Barr told Congress that Mueller's office didn't establish a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and the Russian interference in the 2016 election , nor did it establish — per Barr — that Trump obstructed justice.
That's based on Barr's four-page letter about the report to Congress . The full document is nearly 400 pages, he wrote , and likely contains a great deal more detail about the findings and assessments made by Mueller and his office.
Barr's office is working now to redact grand jury testimony, foreign intelligence and other material from the full Mueller report before releasing it sometime this month.
Here are some of the big questions it may answer.
What did Trump know?
Trump's campaign and business had many contacts with Russians from 2015 through the 2016 election — these are not in dispute and they were among the reasons for the investigation in the first place.
Mueller, in fact — according to Barr — confirmed that ""Russian-affiliated individuals"" made ""multiple offers"" to ""assist the Trump campaign,"" which comports with the versions of events given in court documents and according to other official sources that already are public.
Did the substance of any of these offers ever reach Trump or other members of his brain trust? If so, what did they do?
Micromanagement
People who worked for Trump have said nothing happened in his business or campaign without his involvement. Donald Trump Jr. attends a fashion show during New York Fashion Week on February 13, 2019, in New York City. Theo Wargo / Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows
That's why, for example, former Trump aides have said they thought it likely he was at least aware that Donald Trump Jr. convened a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 at which a Russian delegation delivered a tip on Democrats.
Trump Jr. said it wasn't what he expected and he didn't pursue it any further, and authorities evidently did not conclude it broke the law.
No one faced criminal charges in connection with that meeting and the Justice Department says Mueller hasn't recommended any more indictments beyond the ones that already have been unsealed.
And Trump has denied he was aware in 2016 of the Russian interference in the election and of the Trump Tower meeting specifically. Democratic opponents said they thought phone records might undermine that denial, but they didn't .
If Mueller's full report further bolsters the Trumps' defenses, that will mean more good political news for the president and his family.
If Mueller's report established that Trump did know what was happening and, while he didn't conspire with Russia's efforts, he also didn't report them to authorities, that may take away some of the political momentum Trump and the GOP have built up so far from the Barr account of Mueller's findings.
What did the feds establish about the dossier?
The unverified Russia dossier was not the origin of the Russia investigation, but it may be the most infamous piece of information about it. NPR has not detailed its claims because they are unverified.
The degree to which Mueller's full report specifically addresses the material in the dossier could be one of its most important developments for the politics of the post-Mueller era.
If the full report torpedoes the dossier altogether, that will strengthen efforts like those by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who wants an investigation into how the FBI and Justice Department used it in the Russia investigation.
If Mueller substantiates some of the dossier's contents, that could create problems for the White House short of the worst-case ""collusion"" allegation that evidently now is off the table.

For example, one claim of the dossier was that powerful Russians may possess compromising material — or so-called kompromat — about Trump and that may have been why he took such sympathetic tone toward Moscow — for fear of it being revealed.
Trump himself has dismissed that idea and said — for example, at his summit in Finland with Russian President Vladimir Putin — that if any such material about him existed, it would have become public by now.
Democrats on the House intelligence committee wrote last year that certain aspects of the dossier have been corroborated — although the details about which aspects were redacted.
Democrats also continue to ask whether Trump may be beholden to Russia or compromised by people in it — and whether that might be true even if, per Barr's letter, Trump's 2016 campaign didn't collude with the election interference.
Mueller's findings about this could change the understanding of the Russia imbroglio yet again.
What did Trump ask, and of whom, involving the various investigations?
Alleged obstruction of justice was a potent threat to Trump because frustrating an investigation is illegal even when there was no underlying crime.
That was another reason why Trump and Republicans welcomed Barr's letter about Mueller's findings so warmly.
And it's one reason why Democrats reacted so strongly to Barr's characterization of Mueller's findings, of which the attorney general wrote : "" 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.' ""
In short, Barr made it sound as though this came down to a judgment call. Barr and Rosenstein, according to the attorney general, were the ones who concluded that Mueller's findings were insufficient to establish that Trump had committed a crime.
So what were those findings?
A number of press reports suggested Trump asked people — intelligence agency leaders, Justice Department or law enforcement officials and White House officials — to take actions that critics called obstruction of justice.
Trump's alleged actions included requests for investigators to ease up on him or friends, for people to be fired or removed — or for safe loyalists to placed onto cases — and for people to give inaccurate information to Congress.

Were those reports accurate? And if so, how much of the assessment depends on the president's exact words?
Former FBI Director James Comey , for example, told the Senate intelligence committee that Trump said ""I hope you can let this go,"" when alluding to the case of former national security adviser Mike Flynn. Trump, in this telling, did not say: I hereby order you to discontinue your investigation of Flynn.
Trump, as his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen told the House oversight committee , often speaks in a ""code."" Mueller's report may reveal how much the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute on obstruction depended on the substance of his actions and how much on his use of that ""code.""
What were the extent of the active measures?
Two of the ways Russia interfered in the 2016 election have gotten most of the attention:
First, the social media agitation wrought by an office of trolls who sought to amplify divisions among Americans. Second, the use of cyberattacks to steal and release information embarrassing to political targets within the United States.
But there was more to the Russian attack on the 2016 election. Intelligence officers, for example, also launched cyberattacks against state election systems that sought to study them and, in at least one case , extracted information about voters.

How many other types of ""active measures"" did the Russians wield in service of their aim to sow chaos and, eventually, help support Trump? Are there any types of interference that haven't been made public?
Mueller's answers about the tools Russia used to interfere in the last presidential election will help Americans prepare to safeguard future elections.
What were the origins of the active measures?
The U.S. intelligence community assessed early on that Putin had ordered the influence campaign ""to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.""
""Active measures"" are as old as statecraft , but the 2016 campaign represented an unusual spike, one that caught American officials off guard.
What more is known about when, precisely, Putin decided to launch it — and why? Who involved chose the techniques — and why?
Americans have learned a great deal from Mueller's prosecutions about the operational workings of the Kremlin's active measures effort — the movement of the troops in what amounted to a war of information.
What's less clear, for now, were the actions of their generals. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

Arkansas Men Arrested for Taking Turns Shooting Each Other While Wearing Bulletproof Vest After Drinking,www.newsweek.com,Jason Murdock,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/charles-eugene-ferris-christopher-hicks-rogers-arkansas-bulletproof-vest-1384395,"On 4/3/19 at 5:29 AM EDT Share U.S. crime
Two men were arrested in Arkansas this week after allegedly taking turns shooting each other while wearing a bulletproof vest, a police report has said.
Charles Eugene Ferris, age 50, and Christopher Hicks, age 36, were detained on Monday after the incident, which took place on Sunday and left one neighbor alarmed. Details of the case were inside an arrest affidavit obtained by the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette .
According to the affidavit, a deputy with the Benton County Sheriff's Office first interviewed Ferris after he was admitted to hospital late Sunday night. The man reportedly had a red spot on his upper chest but tried to concoct an elaborate cover story for the injury, police said.
As reported by 5News (KFSM-TV), Ferris claimed an “asset” had paid him $200 for protection. He said the pair met another man at around 10 p.m. and ended up in a gunfight.
The 50-year-old told the deputy he was hit multiple times but returned shots and fled in a car. He said he was taken to the hospital by the so-called asset. Later, he admitted making up the tale in an attempt to protect his friend, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Leslie Ferris, the man’s wife, had a different recollection of events. She told police that he had been drinking outside their home with his neighbor Hicks when gunfire erupted. The couple’s residence is located in Rogers, a city in Benton County.
When confronted by investigators, the husband changed his story. According to the affidavit, he confirmed they were drinking and playing with a bullet-resistant vest. After asking Hicks to shoot him, he was hit in the chest with a .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle, leaving the mark.
Local media outlet KARK-TV reported Ferris asserted that he had been left “pissed” about the injury and then ""unloaded the clip"" into Hicks, who by this stage was wearing the vest. The friend was struck five times in the back. Luckily none of the bullets pierced the material.
One local neighbor told 5News he was concerned about his children, who live nearby. “I have three kids, two of them still live at home here… right next to them. They shoot as many as 50 to 100 rounds at a time. I just want to make sure it's not just left hanging, no charges.”
""There has to be something done about it. If nothing is done it could escalate into someone getting seriously injured. Maybe somebody that is not on their property,"" he added.
Both Ferris and Hicks were arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault, a Class D felony which carries a potential penalty of six years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000, 5News reported.
No formal charges have been filed and the pair were released yesterday on $5,000 bond. The two men are currently scheduled to appear in a Benton County court for a hearing at 8 a.m. on May 13, according to local media outlets.

Everyone has a traffic horror story that’s come with a high cost—a missed meeting, family dinner, or the Little League opening pitch. These are the moments and memories that are lost as we sit imprisoned in our vehicles. Today, the biggest obstacle that stands between us and the places we work, live and play is thousands of miles of crumbling roads, highways and bridges that are creating bottlenecks and gridlock.
The problem has reached a tipping point. Just last month, chunks of falling concrete struck cars traveling under bridges in California and Massachusetts. We are no longer facing a future highway maintenance crisis. We’re living it. In nearly 53 percent of the highway fatalities, the condition of the roadway contributed. Every day we fail to invest, we’re putting more lives at risk.
In February, the American Transportation Research Institute released its annual list of top 100 bottlenecks in the country that rob us all of time and money. Time wasted sitting in traffic – rather than at work or with our families – has skyrocketed. The typical commuter spends 42 hours each year sitting in traffic, and motorists now pay an annual average of $1,600 in vehicle repairs, wasted gas and lost time – all as a result of our failing infrastructure. The trucking industry loses 1.2 billion hours of productivity every year because of traffic congestion, which is the equivalent of 425,000 truck drivers sitting idle for an entire year. That adds $74.5 billion in additional operating costs to the nation’s supply chain – costs that ultimately reach the end consumer.
Fortunately, our leaders in Washington appear to be inching toward cooperation to fix the problem as House Democrats and the Republican administration have each signaled a desire to find common ground on this issue. To get there we need an innovative solution. America’s truckers believe that our nation’s roads and bridges should be paid for by the users that travel on them every day. While trucks make up just 4% of the vehicles on our nation’s highways, trucking already pays for nearly half of the Highway Trust Fund — and we’re willing to pay more. That’s why we have proposed the Build America Fund : a five-cent-per-gallon user fee added on to all transportation fuels each year for four years, including diesel, gasoline and natural gas.
The fee will be applied at the wholesale terminal rack, before the retail gas pump, and indexed to inflation and improvements in fuel efficiency. The business community, including the trucking industry, will shoulder a large share of the $340 billion that the plan would generate.
The Build America Fund is the most fiscally conservative proposal, costing less than .01 cent on the dollar to administer. This is new and real revenue for our nation’s roads and bridges, not fake funding like toll roads, which cost up to .35 cents a dollar for tolling schemes — the very definition of highway robbery. User fees have seen broad support in the past. President Reagan twice increased the user fee, which was supported by Democrats and Republicans, organized labor and the business community, as the best way to invest in roads and bridges. Today, user fees are seeing support from governors in Ohio, Michigan and Alabama and multiple other states in legislation to help shore up their own infrastructure needs.
The immediate revenue generated from this fund comes at a critical time, as multiple indicators are pointing to a softening of the U.S. economy. This problem will only be exacerbated if our deteriorating infrastructure prevents us from moving goods quickly and efficiently. Investment now is essential to sustaining economic growth in the coming years.
Too often, lawmakers get caught up in the politics, pay-fors and big price tags of fixing our infrastructure, but they often forget the human toll and the wasted time and money that are being bled every day on the roads. Let’s end the nightmare that Americans are living through and put them on the road to a better future.

I wish climate change wasn’t real. A melting Arctic creates a more permissive environment for Russia and China to seize territory. Mass migrations of climate refugees erode borders and nations, creating a global playground for terrorists and traffickers. My Florida neighbors are still rebuilding their lives after devastating hurricanes.
The reality of climate change is a stupid thing to argue about. How we respond, however, hasn’t been afforded enough debate.
Congress’ most famous (and most powerful) new member has drafted a Green New Deal. It’s not an action plan — it’s the scope of what she believes Washington should control. Goodbye to cars, cows, airplanes, and buildings. Hello $93 trillion in new spending — excessive, considering our nation already runs trillion-dollar annual deficits against a $21 trillion national debt.
The GND embraces regulation as its organizing principle, but America’s regulations are far less sought-after than our innovations and expertise. More regulations mean we will export pollution-causing jobs overseas, without reducing pollution. The GND would destroy America’s economy, without reducing global emissions.
Despite this, the GND shouldn’t scare anyone, because it will never happen. In the Senate, even the GND’s own sponsors couldn’t bring themselves to vote yes on it.
What America needs is a Green Real Deal — a strategy linked to legislative proposals that can gain broad, bipartisan support. Climate change is too big for one political party to solve alone. We must address it as a nation, rather than lecture from the ivory towers of our own piety.
Let’s start by modernizing our electric grid. The American Society of Civil Engineers graded our grid D+ . Today’s grid cannot accommodate fluctuation in capacity, utilization, and availability of our existing renewable portfolio — much less an expanded use of renewables. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory argues that today’s renewable energy technology, coupled with upgraded grid technology, could result in renewable energy meeting 80 percent of America’s energy needs by 2050.
To unlock the potential of American innovation, grid upgrades will facilitate “ net metering ,” which allows property owners, shopping centers, hospitals, and schools to sell energy they create back to the grid. This creates incentives for corporations to maximize renewable energy production and allows homeowners to lower or eliminate their energy costs by embracing renewable energy.
The grid isn’t the only platform ripe for innovation. The federal government owns 640 million acres of land. Reps. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Raul Grijalva (D-N.M.) have both drafted legislations to harvest more renewable energy on public lands. It’s a bipartisan no-brainer.
The GND assumes that investment in clean energy demands more government. But here, less government is the answer. Today’s cheapest, cleanest energy comes from hydropower . A pro-hydro agenda should cut the maze of red tape. More hydropower means lower costs for consumers, while reducing carbon emissions.
Legacy government-control doctrine also constrains zero-emissions nuclear innovation, particularly where it can replace dirty coal. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission favors big, expensive light-water reactors that cost billions. The NRC won’t fairly consider smaller, reliable modular reactors built at a fraction of the cost, limiting the availability of nuclear power to disadvantaged and rural communities lacking a robust payer base . A more libertarian, technologically inclusive policy would democratize nuclear use, reduce carbon emissions, and allow American companies to capture the global modular-nuclear market.
The GRD rejects the fiction that Washington alone can solve problems. States should be encouraged to create tax incentives for energy production and efficiency upgrades, as Florida has. By supporting individual responsibility over government control, every American can be rewarded when the carbon footprint shrinks.
America’s solar technology once led the world. Not anymore. China stole American intellectual property, replicated our products, and undercut American solar companies. President Trump’s tariffs against Chinese solar panels were a good start, but we must become more aggressive in defense of American innovators.
Americans always rise to the challenge when we empower individuals and deconstruct the limitations on our potential. Climate change is real. A response doesn’t demand subjugating our lives to expansive government control. It requires a Green Real Deal."

Sarah Sanders Blames Trump’s Failure To Replace The ACA On Meanie Democrats,crooksandliars.com,NewsHound Ellen,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/sarah-sanders-blames-trump-s-failure,"By NewsHound Ellen
Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox News viewers that the reason ""great dealmaker"" Donald Trump won’t come up with a replacement for Obamacare until after the election, even as he’s working to completely destroy it now, is because of the meanie Democrats. There was no challenge from anchor Sandra Smith.
Trump has been in office more than two years, his party controlled the House of Representatives and the Senate for most of that time, yet he has been unable to come up with the “so much better” alternative to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) he promised on the campaign trail. And now that his Department of Justice is trying to get the entire Affordable Care Act thrown out in court, Trump has decided he’ll wait until after the election to replace it.
As Slate noted , this is a concession to Congressional Republicans who openly revolted and made it clear they would not be writing any legislation in the foreseeable future. That’s not surprising, given that the issue was a big loser for them in the 2018 midterm elections. But it’s also a concession to the fact that Republicans can’t or won’t come up with a health care plan that’s popular. Otherwise, you know they’d be frothing at the mouth with enthusiasm, demanding Democrats pass it and attacking them if they didn’t.
But Smith, who was clearly skeptical of Trump’s health care “strategy,” didn’t mention any of those inconvenient but obvious truths. Instead, she asked Huckabee Sanders, “What is the president’s goal on healthcare right now?”
Sanders was too busy blaming Democrats for all of Trump’s potentially catastrophic ineptitude to articulate anything like a specific plan for the future of health care:
SANDERS: Certainly, the president wants to be the party of health care. It’s an important issue and it’s one that he wants to see us address. He’d love to be able to address it now. But we know that Democrats are controlled by the far, radical left-wing of their party and they are a total contrast to what we need and what the president wants to see happen when it comes to health care. They want to see this Medicare-for-all, government takeover of healthcare. And the president wants to see healthcare returned to the power of the patient. He wants the people that are receiving the care to get to make decisions about it. They want the individuals to control their own decisions about their healthcare while the radical left want the government to tell you what you can and can’t do. What doctor you can and can’t see and what procedures you can and can’t have. That’s unacceptable to this president. It should be unacceptable to every single American. ↓ Story continues below ↓
FACT CHECK : Democrats are working on a plan to strengthen Obamacare, not demanding Medicare for all or nothing.
Smith did not correct Sanders misrepresentations, nor did she say anything to clue in viewers to the fact that the situation represents an epic fail on the part of the Trump administration. But after Sanders claimed that Trump will do “what we can administratively” on health care before the election, Smith was again clearly skeptical. And Sanders again blamed the Trump administration failures on Democrats.
SMITH: How does President Trump respond to concerns shared within his own party about this move and about making an election a referendum on Obamacare without something solidly there to replace it?
SANDERS: I don’t think that the election has to be a referendum on Obamacare. It needs to be a discussion about what works on health care. And that’s what the president’s doing. He’s laying out the things that we need to see in a good health care system - whether that’s more quality care, whether that’s more affordable choices. And that’s bringing those costs down. Again, the president wants to lay out those principles. He’s been a hard-core advocate on protecting pre-existing conditions, you’ll continue to see him talk about that. But we know that Democrats aren’t serious about getting anything done. They want to play games. They want to attack the president. They want to play investigator instead of legislate tour. And they need to decide what they were elected to do. And so far, We’ve seen over the last hundred days that’s very little.

Trump Channels The Caine Mutiny: There 'Was A Whole Plot' Against Him,crooksandliars.com,John Amato,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/trump-channels-caine-mutiny-muellers,"1 day ago by John Amato Views:
During a press gaggle today with the head of NATO, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump became very paranoid and claimed as soon as he came down the escalator to announce his candidacy in 2015, a plot was hatched; an insurance policy of sorts to destroy him just in case he won.
This afternoon's press gaggle was very bizarre, indeed. He kept saying ""oranges"" instead of ""origins"" about what led to the creation of the special counsel and then he lied that his father was born in Germany. And it's not the first time either.
How does a person lie about where their father is born?
But then he turned into Humphrey Bogart's famous Captain Queeg after Trump was asked about the releasing of the Mueller report.
He went on a lengthy and very Caine Mutiny rant about a conspiracy that was set up to destroy him right from the outset of his campaign.
Trump was angry at the Democrats for wanting to see the un-redacted Mueller rep[ort.
""We could give them -- it's a 400-page report, right? We could give them 800 pages and it wouldn't be enough, they'll always come back and say, it's not enough, it's not enough,"" Trump said,
He continued, ""This thing has gone on for two years, and really it started long before that. It practically started from the time I came down the escalator because this was a whole, this was a whole plot; whether you want to use the insurance policy as a time frame? This was an insurance policy, just in case she -- Hillary Clinton loses.""
The only thing missing from his delusion was a can of strawberries.
""Ah, but the strawberries, that's where I had them, but they laughed at me and made jokes."" Tags:"

Mika Brzezinski: Biden’s ‘Politically Active’ Accuser Knew How This Would Blow Up Brzezinski has't shied away from criticizing the former VP's detractors by Darragh Roche April 3, 2019
Morning Joe ‘s Mika Brzezinski defended former Vice President Joe Biden for the third day running on Wednesday morning. The MSNBC host, who knows Biden personally, again called his accusers credibility into question, amid some push back from her guest.
After a discussion about the allegations of inappropriate touching against Biden, who has yet to announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, Brzezinski was keen to defend the Delaware Democrat.
“Yeah, I think the part that worries me is sort of the side of ‘Me Too’ that feels like it is about taking down careers. Oh, he did that? He’s out. Oh, he did that, he’s out. Let’s not investigate it. Get him out.”
A guest pushed back against Brzezinski claim, pointing out that any Democrat who’s been asked about this has said that the accusations do not disqualify Biden from running.
“Well, because I think, and especially in the case of the first two, these are women who are very politically – in fact, they go to political events, they’re involved in politics, they support candidates,” Brzezinski said.
“Lucy Flores supported Bernie and has a picture of herself on Instagram, at some point, with Bernie with his hand on her back. Did Bernie ask? Look, women should be heard. I think many cases, most cases, because most women would never come forward with a story of sexual assault or harassment if they didn’t believe it happened. But in this case, it wasn’t sexual harassment or assault. So we listen. But we can question. You know, women don’t have the end of the story here. They’re a part of the story.”
Later in the conversation, Brzezinski doubled down on her suggestion that these ‘politically active’ women knew what would happen when they made their allegations.
“I do think that a smart woman, a politically active woman like Lucy Flores would understand the magnitude of her story, if she put it out there, and would understand that the narrative would immediately fall into the ‘Me Too’ wave.”
“And all of a sudden, it’d be a flurry of attention about Joe Biden being creepy or sexually weird, even if she clarifies at the end that, well, it wasn’t that bad. If it wasn’t that bad, why say it, so that’s my question. I’m not attacking the victim here because she says she’s not a victim. What is it?”
“I’m saying that she is a very intelligent woman with a political mind, and that she is well aware how these things blow up,” Brzezinski added at the end of the segment.

Theresa May is confident that Jeremy Corbyn is the missing piece in her carefully laid plans for Brexit.
Despite parliament voting three times against her deal, May insists it is not dead and only resting, and could be given a new lease of life from a man she has spent three years denouncing as ‘rubbish’.
Backbench Tory MP Simon Williams told us, “This is the state of Brexit today. After having a crap deal that no-one wants roundly rejected by parliament several times, the party seems to feel confident that the missing ingredient is our incompetent leader securing the support of an opposition universally thought of as pathetic.
“How could it fail?”
Voters have welcomed the move, saying that at least it gives them something slightly different to moan about for a few days.
Basingstoke resident Derek Matthews told us, “I just don’t understand why so many people are against Theresa’s deal?
“Just because the terms of the deal were horrible, and Theresa was utterly terrible at selling it to the public, and it delivered an outcome that fewer and fewer people actually want – that’s no reason for it to fail. I am genuinely shocked it failed so spectacularly.
“But if there’s one thing that could add some credibility to her proposals, it’s involving an opposition she has spent three years publicly insisting is in no way credible.
“On the plus side, she might finally be able to tell the DUP where to get off. With any luck, she’ll have kept the receipt for that billion quid.” There are currently witterings below - why not add your own? "

SINGAPORE (AP) — New Islamic criminal laws that took effect in Brunei on Wednesday, punishing gay sex and adultery by stoning offenders to death, have triggered an outcry from countries, rights groups and celebrities far beyond the tiny Southeast Asian nation's shores.
The penalties were provided for under new sections of Brunei's Shariah Penal Code. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah instituted the code in 2014 to bolster the influence of Islam in the oil-rich monarchy of around 430,000 people, two-thirds of whom are Muslim.
Even before 2014, homosexuality was already punishable in Brunei by a jail term of up to 10 years. The first stage of the Shariah Penal Code included fines or jail for offenses such as pregnancy out of wedlock or failing to pray on Fridays.
But under the new laws — which apply to children and foreigners, even if they are not Muslim — those found guilty of gay sex can be stoned to death or whipped. Adulterers risk death by stoning too, while thieves face amputation of a right hand on their first offense and a left foot on their second.
""Living in Brunei, we already knew that our sexual identity is taboo and should not be expressed. We already felt belittled before the law came to place,"" said a 23-year-old member of the LGBTQ community who wanted to be identified only as Kun out of fear of reprisal from the authorities.
""Now with it, we feel even smaller and the ones who could potentially oppress us have more opportunity to harass us to say and do what they want,"" he said.
Celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres have voiced opposition to the new laws, and have rallied a boycott of nine hotels in the U.S. and Europe with ties to Hassanal, who is still sultan.
""Are we really going to help fund the murder of innocent citizens?"" Clooney wrote Thursday on Deadline Hollywood.
Clooney said that while you can't shame ""murderous regimes,"" you can shame ""the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them.""
There has been no vocal opposition to the new penalties in Brunei, where the sultan rules as head of state with full executive authority. Public criticism of his policies is extremely rare in the country.
Hassanal, who has reigned since 1967, has previously said the Penal Code should be regarded as a form of ""special guidance"" from God and would be ""part of the great history"" of Brunei.
On Tuesday, the United States joined the United Kingdom, Germany and France in urging Brunei to halt its plans.
""The United States strongly opposes violence, criminalization and discrimination targeting vulnerable groups, including women at risk of violence, religious and ethnic minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons,"" State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement.
Brunei's Southeast Asian neighbors, some of whom have laws banning sex between men, were silent.
But LGBTQ citizens of other nearby Muslim-majority countries were concerned about the broad penalties.
""I am very worried that Indonesia or Malaysia may follow the lead,"" said a 24-year-old man from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, who wanted to be identified only by his first name, Ludwig. ""I think people nowadays, especially the younger generation, are quite OK with LGBT, but those who are not make the loudest noise and they are the reason why it seems like everyone is against it.""
Nearly two-thirds of Malaysia's 32 million people are Muslim. They are governed by Islamic courts in family, marriage and personal issues. Last year, two Malaysian Muslim women were convicted under Islamic laws and caned for attempting to have sex with each other.
Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, urged Brunei's government to ""stop the entry into force of this Draconian new penal code.""
""Any religion-based legislation must not violate human rights, including the rights of those belonging to the majority religion as well as of religious minorities and non-believers,"" she said in a statement on Monday.
Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, called on the sultan to ""immediately suspend amputations, stoning, and all other rights-abusing provisions and punishments.""
""Brunei's new penal code is barbaric to the core, imposing archaic punishments for acts that shouldn't even be crimes,"" Robertson said in a statement on Wednesday.
Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Brunei researcher at Amnesty International, decried the ""vicious"" laws and asked the international community to condemn them.

"Humanity’s long, strange quest to build a war-stopping death ray has delivered everything but.",slate.com,Jeff Hecht,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/death-ray-history-jeff-hecht-excerpt.html,"Excerpted from Lasers, Death Rays, and the Long, Strange Quest for the Ultimate Weapon by Jeff Hecht. Out now from Prometheus Books. The ancients didn’t understand the nature of lightning, but they knew and feared its power. To them, lightning was the first directed-energy weapon, hurled by the gods to smite those that annoyed them. The idea of wielding such a weapon has captured imaginations ever since. The term “death ray” was coined in the late 1890s by journalists reporting about the unsubstantiated claims of a man named John Hartman, who had served as an engineer in the American Civil War. Hartman boasted that he had modified a searchlight so that it could guide electricity through the air, and that his electric gun could be set to stun or kill a rabbit 50 feet away. Death rays became modern myths, updated versions of the bolts hurled by ancient gods, born more than a century ago at a time when scientists were puzzling over new discoveries from X-rays to radio waves, inventors were seeking new weapons of war, and storytellers were looking for thrilling new ways to entertain their audiences. The laser is a newcomer, invented in 1960 by Theodore Maiman. He had high hopes for uses of his new discovery in research, communications, industry, and medicine when he announced it, and was dismayed to hear that newspaper headlines were mostly variations on “Man Discovers Science Fiction Death Ray.” In time the laser would perform vision-saving eye surgery, enable high-speed internet transmission, weld sheet metal, and do many other things that its inventor could not have imagined. But after 60 years, the invention has yet to become what military strategists around the world once pursued with laser-like intensity: a lethal ray capable of zapping enemies and their weapons into oblivion from thousands of miles away. A serious quest for a death ray that could stop war began soon after World War I ended. Air attacks had become a major worry. During the war, German zeppelins and winged aircraft had raided Britain 103 times, killing 1,413 people. Laboratory tests showed that high voltages and intense electrical and magnetic fields could affect engines, and military leaders hoped to extend those effects to stop planes. “Under the attack of these electric waves the airplane will fall as though struck by a thunderbolt, the tank will burst into flames, the dreadnought will blow up, poison gas will be dispersed,” wrote French army chief of staff Gen. Marie-Eugène Debeney in 1921. France worried that Germany had already developed such weapons after a series of French commercial flights over Germany had to make emergency landings in 1923. Military leaders hoped new science would yield new weapons, perhaps even an ultimate weapon. Technology was advancing much faster than in the 19 th century. Relativity and quantum theory were revolutionizing physics. “We have X-rays, we have heat rays, we have light rays. H.G. Wells in his War of the Worlds alludes to the heat rays of the Martians, and we may not be so very far from the development of some kinds of lethal ray which will shrivel up or paralyze human beings if they are unprotected,” wrote British Gen. Ernest Swinton in 1920. Pulp magazines covering new science and technology proliferated, and the border between fact and fiction could be hazy. Young inventor and entrepreneur Hugo Gernsback founded the publication Modern Electrics in 1908, then sold that and in 1913 founded Electrical Experimenter, which Nikola Tesla wrote for. The inventor’s electric discoveries are still used today in short-range wireless systems, but he fell short of cracking the code on long-range wireless transmission. Still, these magazines looked toward a bright electrical future. They published speculative fiction as well, and in 1926 Gernsback launched the world’s first science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories. This new world eager for new technology and news about it was primed for someone like Harry Grindell Matthews when he arrived with plans for a death ray in 1924. Born in England in 1880, Matthews served in the Boer War, during which he grew intrigued by wireless communications. In December 1915, Matthews demonstrated wireless technology for remote control of a powered model boat and for exploding mines to the British Admiralty. After working on military projects during the war and later developing an early motion picture sound system, Matthews had a credible track record in invention and engineering by the early 1920s. That helped him get a hearing when he started talking about energy-beam weapons in early 1924. Word reached Winston Churchill, who asked his scientific adviser to check out “the man who is said to have discovered a ray which will kill at a certain distance. … It may be all a hoax, but my experience has not been to take ‘no’ for an answer.” In March 1924, Matthews talked with the Air Ministry about his invention but said he was not yet ready to demonstrate it. In May a New York Times correspondent conducted a lengthy interview with Matthews about his “diabolical rays.” The inventor was elusive about the details, but he did say that the rays could direct an electric current through the air for up to four miles, and predicted that the range could be doubled. His surviving notes say the two key parts of the system were a specialized electrical generator and a carrier beam that Matthews described as a “searchlight” like that on a lighthouse. The beam acted as a conductor to direct the electrical current and deliver its destructive punch, much like John Hartman’s alleged death ray design. It could not destroy ships, because they were grounded by the water, Matthews said, but it could “put the ships out of action by the destruction of vital parts of the machinery and also by putting the crews temporarily out of action through shock.” Airplanes, being isolated in the air, could be totally destroyed. The paper also ran a full-page spread explaining why scientists doubted Matthews’ statements—and the quest for a war-stopping weapon more broadly. Michael Pupin, who headed the Department of Electro-Mechanics at Columbia University, said it was nonsense to believe that such a weapon could succeed even if it worked. “You can’t make war so frightful that men will shrink from it. … If a ray could be discovered which would reduce all motor-driven trucks, tanks, airplanes and battleships to scrap-iron, then armies might be obliged to go back to hand-to-hand fighting. But they would fight just the same.” Growing skeptical of his claims, the British Air Ministry offered Matthews only modest support until he could disable a small engine supplied by the government, a way for them to be sure Matthews wasn’t rigging the test. He declined this proposal but continued talking with reporters and promoting his invention, even shooting and starring in a silent film titled The Death Ray . One segment featured Matthews sitting at a desk in a white laboratory coat, and shows the “death ray” light a lamp and explode gunpowder. Matthews soon went bankrupt, became the fifth husband of rich Polish-born opera singer Ganna Walska in 1938, and broke up with her before he died from a heart attack on September 11, 1941. After Matthews, the British Air Ministry decided to take a more pragmatic approach to dealing with would-be inventors pitching their death ray schemes. They offered a bounty of 1,000 pounds sterling to anyone with a ray weapon that could kill a sheep 100 yards away. Passing that simple test presumably would have earned the successful inventor the bounty as well as an invitation to talk with ministry officials, though no one ever did. But aerial bombing continued to worry Britain. “The bomber will always get through” whatever defense exists, warned Stanley Baldwin in 1932, between his terms as prime minister. “The only defense is in offense, which means that you will have to kill more women and children more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves.” Churchill in 1934 urged rearming Britain and raged against the “cursed, hellish invention and development of war from the air.” Unless science could offer something new, Britain was likely doomed to defeat in the next war. Henry Wimperis, director of scientific research at the Air Ministry, started exploring the options and asked Robert Watson-Watt, who operated the Radio Research Station of the National Physical Laboratory, if “damaging radiation” from a death ray offered much prospect for defense. Watson-Watt didn’t think much of the idea, but he was a careful man, and to check his opinion he instructed a subordinate, Arnold Wilkins: “Please calculate the amount of radio frequency power which should be radiated to raise the temperature of eight pints of water from 98 degrees F to 105 F at a distance of five km and a height of 1 kilometer”—a circuitous way of asking how much radiation was needed to heat a pilot’s blood to an unhealthy temperature. Taking a more pragmatic approach to would-be death ray inventors, the British Air Ministry decided to offer a bounty of 1,000 pounds to anyone that could kill a sheep from 100 yards away. Wilkins quickly understood the reason for the question, and his calculations showed that it wasn’t practical. Watson-Watt was not surprised and asked what else radio waves might be able to do. Wilkins recalled that radio receivers often picked up noise when planes flew nearby and wondered if it might be possible to detect planes by reflecting radio waves off them. Watson-Watt jumped at the idea, and existing radio technology turned out to be up to the task. And so the quest for death rays led to the invention of radar, which played a crucial role in protecting Britain from bombers and rockets by detecting their presence and targeting them for gunneries. Still, death ray inventors didn’t go away, the press kept reporting their claims, and a brief panic ensued after Tesla’s death in 1943. His talk of death rays in life raised concerns that he might have possessed sensitive documents. Federal agents hauled two truckloads of papers from the inventor’s residence, and called in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineering professor, John G. Trump—uncle to none other than sitting president Donald J. Trump and an expert on high-voltage equipment—to comb Tesla’s writings for death ray designs. After two days burrowing through Tesla’s notes, professor Trump concluded there was nothing to worry about. “It is my considered opinion that there exist among Dr. Tesla’s papers and possessions no scientific notes, descriptions of hitherto unrevealed methods or devices, or actual apparatus which could be of significant value to this country or which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands,” wrote Trump, signing his letter as a technical aide to the government’s wartime National Defense Research Committee, and attaching a list of Tesla projects. Trump was well aware that his comments about Tesla might seem harsh, so he closed by saying, “It should be no discredit to this distinguished engineer and scientist whose solid contributions to the electrical art were made at the beginning of the present century to report that his thoughts and efforts during the past fifteen years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character.” That generosity reflects a colleague’s memory of Trump as “remarkably even-tempered, with kindness and consideration to all, never threatening or arrogant in manner.” Trump did find that Tesla had tried to peddle the “death beams” of tiny particles at his 1934 birthday party. “Such beams would constitute a death ray capable of the protection of Great Britain from air attack,” Tesla had written British military officials who politely declined, and Trump agreed the plan wasn’t workable. Beam weapons of all sorts became standard for science fiction thanks to the death ray craze, but by the early 1940s major military powers still preferred old-fashioned guns for shooting down enemy aircraft tracked by radar. The Japanese military did try to develop powerful microwave tubes for use as death rays, and managed to kill rabbits up to 30 meters from a tube emitting 200 to 300 kilowatts hooked up to a giant 10-meter focusing antenna. That’s a few hundred times the power of a modern microwave oven, but the lethal distance was only a third of the British Air Ministry minimum for killing a sheep. Today, even our most advanced lasers and other directed-energy weapons have important limitations. Don’t be fooled by videos showing high-powered laser beams slicing sheet metal like butter. That beam is focused across a matter of inches so it can be concentrated on a tiny spot. Laser weapons are hundreds of meters or more from targets that may not be stationary, so the beam can’t be focused that tightly onto a spot. And far from achieving instantaneous obliteration, modern laser weapons are best at heating a thin-skinned fuel tank until the pressure blows out the softened metal, or heating an explosive to the detonation point. They can hit their target at the speed of light, but the beam has to dwell for quite a while to deliver a lethal dose of energy, like heating a teakettle of water on an electric stove. Nonetheless, the Platonic ideal of a death ray–like laser retains the same magical appeal it generated a century ago. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Director Arati Prabhakar saw this laser enthusiasm among military officers during her tenure from 2012 to 2017 and told me that she found it rather ironic after the troubled history of laser weapons. “Most new technologies are viewed with suspicion and hostility by most military users,” she said. Lasers are the rare counterexample: “The enthusiasm of users has for decades outstripped the capability of the technology. The laser is such a powerfully exciting notion that their desire exceeds the capability of the technology. In the area of laser weapons, I spent a lot of time trying to reduce their expectations that lasers would make practical weapons.” Prabhakar acknowledged that lasers have completely changed military capabilities in other areas, citing laser range-finding and target designation, laser radars and sensing, and communications. But so far laser weapons have not. In the future, she says, “I think laser weapons may be a terrific solution for some very specific applications of enormous value. But there will not be a general-purpose laser weapon.” Death rays may always belong to the realm of fantasy."

Outrage as British Soldiers Filmed Using Opposition Leader's Picture for Target Practice,www.newsweek.com,Brendan Cole,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/outrage-british-soldiers-jeremy-corbyn-picture-target-practice-1384448,"Britain's Ministry of Defence is investigating a video shared on social media that shows its soldiers purportedly using an image of U.K. opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn for target practice.
Footage of the incident that is thought to have taken place in the Afghan capital of Kabul, was shared on Snapchat.
The video, which has not been verified, is captioned “happy with that” and shows what appears to be four uniformed paratroopers firing weapons at a shooting range.
The picture of the Labour leader can be seen as the camera pans around, and at least 15 shots are peppered across the target.
Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn pictured leaving his home in North London on April 3. Britain’s Ministry of Defence has launched an inquiry into claims that his image was used by soldiers for target practice. ISABEL INFANTES/AFP/Getty Images The Sun reported that “sim-unition” training bullets, not live rounds, were used. These are hardened wax paint balls often used for cheap target practise.
A military source told the paper that the incident “is being taken pretty damn seriously. It looks terrible. This is causing huge embarrassment,” the source said.
Sky News reported that the range where the drills took place was in the loft of New Kabul Compound in Afghanistan.
“Soldiers practice 'guardian angel' drills here—protecting VIPs. There are images of celebrities on the range, but as VIPs to be protected rather than shot at,"" Sky reported.
The Ministry of Defense said in a statement: “We are aware of a video circulating on social media. This behavior is totally unacceptable and falls well below the high standards the army expects. A full investigation has been launched.”
Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member of Parliament and a former lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, described the footage as ""disgraceful,"" the BBC reported.
Jess Phillips, a Labour MP, tweeted: ""This is absolutely hideous and irresponsible under this or any climate.""
Alex Sobel, another Labour Quote: : ""How can serving soldiers think it is acceptable to use Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, for target practice?""
However, former British soldier Trevor Coult, who circulated the video, later claimed it was fake, saying that the image had been photoshopped, The Guardian reported.
The safety of British politicians is a sensitive issue following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox, who was killed by a far-right extremist. In another incident, a terrorist who attacked a mosque in Finsbury Park, North London, said he had originally wanted to kill Corbyn.
Corbyn is unpopular among some parts of the military because of his pacifist position on foreign interventions, opposition to the Iraq War and policies in Northern Ireland, The Independent reported.
It comes amid a febrile political atmosphere in the U.K. over Britain’s exit from the European Union. Corbyn is meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday to discuss a Brexit pact.

Nearly 60 Percent of Voters Don’t Trust Trump on Healthcare,www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/03/nearly-60-percent-of-voters-dont-trust-trump-on-healthcare.html,"Nearly 60 Percent of Voters Don’t Trust Trump on Healthcare 1.5k
A large majority of American voters say they don’t trust Donald Trump on health care, according to the new Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday.
The poll discovered that 59 percent of voters said they don’t have “much trust” or “any trust at all” in the president on health care.
The new poll also discovered that more voters support the Affordable Care Act (the ACA, or Obamacare) than do not support it. Nearly half of respondents, 47 percent, said they approve of the law, compared to just 41 percent who said they do not approve.
In addition, 45 percent of voters said they trust Democrats more than Republicans in Congress on healthcare. Just 35 percent of respondents said they have more trust in Republicans.
Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult’s vice president, pointed out the problem for the president facing reelection:
“As health care is pushed to the forefront of the 2020 agenda, our polling suggests President Trump may struggle to attract voters with his promise of a new plan.”
Today’s poll results come after the Trump administration last week called for the entirety of the Affordable Care Act to be be struck down by a federal court in Texas.
After that Trump made a controversial pledge that Republicans would become the “party of health care.”
He also said that the GOP would come up with a “far better” health care proposal than Obamacare.
Since last week’s court filing, Trump has backtracked on healthcare, saying that Republicans wouldn’t take up healthcare reform until after the 2020 election. In his comments he was assuming that Republicans would win back House control and he would also win reelection.
The federal lawsuit is continuing, however, and healthcare will be on voters’ minds during the 2020 election.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he told Trump earlier this week that the Senate would not work on a comprehensive health care package ahead of the 2020 election.
“I made clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate,” McConnell said he told the president. “He did say, as he later tweeted, that he accepted that and he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign.” Trump and the GOP Can’t Fool American Voters
This new poll makes clear that the lies being told to the American people about Donald Trump’s and congressional Republicans’“great” healthcare plans aren’t working.
Republicans are in real trouble as they head into the 2020 election season since they have no plan whatsoever on healthcare. But healthcare will be the top issue on voters’ minds in the 2020 election.
All of this spells doom for the GOP in 2020, and makes it increasingly likely that Democrats will not only win back the presidency, but may win back control of the U.S. Senate also. "
EU commission plans bolstering rule of law toolbox,euobserver.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://euobserver.com/political/144577,"EU Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans on Wednesday (3 April) called for a public debate ahead of plans to reinforce the EU's toolbox for dealing with member states that infringe the rule of law.
The move comes after European institutions came under criticism for being unable to rein in bellicose governments in Hungary, Poland and, more recently, Romania, which have been accused of rolling back democratic freedoms and judicial independence.
""The EU's capacity to uphold rule of law is essential, it is an issue of fundamental values, a matter of who we are,"" Timmermans told reporters, adding: ""It is essential for the internal market, for investments, for judicial cooperation across the EU.""
""A problem in one member states is a problem for the union as a whole,"" he said.
Timmermans announced a public consultation on the issue.
""There is a growing consensus that further action on the protection of rule of law is needed, and to that end we need a debate,"" the Dutch politician said.
The commission's own plans on ""how to further develop the rule of law framework"" will only come at the end of June.
The EU has struggled to deal with governments that put political pressure on the judiciary, target civil society and the media and challenge EU values.
The bloc can use targeted probes into specific national legislation, called infringement procedures, that take years to conclude and often don't produce substantial results.
A so-called ""rule of law framework"" organises those probes if there are a series of EU law violations.
The other option is the Article 7 sanctions procedure in the EU treaty, which can be triggered if there is a clear risk of a serious breach of EU values, that - ultimately - can result in the suspension of that EU country's voting rights.
The commission in December 2017 launched an Article 7 procedure against Poland, while the European Parliament triggered the same process against Hungary last September.
Both procedures are stuck in the council of member states, as EU countries are reluctant to sanctioning each other.
Meanwhile, Budapest and Warsaw argue the moves are a politically-motivated campaign against their governments.
The commission also called for a debate on the Article 7 procedure.
'Unanimity' stays Timmermans, however, ruled out the commission proposing a treaty change to tweak Article 7, so that it would only require a majority of member states to sanction a specific EU country, and not unanimity.
Timmermans told reporters a bigger role could be envisaged for the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency, and the Council of Europe's law experts, the Venice Commission.
There are parallel proposals, aimed to reinforce the protection of the rule of law in the EU.
In its long-term EU budget proposal the EU commission has proposed tying respect of the rule of law to EU funds, so-called ""conditionality"", something Poland and Hungary have protested against.
The German and Belgian foreign and EU affairs ministers have also been lobbying colleagues to agree on a regular ""peer review"" of EU member states to check on the health of the judiciary and respect for the rule of law.
Rule of law has emerged as a campaign issue in the European elections for the lead candidates seeking the EU commission presidency.
Centre-right lead candidate Manfred Weber has been criticised for being soft on Hungary's premier Viktor Orban, a European People's Party ally.
In response, Weber recently published his own initiative in an op-ed for EUobserver for dealing with countries that challenge the rule of law.
Socialist lead candidate Timmermans has been criticised for not doing enough to pressure his party ally, Romania's ruling Social Democrats, to stop backtracking on fighting corruption and increasingly putting the judiciary under political control.
Politically 'colour blind' Timmermans said on Wednesday said he is politically ""colour blind"", and added that the commission's decisions are not party political measures, and that the EU executive has been ""absolutely neutral"".
On Wednesday, Timmermans warned Romania to act on those concerns raised.
""Romania urgently needs to put the reform process back on track,"" he said, adding that includes ""refraining from any steps which reverse the progress achieved in the past years.""
He warned against the government passing an ""amnesty law"" that could let convicted politicians off the hook for corruption crimes.
""I want to warn against any governmental action that would disrupt the Romanian judicial system, by creating a systemic and de facto impunity for high office holders who were sentenced for corruption,"" he said, warning that the commission will act ""within days"" if Bucharest adopts such legislation.
""We need results urgently,"" Timmermans said.
New Polish measure The Dutch politicians also announced a new infringement procedure against Poland over a new disciplinary regime for judges.
Timmermans said judges have been scrutinised for participating in public debates on judicial reform, or referring requests for preliminary rulings from the European Court of Justice.
""The main aim [of the law] is to systematically subject judges to the political control of the executive,"" he said, adding: ""This has an obvious chilling effect on the activities of judges, and it constitutes violation EU rules.""
The Polish government has two months to respond.

Trea Turner Diagnosed With Fractured Index Finger - MLB Trade Rumors - BPC News,britishpakistanis.online,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://britishpakistanis.online/trea-turner-diagnosed-with-fractured-index-finger-mlb-trade-rumors/,"admin
Oh Samuel, you know I have always argued that runs are what win games. It’s why Harper, despite a low batting average, was so good last year – he created tons of runs and got on base more than almost anyone in baseball. Getting on base is the most important skill in baseball. Teams that win get on base and score more runs than their opponents. Runs win games. Bunting is a low-percentage play, even bunting for a hit, like a super speedy guy like Turner was trying to do.
My favorite player of all time is Rickey Henderson. When he retired he was the career leader in runs scored, stolen bases, and walks (he has since been eclipsed by Bonds in the last category. Nobody’s going to touch his SB record and it’s highly doubtful anyone will touch his runs record in the next twenty years either). You know what Rickey almost never did? Bunt. He walked, and stole bases, and hit for some power. His career batting average was “only” .279, but he knew what his role was better than almost any player I’ve ever seen – to get on base and score runs. He didn’t do that by sacrificing outs – the most times he ever bunted in a season was 8, and that was in his rookie year in 1979. In his amazing 1990 MVP season, he batted 325/439/577, scored 119 runs, led the league in steals, walked 40 more times than he struck out, led the league in OPS and OPS+. Oakland won 103 games that year.
Rickey, in that phenomenal 1990 season, in 594 plate appearances, bunted twice. The goal of the games, as a hitter, is to not make outs. The very name of the act of bunting – a sacrifice – means you just gave the team an extra out to work with.
Exception, of course, is pitchers, who have never been able to hit, and the squeeze, which is a really fun play IMO. But when you’re one of the five fastest players in baseball, as Turner is, there’s no real reason to be bunting when you can just put the ball in play and run like hell. And btw, there was no shift on against Turner in his finger-breaking bunt attempt. Teams don’t shift against right handers nearly as much as lefties, and the third baseman, from the video, seemed to be playing a few steps in front of normal positioning for a third baseman – not quite playing in, but he certainly wasn’t playing back. It was a pretty dumb bunt attempt, and now the dude might miss significant time for a team that already lost its most significant hitter. "

Pavlich: Trump and Obama officials agree — there's a crisis at the border | TheHill - The Hill,thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/437051-pavlich-trump-and-obama-officials-agree-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border,"Pavlich: Trump and Obama officials agree — there's a crisis at the border By Katie Pavlich, opinion contributor — 04/02/19 07:15 PM EDT The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill View Latest Opinions >>
Last week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan went to El Paso, Texas, with a desperate message for those back in Washington: the border is at a breaking point.
“Two weeks ago, I briefed the media and testified in Congress that our immigration system was at the breaking point. That breaking point has arrived this week at our border. CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our southwest border,” McAleenan said. “On Monday and Tuesday CBP started the day with over 12,000 migrants in our custody. As of this morning, that number was 13,400. A high number for us is 4,000. A crisis level is 6,000 – 13,000 is unprecedented.”
The numbers are staggering, and they are unsustainable. ADVERTISEMENT
The same week of McAleenan’s visit, Border Patrol agents were forced to house immigrants under the El Paso del Norte International Bridge because detention centers are completely full.
In Yuma, Arizona Border Patrol agents have been forced to release hundreds of illegal immigrants onto the streets due to facilities being at full capacity.
Kirstjen Michele Nielsen CEOs urge Trump officials not to close southern border Nielsen to make three-day visit to Mexican border Cutting aid to Central America misguided, impulsive, and supremely counter-productive MORE traveled to Honduras last week to address the problem at its source. During her trip, she met with security officials from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and entered into a new agreement to deal with what she describes as a “system in free fall.”
“America shares common cause with the countries of Central America in confronting these challenges,” Nielsen said about the new Memorandum of Cooperation between the four countries. “We all want to enforce our laws, ensure a safe and orderly migrant flow, protect our communities, facilitate legal trade and travel, support vulnerable populations, interdict dangerous and illicit drug flow, and secure our borders.”
According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agreement works to combat human trafficking and smuggling, combats criminal organizations and gangs, expands intelligence sharing and strengthens border security in the air, on the land and at sea.
“I look forward to implementing this historic agreement and working with my Northern Triangle counterparts to help secure all of our nations and to end the humanitarian and security crisis we face,” Nielsen continued. ADVERTISEMENT
This agreement is certainly admirable and Central American officials must take responsibility for the outflow of people from their countries, but only the United States, through the executive and Congress, can secure its borders and control illegal immigration. As long as the magnets of easy asylum claims and activist-court ordered non-enforcement of immigration law continue, a million people will show up at the border by the end of the year.
While Trump administration officials have been sounding the alarm for years on this issue, and continue to do so, former Obama administration officials are backing them up.
“On Tuesday there were 4,000 apprehensions. I know that 1,000 overwhelms the system. I can’t imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. So, we are truly in a crisis,” former Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said during an interview with MSNBC this week.
“The [CBP] Commissioner said it this week, he said ‘hey, we only have so much space.’ 4,000 capacity, 6,000’s a crisis. We have 13,000 right now. There’s no more room at the inn, there’s nowhere for them to go. And because of the broken asylum laws and bad judicial precedent like Flores, it’s actually law that DHS has to release these people,” former Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan said on Fox Business.
There are easy things Congress can do to stop the flow of this crisis: change the Flores settlement to allow for longer detention of family units and end catch and release, increase the threshold for making an asylum claim and reform deportation laws so they are immediately applicable to Central Americans.
The Mexican government can also help. After all, tens of thousands of Central Americans have illegally traveled through Mexico to get to the United States. Then-Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Gerónimo Gutiérrez Fernandez has said in the past he believes immigration should be orderly and legal. His country should be held to that standard.
“Mexico’s migration policy is to seek that any migration is legal, safe, orderly and respectful of basic human rights. And that’s the way we act upon immigration,” Gutiérrez said in an interview with Fox News. “We certainly do not advocate for a regular immigration from our nationals of – or any other country.”
Gutiérrez made that statement on April 2, 2018. One year later, illegal immigration from Mexico is still happening, has become more unsafe, more inhumane and extremely disorderly. Individuals illegally traveling through Mexico aren’t seeking asylum, as they claim, to flee violence and persecution. Instead, Mexico has waved many of them through while claiming cooperation.
Donald John Trump Tim Ryan expected to announce bid for presidency this week: report Kushner's security clearance was denied due to concerns of foreign influence: report Morgan Ortagus named as new State Dept spokeswoman MORE has threatened to shut down the border if Mexico doesn’t do more to stop the chaos, and according to senior White House officials, he’s serious about doing so. Mexico’s government has an obligation to act immediately in order to prevent an economic disruption on both sides of the border.
This is a bipartisan crisis. Officials from two ideologically opposed administrations agree. It’s time for Congress to put legislation on the table to end it, without gumming up the gears with “comprehensive immigration reform.” This is an emergency and a narrow bill that cuts off the flow is of dire need. The current situation is a threat to American sovereignty. It is lawless and will have severe, negative impacts on the United States if it is allowed to continue.

Dem Flips PA State House Seat To Blue In District That Went For Trump,crooksandliars.com,Susie Madrak,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/dem-flips-pa-state-house-seat-blue,"By Susie Madrak
A Democratic veteran flipped a seat in Pennsylvania's state house in a special election that was watched closely as a bellwether for the 2020 election. Pam Iovino, 62, beat Republican D. Raja in a race that was expected to come down to be a squeaker. Not even close -- she won by more than 4,000 votes.
This is a big deal to PA residents like me, because our state house used to be relatively moderate. So we're close to dealing the death blow to wingnut control with just three more seats. Via the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:
The election, which was expected to be close and possibly decided by a few hundred votes, was officially decided when Mr. Raja conceded to Ms. Iovino by phone at around 9:30 p.m. As of 10:10 p.m., she was about 4,000 votes ahead with 94 percent of precincts counted.
At that point, Democrats in Pennsylvania got what they had hoped for: another jolt of momentum heading into the 2020 election cycle, when they’ll now need just three seats to flip the Senate blue and take a chamber in what’s currently a Republican-controlled Legislature.
“This win is a credit to a candidate, a great campaign, and and amazing grassroots volunteer effort,” said David Marshall, executive director of the Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. “Continuing in communities like this show a fundamental shift in state politics, and highlight why Democrats have a crystal clear path to pick up three more seats next year and take control of the state Senate.” Tags:"

Political asylum is an accepted if often ignored right. It is also at the mercy of those interests that grant it. Ecuador’s repeated insistence on conditioning Julian Assange’s stay in its London abode is tantamount to corroding the idea of asylum to vacuity. You are granted asylum as a political dissident, but political dissident you shall not be, especially when it comes to exposing the secrets of your landlord.
Assange has ventured to test the onerous limits on his conduct that have been imposed by embassy protocols, taking the matter to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. His argument has been that the strict rules applied to his stay, entailing a monitoring of visits, control of medical bills, communications, expenses and pet care were a violation of “fundamental rights and freedoms”. The Commission, as it transpired, did not bite.
The Ecuadorean response was a crowing one, arguing that the state’s treatment of Assange was in accordance with international law, and that their guest’s situation “cannot be extended indefinitely and (Ecuador) expects it to be resolved as soon as possible.”
Ecuador’s Attorney General Íñigo Salvador, summed it up in smug fashion. “The decision was based on the fact that the request filed by Assange did not comply with the requirements of gravity, urgency and irreparable harm provided for in Article 25 of the Rules of Procedure of the IACHR.” The peculiar twist to this, however, was that…"

Kennedy by Lisa Pease by Edward Curtin / April 2nd, 2019
‘We’re all puppets,’ the suspect [Sirhan Sirhan] replied, with more truth than he could have understood at that moment.
— Lisa Pease, quoting from the LAPD questioning of Sirhan
When Senator Robert Kennedy was assassinated on June 5, 1968, the American public fell into a hypnotic trance in which they have remained ever since. The overwhelming majority accepted what was presented by government authorities as an open and shut case that a young Palestinian American, Sirhan Sirhan, had murdered RFK because of his support for Israel, a false accusation whose ramifications echo down the years. That this was patently untrue and was contradicted by overwhelming evidence made no difference.
Sirhan did not kill Robert Kennedy, yet he remains in jail to this very day. Robert Kennedy, Jr., who was 14 years old at the time of his father’s death, has visited Sirhan in prison, claims he is innocent, and believes there was another gunman. Paul Schrade, an aide to the senator and the first person shot that night, also says Sirhan didn’t do it. Both have plenty of evidence. And they are not alone.
There is a vast body of documented evidence to prove this, an indisputably logical case marshalled by serious writers and researchers. Lisa Pease is the latest. It is a reason why a group of 60 prominent Americans has recently called for a reopening of, not just this case, but those of JFK, MLK, and Malcom X. The blood of these men cries out for the revelation of the truth that the United States national security state and its media accomplices have fought so mightily to keep hidden for so many years.
That they have worked so hard at this reveals how dangerous the truth about these assassinations still is to this secret government that wages propaganda war against the American people and real wars around the world. It is a government of Democrats, Republicans, and their intelligence allies working together today to confuse the American people and provoke Russia in a most dangerous game that could lead to nuclear war, a possibility that so frightened JFK and RFK after the Cuban Missile Crisis that they devoted themselves to ending the Cold War, reconciling with the Soviet Union, abolishing nuclear weapons, reining in of the power of the CIA, and withdrawing from Vietnam. That is why they were killed.
The web of deceit surrounding the now officially debunked Democratic led Russia-gate propaganda operation that has strengthened Trump to double-down on his anti-Russia operations (a Democratic goal) is an example of the perfidious and sophisticated mutuality of this game of mass mind-control.
The killing of the Kennedys and today’s new Cold War and war against terror are two ends of a linked intelligence operation.
Moreover, more than any other assassination of the 1960s, it is the killing of Bobby Kennedy that has remained shrouded in the most ignorance.
It is one of the greatest propaganda success stories of American history.
In her exhaustive new examination of the case, A Lie Too Big To Fail , Lisa Pease puts it succinctly at the conclusion of her unravelling of the official lies that have mesmerized the public:
The assassination of the top four leaders of the political left in the five year period – President John Kennedy in 1963, Malcolm X in 1965, and Martin Luther King, Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy in 1968 – represented nothing less than a slow-motion coup on the political scene.
If anyone wishes to understand what has happened to the United States since this coup, and thus to its countless victims at home and throughout the world, one must understand these assassinations and how the alleged assassins were manipulated by the coup organizers and how the public was hoodwinked in a mind-control operation on a vast scale. It is not ancient history, for the forces that killed these leaders rule the U.S. today, and their ruthlessness has subsequently informed the actions of almost all political leaders in the years since. A bullet to the head when you seriously talk about peace and justice is a not so gentle reminder to toe the line or else.
“But the way the CIA took over America in the 1960s is the story of our time,” writes Pease, “and too few recognize this. We can’t fix a problem we can’t even acknowledge exists.” Nothing could be truer.
Lisa Pease has long recognized the problem, and for the past twenty-five years, she has devoted herself to shedding light on the CIA’s culpability, particularly in the Robert Kennedy case. Few people possess the grit and grace to spend so much of their lives walking this path of truth. The extent of her research is dazzling, so dazzling in its voluminous detail that a reviewer can only touch on it here and there. She has written a book that is daunting in its comprehensiveness. It demands focused attention and perseverance, for it runs to over 500 pages with more than 800 footnotes. This book will remain a touchstone for future research on the RFK assassination, whether one agrees or disagrees with all of her detailed findings and speculations. For this book is so vast and meticulous in its examination of all aspects of the case that one can surely find areas that one might question or disagree with.
Nevertheless, Pease fundamentally proves that Sirhan did not shoot RFK and that there was a conspiracy organized and carried out by shadowy intelligence forces that did so. These same forces worked with the Los Angeles Police Department, federal, state, and judicial elements to make sure Sirhan was quickly accused of being the lone assassin and dispatched to prison after a show trial. And the mass media carried out its assigned role of affirming the government’s case to shield the real killers and to make sure the cover-up was successful.
No doubt others will investigate this case further. Yet I think no more research is really needed, for as with these other assassinations, additional analyses will only result in pseudo-debates about minutiae. Such debates will only serve to prolong the hallucinatory grip the perpetrators of these crimes have on a day of reckoning, suggesting as they would that we do not really know what happened. This is an old tactic meant to delay forevermore such a day of reckoning.
The facts are clear for all to see if they have the will to truth. All that is now needed is a public tribunal, which is planned for later this year, in which the fundamental, clear-cut facts of these cases are presented to the American public. In the case of Robert Kennedy’s assassination as with the others, a little knowledge goes a long way, and only those who are closed to basic logic and evidence will refuse to see that government forces conspired to kill these men and did so because all were seeking peace and justice that was then, and is now, a threat to the war-making forces of wealth and power that control the American government.
Pease writes:
Anyone who has looked closely and honestly at the evidence has realized that more than one person was involved in Robert Kennedy’s death. So why can’t reporters see this? Why can’t the media explain this? Because the media and the government are two sides of the same coin, and those who challenge the government’s version of history, as numerous reporters have found out, all too often lose status and sometimes whole careers. Kristina Borjesson published an anthology of such stories in her book Into the Buzzsaw, in which journalists describe how they lost their careers when each of them expressed a truth that the government did not want exposed.
Lisa Pease discloses such truths. I am reporting on her work. Therefore, the mainstream media, except for an extraordinary reporter or two, such as Tom Jackman of The Washington Post , will likely ignore both of us, but the publication where you are reading this is on the side of truth, and in the disclosure of truth lies our hope.
Since more than one person was involved in the killing of RFK, there was – ipso facto – a conspiracy. This is not theory but fact. The fact of a conspiracy. For more than fifty years, mainstream reporters have been cowed by this word “conspiracy,” thanks to the CIA. Many others have been intelligence assets posing as journalists, regurgitating the lies. This is a fact.
The official story is that after giving his victory speech for winning the 1968 Democratic California Primary, Kennedy, as he was walking through a crowded hotel pantry, was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, who was standing to his left between 3-6 feet away. Sirhan’s revolver held eight bullets, and as he was shooting, he was tackled by a group of large men who subdued him. All witnesses place Sirhan in front of Kennedy and all claim he was firing a gun.
Fact: As the autopsy definitively showed, RFK was shot from the rear at point blank range, three bullets entering his body, with the fatal head shot coming upward at a 45-degree angle from 1-3 inches behind his right ear. Not one bullet from Sirhan’s gun hit the Senator. In addition, an audio recording shows that many more bullets than the eight in Sirhan’s gun were fired in the hotel pantry that night. It was impossible for Sirhan to have killed RFK.
Let me repeat: More than one gunman, contrary to the government’s claims, equals a conspiracy. So why lie about that?
What is amazing is that the obvious conclusion to such simple syllogistic logic (Sirhan in front, bullets in the back, therefore…) that a child could understand has been dismissed by the authorities for fifty-one years. The fact that the government authorities – the LAPD, the Sheriff’s Office, the District Attorney, federal and state government officials, the FBI, the CIA – have from the start so assiduously done all in their power to pin the blame on “a lone assassin,” Sirhan, proves they are part of a coordinated cover-up, which in turn suggests their involvement in the crime.
The fact that Robert Kennedy was shot from the back and not the front where Sirhan was standing immediately brings to mind the Zapruder film that shows that JFK was killed from the front right and not from the 6th floor rear where Oswald was allegedly shooting from. That unexpected film evidence was hidden from the public for many years, but when it was finally seen, the case for a government conspiracy was solidified.
While no such video evidence has surfaced in the RFK case, the LAPD made sure that no photographic evidence contradicting the official lies would be seen. As Lisa Pease writes:
Less than two months after the assassination, the LAPD took the extraordinary step of burning some 2,400 photos from the case in Los Angeles County General’s medical waste incinerator. Why destroy thousands of photos in an incinerator if there was nothing to hide? The LAPD kept hundreds of innocuous crowd scene photos that showed no girl in a polka dot dress or no suspicious activities or individuals. Why were those photos preserved? Perhaps because those photos had nothing in them that warranted their destruction.
While “perhaps” is a mild word, the cover-up of “the girl in the polka dot dress” needs no perhaps. Dozens of people reported seeing a suspicious, curvaceous girl in a white dress with black polka dots with Sirhan in the pantry and other places. She was seen with various other men as well. The evidence for her involvement in the assassination is overwhelming, and yet the LAPD did all in its power to deny this by browbeating witnesses and by allowing her to escape.
Sandra Serrano, a Kennedy campaign worker and a courageous witness, was bullied by the CIA-connected police interrogator Sergeant Enrique “Hank” Hernandez. She had been sitting outside on a metal fire escape getting some air when the polka dot dress girl, accompanied by a man, ran out and down the stairs, shouting, “We’ve shot him, we’ve shot him.” When Serrano asked whom did they shoot, the girl replied, “We’ve shot Senator Kennedy.” Then she and her companion, both of whom Serrano had earlier seen ascending the stairs with Sirhan, disappeared into the night. A little over an hour after the shooting Serrano was interviewed on live television by NBC’s Sander Vanocur where she recounted this. And there were others who saw and heard this girl say the same thing as she and her companion fled the crime scene. Nevertheless, the LAPD, led by Lieutenant Manuel Pena, also CIA affiliated, who was brought out of retirement to run the investigation dubbed “Special Unit Senator,” worked with Hernandez and others to dismiss the girl as of no consequence.
Lisa Pease covers all this and much more. She shows how Sirhan was obviously hypnotized, how the trial was a farce, how the police destroyed evidence from the door frames in the pantry that proved more than the eight bullets in Sirhan’s gun were fired, how Officer DeWayne Wolfer manipulated the ballistic evidence, etc. Through years of digging into court records, archives, transcripts, the public library, and doing countless interviews, she proves without a doubt that Sirhan did not kill Kennedy and that the assassination and the cover-up were part of a very sophisticated intelligence operation involving many parts and players. She shows how no matter what route Kennedy took in the hotel that night, the killers had all exits covered and that he would not be allowed to leave alive.
While some of her more speculative points – e.g. that Robert Maheu (Howard Hughes/CIA) was “the most credible high-level suspect for the planner of Robert Kennedy’s assassination,” that Kennedy was shot twice in the head from behind, etc. are open to debate, they do not detract from her fundamentally powerful case that RFK, like his brother John, was assassinated by a CIA-run operation intended to silence their voices of courageous resistance to an expanding secret government dedicated to war, murder, and human exploitation. The U.S. government of today.
When Bobby Kennedy was entering the kitchen pantry, he was escorted by a security guard named Thane Eugene Cesar, a man long suspected of being the assassin. Cesar was carrying a gun that he drew but denied firing, despite witnesses’ claims to the contrary. Conveniently, the police never examined the gun. He has long been suspected of being CIA affiliated, and now Pease says she has found evidence to confirm that. She writes, “It’s hard to overstate the significance of finding a current or future CIA contract agent holding Kennedy’s right arm at the moment of the shooting.”
Yes, it is. As she rightly claims, the CIA takeover of America in the 1960s is the story of our time. And our time is now. None of this is ancient history. That is so crucial to grasp. For those who think that learning the truth about the 1960s assassinations is an exercise in futility reserved for those who are living in the past, they need to think again. Our descent into endless war and massive media propaganda to support it is part of a long-term project that began with the elimination of JFK, Malcom X, MLK, and Robert Kennedy. They were killed for reasons, and those reasons still exist, even if they don’t physically, but only in spirit. Their killers roam the land because they have become far more deeply part of the institutional structure of government and the media.
Pease says:
It was horrible that Robert Kennedy was taken from us far too soon. It is horrible that one man has borne the guilt for an operation he neither planned nor willingly participated in. It’s horrible the conspiracy was so obvious that bullets had to be lost and switched to hide it. And it’s horrible that the mainstream media has never dared to tell the people of this country that the government lied to us about what they really found when they looked into this case. Until the media can deal with the truth of the Robert Kennedy assassination, and until the people can be made aware of the CIA’s role in slanting the truth on topics of great importance, America’s very survival is in jeopardy….We’ve come perilously close to losing democracy itself because of fake, CIA-sponsored stories about our history. Should America ever become a dictatorship, the epitaph of our democracy must include the role the mainstream media, by bowing to the National Security state, played in killing it.
By writing A Lie Too Big To Fail, Lisa Pease has done her valiant part in refuting the lie that is now failing. Now it is up to all of us to spread the word of truth by focusing on the fundamental facts so we can finally take back our country from the CIA.
Then we can say with RFK and his favorite poet Aeschylus:
And even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.

“The Essence of Being Palestinian”: What the Great March of Return is Really About,dissidentvoice.org,Ramzy Baroud,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://dissidentvoice.org/2019/04/the-essence-of-being-palestinian-what-the-great-march-of-return-is-really-about/,"“The Essence of Being Palestinian”: What the Great March of Return is Really About by Ramzy Baroud / April 2nd, 2019
The aims of the Great March of Return protests, which began in Gaza on March 30, 2018 are to put an end to the suffocating Israeli siege and implementing the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees who were expelled from their homes and towns in historic Palestine 70 years earlier.
But there is much more to the March of Return than a few demands, especially bearing in mind the high human cost associated with it.
According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health , over 250 people have been killed and 6,500 wounded, including children, medics and journalists.
Aside from the disproportionately covered ‘flaming kites’ and youth symbolically cutting through the metal fences that have besieged them for many years, the March has been largely non-violent. Despite this, Israel has killed and maimed protesters with impunity.
A UN human rights commission of inquiry found last month that Israel may have committed war crimes against protesters, resulting in the killing of 189 Palestinians within the period March 30 and December 31, 2018.
The inquiry found “reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers shot at children, medics and journalists, even though they were clearly recognizable as such,” the investigators concluded as reported by BBC online.
Many in the media, however, still do not understand what the Great March of Return really means for Palestinians.
A cynically titled report in the Washington Post attempted to offer an answer. The article, “Gazans have paid in blood for a year of protests. Now many wonder what it was for,” selectively quoted wounded Palestinians who, supposedly, feel that their sacrifices were in vain.
Aside from providing the Israeli military with a platform to blame the Hamas Movement for the year-long march, the long report ended with these two quotes:
The March of Return “achieved nothing,” according to one injured Palestinian.
“The only thing I can find is that it made people pay attention,” said another.
If the Washington Post paid attention, it would have realized that the mood among Palestinians is neither cynical nor despairing.
The Post should have wondered: if the march ‘achieved nothing’, why were Gazans still protesting , and the popular and inclusive nature of the March has not been compromised?
“The Right of Return is more than a political position,” said Sabreen al-Najjar, the mother of young Palestinian medic, Razan, who, on June 1, 2018, was fatally shot by the Israeli army while trying to help wounded Palestinian protesters. It is “more than a principle: wrapped up in it, and reflected in literature and art and music, is the essence of what it means to be Palestinian. It is in our blood.”
Indeed, what is the ‘Great March of Return’ but a people attempting to reclaim their role, and be recognized and heard in the struggle for the liberation of Palestine?
What is largely missing from the discussion on Gaza is the collective psychology behind this kind of mobilization, and why it is essential for hundreds of thousands of besieged people to rediscover their power and understand their true position, not as hapless victims, but as agents of change in their society.
The narrow reading, or the misrepresentation of the March of Return, speaks volumes about the overall underestimation of the role of the Palestinian people in their struggle for freedom, justice and national liberation, extending for a century.
The story of Palestine is the story of the Palestinian people, for they are the victims of oppression and the main channel of resistance, starting with the Nakba – the creation of Israel on the ruins of Palestinian towns and villages in 1948. Had Palestinians not resisted, their story would have concluded then, and they, too, would have disappeared.
Those who admonish Palestinian resistance or, like the Post, fail to understand the underlying value of popular movement and sacrifices, have little understanding of the psychological ramifications of resistance – the sense of collective empowerment and hope which spreads amongst the people. In his introduction to Frantz Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth , Jean-Paul Sartre describes resistance, as it was passionately vindicated by Fanon, as a process through which “a man is re-creating himself.”
For 70 years, Palestinians have embarked on that journey of the re-creation of the self. They have resisted, and their resistance in all of its forms has molded a sense of collective unity, despite the numerous divisions that were erected amongst the people.
The March of Return is the latest manifestation of the ongoing Palestinian resistance.
It is obvious that elitist interpretations of Palestine have failed – Oslo proved a worthless exercise in empty clichés, aimed at sustaining American political dominance in Palestine as well as in the rest of the Middle East.
But the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993 shattered the relative cohesiveness of the Palestinian discourse, thus weakening and dividing the Palestinian people.
In the Israeli Zionist narrative, Palestinians are depicted as drifting lunatics, an inconvenience that hinders the path of progress – a description that regularly defined the relationship between every western colonial power and the colonized, resisting natives.
Within some Israeli political and academic circles, Palestinians merely ‘existed’ to be ‘cleansed’, to make room for a different, more deserving people. From the Zionist perspective, the ‘existence’ of the natives is meant to be temporary. “We must expel Arabs and take their place,” wrote Israel’s founding father, David Ben Gurion.
Assigning the roles of dislocated, disinherited and nomadic to the Palestinian people, without consideration for the ethical and political implications of such a perception, has erroneously presented Palestinians as a docile and submissive collective.
Hence, it is imperative that we develop a clearer understanding of the layered meanings behind the Great March of Return. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza did not risk life and limb over the last year simply because they required urgent medicine and food supplies.
Palestinians did so because they understand their centrality in their struggle. Their protests are a collective statement, a cry for justice, an ultimate reclamation of their narrative as a people – still standing, still powerful and still hopeful after 70 years of Nakba, 50 years of military occupation and 12 years of unrelenting siege."

Members of parliament have approved the nomination of Hillary Mutyambai as the new Inspector General of police.
The intelligence officer replaces Joseph Boinnet who is set to take up a Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) role in the Ministry of Tourism. The legislators urged him to prioritize ending extrajudicial killings.
Mutyambai said he will tame rogue police officers and perpetrators of extrajudicial killings.
“I will be practical in dealing with this. Many have come before me, found corruption and other vices within the service, and left. I will make a difference through leadership by integrity,” he told the lawmakers.
He also pledged to work closely with the Independent Police Oversight Authority (Ipoa) and the Internal Affairs Unit to help identify the rogue officers. Mutyambai promised to ensure full implementation of the National Police Management system and transform every police station into a service centre. “I will engage the National Police Service Commission (NPSC) and Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) to review the rates for house allowance for police,” he said.

It’s terrifying to contemplate how much more dangerous the world has become over the past six years. Things seemed precarious enough in late 2012, when we published our book, The Untold History of the United States , and began airing our 10-hour Showtime documentary. The situation seemed dire, but not desperate. Barack Obama, a disappointing though somewhat restrained proponent of American empire compared to his neocon predecessors, was about to be elected to a second term, having tamped down the worst excesses of the Bush-Cheney era. The United States had slowed rendition and repudiated torture, withdrawn troops from Iraq, negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran, pardoned Chelsea Manning, normalized relations with Cuba, and was reducing its military footprint in Afghanistan with complete withdrawal promised for 2014. Al Qaeda was on the run following bin Laden’s assassination and ISIS had yet to emerge. And the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists ’ Doomsday Clock stood at five minutes before midnight, which was sobering but significantly further from Armageddon than many times before. Ad Policy
Things, however, were far from rosy. Warnings about climate change had grown more urgent. NATO’s unabated expansion to Russia’s doorstep and extension of US missile defense in Eastern Europe and the United States’ Asia “pivot” had begun to poison relations with Russia and China. In Syria, Obama’s covert Timber-Sycamore program had breathed life into a moribund insurgency, which, combined with Assad’s brutal response, had left tens of thousands dead and displaced. In Obama’s final year in office, the United States dropped at least 26,172 tons of bombs in seven predominantly Muslim countries and US special forces operated in 138 countries. Obama authorized almost 10 times as many drone strikes as Bush, outspent Bush on the military, brokered far more arms sales overseas, and set new standards for secrecy and prosecution of whistle-blowers.
Now, more than six years later, as we’re about to issue the updated edition of Untold History , with a new chapter covering 2012 through January 2019, we’ve taken pause to reflect on how the world has devolved from dire to truly desperate. The crises that seemed contained or containable in late 2012 have now spiraled out of control, and the prospects for resolving them peacefully look depressingly bleak. Related Article The End of Our World Order Is Imminent Alfred McCoy
Yet the nightmare of the first two years–plus of the Trump presidency—marked by increased drone strikes, bombing levels, and defense spending combined with bigotry, mendacity, venality, and corruption at home—makes us long for the days of Obama. But it’s Trump’s nuclear and environmental recklessness that keeps us up at night and prompted us to call the new chapter “How the Unthinkable Became Thinkable Again.” In January 2018, the experts at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the hands of the Doomsday Clock to two minutes before midnight, where it had stood during the darkest days of the Cold War, from 1953 to 1960. The latest move of the hands was precipitated by the recklessness in Trump’s nuclear thinking and the deepening crisis over Korea. Trump wondered aloud about the point of having nuclear weapons if he couldn’t use them. His answer was to make them more usable, which he did with his new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), the first since Obama’s 2010 NPR, which had reduced the role of nuclear weapons in the US defense posture. The 2018 NPR significantly elevated their role, permitting use in response to vaguely defined “extreme circumstances,” such as cyberattacks or attacks on the infrastructure of both the United States and its “allies and partners.” The review doubled down on Obama’s unconscionable 30-year trillion-dollar modernization of all parts of the nuclear arsenal. The actual cost looks to be closer to $1.7 trillion and climbing. To make matters worse, all eight other nuclear powers are undertaking their own modernizations, though on a far more modest scale. Russia, it should be noted, actually cut its defense spending this past year.
Just two weeks earlier, the new National Defense Strategy identified China and Russia, not international terrorism, as the nation’s top security threats, officially burying the short-lived fantasy of a unipolar world that neocon theorist Charles Krauthammer had triumphantly proclaimed in 1990 and then performed last rites over in 2006, following the debacles in Afghanistan and Iraq. Acting like a hegemon, the United States, starting in 1999, took advantage of Russian weakness and broke its promise not to expand NATO, eventually adding 13 countries, the last of which was Montenegro, in 2017. When Bush announced plans to incorporate Georgia and Ukraine, Putin drew the line. Following the US-backed Ukrainian coup, he took back Crimea and made clear that there are limits to his toleration of NATO expansion. In his March 1, 2018, Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly, he went further, throwing down the gauntlet to the United States. Russia, he acknowledged, had been on the defensive since the Soviet Union collapsed, having lost substantial amounts of its territory, population, GDP, industrial potential, and military capability. It depended on the IMF and World Bank for survival. The United States ignored its appeals not to abrogate the ABM Treaty in 2002 and expanded its global missile-defense system, leaving Russia vulnerable to a US attack. A 2006 article in Foreign Affairs contending that neither Russia or China could even retaliate against a US first strike “sent heads spinning” in Russia, The Washington Post reported, “with visions of Dr. Strangelove.”
But now, in March 2018, Putin was declaring that the US effort had failed. He unveiled the existence of five new nuclear weapons, all of which could circumvent US missile-defense systems. He concluded defiantly, “I hope everything that has been said today will sober any potential aggressor,” adding, “No one listened to us. Listen to us now.” Independent Russian military analyst Aleksandr Golts said that all the weapons experts he had spoken to were “in shock, as was I.” Related Article Planet Earth Is Doomed. How Do I Go On? Liza Featherstone
The crises in Ukraine and Syria and the NATO expansion in Eastern Europe and the Baltics threatened to erupt into armed conflicts. Though liberal media and many Democrats denounced Trump as Putin’s patsy, US bombing of Syria, sale of lethal arms to Ukraine, pressure on Angela Merkel to disavow the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, ouster of dozens of Russian diplomats, and attempts to overthrow Putin ally Maduro in Venezuela had actually ratcheted up tensions following Obama’s departure. These conflicts, combined with the largely hypocritical and hyperbolic outrage over Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections, had brought relations between the two countries that possessed more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons to their lowest point since 1962. And when things looked like they couldn’t get any worse, Trump, goaded by foreign-policy hawks John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, announced US withdrawal from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty—a treaty that Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman had described as “probably the most successful treaty in [the] history of arms control.” If that wasn’t enough of a blow to nuclear-arms control, Trump clearly signaled that he had no intention of extending the New START Treaty beyond its February 2021 expiration date—threatening to plunge the world back into a 1980s-style nuclear-arms race in which the US, the USSR, and their allies brandished nuclear arsenals with close to 70,000 weapons and a destructive capability equal to 1.5 million Hiroshima bombs. Current Issue View our current issue
Relations between the United States and China have also taken a dangerous turn for the worse as China bristles at US containment policy and responds with an increasingly hard-line stance in the East and South China Seas, including a buildup of military fortifications on its man-made islands. Trump’s trade wars and the US Navy’s “freedom-of-navigation” operations in those contested waterways have produced confrontations that threaten to spiral out of control. These heightened tensions have probably contributed to North Korea’s increasing defiance in response to unrealistic US demands for “denuclearization.” It was barely a year ago that the two countries were on the verge of war. The world quaked until South Korean President Moon Jae-in managed to bring both sides to the bargaining table. But the talks have again broken down, and the return to open hostilities seems a real and frightening possibility.
Infuriating not only Russia and China but also European US allies, Trump also pulled the United States out of the six-party nuclear deal with Iran—a deal that was working in the US and its allies’ interest and blocking Iran’s path to developing nuclear weapons. Talk of war with Iran, cheered on by Israel’s right-wing Netanyahu government, is again being heard in Washington.
And on top of potential United States confrontations with Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, the dangerous standoff between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan over Kashmir was just reignited by attacks on Indian forces by Pakistani-linked terrorists. India and Pakistan bombed each other’s forces, and the pressure on both governments to escalate remains high.
On top of this, we have the rapid and accelerating drift toward planetary disaster exacerbated by the climate change–denying troglodytes in the Trump administration.
So when we step back and carefully examine in the updated edition of our book what has happened over the past six-plus years, we see a world hurtling blindly toward disaster. In 1942, at a very different time in history, Franklin Roosevelt discussed a postwar world in which the United States, Russia, China, and Britain would work together to ensure peace and prosperity across the planet. Vice President Henry Wallace had an equally compelling democratic vision for creating a peaceful and more equitable, nuclear-free world. Such leaders who privilege the interests of the planet above those of military and financial elites have never been more desperately needed, but, tragically, never have they been more absent.

Kushner working to increase legal immigration: report,thehill.com,Michael Burke,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437091-kushner-working-to-increase-legal-immigration-report,"
Politico , citing four people involved in discussions, reported Wednesday that Kushner is developing a plan that would increase the number of low- and high-skilled workers allowed to enter the country each year. ADVERTISEMENT
Development of the proposal reportedly began in January, when Kushner began meeting with dozens of advocacy groups. Talks have since continued among a four-person group within the White House, led by Kushner, and a proposal could be submitted to Congress by this summer, according to Politico.
The news outlet also noted that President Trump Donald John Trump Tim Ryan expected to announce bid for presidency this week: report Kushner's security clearance was denied due to concerns of foreign influence: report Morgan Ortagus named as new State Dept spokeswoman MORE personally tasked Kushner with coming up with a plan on legal immigration.
The plan would need to be approved by Stephen Miller, Politico noted, adding that the White House senior adviser is especially hawkish on immigration and has previously worked to reduce legal immigration.
Trump said during his State of the Union address earlier this year that he wanted legal immigration ""in the largest numbers ever,"" Politico added.
News of the policy push comes as Trump has continued to take a hard stance on immigration, threatening in recent days to close off the border entirely.
Trump, citing a crisis at the border, said last week that he would consider shuttering the border. He has continued to make that threat this week, telling reporters on Tuesday in the Oval Office that he would ""100 percent"" close the border if Congress doesn't pass stricter immigration laws.
However, with Republicans warning that closing the border could have devastating impacts on the economy, Trump appeared to pull back from the threat on Tuesday evening. The president claimed during remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner that Mexico was now cooperating in apprehending migrants before they can reach the U.S. border.

The Politico–Morning Consult poll released Wednesday found that 59 percent of voters said they don't have much or any trust at all in the president on health care.
The poll also found that a plurality of voters support the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare. Almost half of voters, 47 percent, said they approve of the health care law, compared to 41 percent who said they disapprove of it. ADVERTISEMENT
Additionally, 45 percent of voters said they trust Democrats more than Republicans in Congress on health care, while 35 percent said they have more trust in Republicans.
""As health care is pushed to the forefront of the 2020 agenda, our polling suggests President Trump may struggle to attract voters with his promise of a new plan,” Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult’s vice president, told Politico.
The findings come after the Trump administration last week called for the entirety of the Affordable Care Act to be struck down. Trump pledged that Republicans would become the ""party of health care"" and said the GOP would come up with a “far better” health care proposal than ObamaCare.
However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he told Trump earlier this week that the Senate would not work on a comprehensive health care package ahead of the 2020 elections.
“I made clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate,” McConnell said he told the president. “He did say, as he later tweeted, that he accepted that and he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign.”
Trump said Monday night that Republicans were developing a health care plan and that a vote will be taken following next year's elections."

Pope Francis' apostolic exhortation, Christus Vivit , was published on April 2.
Archbishop Georges Pontier opened the French bishops' conference meeting at Lourdes this week with the observation that the ""Church (is) in trouble"" before moving on to speak of economic and social concerns both at a national and European level.
Responding to the turmoil experienced by many members of the faithful, he concluded his speech by explaining the sources of his hope. In a period of crisis, the faith is a sure guide, he said.
In his post-synodal apostolic exhortation, Christus Vivit , published on Tuesday, Pope Francis offers his own reasons for hope.
Reflecting on the conclusions of last autumn's Synod assembly on youth, the pope specifically designates young people as a resource ""to help the Church to remain young.""
He says this is important at a time when there are those who prefer rigid frameworks and ready-made answers to creativity and risk taking. These people help ""make (the Church) grow old, encase her in the past, hold her back or keep her at a standstill,"" the pope warns.
On the other hand, Francis notes that there are others who want the Church to show signs of being modern by conforming to the prevailing mores of our age without recognizing its own differences.
But a youthful Church, for the pope, is one that allows itself to be renewed by the message entrusted to it and is open to challenges to remain faithful.
Young people can therefore assist the Church through their words, criticisms and initiatives.
""They can stop (the Church) from becoming corrupt; they can keep her moving forward, prevent her from being proud and sectarian, help her to be poorer and to bear better witness, to take the side of the poor and the outcast, to fight for justice and humbly to let herself be challenged,"" Pope Francis suggests.
And he voices the conviction that young people are precious because they prevent the Church from ""becoming a museum"". "

Pope Francis has appointed Msgr. Patrick Descourtieux, a French official at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), to oversee the Vatican's relations with Catholic traditionalists. These include members of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX or ""Lefebvrists""), an anti-Vatican II clerical group founded by the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.
The move was announced on March 30. It comes less than two months after the pope suppressed the Pontifical Commission ""Ecclesia Dei,"" which John Paul II created in 1988 to deal with followers of the late schismatic Archbishop Lefebvre.
Msgr. Descourtieux, 61, spent the past ten years working at the now defunct commission. He succeeds Archbishop Guido Pozzo, former head of ""Ecclesia Dei"", as the Vatican's liaison with the ""Lefebvrists"" and other traditionalist groups.
Descourtieux was ordained for the Archdiocese of Paris in 1986 and spent his first three years working in a parish in the city. In 1989, he was sent to Rome and worked for ten years in the French-speaking section of the Vatican's Secretariat of State.
During this period, he was also the organist at the principal French national church in Rome, Saint Louis des Français.
After finishing his service at the Secretariat of State in 1999 Msgr. Descourtieux was named rector of the Santa Trinità dei Monti, the Rome titular church of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin of Lyon and location of a prestigious French girl's school. During his seven years as rector, he also taught at the Augustinianum, the Pontifical Institute for Patristics.
After the female religious order in charge of the Trinità dei Monti institute was replaced by men religious from the Jerusalem Fraternity (and now the Emmanuel Community), Msgr. Descourtieux returned to Paris in 2008 where served as a chaplain at the Cathedral of Notre Dame.
During this time also taught patristics at the Notre Dame Faculty of the Cathedral College. Traditionalists satisfied
Traditionalist circles have welcomed Msgr. Descourtieux's new appointment, noting he has a good understanding of pre-Vatican II liturgy.
They say he is ready to listen to those faithful who desire to celebrate Mass according to the Tridentine rite.
In Paris, Descourtieux was one of the diocesan priests delegated to celebrate the in the Old Rite.
In an opinion piece published in L'Homme Nouveau magazine, Jacques Bégué, who writes on the Society of St Pius X, also characterized the appointment as a ""favorable sign.""
""Msgr. Descourtieux has always tried to help all traditionalist groups, but he has developed particularly close links with various representatives of the SSPX, links that are all the more relaxed and confident since he was well known for his 'openness' in managing the (SSPX's) file,"" Bégué wrote. Ecclesia Dei abolished
The ""Ecclesia Dei"" Commission was launched in 1988 after Archbishop Lefebvre caused a schism. It was a way of reaching out to traditionalists who wished to stay faithful to Rome.
One of the commission's main tasks these past 30 years was to facilitate dialogue with the Society of St. Pius X, which has its headquarters in Ecône, Switzerland.
Several traditionalist websites have claimed that the SSPX actually wanted the commission to be abolished so it could conduct its dialogue directly with the CDF.
Will discussions between Rome and Ecône once again center on doctrinal issues as a result of these changes?
Until now, Pope Francis has chosen a much more pragmatic and pastoral approach. "

This is the first part of an article by Father Antonio Spadaro SJ that appeared in La Civiltà Cattolica .
He is alive and wants you to be alive!
This is how Pope Francis begins his new apostolic exhortation, which he signed on March 25, 2019. This exclamation summarizes the underlying meaning of Bergoglio's text, whose title is Christus Vivit , Christ is alive.
""Life,"" ""living,"" ""alive"" are terms repeated throughout the text some 280 times, just as many times as the word ""young,"" which is the key to the exhortation. A life lived to the full: this is the heart of the thinking of Francis concerning young people.
The pages turn over quickly, full of energy as though to shake us or literally exhort us to a full life. Youth does not exist: young people do
In a book-length interview called God is Young Francis specified that ""youth does not exist. When we talk about youth, we are often unconsciously referring to myths about youth. I like to think that youth does not exist, only young people."" Young people cannot be categorized as a separate caste.
Certainly, we can say with St. Paul VI that the age of youth ""should not be considered the age of free passions, unavoidable failure, insuperable crises, decadent pessimism, harmful egoism; being young is a grace, it is a blessing.""
And it is a grace and a blessing given to all, for all of us are or have been young. Speaking of young people, then, means speaking of being human. Beyond all other considerations, the Church sees in them the instincts for happiness and fullness of those who are open to life.
Christus Vivit is a link in a chain.
It can certainly be read as a stand-alone text, but it is good to be clearly aware that the pope has ""made his own"" a complex and rich writing process that saw the involvement of hundreds of young people: the 15th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the theme ""Young People, Faith and Vocational Discernment,"" which took place in Rome, October 3-28, 2018, and produced its own Final Document.
Speaking about young people means speaking of promises. Every young person is something of a prophet. The Synod was called to gather and interpret this prophecy. Christus Vivit is part of this hermeneutical work. The exhortation consists of nine chapters. Let us gather the keys to what Francis says as they appear in the text. He is alive and wants you to be alive!
The opening chapter is a rapid series of close ups of some of the young people in the Bible. It is very readable as the pope is not making a great speech, but just gathering synthetically some characteristics, actions, deeds … sketches that can be used to compose a big picture.
Thus, we see a God who inspires young people in their dreams (Joseph) and goes out to choose his elect among those whom others ignore (David).
And we have sincere young people who do not sweeten the harshness of life (Gideon), insecure youngsters who know how to be courageous (Samuel), young people who feel lost before their responsibilities, but who know how to react wisely (Solomon) or reawaken the consciences of their people (Jeremiah), young people who are examples of generosity at times of disgrace (Ruth), or an anonymous girl who ended up in service to the wife of Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram who knew how to intelligently help her ""master.""
The same sketching technique is used for the New Testament, where young people appear who are willing to undergo a profound change in their lives, to learn.
The pope writes: ""Young people are not meant to become discouraged; they are meant to dream great things, to seek vast horizons, to aim higher, to take on the world, to accept challenges and to offer the best of themselves to the building of something better"" (No. 15).
There is even a boy who has ""given up his youth"" (No. 18). This is a strong expression and concerns a person who came to Jesus seeking ""something more,"" but who then goes away sadly. In this way, renouncing youthfulness is to live distractedly, asleep, ""skimming the surface of life"" (No. 19).
The second chapter fleshes out the figure of ""youthfulness."" We are not just looking at intuitions about the phenomenology of youth. We have a face: The face of Jesus. The pope sees youthfulness there. Christ too is presented with some characteristics, and he is painted with some imagination.
Jesus is a young person immersed in relationships. Let us read the picture Francis draws referring to the caravan of families going up to Jerusalem: ""Jesus was there, mingling with the others, joking with other young people, listing to the adults tell stories and sharing the joys and sorrows of the group.
Indeed, the Greek word that Luke uses to describe the group – synodía – clearly evokes a larger 'community on a journey' of which the Holy Family is a part. Thanks to the trust of his parents, Jesus can move freely and learn to journey with others"" (No. 29).
Here we see this particular way of being in the caravan, which the pope connects to the term ""synod,"" that is, the very ecclesial event that generated this apostolic exhortation.
A synodal Church is one that knows how to be young and part of the world engaging in the world of relationships without pulling back into an elitist, separate place.
It is a caravan: this is an image of the Church. It is also a way of living in the world with projects, ""lest we create projects that isolate young people from their family and the larger community, or turn them into a select few, protected from all contamination.
Rather, we need projects that can strengthen them, accompany them and impel them to encounter others, to engage in generous service, in mission"" (No. 30). Restlessness, key to holiness and mission of the Church
This is how the Church is called to be (cf. Nos. 34-42): free from sclerosis and from being unmoved, able to fight for justice, being humble. But Francis knows that many young people do not consider the Church to be significant for their lives.
Indeed, sometimes they find the Church invasive and irritating (cf. No. 40). When the Church is defensive and does not listen, it transforms into a ""museum"" (No. 41). So, here is the question: How can the Church embrace the dreams of the young?
The pope does not remain at the abstract level, but traces some other images, short portraits of 12 young saints who are the natural continuation of the sketches of the biblical figures: from St. Sebastian in the third century to Blessed Chiara Badano who died in 1990.
Looking at the dreams and interests of young people, the Church understands that its own identity is closely tied to its task, to its mission.
The pope finds in Mary the full image of the Church. But it is interesting to note he defines her as restless or ""energetic"" (No. 46). Restlessness is, in sum, the key to holiness and the mission of the Church.
The third chapter of the exhortation is dedicated to reading the situation of the young people today, and so precisely their restlessness. This reading has no intention of being exhaustive but makes ample reference to the Final Document of the Synod.
Francis writes at the beginning of Christus Vivit : ""In this way, my words will echo the myriad voices of believers the world over who made their opinions known to the Synod. Those young people who are not believers, yet wished to share their thoughts, also raised issues that led me to ask new questions"" (No. 4).
The word of the pope, then, takes up and is even charged – almost electrically – by the voices of believers and non-believers. And he does so with sacral respect.
In fact, he writes: ""Each young person's heart should thus be considered 'holy ground,' a bearer of seeds of divine life, before which we must 'take off our shoes' in order to draw near and enter more deeply into the Mystery"" (No. 67).
From the synodal dynamic a method strongly emerges that is confirmed by the apostolic exhortation of Francis: before interpreting or making choices, you need to listen, you need to know the reality.
You need to be made restless, or disturbed by reality. You cannot hear the young people if you do not walk with them along the ways of the world.
Gathered in the synod hall, the pastors of the Church became aware that the Gospel message the Church treasures can only be transmitted by walking along the way with young people. Indeed, within the people of God they can even go before us.
The icon that accompanied the reflections of the synod was that of the disciples of Emmaus. It is used again by Francis in his exhortation (cf. Nos. 156, 236, 292, 296). The entire third chapter of the exhortation confirms this method of journeying together.
The first thing that we note by listening is that the voices are too different to be confused into a single voice. Polyphony is indispensable. We cannot lump everything together as one and the same.
As we said at the beginning: we cannot speak of ""youth"" in general. If we listen to them and walk with them, all the differences and diversities of their voices emerge. Young people of a world in crisis
And yet despite their differences, in the title of one paragraph the pope does not hesitate to speak of ""Young people of a world in crisis."" And crisis is the fruit of violence, persecution, abuse, addiction and exclusion of many kinds.
The worst response to all this would be ""anesthesia"": becoming so used to this colonization of the mind and the soul, losing sensitivity, remaining at the level of appearances and ignoring what is unwanted, poor, ugly and leftover.
The antidote exists: it consists in seeing things through eyes full of tears.
These are the questions Francis asks: ""Can I weep? Can I weep when I see a child who is starving, on drugs or on the street, homeless, abandoned, mistreated or exploited as a slave by society? Or is my weeping only the self-centered whining of those who cry because they want something else?"" (No. 76).
The pope sees in young people ""desires, hurts and longings"" and recalls that the synod identified three themes of great importance (cf. Final Document, Nos. 21-31, and in the Exhortation, Nos. 86-102).
He takes them up as they were written and quotes them at length. These are: the digital environment, migration and the drama of abuse.
The digital environment is understood not only as an instrument of communication, but also as the context for a widely digitalized culture. Francis is very clear in identifying the digital as a context of ""social and political engagement and active citizenship"" (No. 87).
In this sense he touches a very hot topic in our society: a problem, but also a challenge to be embraced. We cannot pretend that the network does not exist and we have to take note that consent is formed through the digital sphere.
Dissatisfaction, especially, is expressed there. How can we make the network a form of democratic participation without falling into the pitfalls of demagogy?
Migrations are understood as an ""epitome of our time."" The phenomenon is described in its effects of suffering and abuse, as well as xenophobic sentiments. The Church today is called to play a prophetic role. This is certainly another burning theme.
The drama of abuse is articulated in its forms tied to power, to the economy, conscience and sexuality.
Francis comments: ""This dark cloud also challenges all young people who love Jesus Christ and his Church: they can be a source of great healing if they employ their great capacity to bring about renewal, to urge and demand consistent witness, to keep dreaming and coming up with new ideas"" (No. 100).
A theme present throughout the exhortation is that of the defense of the rights of women and the need for reciprocity (Nos. 42 and 81) between men and women.
The pope speaks of this in No. 42: ""Instead, a living Church can react by being attentive to the legitimate claims of those women who seek greater justice and equality.
A living Church can look back on history and acknowledge a fair share of male authoritarianism, domination, various forms of enslavement, abuse and sexist violence.
With this outlook, she can support the call to respect women's rights, and offer convinced support for greater reciprocity between males and females, while not agreeing with everything some feminist groups propose.""
We should note the move from the word ""complementarity"" to the word ""reciprocity.""
Complementarity seems more static and gives women one role and men another. In some way this crystalizes the relationships in a game of characterizations that do not respect the concrete life of a male-female couple.
Christian revelation puts into discussion, then, a platonic concept of human nature that interprets difference as if it were destined to disappear into the unity of love from which, by fusion, a complete human being would arise. We note finally that in No. 245 Francis speaks of the lack of the example of liderazgo femenino , that is, of ""leading female role models within the Church."" The 'great message'
The fourth chapter is the central one for the exhortation. It is dedicated to the ""great message for all young people"" and contains ""three great truths that all of us need constantly to keep hearing"" (No. 111).
The first is ""God loves you."" This message is disarmingly simple. Yet this is the very point of the Christian message. ""It makes no difference whether you have already heard it or not. I want to remind you of it. God loves you. Never doubt this, whatever may happen to you in life. At every moment, you are infinitely loved"" (No. 112).
Above all, God is not a hard disk . His memory is a ""heart filled with tender compassion"" (No. 115). Without this truth in Christianity everything falls to pieces.
The pastoral work of Francis is striking for how it corrects the image of a false, dusty and heavy God. We have overloaded the image of God with ideas that distance him from his true image as lover of life.
The second ""great truth"" that Francis expresses in the fourth chapter of Christus Vivit is that ""Christ, out of love, sacrificed himself completely in order to save you.""
And the truth becomes an appeal for action: ""Look to his cross, cling to him, let him save you"" (No. 119). This love that goes as far as the cross overcomes all our fragilities and contradictions.
Indeed, Christ writes his history of love with us through our ""problems, frailties and flaws"" (No. 120). Nothing and nobody are cast aside by the cross.
The third is that Jesus Christ is alive: ¡Él vive! He is not just a good example from the past.
Bergoglio asks: ""See Jesus as happy, overflowing with joy. Rejoice with him as with a friend who has triumphed. They killed him, the holy one, the just one, the innocent one, but he triumphed in the end.
Evil does not have the last word. Nor will it have the last word in your life, for you have a friend who loves you and wants to triumph in you. Your Savior lives"" (No. 126).
We can see a triumph, a formidable exultation in these words, as though they were the direct fruit of the joy of resurrection. This is what converts, not just ""an ethical choice or a lofty idea"" (No. 129).
So here are the three great truths of the faith: ""God loves you; Christ is your savior; he is alive"" (No. 130). "
PolitiFact: Sen. Taylor misfires with claim against Mayor Barrett on youth prisons,www.politifact.com,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/apr/02/lena-taylor/state-sen-taylor-misfires-claim-against-milwaukee-/,"Says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett did not want a juvenile facility in Milwaukee, ""has never been to a juvenile facility,"" and ""didn't want it to be done."" — Lena Taylor on Thursday, March 14th, 2019 in a community meeting State Sen. Taylor misfires with claim against Milwaukee Mayor Barrett on youth prisons By D.L. Davis on Tuesday, April 2nd, 2019 at 4:19 p.m. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas attended a ""Dinners with Winners"" event with youths at Milwaukee's Ujima House on Nov. 14, 2018. (Courtesy Jermaine Reed).
Wisconsin’s juvenile correctional facilities have been in turmoil since about 2012, when the sexual assault of a Racine County youth was mishandled by officials at Lincoln Hills School for Boys.
In February 2012 , Racine County Circuit Judge Richard Kreul wrote to Gov. Scott Walker about one of his cases. Kreul wrote that a Lincoln Hills inmate from Racine was forced to perform a sex act on his roommate and then beaten unconscious. Lincoln Hills workers delayed getting the victim medical treatment for three hours because other inmates were playing a basketball game, according to reports.
Racine County officials responded by pulling all their youth offenders from Lincoln Hills.
Since then, there has been a string of additional scandals, and the state faces a Jan. 1, 2021 deadline to shutter the facility (Gov. Tony Evers has sought to extend that deadline). The plan calls for multiple regional facilities that are smaller than Lincoln Hills. One of two new youth prisons will be built in the Milwaukee area.
But where should it be located? That has been a critical issue.
The state has identified a location on city-owned land at North Teutonia Avenue and West Mill Road, just south of the city's Safety Academy.
""This decision was made without input from my office, the community or Milwaukee County and no further details have been provided about this facility,"" Common Council President Ashanti Hamilton said in a March 12, 2019 news release .
The site is in Hamilton’s district. He hosted a March 14, 2019 community meeting , which was attended by about 100 residents and grew heated at times. Officials in nearby Glendale have also opposed the state’s selection of the Teutonia Avenue site.
At the meeting, state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, sharply criticized Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, describing him and his actions this way:
""The mayor who didn't want the children here in the first place, who has never been to a juvenile facility, who didn't want it to be done, should not be the voice at all.""
That caught our attention, since Barrett had been a critic of Lincoln Hills, located in Irma in Lincoln County -- about three and a half hours from Milwaukee -- and an advocate for creating a facility closer to the families of inmates.
Is Taylor right that Barrett did not want a juvenile facility in Milwaukee, ""has never been to a juvenile facility,"" and didn't want it to be done at all?
The background
A spate of proposals, including community halfway houses and a 2018 proposal for Milwaukee County to open a treatment center for male teens on Milwaukee's north side, have come and gone, as officials struggled to find an appropriate location for a new facility.
On March 12, 2019 , Evers announced that two new youth facilities would be built: The Milwaukee one and one northwest of Appleton, in the town of Hortonia. Evers’ budget calls for spending nearly $200 million on the smaller replacement youth prison facilities.
We reached out to Taylor’s office to seek backup for her claim, but her staff did not respond to repeated requests via phone and email.
We did find a Feb. 9, 2016 FOX6 news report in which Barrett said he was in favor of protecting the youths from possible abuse at Lincoln Hills, but said ""I don’t want the ramifications of that to affect public safety in Milwaukee. I’m very concerned about that.""
Does that amount to opposition? Sort of. At least at the time.
The Barrett record
When we reached out to Jodie Tabak, Barrett’s communications director, she noted things have changed since the 2016 news report.
""The idea being pushed at the time by the county was focused on group homes,"" Tabak said. ""At that time, Mayor Barrett expressed his concerns about violent offenders and violent repeat offenders who should be in a secure facility, closer to families, receiving services and not in group homes in neighborhoods.""
As for Taylor’s three criticisms, here is a closer look:
-- ""Didn’t want the children here in the first place.""
In addition to the information above, on July 13, 2016 , Barrett told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Lincoln Hills was a failed ""experiment."" He said he wanted the state to take immediate steps to reopen Ethan Allen School for Boys, the Waukesha County juvenile correctional facility shut down five years earlier by Gov. Walker.
""The question becomes what happens to the young people there. And some of the young people need to be in a secure facility,"" Barrett said at the time. ""And from a logistics standpoint, from a cost standpoint, from a programmatic standpoint, from a staffing standpoint, Ethan Allen provides an opportunity that must be explored very, very quickly.""
Waukesha County officials objected, saying it would be too costly to reopen Ethan Allen.
In any case, Barrett was on the record for being in favor of having the youth moved closer -- though not specifically in Milwaukee.
-- ""Has never been to a juvenile facility.""
On this point, Tabak said Barrett ""recently had dinner at a local facility where youth are under court order to be there, including those that have been to Lincoln Hills.""
Tabak said the Nov. 14, 2018 dinner took place at Ujima House.
In a March 7, 2019, opinion piece for Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service , Executive Director Jermaine Reed described Ujima House as ""a non-secure facility in the heart of the inner-city of Milwaukee.""
In a telephone interview, Reed said although some of the youths do wear monitoring bracelets, the shelter is ""not a correctional facility"" but ""our services are sometimes used as an alternative to corrections. We have had youth on a GPS monitoring system. If they violate their conditions of release they could be sent to detention or possibly Lincoln Hills.""
So, the visit to Ujima House was to something very different than to a Lincoln Hills-style facility.
In a followup email, Tabak said the mayor has visited several correctional facilities.
""He has been to St. Rose’s, Lakeside (St. A’s), State Correctional Facility in Racine, Taycheedah, Vel Phillips Center, Felmers Chaney Center in the heart of the City, the County corrections facility in Franklin, the downtown jail and Waupun. He has not been to Lincoln Hills, but he’s obviously been to many juvenile and adult corrections facilities.""
-- Who ""didn't want it to be done.""
As noted, Barrett initially proposed reopening Ethan Allen, in Waukesha County’s Town of Delafield. Two years later , Barrett had dropped the Waukesha County idea and supported a Milwaukee facility.
Our rating
Taylor said Tom Barrett did not want a juvenile facility in Milwaukee, ""has never been to a juvenile facility"" and ""didn't want it to be done.""
The mayor was opposed to early plans, but mainly because of concerns about the possibility of violent offenders being placed in neighborhood group homes instead of a secure facility. While he initially suggested reopening Ethan Allen in Waukesha County, he has backed a city site.
As for the visit to a juvenile facility, while Ujima House is a far cry from Lincoln Hills, the mayor has visited numerous other facilities.
For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. Advertisement"

An important development has taken place between the Christian and Muslim populations of the Castors and Yakité neighborhoods of Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic.
Led by Fabrice Dekoua, a Christian, and Ibrahim Abdourahman, a Muslim, young people from the two areas of Bangui's Third District signed a non-violence agreement on March 25.
In 2018, a May 1 attack on Our Lady of Fatima Parish in which the Muslim armed group ""Force"" killed at least 16 Christians, including the parish priest, Father Albert Toungoumale Baba, plunged the Castors Christian community and the Yakité Muslim community into a cycle of violence and reprisals.
As a result, young people took up arms to ""defend their community.""
But the devastated communities had difficulty in accepting a series of reconciliation efforts launched by Cardinal Dieudonné Nzapalainga of Bangui. Two leaders
""At the time, I asked the two communities to dialogue and to meet together because mistrust was amplifying the conflict,"" Cardinal Nzapalainga said.
""However, only two young people, Fabrice Dekoua, and Ibrahim Abdouraman, one a Christian and the other a Muslim, agreed to meet.
""In the beginning it was difficult because no one wanted to join them,"" he said.
""Some later joined and came to appreciate that they had been used by the enemies of peace,"" the cardinal noted.
By raising awareness in their communities and encouraging their peers to meet, Dekoua and Abdourahman succeeded in getting young people to choose peace in order to build their future.
""In order to put an end to anything that could cause violence against others, we have taken the initiative of signing an agreement,"" explained Dekoua.
""This agreement represents the commitment that we have in our hearts and we have now written it down on paper,"" he continued.
Cardinal Nzapalainga, who collaborated with the two young men on several occasions, says there are good reasons for optimism over the duration of the agreement even though there are ""enemies of peace who could destroy it from one day to the next."" Conflict dating from 2013
Many armed groups have battled each other since the fall of President François Bozize in 2013.
The former president was overthrown by a coup d'état fomented by a coalition of mostly Muslim armed groups from the north of the country and mercenaries from Chad and Sudan.
The group, which was known as the Seleka coalition, retreated to the north of the country following a French military intervention in December 2013.
Meanwhile, ""anti-Balaka"" self-defense militia comprised of animists and Christians had been launched in response to Seleka.
These militia began to attack Muslims, giving the conflict a religious dimension.
According to several observers, armed groups are continuing to fight primarily for control of diamond and uranium resources. "
Pope Francis calls for a listening Church in latest exhortation,international.la-croix.com,La Croix International staff,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/pope-francis-calls-for-a-listening-church-in-latest-exhortation/9807,"Religion Pope Francis calls for a listening Church in latest exhortation 'Let us ask the Lord to free the Church from those who would make her grow old, encase her in the past, hold her back or keep her at a standstill' La Croix International staff Pope Francis greets young people in Panama at World Youth Day 2019 (Vatican Media)
Pope Francis in his April 2 document on the youth, Christus vivit (Christ is Alive) calls for a listening Church.
""A Church always on the defensive, which loses her humility and stops listening to others, which leaves no room for questions, loses her youth and turns into a museum,"" he says.
Pope Francis on March 25 signed his apostolic exhortation to the world's young people representing the fruit of the October Synod of Bishops' special assembly on Young People, the Faith, and Vocational Discernment.
Addressed to young people and to ""the entire People of God"" it was released to the public April 2, the anniversary of the death of St. John Paul II.
The document is composed of nine chapters.
Following are the excerpts from each chapter. Chapter 1: What does the Word of God have to say about young people?
Francis recalls that ""in an age when young people were not highly regarded, some Biblical texts show that God sees them differently.""
For him age did not establish privileges, and being young did not imply lesser worth or dignity Chapter 2: Jesus, ever young
The pope addresses the theme of Jesus' youthful years and remembers the Gospel story that describes Jesus ""as an adolescent, when he had returned with his parents to Nazareth, after being lost and found in the Temple.""
Francis then speaks of the youth of the Church and writes: ""Let us ask the Lord to free the Church from those who would make her grow old, encase her in the past, hold her back or keep her at a standstill.""
He presents ""Mary, the young woman from Nazareth,"" and her Yes as that of ""someone willing to take a risk, ready to stake everything she had, with no more security than the certainty of knowing that she was the bearer of a promise. Chapter 3: You are the 'now' of God
We cannot just say that ""young people are the future of our world,"" says Pope Francis.
""They are its present; even now, they are helping to enrich it."" For this reason it is necessary to listen to them even if ""there is a tendency to provide prepackaged answers and ready-made solutions.""
""Many young people are taken in by ideologies, used and exploited as cannon fodder or a strike force to destroy, terrify or ridicule others"" hence the pope invites young people to learn to weep for their peers who are worse off than they are.
Referring to ""desires, hurts, and longings,"" Pope Francis speaks about sexuality and its ""essential importance"" for young peoples' lives and for their ""process of growth in identity.""
The pope writes that: ""in a world that constantly exalts sexuality, maintaining a healthy relationship with one's body and a serene affective life is not easy.""
The exhortation then turns to the theme of the ""digital world"" which has created ""a new way to communicate"", and which can ""facilitate the circulation of independent information.""
In many countries, the web and social networks ""already represent a firmly established forum for reaching and involving young people."" But they can also be a place of ""loneliness, manipulation, exploitation and violence, up to the extreme case of the 'dark web.'
Digital media can expose people to the risk of addiction, isolation and gradual loss of contact with concrete reality.
The pope goes on to present ""migrants as an epitome of our time"" and recalls the many young people involved in migration.
He also speaks of child abuse, makes the Synod's commitment to the adoption of rigorous measures of prevention his own, and expresses gratitude ""to those who had the courage to report the evil they experienced.""
Pope Francis reminds young people that ""there is a way out"" in all dark and painful situations. He recalls the Good News given on the morning of the Resurrection. Chapter 4: A great message for all young people
To all young people the pope announces three great truths. A ""God who is love.""
The second truth is that ""Christ saves you.""
The third truth is that ""He is alive!""
""We need to keep reminding ourselves of this… because we can risk seeing Jesus Christ simply as a fine model from the distant past, as a memory, as someone who saved us two thousand years ago. Chapter 5: Paths of Youth
""The love of God and our relationship with the living Christ do not hold us back from dreaming; they do not require us to narrow our horizons. On the contrary, that love elevates us, encourages us and inspires us to a better and more beautiful life.""
Pope Francis invites young people not to observe life from the balcony, not to spend their lives in front of a screen, not to be reduced to abandoned vehicles and not to look at the world as tourists: ""Make a ruckus! Cast out the fears that paralyze you… live!""
He invites them to ""live the present"" enjoying with gratitude every little gift of life without ""being insatiable"" and ""obsessively seeking new pleasures.""
The pope, speaking of growth and maturity, indicates the importance of seeking ""a spiritual development,"" of ""seeking the Lord and keeping his Word,"" of maintaining the ""connection"" with Jesus... since you will not grow happy and holy by your own efforts and intelligence alone.""
Pope Francis proposes ""paths of fraternity"" to live the faith, remembering that ""the Holy Spirit wants to make us come out of ourselves, to embrace others… That is why it is always better to live the faith together and to show our love by living in community."" Chapter 6: Young people with roots
Pope Francis says that it hurts him to see ""young people sometimes being encouraged to build a future without roots, as if the world were just starting now.""
Fundamental is ""your relationship with the elderly,"" says the pope, which helps young people to discover the living richness of the past.
Speaking of ""dreams and visions"" Pope Francis observes: ""When young and old alike are open to the Holy Spirit, they make a wonderful combination. The old dream dreams, and the young see visions."" Chapter 7: Youth ministry
The pope explains that youth ministry has been affected by social and cultural changes and ""young people frequently fail to find in our usual programs a response to their concerns, their needs, their problems and issues.""
Youth ministry has to be synodal, that is, capable of shaping a ""journey together"" and this involves two broad lines of action: the first is outreach, the second is growth.
For the first, Church institutions should therefore provide ""suitable environments,"" ""places young people can make their own, where they can come and go freely, feel welcome and readily meet other young people, whether at times of difficulty and frustration, or of joy and celebration.""
Pope Francis then describes ""Youth Ministry in educational institutions,"" affirming that schools are in ""urgent need of self-criticism."" He said that ""some Catholic schools seem to be structured only for the sake of self-preservation.""
Among the areas of ""pastoral development"", the Pope indicates the ""importance of the arts,"" the ""potential of sports,"" and ""care for the environment.""
Young people need to have their freedom respected, ""yet they also need to be accompanied,"" he says. Chapter 8: Vocation
""To respond to our vocation, we need to foster and develop all that we are. This has nothing to do with inventing ourselves or creating ourselves out of nothing. It has to do with finding our true selves in the light of God and letting our lives flourish and bear fruit.""
As for ""love and family,"" the pope writes that: ""Young people intensely feel the call to love; they dream of meeting the right person with whom they can form a family.""
Pope Francis concludes this chapter by talking about ""the vocation to special consecration."" ""In discerning your vocation, do not dismiss the possibility of devoting yourself to God… Why not? You can be sure that, if you do recognize and follow a call from God, there you will find complete fulfilment."" Chapter 9: Discernment
The pope recalls that: ""Without the wisdom of discernment, we can easily become prey to every passing trend.""
""A particular form of discernment involves the effort to discover our own vocation. Since this is a very personal decision that others cannot make for us, it requires a certain degree of solitude and silence.""
Three sensitivities are required of those who help young people in their discernment.
""The first kind of sensitivity is directed to the individual. It is a matter of listening to someone who is sharing his very self in what he says.""
""The second kind of sensitivity is marked by discernment. It tries to grasp exactly where grace or temptation is present.""
""The third kind of sensitivity is the ability to perceive what is driving the other person"", discerning ""the direction in which that person truly wants to move.""
The exhortation concludes with ""a wish"" from Pope Francis: ""Dear young people, my joyful hope is to see you keep running the race before you, outstripping all those who are slow or fearful. Keep running, ""attracted by the face of Christ, whom we love so much, whom we adore in the Holy Eucharist and acknowledge in the flesh of our suffering brothers and sisters. The Church needs your momentum, your intuitions, your faith… And when you arrive where we have not yet reached, have the patience to wait for us."" For the full text of the exhortation, click here .

Polish priests burn Harry Potter books in battle against occult,international.la-croix.com,La Croix International staff,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/polish-priests-burn-harry-potter-books-in-battle-against-occult/9806,"Polish priests burn Harry Potter books in battle against occult Critics draw comparisons with Nazi Germany, witch hunts in Middle Ages La Croix International staff
(Photo by Hendrik Schmidt/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa/MaxPPP)
The Harry Potter character has won fans by escaping all manner of evil plots, but author J. K. Rowling could not escape the ire of Polish priests last month as they burned her books due to alarm over their perceived sacrilegious content.
The Catholic Church still wields huge influence in Poland, where some Christians have taken offense to the centrality of magic in her stories due to its association with the supernatural at the expense of the divine.
A Catholic evangelical group called the SMS From Heaven Foundation that sends Christian text messages to people's smartphones posted a picture on its Facebook page on March 31 showing books being burned in Gdansk.
Along with the Harry Potter novels, other items were also set ablaze including an African wooden mask, figurines of elephants, books on magic, and a small Buddhist figurine, The Associated Press reports on April 1.
The Facebook photo shows priests and altar boys watching the conflagration after parishioners helped to build the bonfire by donating things from their homes that could be linked to ""evil forces,"" the media reports.
The Polish Church has long objected to the Harry Potter series despite it racking up global sales in excess of 500 million copies, placing it among the most popular works of fiction ever written.
As a result, not everyone was impressed with the Church's decision to torch such prized cultural artifacts in the name of fighting the occult.
Many netizens compared the practice to the book burnings that occurred in Nazi Germany prior to World War Two, or the witch-hunts during the Middle Ages.
Father Wojciech Parafianowicz from Koszalin Diocese, where SMS From Heaven is based, said he ""did not like this form of priestly activity, which is wrong,"" yet he agreed the occult ""has a bad influence on human life."" "

Asia, especially Southeast Asia, has become the latest battleground in the conflict between Russia and the Turkey-headquartered Orthodox Catholic Church, after the Ukraine church recently announced its independence from Moscow's control.
The Russian Orthodox Church, which has close ties to the government of Vladimir Putin, has opened several new dioceses in the region as it moves to strengthen its presence there, according to the Nikkei Asian Review .
""Four dioceses have been formed as part of the Patriarchal Exarchate in Southeast Asia: the Singaporean, Korean, Thai and Filipino-Vietnamese,"" Vladimir Legoyda, head of the Russia church's Synodal Department for Church, Society and Media Relations, was quoted as saying in February.
""It has been decided that Metropolitan Sergei of Singapore and Southeast Asia will be the governing archbishop of the Singaporean diocese, and he has also been entrusted with the temporary running of the other three,"" he added.
Critics say this could mark the beginning of a turf war as the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia already falls under the Constantinople patriarchate.
Some see it as part of a larger broadside by Russia to exert greater control over the region, as Putin recently authorized increased arms exports to the region.
It comes just months after Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew officially recognized the Ukrainian church's independence in January, in line with a request from Kiev, which is still technically at war with Russia.
The Russian Church responded by saying it would now ""act as if they [Constaninople] do not exist at all' – hence the pivot to Asia.
In a TV interview, Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Russian Synodal Department for External Church Relations, said: ""Our purpose is missionary, we are creating these structures for ministerial care about our flock, there can be no such deterring factors here."" "
China's 'genocide' unlike any other,international.la-croix.com,Benedict Rogers,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/chinas-genocide-unlike-any-other/9803,"China's 'genocide' unlike any other The global community must act to end the forcible extraction of organs from prisoners of conscience Benedict Rogers Mail This Article
China may be committing what one expert, journalist Ethan Gutmann, author of The Slaughter , describes as ""a form of genocide cloaked in medical scrubs.""
Or what British MP Fiona Bruce, chair of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, described in a debate in parliament last week as ""a crime against humanity and … potentially nothing less than a 21st century genocide.""
A crime unlike any other — the forcible extraction of organs from prisoners of conscience.
The man who prosecuted Slobodan Milosevic — British barrister Sir Geoffrey Nice, QC — is chairing a seven-member panel at an independent tribunal on the subject.
The China Tribunal panel, which includes lawyers, an academic, a senior medical expert and a businessman, will hold further hearings on April 6-7 in London, and will publish its final judgment in June, but it has already concluded, after the first three days of hearings last December, that they are ""certain, unanimously, and sure beyond reasonable doubt that in China forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time, involving a very substantial number of victims …. by state-organized or approved organizations and individuals.""
For such an eminent panel to take the unusual step of issuing an interim judgment must surely command attention. They took their decision, they said, in the hope that it might ""save innocents from harm.""
Yet it is one of the most difficult human rights violations to prove because, in contrast to many other abuses, the only witnesses are the doctors, police and prison officers involved.
The evidence, in a hospital operating theatre, is cleaned away with clinical efficiency. And as Bruce put it in last week's debate, it is ""almost a perfect crime"" because there are no victims to testify. ""That is because no one survives"".
Chinese-born Canadian actress and former Miss World Canada Anastasia Lin told a hearing in the British parliament that ""on the street, if someone assaults you, you can scream for help. Tied to a hospital bed in the surgical room of a labor camp, no one can hear your screams. In China, it is the state itself that is involved in organ stealing.""
The charge is that not only death-row criminals but also prisoners of conscience — particularly practitioners of the Falun Gong spiritual movement , Uyghur Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists and certain house Christians — have been subjected to extensive medical testing, compatible with tissue matching for organ transplants, and that many have had their organs removed without their consent.
Those organs have fed an enormous commercial trade in organ transplants.
Three years ago, Canada's former secretary of state for Asia-Pacific David Kilgour, lawyer David Matas and journalist Gutmann published a report, ""Bloody Harvest/The Slaughter: An Update,"" which builds on previous investigations and focuses on forensic research into public records of 712 hospitals in China carrying out liver and kidney transplants.
They found that the number of organ transplants in China is far greater than previously reported, and therefore, they conclude, the scale of forced organ harvesting is too.
One hospital alone, Tianjin First Central Hospital, is carrying out over 6,000 transplants a year — and they extrapolate that between 60,000 to 100,000 organs are transplanted each year in Chinese hospitals.
This raises the question: where are these organs coming from?
China has not had a tradition of voluntary organ donation. In 2018, the government's official figures put the number of organ donors around 6,000, donating a total of 18,000 organs. Yet this, claim Kilgour, Matas and Gutmann, is ""easily surpassed by just a few hospitals.""
Furthermore, in China patients, including foreigners, are promised matching healthy organs within days, in contrast to most advanced Western countries where a patient waits many months, sometimes years, for a transplant. Researchers posing as patients made telephone calls to Chinese hospitals and had this confirmed.
The country's former vice-minister for health and chair of the organ transplant committee, Dr. Huang Jiefu, is on record ordering two spare livers from hospitals in Chongqing and Guangzhou as a back-up for an operation he was conducting in Xinjiang in 2005. They were delivered the next morning. Sentenced to death
The simple fact is that the figures don't add up. To be able to provide healthy matching organs to a patient within days, to have hundreds of hospitals conducting transplants, and yet to have only a few thousand voluntary donors a year means there must be an additional source of organs.
Death-row prisoners may account for some, but as Chinese law requires that prisoners sentenced to death must be executed within seven days, it makes the availability of organs on demand from that source limited.
That has led investigators to the conclusion that prisoners of conscience are the source. ""The end of this crime against humanity is not in sight,"" they conclude. ""The ultimate conclusion is that the Communist Party of China has engaged the state in the mass killings of innocents … in order to obtain organs for transplants.""
A former surgeon from Xinjiang, Dr. Enver Tohti, has testified to having forcibly removed organs from a prisoner in 1995 at an execution ground. After being instructed by his hospital's chief surgeons, he prepared the equipment and was taken to the site.
""We had been told to wait behind a hill and come into the field as soon as we heard the gun shot,"" he recalls. ""A moment later there were gun shots. Not one but many. We rushed into the field.
An armed police officer told me where to go. He led us closer, then pointed to a corpse, saying 'this is the one.'
By then our chief surgeon appeared from nowhere and told me to remove the liver and two kidneys. He urged me to hurry up … Then our chief surgeons put those organs in a box and got into the car. They told me to go back to the hospital and never to speak of what had happened.""
Experts have testified in legislatures around the world, including the United States Congress, and resolutions have been passed in Congress, the European Parliament and other legislatures condemning the practice.
Some countries, particularly Israel, Italy, Spain and Taiwan, have banned ""organ tourism"" to China, and Canada's Senate has legislated to do the same.
U.N. rapporteurs have called China to account for the sources of organs, but received no response, and one of the world's most respected voices on organ transplant ethics, Dr. Annika Tibell, has called for an international inquiry.
Does China have a response? If so, we would like to hear it. If not, the international community in all its composite parts — governments, media, lawyers, medical practitioners, professional associations and non-governmental organizations — must consider theirs.
If the China Tribunal's interim judgment casts light on truth, then it compels that justice be done and those responsible be held accountable. If true, it requires a re-evaluation of relations with those responsible.
Other countries should follow those that have already legislated to ban organ tourism to China. The United Nations should appoint a special rapporteur for human rights in China and hold a commission of inquiry. And if true, it requires urgent action to stop the murder of further innocents.

Indian Catholic priest alleges abduction by police at gunpoint,international.la-croix.com,"ucanews.com reporter, Jalandhar",04-02-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/indian-catholic-priest-alleges-abduction-by-police-at-gunpoint/9802,"Indian Catholic priest alleges abduction by police at gunpoint Police accuse superior general of local diocesan congregation of having US$1 million in unaccounted cash ucanews.com reporter, Jalandhar Mail This Article

Church officials in India's Jalandhar Diocese have disputed a police claim that currency worth about US$1 million in unaccounted cash was recovered from a Catholic priest.
Father Antony Madasserry, superior general of the Franciscan Missionaries of Jesus, the locally founded men's religious congregation to serve the diocese, was arrested along with five others on March 29 after 66.5 million Indian rupees in cash was recovered from three of his vehicles, police said in a statement.
All six people were released after questioning.
Father Madasserry, said 40-50 police officers armed with guns and without any search warrant took away the money. They did so in the presence of bank officials who were counting the money to be taken to the bank on the last working day of the financial year.
The police ""forcibly abducted me and others in my residence at gunpoint,"" he said.
The accused priest is a partner in a company that provides books, stationery, uniforms and security services to schools in Jalandhar. The diocese in northern India runs some 100 schools.
Father Madasserry, a former diocesan priest, said in a press statement that his company has collected US$4.32 million from schools this year and US$2 million has been deposited in banks.
Jalandhar diocesan spokesman Father Peter Kavumpuram told ucanews.com that the entire police ""story is false and misleading.""
He claimed police took away currency worth US$2.2 million at gunpoint from the residence of Father Madasserry but that police documents showed less than half of what they took.
The money, collected from students for services, is ""fully accounted with bills and receipts,"" Father Kavumpuram said.
The diocese was plunged into controversy in June last year when a nun complained to police that Bishop Franco Mulakkal of Jalandhar raped her multiple times between 2014 and 2016 when he visited her convent in Kerala.
The bishop continues to face investigation. The Vatican removed him from diocesan administrative duties last September but he retained his title as its bishop.
Bishop Mulakkal started the Franciscan Missionaries of Jesus. "
Cooks wanted: Church keeps Papua flood victims afloat,international.la-croix.com,"Benny Mawel, Jayapura",04-02-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/cooks-wanted-church-keeps-papua-flood-victims-afloat/9804,"Mail This Article

Two weeks after flash floods and mudslides swept villages in Sentani and other subdistricts of Jayapura in Papua province on March 16, thousands remain in evacuation shelters run by the government or church groups.
At least 112 people died in the tragedy while 94 remain missing. Some 374 houses, four bridges, five places of worship and eight school buildings were damaged, with more than 6,000 people still living in evacuation centers.
Media reports claim nearly 12,000 people have been displaced by the natural disaster in a province that a fact-finding mission from Australia declared in 2016 to be at risk of a ""slow-motion genocide.""
President Joko Widodo and First Lady Iriana Widodo visited the disaster zone on April 1, two days after authorities ended a 14-day emergency period, and reassured flood victims at Toware sports stadium that they would be safely evacuated, with new houses built once the land had been acquired.
But time is of the essence for those struggling to survive from day to day.
Tolakhe Meaga, 49, and her family chose to remain at the Kehiran evacuation shelter in Jayapura, sustained by aid from church groups. The shelter is near Christ the Redeemer Church.
She said she was too traumatized to return home, still haunted by the memories of watching her village washed away in roiling, muddy waters. She, too, almost perished that evening.
Muhamad Aidi, a military spokesman in Jayapura, said the death toll could surpass 190 as hope of finding those who are missing starts to fade. Buried under mud
Many properties, including Meaga's home, have all but vanished from sight, swallowed up by pits of mud.
She said everything happened so fast that people didn't even have time to rescue their pets or belongings. ""When I heard people scream 'flood, flood' I began to panic. I ran into my house but the only thing I had time to grab was my Bible,"" she said.
She said two female relatives identified as Ani and Ana were dragged away by the strong current but managed to survive by clinging to nearby poles. ""The current took me too,"" she said. ""I was holding my Bible in one hand and praying while grabbing a pole in my house with the other.""
She was reunited with Ani and Ana at the shelter.
Benny Kossay, a local Catholic leader whose house was inundated, said he was awoken to find his bed semi-submerged. His first thought was to get his wife safely outside. ""I tried to open the door but stones and sand had wedged it in place,"" he said.
Hours later, he was one of 70 families living near the area's famous Cyclops Mountains to be evacuated to the Kehiran shelter. Public kitchen, mobile clinic
About 1,200 evacuees at the camp and in other parishes have been receiving food and medical services from local Franciscans, according to Father Tarcisius Sina Lenggari, secretary of the Franciscan mission in Papua.
He said the congregation has opened public kitchens in remote areas that cannot access government aid, and it has been working in concert with Christ the Redeemer parish to do whatever it can.
The rescue and rehabilitation efforts got easier as more volunteers and seminarians trickled in from neighboring districts to help distribute food to people, but they still lack enough cooks, he said.
Yance Wenda, who is staying at another shelter managed by different church groups, said skin irritations and fungal infections are becoming rife.
Franciscan Brother Agust Adil, founder of the Surya Kasih Clinic for HIV patients, has organized a medical team. It consists of workers from Dian Harapan Hospital, owned by Jayapura Diocese, and Franciscan-owned Provita Hospital.
They have established an emergency clinic at Kehiran parish in cooperation with Christ the Redeemer Church.
""No one at the camp has suffered from a serious illness yet,"" Brother Adil said.
Parish priest Hendrikus Nahak said many young people have helped to hand out donated gifts that arrived at the parish-run post office, including rice, noodles, tents, mattresses, diapers, milk and soap. ""They came from other dioceses in Papua and other parts of Indonesia,"" he said.
The priest said church groups were filling a crucial void the government was unable to immediately take care of due to limited supplies and trouble accessing isolated areas.
Hengky Hilapok, head of a local youth group, said the parish had donated a ton of rice, and they had found ways of getting it almost everyone in need in the vicinity regardless of the location. Long road to recovery
The process of rebuilding homes and lives will be especially tough and grueling for indigenous Papuans who don't have any savings , said Dominikus Surabut, chairman of the Papuan Indigenous Council.
""They will have to start from scratch,"" he said. ""On top of the material distress, they will also need time to heal from all the psychological trauma.""
Governor Lukas Enembe said the provincial government has allocated 15 million rupiah ($1,050) for every human casualty of the floods.
He considers the Cyclops Mountains unsafe and expects many villagers will be relocated. ""People should not live there anymore,"" he said.
John Gobay, a member of the provincial council, said the government should use this as an opportunity to invest in economic development. ""That means not only building new homes for these people, but also providing them with agricultural land,"" he added. "
Are Catholics less divided on the migration issue?,international.la-croix.com,Sophie MarÃ©chal and MÃ©linÃ©e Le Priol,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/are-catholics-less-divided-on-the-migration-issue/9801,"Religion Are Catholics less divided on the migration issue? Two points of view on how Catholics in France see the question of migration in light of the pope's position Sophie Maréchal and Mélinée Le Priol France

During his visit to Morocco on March 30-31, Pope Francis pleaded the cause of migrants.
He called in particular for people to move ""from commitments made"" to ""concrete actions"" to improve the reception of migrants.
More than three years after his ""appeal"" to Christian communities on this subject, does the issue continue to split Catholics between supporters and opponents of greater efforts to assist incoming migrants?
Following are two points of view on how Catholics in France see the question of migration in light of the pope's position. It remains a burning issue Pierre Jova, journalist and author of 'Les Chrétiens face aux migrants'
There has been no calm. The question of migration remains a burning issue in Christian communities. The sex abuse crisis has not overshadowed it. Whenever the pope makes strong statements, as in Morocco, there is a flood of criticism.
Whether it's practising Catholics, Catholics further removed from the Church, Evangelicals or Protestants, the issue is divisive. Christians are torn between the sincere desire to help and a feeling of marginalization.
They have the impression that their country is slipping away from them.
Some are afraid immigration might disturb the Christian identity. Others, more socially vulnerable, feel migrants are better treated than French people in need. Within the same population, there are people who want to help and others who are afraid.
Among practising Catholics who see themselves as defenders of Christianity, there is a minority who are very angry at the pope. Those Catholics grew up with John Paul II and Benedict XVI. They made their words absolute. They idolized them.
Today, Francis is shaking them. His discourse, focusing on the problem of receiving migrants, does not match their expectations. They are taken aback, perplexed, so they rebel.
They are drawn by a radical right-wing message that calls on you to protect yourself against migrants.
The more the pope brings up this subject, the more this minority becomes tense. It also seeks substitute authorities to comfort it, for example Cardinal Robert Sarah, who has a much more critical discourse.
In the French Catholic Church, leaders realize that big slogans and optimistic calls no longer work. People are becoming more mature, more careful. The Church is reflecting more on how to speak about the crisis.
Above all, churches need to resist political and media emotion, in other words they must not lay blame on the native French and European populations. That only stirs up fears. The churches need to respond by example, not with words.
They absolutely need to intervene on the ground and provide the necessary assistance because the Church cannot do everything; that's the message of the Gospel. Churches have a prophetic role. However, they need to exercise much caution: it's not for them to manage migration policy.
Christians have everything to gain by helping others. There are individual paths and community paths that have succeeded in overcoming the divide: when migrants are taken in by a family or a parish, it's the entire community that is affected. However, once people are worried, the issue of migrants will be explosive. *** The current climate is one of respect for vulnerable persons A ntoine Paumard, priest and director of the Jesuit Refugee Service, France
First of all, it should be recalled that on the migration issue, Catholics have more moderate, and even more benevolent, positions than the general French population, as was shown by an interview published in La Croix on June 7 that we commissioned from IFOP (French Institute of Public Opinion, a major polling institute) with the National Service for the Pastoral Care of Migrants, Catholic Assistance-Caritas France and CCFD-Terre Solidaire (French NGO that supports anti-poverty efforts).
Of course, there is some reticence and it needs to be taken seriously, but I think one needs to be wary of the ""sounding-box"" effect social media can have: the people most opposed to receiving migrants are also the loudest.
I see two reasons underlying their opposition: the fear of seeing aid to migrants being granted priority over Frenchmen, and fear of Islam. Some 45 percent of Catholics see the fact that the migrants being received are Muslims as a problem.
On this score, the pope's words in Morocco this past weekend are essential. He recalled that faith is an appeal to shift the center. It is a strong gesture that concerns migrants, but more broadly, the question as to which society do we want for tomorrow.
Since the migration crisis peaked in 2015-2016, many who were doing research on the issue went into action following the call by Pope Francis, and they are convinced today of the benefit to be derived from taking in migrants.
According to our investigation last year, a quarter of practising Catholics are completely open to receiving migrants, while 61 percent are against closing the borders.
The sex abuse crisis today occupies an important place in discussions between Catholics, but I do not think it has changed much on the migration issue. Should it play a role, it would rather be a ""positive"" one since this crisis favors the development of an awareness that today's Church is not tomorrow's.
The present climate is one of increased respect for vulnerable persons, with this question: what does the Church propose for receiving them?
As for the word ""divide,"" I would use it with precaution. One needs to avoid binary stigmatization and the ""duel"" aspect.
Our inquiry shows that even those least inclined to take in refugees and asylum-seekers (those respondents designated ""nationalist Catholics"") could be ready to provide material and financing for Christians in the Middle East.
Thus, 33 percent of Catholics said they were closed to the idea, 22 percent were undecided, but even they provided some assistance or housing.
Christians within their churches should be involved in the dialogue that the pope tries to advocate with King Hassan of Morocco.
Each parish is quite representative of society in terms of dissension over these issues, so it's essential for the dialogue to continue in our communities. One finds a benign hospitality there, and doubts, too. "
Two-term French bishops' conference head has brought calm amid the storms,international.la-croix.com,Bruno Bouvet and Gauthier Vaillant,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/two-term-french-bishops-conference-head-has-brought-calm-amid-the-storms/9800,"Mail This Article

Archbishop Georges Pontier of Marseille concludes two terms as president of the Bishops Conference of France (CEF) on July 1 . During this time he faced many turbulent episodes where he sought to prioritize a collective, consensus-seeking approach.
It's not saying anything new to observe that over the course of his six years at the head of the French bishops' conference, Archbishop Pontier faced many storms both inside and outside the Church.
These ranged from divisions over the ""marriage for all"" law to the wounds inflicted by the ongoing sex abuse crisis in the Church.
They also included tensions over the role of religion in society in the wake of the terrorist attacks in 2015 and over Pope Francis' appeal to parishes to welcome migrants.
During all these storms, Archbishop Pontier, who turns 76 next month, displayed his many universally recognized qualities. They included a keen capacity for listening, respecting others and embodying a sense of calm.
These qualities also proved useful during several tragic events such as the assassination of Father Jacques Hamel in July 2016.
""Archbishop Pontier is a wise, deeply prayerful man, committed to Gospel values,"" noted CEF secretary-general, Msgr. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, who worked closely with the archbishop over the course of Pontier's two terms.
Indeed, the Marseille archbishop began his role as president on July 1, 2013 with great modesty and little concern for public recognition of his role.
During his early years, he was in fact often criticized, particularly in the media, for isolating himself from the outside world.
From this perspective, President Emmanuel Macron's reception for Archbishop Pontier at the Bernardin College in April 2018 signified a change in the Church's visibility in society.
Nevertheless, Msgr. Ribadeau Dumas denies that Pontier was ever at ease among the powerful. Priority to the collective
""Clearly, he is not a networker. But his finesse and his sensitive approach enabled him to make contacts,"" Msgr. Dumas said.
""I have never felt embarrassed by his links at the top levels of government and he succeeded in making himself understood on essential issues such as bioethical questions.
""In his view, a Christian needs to defend life from the beginning, in the middle and at the end,"" he added.
""Archbishop Pontier always worked collectively, seeking to involve the Permanent Council (of the CEF),"" the priest emphasized.
This is clearly a key to understanding Pontier's way of working.
In fact, one collectively produced document entitled Dans un monde qui change, retrouver le sens du politique (Rediscover the meaning of politics in a changing world), published in October 2016, will remain as a key initiative of his term.
Interviewed by La Croix , Archbishop Pontier's peers hailed his capacity ""to place himself at the service of the bishops""
He never ""regarded himself as their 'head',"" they noted.
He particularly demonstrated great skills in the way he led discussion at various plenary assemblies.
""I will remember his ability to lower the pressure in tense situations by means of an anecdote or a bit of humor,"" recalled one participant.
Combining gentleness with firmness during the November General Assembly, Pontier was personally involved launching an independent commission of inquiry into sex abuse.
This reveals much about the way he governed over the course of his two terms. He concludes his service as conference president on July 1. "

As the Synod of Bishops' Special Assembly on Amazonia to be held at the Vatican in autumn draws nearer, a delegation from the National Episcopal Conference of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (CENCO) attended a March 19-21 preparatory meeting at the University of Georgetown in Washington DC.
Sadly, this coincided with torrential rains that devastated three dioceses in western DR Congo.
""For years or even centuries, people have behaved badly in relation to nature, opposing people, animals and life,"" commented Bishop Sébastien Muyengo of Uvira in the Southern Kivu region of the DR Congo, the president of the Episcopal Commission for Natural Resources (CERN).
""If you read Laudato Si' carefully, Pope Francis insists on the fact that everything is linked,"" Bishop Muyengo noted in his speech at the meeting, which was organized by the Panamian Ecclesial Network (REPAM). Ecclesial Network of the Congo Basin (REBAC)
Bishop Muyengo also spoke on behalf of the Ecclesial Network of the Congo Basin (REBAC), which was founded in 2015 at the initiative of the CENCO Justice and Peace Commission in an effort to promote protection of the region, the second lung of the planet after Amazonia.
The REBAC network encompasses six bishops' conferences -- Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Equatorial Guinea.
The basin continues to be afflicted by deforestation and conflicts between local communities forest companies.
Bishop Donatien Bafuidinsoni of Inongo in the western Congo told the Washington conference that ""all these things have consequences on the environment as well as on the people."" Heavy rains
The ecological issue has great significance for the Church in the Congo with violent storms striking three dioceses in the west of the country – Inongo, Kikwit and Mbandaka-Bikoro – from March 17-28.
According to the CENCO website, the Catholic mission at Pindi in the Diocese of Kikwit was almost totally devastated.
""The roof of the Holy Trinity parish church as well as schools and houses were blown away, trees were stripped and there was much other material damage,"" reported Father Francis Kimwanga, diocesan chancellor at the Pindi mission where he is staying.
One Inongo student lost his life during the storms while torrential rain and violent winds also caused enormous damage at Mbandaka-Bikoro.
""The phenomena hit several Church buildings, including the welcome center, several schools and the parish church of St. Eugene's cathedral,"" a diocesan statement noted. "
