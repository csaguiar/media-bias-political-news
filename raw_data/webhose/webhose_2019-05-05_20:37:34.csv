If you have a dangerous dog in your neighborhood contact the owner’s insurance company as they pay attention to dangerous conditions on their policy holders property.

Blue Kids are now placed in front of businesses and homes across the region to mark Child Abuse Prevention Month.
Friday at John A. Logan College advocates said there are many misconceptions out there about child abuse--including that it doesn't happen in southern Illinois.
""Although many of our friends and neighbors would like to believe that this problem only exists somewhere else...we know that is not true. Many counties, over twenty in southern Illinois, have child abuse rates more than twice as high as the rest of the state,"" said Jo Poshard, of the Poshard Foundation for Abused Children.
Those in attendance could speak with advocates about the services available throughout southern Illinois.
The Clothesline project was also on display which shares stories about the impacts of abuse and neglect.
Child Abuse Prevention Month has been observed each April since its first presidential proclamation in 1983.
Local lawmakers were also on hand Friday along with representatives from John A. Logan College, Prevent Child Abuse Illinois, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Illinois State Police, and the Children's Medical and Mental Health Resource Network."

Third and fourth grade students from across Jefferson County visited Adams Farm, near Bonnie, Illinois, to hear presentations on safety from community members and Mt. Vernon FFA students.
In total, 20 presentations included electrical safety, farm safety, and even severe weather safety presented by WSIL Meteorologist, John Ross.
Organizer John Kabat says visual presentations like these help the young students remember the information.
He says, “The little kids, third and fourth graders will be here. They can for sure maybe think about safety, and see things they never saw before, and they don’t realize what is safe and unsafe because they don’t talk about it enough.”
Organizers estimate over 600 students from 12 schools attended today’s safety camp.

Country Financial Insurance presented the fire department with a check Friday afternoon. It's a part of the company's Operation Helping Heroes, where donations are made to first responders and military members.
The money will go toward educational pamphlets, coloring books, smoke detectors, and a new mascot costume. Those items will be helpful when fire fighters visit schools or students tour the station.
Fire chief Steve McBride says the materials could save a life, ""If we stop one kid from getting hurt or help one family to escape early in a fire and avoid getting injured. It was well worth it.""
McBride adds that his budget is very tight and fire fighters often have to pay for materials out of their own pockets. He says without the donation, much of this wouldn't be possible."

Department heads and the county board met to discuss the $1.3 million shortfall on Friday afternoon.
Early in the meeting, Commissioner Dallas Bigham pointed out just how dire the circumstances are.
""I think we're at the point right now,"" he said. ""I mean, we're almost just shutting every thing down, shutting the whole county down.""
The county's money problems all started because of the state's budget impasse. State funding slowed down, and it's not improving. This week voters rejected the county's effort to pass a half-cent sales tax .
County Treasurer Mary Jane Craft is worried about bounced checks and being able to afford health care expenses for employees.
""When our employees go to the drug store or go to their doctor, then people start refusing to basically fill things for them,"" she said.
County leaders are planning to cut $700,000 from the budget this year, and $600,000 next year to make up for the county's budget short fall.
Bigham suggested reducing employee hours to a four day work week.
However, Rhett Barke, attorney for the county, said that would only save the county $6,000, simply not enough.
Other possible cuts including laying off a maintenance worker and three deputies from the sheriff's office.
If that happens, Sheriff Steve Bareis is concerned about a gap in public safety as state troopers would have to help cover the area but are also limited in personnel.
""There may be a six-hour block where we have no deputy in Perry County. We'll have two troopers on for entire Southern Illinois as well,"" Bareis explained.
If the jail closed the county would loss money from holding federal inmates. Plus, the county would have to pay contracts to transport and house it's inmates elsewhere.
The solution that county leaders came up with is for department heads to define a bare minimum number to run their offices and still comply with the law, find areas to make cuts, and see if specialty funds can be used to pay employees.
Reports are due to the county board members next Tuesday, April 9, while a decision on cuts could come as early as that Thursday, April 7, when another special meeting has been set for 2 p.m."

Atlanta library shuts down DRAG QUEEN storytime – so the MAYOR invites it to city hall!,therightscoop.com,SooperMexican,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/atlanta-library-shuts-down-drag-queen-storytime-so-the-mayor-invites-it-to-city-hall/,"Another despicable adult is exposing children to sexualization in order to further a political agenda in the great city of Atlanta, Georgia.
This is horrendous.
From the Hill:
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) invited a drag queen to read to children at city hall after a library pulled its sponsorship for her “Drag Queen Story Hour” event.
“Miss Terra Cotta Sugarbaker and all of our LGBTQ friends are always welcome at Atlanta City Hall. How about we host your next story hour? @CityofAtlanta—let’s make it happen! #OneAtlanta ,” Bottoms tweeted Friday.
The event Bottoms offered to host is part of a national “Drag Queen Story Hour” movement that promotes events at local libraries in which drag queens read to children.
Miss Terra Cotta Sugarbaker, the drag persona of 40-year-old Buford native Steven Igarashi-Ball, has held story time at the local library for more than a year and a half, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Here’s what happened to the drag queen storytime event in Houston:

OBSCENE: The gov’t quietly lowered the age that kids can get transgender operations and chemical treatments!,therightscoop.com,SooperMexican,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/obscene-the-govt-quietly-lowered-the-age-that-kids-can-get-transgender-operations-and-chemical-treatments/,"From the Christian Post:
Medical doctors and a mom of a trans-identifying child are urging the government to shut down medical operations that are harming children.
Their efforts to resist the medicalization of gender has led them to discover that government-funded research now allows wrong sex hormones such as testosterone to be given to girls as young as 8.
At a Thursday panel at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, Dr. Michael Laidlaw addressed the medical harms of hormonal treatments and surgical interventions being performed on young people who believe they are the opposite sex. Doctors administering these treatments are advocating these harmful practices on increasingly younger children, he explained.
Today, medical scenarios such as girls as young as 13 and 14 undergoing double mastectomies and 17-year-old boys with penises of 9-year-olds, developmentally speaking, because of chemical puberty blockers, are now showing up, Laidlaw, a Rocklin, California-based endocrinologist, explained in his remarks.
Under the nebulous concept of “gender identity,” children as young as 8 are receiving injections for gender transition treatment, he explained. The phrase was defined in a recent court case as a person’s “core internal sense” of their own gender and that it was the “primary factor” in determining their sex, not biology. This is false, the endocrinologist said.
No blood test, genetic testing, or brain imaging scans can find a “gender identity,” Laidlaw said, adding “there is no objective test to diagnose this, yet we are giving very harmful therapies on the basis of no objective diagnosis.”
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Laidlaw says that he discovered the the government quietly changed laws in order to allow quack doctors to deliver bizarre therapy to very young kids:
“This whole thing is an experiment on children. We are ignoring the voices of desisters and people who have come out of this and recognize their sex. And the NIH is allowing unethical research to be conducted on adolescents, in my opinion.”
Laidlaw and his colleagues used FOIA requests to obtain more information about Olson-Kennedy’s study at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and found that in 2017 they lowered the minimum age for cross-sex hormones from 13 to 8.
“Imagine giving 8-year-old girls testosterone,” Laidlaw said. “They are in 3rd or 4th grade. This is unbelievable. But this is going on.”
Here’s the video of the Heritage event:
Thank God for the Heritage Foundation hosting these events to speak out on this issue and others, and the Christian Post for reporting it. These are truly dark days. And it’s going to get worse."

"Ironically, Too Many Video Streaming Choices May Drive Users Back To Piracy",www.techdirt.com,Karl Bode,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190320/07442041832/ironically-too-many-video-streaming-choices-may-drive-users-back-to-piracy.shtml,"from the adapt-or-perish dept Fri, Apr 5th 2019 7:39pm — Karl Bode
To be very clear the rise in streaming video competitors is a very good thing. It's providing users with more choice, lower prices, and better customer service than consumers traditionally received from entrenched vanilla cable TV companies. It's the perfect example of how disruption and innovation are supposed to work. And given the abysmal customer satisfaction ratings of most big cable TV providers, this was an industry that's been absolutely begging for a disruptive kick in the ass since the 1980s.
But we've also noted that, ironically, the glut of video choices--more specifically the glut of streaming exclusivity silos--risks driving users back to piracy. Studies predict that every broadcaster and their uncle will have launched their own direct-to-consumer streaming platform by 2022 . Most of these companies are understandably keen on locking their own content behind exclusivity paywalls, whether that's HBO Now's Game of Thrones , or CBS All Access's Stark Trek: Discovery .
But as consumers are forced to pay for more and more subscriptions to get all of the content they're looking for, they're not only getting frustrated by the growing costs (defeating the whole point of cutting the cord), they're frustrated by the experience of having to hunt and peck through an endlessly shifting sea of exclusivity arrangements and licensing deals that make it difficult to track where your favorite show or film resides this month.
In response, there's some early anecdotal data to suggest this is already happening. But because these companies are fixated on building market share, and this will likely be an industry-wide issue, most aren't seeing the problem yet.
Others are. The 13th edition of Deloitte’s annual Digital Media Trends survey makes it clear that too many options and shifting exclusivity arrangements are increasingly annoying paying customers :
But the plethora of options has a downside: Nearly half (47%) of U.S. consumers say they’re frustrated by the growing number of subscriptions and services required to watch what they want, according to the 13th edition of Deloitte’s annual Digital Media Trends survey. An even bigger pet peeve: 57% said they’re frustrated when content vanishes because rights to their favorite TV shows or movies have expired.
“Consumers want choice — but only up to a point,” said Kevin Westcott, Deloitte vice chairman and U.S. telecom and media and entertainment leader, who oversees the study. “We may be entering a time of ‘subscription fatigue.'”
As it turns out, people don't like Comcast, but they do ironically want a little more centralization than they're seeing in the streaming space. What that looks like isn't clear yet, but it's something that will slowly get built as some of the 300 options (and growing) currently available fail to gain traction in the space:
All told, there are more than 300 over-the-top video options in the U.S. With that fragmentation, there’s a clear opportunity for larger platforms to reaggregate these services in a way that can provide access across all sources and make recommendations based on all of someone’s interests, Westcott said. “Consumers are looking for less friction in the consumption process,” he said.
Variety's otherwise excellent report doesn't mention this, but a lot of these customers are going to revert to piracy. It's not clear why this isn't mentioned, but it's kind of standard practice for larger outlets to avoid mentioning piracy in the odd belief that acknowledging it somehow condones it. But if you don't mention it, you don't learn from it. You don't understand that piracy is best seen as just another competitor, and a useful tool to gain insight into what customers (studies repeatedly show pirates buy more content than most anybody else ) really want.
It's easy to dismiss this as privileged whining (""poor baby is upset because they have too many choices ), and that's certainly what a big segment of the market is going to do.
But it would be a mistake to ignore consumer frustration and the obviously annoying rise of endless exclusivity silos, given the effort it took to migrate users away from piracy and toward legitimate services in the first place. The primary lesson learned during that experience is you need to compete with piracy . It's not really a choice. It's real, it's impossible to stop, and the best way to mitigate it is to listen to your customers. Building more walled gardens, raising rates, and ignoring what subscribers want is the precise opposite of that."

State House and Senate lawmakers are weighing bills that would improve inmate access to hygiene products such as sanitary pads, toilet paper, soap and toothpaste. | Getty Images 'They just didn't give it to them': Female inmates denied hygiene needs, prison workers say Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Prison workers and former inmates contradicted the state’s claim that it has zero tolerance for denying hygiene products to incarcerated women, describing repeated violations of the policy as lawmakers weigh stricter rules on corrections facilities.
Corrections officers frequently withhold sanitary pads and other items to inflict punishment, score political points or avoid paperwork, they said. Story Continued Below
“I’ve been refused sanitary napkins or soap or toilet paper because the officers just didn’t want to do the process,” Tranassa White, an activist and former prison inmate, told POLITICO.
State House and Senate lawmakers are weighing bills that would improve inmate access to hygiene products such as sanitary pads, toilet paper, soap and toothpaste. As the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act moves closer to becoming law, the Florida Department of Corrections has maintained that agency rules already forbid prison workers to withhold access to hygiene products.
Corrections officers, or COs, said that policy is frequently ignored by some prison personnel.
Rex McSeaton spent two years working at Lowell Correctional Institution, a women’s facility in Marion County. He said that while most corrections officers were mindful of women’s needs, the policies didn’t safeguard inmates from bad actors.
“I’ve seen some COs that just didn’t want to give them anything,” McSeaton said in an interview with POLITICO. “Throughout the whole day, no matter how many people asked, they just didn’t give it to them.”
Another former corrections officer from Lowell, Mason Hoydic, said sergeants would argue with inmates “over simply just handing them some toilet paper or some pads.”
“If me giving you two pads made you a little bit happier, I gave you two pads,” said Hoydic, who left Lowell in 2018 after serving as an officer for a year.
The state’s three public facilities provide women with basic hygiene products, including toilet paper, soap and pads, on a schedule. If an inmate needs more than she’s allotted, she must ask a corrections officer to grant more.
“Our current policies are providing all of those basic needs to both male and female inmates,” said Michelle Glady, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections.
Advocates for the bills say those policies aren't stopping rogue officers from withholding basic needs from inmates. But corrections officers also cautioned lawmakers about provisions in the bills that could be problematic.
Stephanie Blackwood, a former corrections officer from the Florida Women’s Reception Center, said she’s seen hygiene products denied to inmates, but she said it’s not always malicious.
Inmates sometimes use pads in unauthorized ways, turning them into eye masks, earplugs and shoe cushions, or hiding places for contraband.
Officers also expressed concerns with language in the bills that would require hygiene products be made available in common housing areas. Putting hygiene products in an open-access area could result in an inmate or group of inmates claiming the area.
“Prison is a different environment, so the top dog is going to get the pads. All of them,” McSeaton said.
""Every single time, and they will sell the pads,"" Blackwood said.
The House bill’s sponsor, Rep. Shevrin Jones (D-West Park), said he hasn’t spoken to any corrections officers, but said the open-area distribution issue is “something the department can work out.”
“The biggest issue is ensuring that they have the access,” Jones told POLITICO.
The state bills are modeled on the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act proposed in Congress in 2017. That effort failed, but Jones has confidence his measure can win support in the Legislature.
“I know that we don’t always get along on a lot of things, but just looking at the direction that Florida is moving on criminal justice reform, this is a part of it,” Jones said.
The Department of Corrections “dropped the ball” under former Gov. Rick Scott, he said, but the new department secretary, Mark Inch, will bring promising reforms.
“He is aware of these things happening, and I know for a fact that they are actively working to solve this issue,” Jones said.
The House measure was advanced unanimously through its first two committees and has one stop left, in the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate version was also passed unanimously in two committees and is waiting for its final stop in the Senate Appropriations Committee. "
