BERLIN (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Russia is ready to continue discussing the reform of the UN Security Council in the light of Germany 's aspirations for permanent membership, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin told journalists on Friday.
The Russian diplomat participated in Russian-German consultations on UN issues at the German Foreign Ministry.
""The question is broader. The question is about Security Council reform,"" Vershinin said, answering a question from a Sputnik correspondent about the position of the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding Germany 's repeated desire to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
According to the deputy prime minister , this issue has been discussed in New York for many years.
""We will continue to discuss it. We believe that we need a decision to come to. This decision should get an overwhelming majority, and better consensus in the General Assembly . Too much responsibility, of course, with each step in improving the Security Council. We cannot lose its effectiveness,"" he said.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters in New York earlier that the question of obtaining permanent membership in the UN Security Council by Germany is very long-term. In January , Germany and France signed a new cooperation agreement in the German city of Aachen, which states that Germany 's goal to get a permanent seat in the UN Security Council is a priority for joint diplomacy."

Trumps plan to bypass Congress on trade with Japan,www.politico.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2019/04/02/trump-trade-japan-000888,"Trump’s plan to bypass Congress on trade with Japan Negotiators are putting political gains on agriculture ahead of a comprehensive deal. By BRUCE HIRSH Print
The Japanese space agency recently landed a spacecraft on a miniscule asteroid traveling nearly 14,000 miles per hour relative to Earth. Many observers have concluded that it will take a similar feat to land the U.S.-Japan trade agreement negotiations expected to kick off in the next several weeks. Congress and the private sector have been pushing for a traditional, comprehensive agreement covering all trade topics. Skeptics note that such a comprehensive agreement would involve tough issues like currency manipulation that could make for a drawn-out and difficult landing, and any such deal would need congressional approval to take effect.
But what if the Trump administration has in mind a staged approach that would avoid the need for congressional approval in the first stage? There are growing signs that the administration might be considering this approach as a way to address its most pressing political need—assuaging President Donald Trump’s agricultural base, which has been buffeted by retaliation for Trump’s metals and China tariffs and by lost opportunities due to his withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership.
While it may prove tempting for the administration to harvest short-term political gains from a narrow trade deal with Japan centered on agriculture, I believe there could be significant costs to U.S. interests and the global trading system long term. That’s because a narrow, first-stage agreement is likely to rely on relief from the threat of unilateral U.S. tariffs as the principal driver of a deal, which could spur protectionist moves by trading partners and further destabilize a global trading system already tottering under the effects of Trump’s trade policies.
The administration has been signaling since last July that it might take this approach, when it first broached the idea of a two-stage approach to negotiating a trade agreement in the context of talks with the European Union. The U.S. announcement last September of negotiations with Japan likewise referred to seeking an agreement that can produce “early achievements” on goods and other key areas, to be followed by talks on additional matters. Both an initial notification to Congress on the Japan talks and a subsequent notification of objectives for the talks also referred to the possibility of a two-stage approach.
Lately there have been numerous rumors in the trade community that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer intends to follow through on a two-stage approach. He seemed to confirm this at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last month, when he explained, ""It’ll take a while to get an entire [free trade agreement], but my own view has been that we have to take care of the agricultural part of it and some others so it’s balanced at an earlier stage.” Lighthizer emphasized that an agriculture deal with Japan is urgent, given the benefits our competitors are receiving through the successor agreement to the TPP and through the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.
But skeptical observers in the United States—which is to say, virtually all of them—have been dismissive of such a two-stage approach. They have flagged a number of concerns, including the challenge of persuading some stakeholders to defer their asks until a second stage, and the sheer novelty of departing from the decades-old U.S. model of pursuing comprehensive free trade agreements with cutting-edge commitments. That model has been rooted both in a desire to provide global leadership in establishing high-standard rules and in the political necessity for broad domestic support when seeking congressional approval. Further, Congress is unlikely to want to undertake the challenging approval process not just once but twice.
Under these circumstances, how can the administration hope to succeed in a two-stage approach? A clue might lie in how the administration recently negotiated modifications to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. In the Korean deal, the U.S. specifically avoided topics that would involve legislative changes requiring approval from Capitol Hill, instead including several commitments only affecting the Korean side.
THERE ARE SEVERAL topics the administration could address without needing congressional approval for an agriculture-focused first stage. For instance, Japanese market access concessions that lower tariffs on U.S. agricultural products would not require formal Hill approval. Nor would certain disciplines the U.S. recently included in USMCA that might be of mutual interest to Japan, such as those preventing barriers to digital trade and those requiring commercial behavior of state-owned enterprises. Also not requiring congressional approval would be Japanese concessions on services and pricing for medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, which are priorities for other key U.S. companies.
Would Japan agree to such a deal? Japan also is interested in a limited-scope agreement, although it had hoped to focus exclusively on trade in goods, without the services-related and other provisions of a typical agreement. Japan’s trade strategy remains TPP-focused, including the possibility of the United States someday rejoining the pact, so it wants to avoid a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. that suggests it has given up on that approach. And in the September 2018 announcement of the negotiations, Japan and the U.S. essentially agreed that the deal would provide the U.S. with agricultural market access comparable to access under TPP, and the Japanese government already weathered the domestic political challenge of agreeing to such access in the context of the TPP negotiations.
Still, the ledger in such a deal might appear too heavily weighted in favor of the U.S. to be palatable to Japan. That could change if the deal addresses Japan’s most pressing need— exclusion of Japanese goods from current and potential U.S. duties on steel, aluminum, automotive products, and titanium sponge. Duties are currently in place on Japanese steel and aluminum products as a result of Trump administration investigations under a little-used trade provision intended to ensure domestic production of items critical to U.S. national security. Duties could be imposed as early as mid-May on automotive goods under the same statute. In addition, the administration recently initiated a similar investigation on titanium sponge imports, most of which comes from Japan.
Japan would of course like to avoid these duties, but it also has resisted a solution that would replace duties with quotas, which has been the Trump administration’s preferred alternative. Still, with more than $40 billion of passenger vehicle exports at risk, Japan, like others before them, might agree to some limits.
Congress would be conflicted in the face of such a deal. Many members are very uncomfortable with the Trump administration’s unconventional and aggressive use of national security tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations. However, many of the same members have been just as adamant about the need for urgent action to open Japan’s agricultural markets. A “down payment” agreement with Japan that does so, and that purports to be only the first stage toward a comprehensive agreement, could prove tempting.
But this highlights a broader danger for U.S. interests. In the name of short-term leverage in current negotiations large and small, the U.S. is validating a strategy of unilaterally erecting trade barriers without regard to global trade rules and multilateral enforcement processes. This provides a green light to other trade partners to raise trade barriers not only for leverage, but for simple protection, to the detriment of U.S. exporters and the predictability of the trading system more generally.
The indiscriminate nature of the approach exacerbates this concern. It may be one thing to employ unilateral tariffs to address Chinese trade practices not squarely addressed by existing trade rules. While many have been uncomfortable with the tactic, there is broad recognition both in the U.S. and abroad that something needs to be done about the China problem. It is another thing entirely for the threat and application of unilateral tariffs to be used as a first-choice tactic to gain leverage in trade negotiations that are intended to produce win-win outcomes. The sustainability of such gains is highly questionable. Gains obtained through this kind of duress have a way of producing short-term headlines but resistance on the ground that undercuts long-term benefits. And this treatment strains alliances in the economic sphere and beyond.
The administration may very well pursue a limited-scope agreement with Japan backed by the offer of withdrawing unilateral tariffs. However tempting the short-term gains are, the approach could cost U.S. exporters and their workers in the long term, when they face similar barriers and a unstable global trading environment unconstrained by rules.

BERLIN (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The UN Security Council needs to send a signal of restraint and finding a solution through political dialogue to the Libyan conflict, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin said on Friday.
The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold a closed emergency session on Friday at 19:00 GMT, following the escalated tensions in Libya after the head of the Libyan National Army , Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, announced on Thursday that he ordered his troops to advance on the country's capital, Tripoli .
""Today's UN Security Council's meeting will be very important in terms of sending all of the powers involved in the Libyan conflict a signal of restraint and finding a solution to overcome existing points of conflict between them through a political dialogue,"" Vershinin said.
Additionally, the deputy foreign minister expressed Russia 's willingness to use its authority within the United Nations to assist in the process of stabilization of Libyan conflict. He said that Russia was directing all of its political power to advance a comprehensive dialogue that would take into consideration the interests of all Libyans.
As a result of years-long civil conflict, there is no single central government in Libya , and the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament , elected in 2014 and backed by the LNA, governs the east of Libya , while the UN-backed Government of National Accord, established in 2015 , controls Libya 's western parts from Tripoli ."

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said he's ""confident"" that there will be a third summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
""I'm confident there will be,"" Pompeo said in an interview with CBS news when asked about the potential for a third meeting between the two leaders.
The secretary of state noted that he doesn't know when this potential third summit might take place, but said he hopes that it will be soon.
""Chairman Kim has promised me, he's promised President Trump he will denuclearize. Now it's the mission of my team to make sure that happens,"" Pompeo said.
The top US diplomat emphasized that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted until the ""ultimate objective"" was achieved.
On March 22, Trump said in a statement that he had ordered the withdrawal of additional large-scale US sanctions against North Korea that the US Treasury Department tried to impose on that country.
Trump said his decision not to implement additional sanctions on North Korea does not mean he may not impose more sanctions later on, however, he noted that is focused at present on maintaining a good relationship with Kim.
At their first historic summit in Singapore last June , Trump and Kim agreed that North Korea would make efforts toward complete denuclearization in exchange for freezing of US-South Korean military exercises and gradual removal of sanctions.
While an agreement was expected to be signed at the second summit in Hanoi , Trump walked away from talks, as Kim demanded full removal of sanctions without pledging to denuclearize the sites that the United States had specified. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

In a statement sent to AFP, Amelie de Montchalin said President Emmanuel Macron's government had ""read with interest"" British Prime Minister Theresa May 's letter to the EU asking for an extension until June 30.
""As the Prime Minister rightly wrote, the current impasse is not in the best interest of neither the UK nor the EU. It cannot be allowed to continue,"" Montchalin said.
But EU leaders had taken a ""clear decision"" at their last summit on March 21, she said.
""Another extension requires that the UK puts forward a plan with a clear and credible political backing,"" she said.
""The European Council would then have to define the necessary conditions attached to this extension.
""In the absence of such a plan, we would have to acknowledge that the UK chose to leave the EU in a disorderly manner."" An official in the French presidency said earlier that Macron, who has taken a stern line on the conditions for any further Brexit delay, was ""waiting for a credible plan between now and the (EU) summit on April 10, when we will study the request."" ""A delay is a tool, but not a solution in itself,"" the source said.
The EU has already agreed to move back the original March 29 deadline to April 12 to give May more time to win backing from MPs for the deal she negotiated with the EU, which they have rejected three times.
In her letter seeking a second extension, May told EU Council president Donald Tusk she wanted to ensure her country left the bloc in an ""orderly way"", as she fights to find a deal that parliament can get behind.
Earlier Friday, an EU official said Tusk would suggest to member states that they offer Britain a flexible 12-month delay to Brexit , removing some of the pressure on May to ram through a deal by next Wednesday's summit meeting.
But a French diplomatic source appeared to pour cold water on that idea as well, calling ""the rumours about such an extension a clumsy trial balloon."" A source in the presidency said earlier this week that France wanted at all costs to avoid an EU summit ""where the prime minister ( May ) arrives saying 'Everything is still blocked, things will be a lot clearer in a month or two or three, give us more time'.""""That cannot happen,"" the source said.

JAMRUD, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Imran Khan Friday categorically said he would not be blackmailed by threats of million marches and sit-ins by opposition leaders, to escape from the accountability process for looting billions of rupees of public funds.
"" Imran Khan will not be blackmailed, as I have come into power only with a motive to hold the corrupt accountable,"" he said while addressing a huge public gathering here wherein he also announced a mega development package for district Khyber.
The prime minister referred to the April 4, speeches of Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari at Naudero public meeting and offered the PPP leaders with a container and even food if they wanted to stage a sit-in in Islamabad .
He, however, challenged them to hold even a week-long sit-in in the Federal capital as against the PTI 's four and half months' sit-in, adding, sit-ins only succeed when the leaders raise the issues of masses and share their grievances.
He said the people who became leaders by showing a piece of paper [death will] were not the true leaders. ""Leaders emerge through struggle and political hardships"", he added.
Similarly, he said, Maulana Fazlur Rehman who was clean bowled in the General election 2018 was talking of million march .
The prime minister termed Maulana as the12th player and said, ""It is like a whinging boy [in the game of cricket] who continues with fielding the whole day, then gets out on the very first ball at crease, and later starts crying foul to disturb the whole match."" ""He (Maulana Fazlur Rehman) is a 12th player and wants to push the government down. You will not get the turn,"" he remarked.
The prime minister further said, "" Zardari Sahib! This government is not going. You are going to jail ."" He regretted that the opposition parties ( PML-N and PPP ) who had completed their five-year terms each during the past 10 years were raising questions about the performance of PTI government over the last 7 months.
He criticized the PPP leaders for questioning PTI about its performance of seven months in power from the first week of government .
He referred to a Joint Investigation Team report and said these people had laundered the public money worth Rs100 billion abroad through fake accounts.
""They are telling us to push the government down and pressurizing us so as to get an NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance)"", the prime minister said and added people like Ishaq Dar , an absconder, were telling the government how to improve economy.
He also mentioned the sons of Nawaz Sharif residing in London and said, ""One of his son is living in a house worth Rs6 billion ."" Similarly, he said, a son and son-in-law of Shehbaz Sharif had gone to London . ""If you have not done anything wrong, why you have run out of the country,"" he remarked.
Imran Khan said when he was called by the court he had presented his 40-year record before it and did not make any hue and cry about democracy getting in danger. ""When these people are questioned, democracy comes under danger,"" he said.
The prime minister made it clear that those involved in loot and plundering of public money would have to be answerable before the courts as well as before the nation.
""If you have to avoid from going into jails, you will have to give back the public money , which was to be used on health, education and poverty elimination,"" he said.

""Britain, France , and the United States should issue detailed, public reports on the Saudi trial for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi ,"" the release said. ""Given the serious and well-documented inadequacies of the Saudi criminal justice system, Britain, France and the United States should act to ensure that they do not provide cover for what could be a sham trial.""

The three countries are among those that the Saudi government invited to attend the trial proceedings, which have been closed to the United Nations , the media and the public, the release said.
Human Rights Watch was joined by Amnesty International , ARTICLE 19, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, PEN America and Reporters Without Borders in issuing demands for judicial fairness in an ""open letter,"" the release explained.
The rights groups also urged the three governments to press the Saudi leadership to allow independent observers from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, international human rights groups, and international media organizations to attend the proceedings.
US intelligence agencies have blamed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of involvement in Khashoggi's October murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul .
An internal Saudi investigation led by bin Salman resulted in the arrest and trial of 11 participants in the killing while absolving bin Salman of any responsibility. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Defense of Ex-Bosnian Serb Leader Karadzic Says Preparing Revised Appeal on Life Sentence,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/defense-of-ex-bosnian-serb-leader-karadzic-sa-587173.html,"Defense Of Ex-Bosnian Serb Leader Karadzic Says Preparing Revised Appeal On Life Sentence Sumaira FH 22 hours ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 10:10 PM
BELGRADE (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Lawyers of the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was sentenced by the Appeals Chamber of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals to life imprisonment, are preparing a revised appeal, lawyer Goran Petronijevic told Sputnik in an interview.
On April 3, the appeals chamber dismissed the appeal by Karadzic who had tried to challenge his lifetime sentence. On March 20, the five judges of the appeals chamber dismissed all but one of Karadzic appeals and increased the 40-year prison term handed down in 2016 to life in prison.
""We will soon prepare an audit in the appeal, which will contain other arguments. We are now preparing the main thing that we have announced - new facts, new evidence, we will resolve the issue within this framework,"" Petronijevic said.
Karadzic's defense is sure that this time Judge Carmel Agius was mistaken in deciding that there had been no basis for such an appeal, he noted.
""The chamber applies the so-called hybrid law model, that is, 95 percent of Anglo-Saxon law and 5 percent of European law. In Anglo-Saxon law, the decision on punishment and the decision on the actual state and essence of the case are different things. And we did not include the meritum [the essence of the case] in our application for appeal, because we considered that we had no right to file a regular appeal, since the sentence was final. But we also believe that under Anglo-Saxon law we can appeal a punishment that had been approved in violation of many precedents,"" the lawyer explained.
He noted that in Anglo-Saxon law, if the actual state of affairs did not change and, thus, the defendant's measure of responsibility should not increase, as was in the Karadzic case, tougher penalties cannot be applied.
""In addition, the Appeals Chamber referred to several precedents with convictions in other cases of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, completely disregarding the huge difference in the degree of responsibility of convicts ... These were all people convicted of committing crimes directly. And Karadzic was convicted of milder types of responsibility, that is also incomparable,"" Petronijevic said.
According to the lawyer, the current presiding judge Agius, who took the post after the famous Theodor Meron, is no better than his predecessor, since he deprived Karadzic of the right to appeal just to finish the case as soon as possible.
""He denied us this right, but he didn't deprive us the opportunity,"" he said.
Karadzic, 73, ruled the Republika Srpska between 1992 and 1996. He was arrested in 2008 in Belgrade after having been on the run for over a decade. He has faced charges since the end of the Bosnian War, which erupted between Bosnian Muslims , Serbs and Croatians in 1992, when Bosnia and Herzegovina proclaimed independence following the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
Karadzic was found guilty including on planning the Srebrenica massacre, the largest mass atrocity in Europe since the Holocaust, that ended with 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks being killed in July 1995.
After seceding from Yugoslavia in 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was in a state of war, until the Dayton Agreement was signed in 1995. The agreement formed two autonomous entities � the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Serbian-majority Republika Srpska � and the self-governing Brcko District.

BRUSSELS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The 5th European Migration Forum held in the Belgian capital on Thursday and Friday looked at the role of global and local authorities in migration management as well as integration and legalization of migrants.
The forum came several weeks before the European parliament elections, during which migration and its consequences will be high on the agenda for every party, everywhere in Europe .
Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner in charge of migration, pointed out at the opening of the forum that strengthening external borders and repatriating more migrants was not enough to deal with a huge inflow of people.
""A smart and well-controlled EU policy on legal migration is essential to show that there are alternatives to irregular migration. In the past years, we have shown that it is possible for the European Union to support safe resettlement pathways for migrants in need of protection, and efficient and controlled legal pathways for migrants coming to work or study,"" Avramopoulos said.
The role of local authorities and civil society in managing migration as well as ensuring safe and regular pathways to the European Union , were extensively discussed during the two days by a mixed group of European civil servants and activists.
The non-profits were able to discuss best practices at national or regional level. Some remarked that the changing legal scene often worked against migrants hoping to get a legal status. According to non-governmental organizations, local authorities and activists could play a more important role in the future.
The forum built on the consultations held across the bloc in the fall of 2018 as well as on the overall evaluation of the EU legal migration framework and ""Urban Agenda. ""
The forum participants mentioned potentially setting up areas where migrants would be given access to a labor market . Guilhem Mante of the French Protestant Federation suggested that it would be possible to find French municipalities willing to participate in such a project.
Sanna Vestin, representing the Swedish Network of Refugee Support Groups, led the group discussion on legalization. Labor market was suggested as the best way to integrate fast and obtain documents in most countries. The participants of the discussion talked about wives who travel to join their husbands � some have the right to a family reunion, but arrive without necessary documents. They also touched upon the role of children of school age in helping parents get their documents.
""Every obstacle to legalize an inhabitant, or prolong his/her documents, will create a newly undocumented person. Civil society must be very attentive to that,"" Vestin told Sputnik.
Meanwhile, Gilles Lebreton, a French member of the European Parliament , is highly critical of the EU support for the non-profits helping migrants.
""The unelected government of Europe is forcefully trying to impose policies that European citizens refuse ... The European Commission, financed by us all and the NGOs financed with our money , lead their political actions against member states and their governments that don't share the Commission's views. High time to change that,"" Lebreton told Sputnik.
Several parties with a harsh stance on immigration, including Lebreton's National Rally, have recently gained popularity on the national level. The issue may play an important role at the European elections, scheduled for May 23-26. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
Migrants end Athens rail station sit-in as camp protest stiffens,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/migrants-end-athens-rail-station-sit-in-as-ca-587166.html,"Migrants End Athens Rail Station Sit-in As Camp Protest Stiffens Sumaira FH 22 hours ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 10:05 PM
Athens, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Asylum-seekers on Friday ended their occupation of the main Athens railway station as a protest demanding access to the border and passage to other EU states picked up steam in northern Greece .
Around 2,000 migrants housed in camps elsewhere in the country have gathered outside the migrant camp of Diavata near Thessaloniki , where minor clashes broke out on Thursday and Friday when police prevented them from heading towards the border with North Macedonia .
After spending the night in the fields outside Diavata, the migrants -- among them families with small children in tow -- tried to force the police cordon.
Security forces formed a shield wall and made sporadic use of tear gas and stun grenades to keep them from advancing.
Authorities said the incidents in Athens and Diavata was sparked by anonymous social media posts over recent days, claiming that human rights groups stood ready to assist migrants in crossing into North Macedonia and on to other EU states.
Both the government and the UN refugee agency have stressed that no such possibility exists.
In Athens , around 200 migrants had earlier occupied the Larissis central train station, shouting ""Saloniki"" ( Thessaloniki ) and "" Germany "", an AFP reporter at the station said.
They had bought tickets to Thessaloniki , intending to also travel to the Diavata camp before authorities realised the plan and halted the train.
Some set up tents on the platform as small children ran about the tracks.
After the occupation shut down train services to the north of the country, Migration Ministry officials persuaded the migrants to end the protest and coaches were sent to take them back to their camps.
Greece's migration minister Dimitris Vitsas said smugglers were behind a ""misinformation"" campaign.
""For some reason, smugglers are claiming that the borders will open. The borders are not going to open,"" Vitsas told state agency ANA.
North Macedonia 's interior minister said Skopje had reinforced its border security as a precaution.
""We dont expect any trouble. But we reinforced the security on the border because it is our obligation,"" Oliver Spasovski told AFP.
Another senior Greek migration ministry official said the demonstration was intended as a ""message"" to the European Union .
""It's a message that Europe must understand that this is a problem demanding a European solution,"" Miltiadis Klapas, general secretary of the migration ministry, told reporters at the train station.
""But it cannot be imposed like this,"" he added, referring to the station shutdown. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Britain's opposition leader walks Brexit tightrope,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/britains-opposition-leader-walks-brexit-tigh-587155.html,"Britain's Opposition Leader Walks Brexit Tightrope Faizan Hashmi 22 hours ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 09:55 PM
London, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Britain's Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has been propelled into an unprecedented position of power over Brexit but needs to walk a tightrope in dealing with the government his party despises, analysts said.
Unable to get the EU divorce deal through parliament with the votes of her own Conservatives and their right-wing allies, this week Prime Minister Theresa May dramatically changed course and turned to veteran socialist Corbyn.
But by jumping into bed with May , Corbyn risks being seen as the enabler of a Conservative Brexit -- anathema to many of his supporters.
Put simply, the bind for Labour is that it has many Remain-backing MPs representing Leave-supporting provincial seats and is led by a lifelong eurosceptic elected by pro-EU metropolitan types.
Labour's Brexit policy thus far has been one of constructive ambiguity, trying to retain its Leave-voting heartlands while not alienating their Corbynist, Remain-voting new party members.
By accepting the invitation to seek common ground with political enemy May , it could be decision time for Corbyn -- something which risks alienating supporters either way.
""Participation and then walking away is his best option,"" said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham .
""If they come to an agreement , that's quite dangerous for him. He cannot have his cake and eat it,"" he told AFP.
- Splitting the Conservatives - Corbyn is no fan of the European Union , seeing its free-market fundamentals as a roadblock to a socialist society.
The 69-year-old swept to the Labour leadership in 2015 on the back of thousands of new, young party members enthused by his undiluted leftist outlook.
The challenge for him is to retain that support base whilst upholding Labour 's pledge to respect the verdict of the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.
He and May had preliminary talks on Wednesday and their negotiating teams were back in a third day of urgent discussions on Friday. Labour thus far wants a much softer form of Brexit than May .
Britain is also now seeking an extension to its EU membership from April 12 to June 30.
EU officials are saying the deadline may have to be much longer -- up to a year -- but could be shortened.
Unlike Corbyn, May has nothing to lose: she will step down after seeing Brexit through.
""Corbyn will try to get as much kudos from the negotiations... paint himself as a national figure and potential prime minister ,"" Fielding said.
""His participation has already caused May all kinds of grief,"" he said, referring to the outrage the talks have triggered among right-wing Conservative Brexiteers opposed to the prime minister 's divorce deal they see as too soft already.
""He might have already further engineered Conservative divisions, which are helpful. By participating in these talks, he might hope to have gained something -- and then walk away."" - Premiership prize - The vast majority of Remain-backing Labour MPs want a second Brexit referendum, seeing this as a legitimate route towards keeping Britain in the EU.
However, Corbyn is not warm to the idea and parliament 's lower House of Commons, as a whole, is against it.
""It's been very difficult for Jeremy Corbyn but now he is really in a position where he will have to make some big decisions very quickly,"" said Paul Breen, a senior lecturer at the University of Westminster.
""Corbyn is trying to argue for some kind of sensible compromise."" Anand Menon, a European politics professor at King's College London university, said May and Corbyn did have some common interests.
""Neither of them wants a referendum. Neither of them wants a long delay, and neither of them are particularly keen on holding European Parliament elections"" -- something that must happen if Britain stays in the EU beyond May 22.
Meanwhile Alastair Campbell, who was centre-left Labour prime minister Tony Blair's communications chief and is now a key figure in the campaign for another referendum, said May had made Corbyn the most powerful opposition leader of modern times but urged him not to ""play her game and help her carry a disastrous Brexit over the line.""Pressing Corbyn to demand a second vote , he wrote in The Daily Telegraph newspaper: ""The Labour leader should make the most of it. It might just make him prime minister ."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The United States is making progress in its talks with Turkey intended to prevent the country from purchasing Russian S-400 air defense systems, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on Friday.
""I think we are making progress ,"" Pompeo told Fox news .
In December 2017 , Russia and Turkey signed a loan agreement for the supply of S-400 air defense systems to Ankara . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed in early March that the S-400 deal was completed and a new one on purchasing advanced S-500 air defense systems from Russia may be concluded in the future.
In response, the United State on Wednesday halted deliveries and activities with Turkey on F-35 fighter jet program over Ankara 's decision to buy the Russian S-400 air defense systems.
Pompeo explained that the United States is doing everything possible to convince other countries intending to purchase the S-400 systems that ""they ought not complete that transaction.""
However, the countries will have to make the decision themselves, Pompeo added.
On Wednesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko slammed the United States ' efforts to put pressure on Turkey over the S-400 purchase, saying Washington was using any possible means to influence its partners. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

LAHORE- (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News- 5 th April 2019) Pakistan Army has exposed Indian claim regarding the shooting down of F-16 by MiG-21.
The ISPR head Major General Asif Ghafoor in a tweet released a picture of unfired four Indian missiles which according to Indian army and media claim were 'fired' by MiG-21 in a dogfight with F-16. Indian say its MiG-21 crashed after shooting down Pakistan F-16.
ISRP chief in a tweet said Pak Army had in possession of the remains of all four missiles carried by the MiG-21 Bison which crashed in Pakistani territory after the Feb 27 dogfight.
He said seeker heads of all four missiles were intact — implying that they were never fired — which runs counter to the Indian Air Force's persistent claim that its MiG-21 Bison had engaged a Pakistani F-16 before being shot down itself.
“ IAF claim of hitting F-16 by their Mig 21 before having been shot down by PAF gets exposed. All 4 missile seeker heads recovered intact from the wreckage & held. Pakistan and its professional Armed Forces staying humble by not drum beating. We have more truth on this to share . More importantly, he implied that the military is in possession of more proof that contradicts Indian claims,” tweeted ISPR head.
He took to the twitter to further expose Indian claims soon after Foreign Policy magazine falsified tweeting that “India has claimed it shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet in February . But a new U.S. count of F-16s suggests New Delhi had it wrong.”"

LONDON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The United Kingdom leaving the European Union 's single market and customs union will likely cause the French economy to contract 0.2 percentage points to 1.1 percent, the Dutch bank ING has predicted.
""Assuming that a 'hard' Brexit causes a 20% drop in trade between France and the United Kingdom in 2019 , GDP for this year would be cut by 0.2pp, which would yield a GDP growth of 1.1% in 2019 in the case of 'hard' Brexit ,"" ING's Senior Economist for France Julien Manceaux wrote in his report.
The economist compared the hard Brexit setback for the French economic growth to that of the yellow vest protests. The difference is that the impact would be felt in different areas, namely high value-added manufacturing sectors and employment-intensive service sectors.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has advocated giving up access to the EU customs union and using the post-Brexit transition period to agree a UK-EU trade deal that would allow her country to become a global trading nation. Her plan was rejected three times by the parliament . The country looks poised to crash out of the bloc on April 12 unless Brussels grants May 's request for a delay until June 30."

""We would like to renew his contract, that's the idea,"" Bartomeu told ESPN in an interview published on Friday.
""I believe he still has many years in front of him and in the coming months we will sit down with him so that he has many more years at Barcelona . "" Messi joined Barcelona 's academy aged 13 and is one of the few players left from Pep Guardiola's iconic team that won the treble in 2009.
In total, he has won nine La Liga titles with the club, as well as four in the Champions League and six in the Copa del Rey.
""Messi is a one-club man ,"" Bartomeu added. ""It's more than what he does on the pitch, his relationship with Barca will last forever.
""I use the example of Pele, who was always at Santos . We want Messi to always be at Barca, whether that's playing on the pitch or being linked to the club (after he retires)."""

Oslo, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world 's biggest at more than $1 trillion, will soon be able to invest in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure projects, such as wind farms and solar parks, the government said Friday.
Currently 66.3 percent of the fund is invested in shares, 30.7 percent in bonds, and three percent in real estate.
While the fund already owns stakes in listed companies in the renewable energy sector, Friday's announcement means it will now have more latitude to invest in infrastructure projects at an earlier stage, thereby allowing it to maximise its gains.
""Allowing for unlisted renewable energy infrastructure is not a climate policy measure, but is a part of the investment strategy for the fund,"" Finance Minister Siv Jensen said in a statement.
""These investments shall be subject to the same profitability and transparency requirements as the other investments of the fund,"" she added.
Fuelled by the Norwegian state's oil revenues, the fund already has an envelope of a maximum 60 billion kroner ($7 billion ) reserved for climate investments.
That ceiling will now be doubled to 120 billion kroner.
According to consulting firm McKinsey, the global renewable energy market is currently valued at $2.9 trillion, and is expected to rise to $4.2 trillion by 2030.
Norway is the biggest oil and gas producer in Western Europe .
The fund has in recent years gone increasingly green -- moves hailed by the environmental lobby though the changes are usually based on purely financial considerations.
In March , Oslo announced it was selling off its stakes in oil and gas exploration and production companies to reduce its exposure to black gold .
That decision could affect more than a hundred companies specialised in upstream operations, including Chesapeake of the US, China 's CNOOC, Canada 's Encana, France 's Maurel and Britain's Tullow.
But companies involved in downstream operations or which also invest in renewable energies, including all the oil majors, will be spared.
The fund has already partially pulled out of the coal industry , both for environmental and financial reasons, but some companies had until now fallen through the cracks, such as Germany 's RWE.
On Friday, the Norwegian government said it was beefing up its criteria.
""It's a decisive step for the health of the fund and the planet,"" said Tom Sanzillo, head of the IEEFA think tank .
The fund will also be able to scrap its bonds in 10 emerging economies ( Chile , Czech Republic , Hungary , Israel , Malaysia , Mexico , Poland , Russia , South Korea and Thailand ).
On Friday, the fund's value was almost 9.04 trillion kroner ($1.05 trillion). Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

LONDON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Supporters of Julian Assange intensified on Friday their protest efforts outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , where the WikiLeaks founder is staying by right of asylum, due to the increasingly imminent threat of his expulsion from the diplomatic mission, a Sputnik correspondent reported.
On Thursday, WikiLeaks wrote on Twitter , citing a high-ranked Ecuadorian source, that Assange might be ousted from the embassy within ""hours or days,"" adding that the Ecuadorian authorities might use a leak in the so-called INA Paper offshore scandal , involving Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno, as a pretext to expel Assange.
One of the protesters, Clara Campos , told Sputnik that the group of supporters were keeping guard in case Assange was kicked out of the embassy, as ""there are rumors that Ecuador and the United States were preparing his expulsion.""
Campos added that over a dozen of tv cameras were focused on the embassy's entrance, waiting to capture the moment of ""Assange's execution.""
Other protesters say that Assange was detained for publishing the truth and ""irritating people in power. ""
At the same time, none of the protesters think that Assange will be expelled in broad daylight in front of TV cameras on Friday. According to one of the demonstrators, there have previously been a number of false alarms.
Earlier this week, in an interview with a local broadcaster, Moreno accused Assange of violating the conditions of his asylum at the embassy. Specifically, the president argued that Assange could not meddle in politics of other states, particularly, Ecuador 's partners.
Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in the United Kingdom since 2012. The activist has repeatedly said he fears extradition to the United States due to the fact that he has published thousands of leaked classified US authorities' documents. His defense team has cited media reports suggesting that Moreno had sought to reach an agreement with the United States on handing Assange over to Washington in exchange for ""debt relief."""
