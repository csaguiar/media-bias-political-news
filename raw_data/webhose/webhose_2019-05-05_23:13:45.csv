Barack Obama Warns Progressives Not to Form ‘Circular Firing Squad’,www.breitbart.com,Accountant5939,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/06/barack-obama-warns-progressives-not-to-form-circular-firing-squad/#post-98,"Businessmen, each and every one. Farmers have to have knowledge of what products to raise and sell, lawyers sell their services, etc. They all had to be intelligent, know how to sell, whether produce, personal services, or how to put together a government. The government is a business. It hires, fires, makes profits, funds foreign countries (charities) produces, regulates, enforces. the people (workers) rely on the government (company) to continue supplying a living. If the government (company) fails, the people/workers fail. That is just a few things a business and the government have in common.
We have free and low income clinics for those who cannot afford health insurance. It is funded thru medicaid. The clinics have access to free medications from big pharma. For instance, the company that makes lantus (insulin) will supply patients with it for free. There is also programs like 'Extra Help' that pays the out of pocket costs of medication for elders on limited incomes. All these programs are free for the asking and proof that the patient is unable to afford the medication and the doctor has prescribed it."

Boeing 737 Max 8 Problems,www.debatepolitics.com,Gladiator,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.debatepolitics.com/science-and-technology/353072-boeing-737-max-8-problems.html,"4,129 Boeing 737 Max 8 Problems ""The planemaker said last week it would submit final paperwork for the revamp to the Federal Aviation Administration by March 29 to make the system -- known as MCAS -- less aggressive in pushing down a planes nose, and to add redundancy so that its less likely to activate when other systems malfunction. Now Boeing says the update wont be ready until the coming weeks. An issue with integrating the software fix and the planes existing flight-control architecture came to light as Boeing did a final audit of the upgrade, according to a person briefed on the work. Ensuring that MCAS will perform as desired while not interfering with existing flight controls isnt expected to be a significant challenge said the person, who wasnt authorized to speak about the work and asked not to be identified."" What was the MCAS fix in January, 2019? Why didn't the MCAS disengage when pilots followed the Boing protocol to cancel the MCAS? How did the Nose Down self-generated computer commands override manual control input? How many versions of the Boeing 737 need to be upgraded? //"
The making of an American terrorist,www.debatepolitics.com,Rogue Valley,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.debatepolitics.com/middle-east/353070-making-american-terrorist.html,"4/6/19 ROJ CAMP, Syria  Hoda Muthana is pushing a stroller in the middle of a conflict zone here and if there's a textbook example of extremism, this probably isn't it. That's partly because of what is in Muthana's arms: Adam, her 18-month-old son. Hes a cute kid. Bright brown eyes, like his mom. His tiny hooded coat is emblazoned with patterns of elephants in profile. Some are upside down. What Adam couldn't know is that his mom abandoned the comforts of a suburban American life for one of the world's most barbaric terror organizations. The Trump administration believes Muthana, 24, born in New Jersey and raised in Alabama, is too big a threat to the United States to return. ""They dont seem to want to understand what happened in my life that led me to this depraved path. I didnt just wake up in the morning and decide to join the most horrendous jihadist group in history,"" Muthana said, speaking to USA TODAY from the camp in northern Syria where she has been detained by a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia since last year amid the collapse of the Islamic State group's self-proclaimed caliphate. Muthana snuck off to Syria in 2014 at age 19. She married Islamic State, or ISIS, fighters and exhorted her fellow Americans to commit mass murder and terror attacks. She now is at the center of a political, legal and diplomatic firestorm that carries far-reaching implications for the way the U.S. confronts Americans who join extremist groups. Muthana used to be devoted to a terrorist organization known for beheadings and other gruesome violence, which they recorded for recruitment videos. She helped circulate these videos on social media. Now she wants to return to the U.S. with Adam, whom she conceived with one of the ISIS fighters she married in Syria  and outlived. But there is a major obstacle in her way: President Donald Trump. The president does not want to let Muthana come back to the U.S., even though she has expressed remorse for her actions and is willing to face the U.S. justice system and near-certain jail time. ""Her mother wont speak of her,"" said Charles Swift, a Texas-based civil rights attorney who is representing Hoda Muthana's father. The State Department's attorneys have until mid-April to respond to the family's lawsuit, and the judge could decide the case this summer. At Roj Camp, Muthana fears ISIS sympathizers may try to harm her for disowning the terrorists. ""I dont feel safe. I expect retaliation from any side,"" she said. Bring Muthana back to the United States and charge her with ""material support of terrorism"". American citizen John Walker Lindh (captured in Afghanistan) was sentenced to 20 years/no parole in 2002 after being found guilty under a similar charge (10 counts)."

Tens of millions of Americans can't see a doctor at all, and tens of millions more go financially bankrupt when they're sick or injured. Quality of care varies wildly between rural and city clinics. America has the most rationed healthcare in the industrialized world. Literal death panels at insurance companies decide if someone gets treatment or not. Compare me and my brother, a tale of two equally educated engineers. He lives in the US and pays about 500 USD a month for health insurance and has a $5,000 deductible and can be rejected for arbitrary reasons. I pay about 400 USD a month in Germany for full coverage for my entire family including dental, I can't be denied care for any reason, I have no deductible and essentially no out of pocket costs, and statistically I will live longer and have better healthcare outcomes. Why do you celebrate a healthcare system that costs over twice what every other industrialized nations pay and yet is consistently ranked low in all of the metrics that matter? they do it because right wing propaganda tells them to. i used to do the same thing.

Re: Barr overstepped his authority Originally Posted by Rogue Valley Barr overstepped his authority and undermined the integrity of the Mueller investigation AG Barr works for Donald Trump, an employer strongly resistant to transparency. Red: The crux of of the current contretemps. There is no provision in the special counsel rules which provide Barr with the independence and the power to make a determination of guilt, or a lack of sufficient evidence to prove guilt. Barr's task was to provide Congress with a written summary of Mueller's conclusions ... not to interpret those conclusions. Keeping in mind the anti-Mueller investigation memo that Barr shared with the White House previous to his appointment as Attorney General overseeing the Mueller investigation, it becomes clear that Barr entered the office with a documented bias against confirming any [Trump] obstruction of justice. The sensible remedy here is to have an independent judge cull the 400 page Mueller Report of the most sensitive classified information, and make determinations on what passages, if any, constitute protected ""executive privilege"" conversations. Then release what remains to Congress (or the public domain). Rubbish. The regulations governing the special counsel appointment state: At the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel. Notice that the explanation is confidential, only for the AG. Moreover, the policy of the DOJ is not speak publicly about the evidence against uncharged persons. (You might recall it was a criticism by Democrats against Comey in the Hillary email scandal.) And there are 6e restrictions as well as national security restrictions. So if you are saying that Barr was TOO open, and should have provided nothing to anyone...you may be right."

Re: Why War ****s People Up Originally Posted by HumblePi Has anyone ever questioned the reasons that all the men and women that returned home from Europe after WWI or those returning from the South Pacific or Europe after WW2 didn't seem to have the same PTSD as those returning from Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq? Of course, some game home from both world wars suffering some type of anxiety disorder but as many as 30% of Vietnam veterans have been diagnosed with some sort of anxiety disorder or PTSD. Here's some glaring differences between those who returned from one of the two World Wars, and those returning from Vietnam. Let's talk about drugs that the U.S. provided soldiers in Vietnam to use. According to a 1971 report by the Department of Defense, 51 percent of the armed forces had smoked marijuana, 31 percent had used psychedelics, such as LSD, mescaline and psilocybin mushrooms, and an additional 28 percent had taken hard drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. Okay so, there's that. But that doesn't explain the other cases resulting from conflicts like the Gulf War, Iraq and Afghanistan. Here's the part where everyone is going to jump all over my opinion and tell me I'm wrong, that we had to go to war there because of 9/11 or to take out a dictator like Saddam Hussein in Iraq. My point is that these were not wars. These were not formal wars with patriotic purposes that our men and women were sent to die for that where we were fighting against despotic, deranged men like Hitler and Mussolini, men guilty of crimes against humanity. Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam are political wars, those that our government chose to send our military to die for their own agenda which was primarily control of oil fields or oil routes. It's always about the oil, that's just a fact, that's where the basis for any U.S. military involvement in the Middle East stems from. Soldiers don't care if they die for a valid patriotic cause, but losing limbs or eyesight, or bombing civilians in order to protect oil is what causes so much stress that these men and women simply can't cope with it. The fact is, our servicemen have not fought in a real war with a common purpose since WW2. Not Korea, not Vietnam, not Iraq - none of them was a real war fought to control communism or oppression of dictators. And that right there is the difference. Nobody joins the military assuming that if they're sent to fight overseas that they're going to come back all ****ed up. The U.S. ****ed up by involving ourselves in the business of other countries, destabilized their governments, and created more enemies like ISIS and Al Qaeda which only arose after our invasion of Iraq. Why do we even wonder why they hate the U.S. so much? I want to say that US soldiers were not exposed to the worst horrors of WW1. No, the people who watched everyone die where the French and Germans. Russians too, but to a lesser extent. By the time the US showed up, the worst of the trench fighting was over. Same applies to WW2. With the exception of D-Day and the islands of the Pacific, US troops showed up at the end of that game too. And, I suspect most of the PTSD from those days was buried under the rug, as well. Nam, not so much. That war was all out and never ended, at least not well. We also killed the enemy at a 40:1 ratio there. So, mowing down humans was an every day occurrence there, for a decade. Iraq? Maybe the stress of not knowing who the enemy was, the ""accidental"" killing of civilians and constant threat of IED took its toll. Also, of course, better diagnosis played a part. The stupidity on the Right is legion, surpassed only by the ignorance. - Calamity 2019"

Not only humans are mummified - New facts have discovered in ancient Egypt tombs,ednews.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/sience/361409-not-only-humans-are-mummified,"1 2 3 4 5 Not only humans are mummified - New facts have discovered in ancient Egypt tombs A- A A+
Mummified mice are among the artefacts discovered in a decorated tomb recently unearthed near the Egyptian town of Sohag.
The mice and other animals surrounded two mummified human bodies and the burial chamber contains detailed paintings of funeral processions and people working in the fields.
Experts say the tomb is more than 2,000 years old and is thought to be the resting place of a senior official called Tutu and his wife. It was discovered in October when smugglers were caught illegally digging for artefacts.
The Egyptian government's antiquities ministry hopes the finds will draw visitors to the desert town 390km (242 miles) south of Cairo, near the Nile.
Mostafa Waziri, the secretary general of Egypt's supreme council of antiquities, said it was a ""beautiful, colourful tomb"" and ""one of the most exciting discoveries ever in the area"". Since the 2011 uprising, the country's political instability and insecurity has hit the tourism industry. The ministry hopes this new attraction will help draw visitors back.
A mummified woman and boy dating back to the Ptolemaic era were put on display outside the tomb. The woman is thought to have been aged between 35 and 50 when she died while the boy was 12 to 14.
More than 50 mummified mice, cats and birds were also unearthed.
Here, an archaeologist examines a carefully wrapped falcon.
Among the treasures found inside the tomb were fragments of painted, decorative faces.
The antiquities ministry said the presentation of this newly uncovered tomb was intended to ""draw the world's attention to the civilisation and antiquities of Egypt"".

The problem was with 10-20 million people( depending on who you believe) that either of their own choice or circumstance fell between private insurance and Medicaid. Obamacare’s cost ( government website estimated at $2 BILLION ) was like using the Queen Mary to cross a creek. We could have easily given( regardless of ethics and sound principals against it) top rated BlueCross/BlueShield coverage to those individuals at about , what, one hundredth the cost? My personal single coverage in California went from $760 to $1850 per month since the inception of this disaster.
So when clueless Republicans let the liberals set the vocabulary and theme ( healthcare that needs reform), we once again let the needs of a small minority dictate and take over one sixth of our economy.
The socialist monster of government single payer has always been the goal."
