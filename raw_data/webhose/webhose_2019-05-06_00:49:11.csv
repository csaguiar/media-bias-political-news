Libya’s Western-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj has accused his rival General Khalifa Haftar of betraying him by initiating a military push against the capital, that risks plunging the nation into civil war.
The head of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) said in a televised speech on Saturday that Haftar had “stabbed us in the back” by launching “a coup.”
Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) said its forces had advanced into the capital’s southern outskirts and taken its former international airport, prompting Sarraj to warn in a televised address of a “war without a winner.”
“We have extended our hands towards peace but after the aggression that has taken place on the part of forces belonging to Haftar… he will find nothing but strength and firmness,” Sarraj said.
Haftar’s troops, which are backed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, have been slowed in their advance amid “intensive” airstrikes by forces backing the GNA.
The airstrikes came as fresh fighting flared south of Tripoli despite warning from several European foreign ministers to Haftar not to countenance any further military action.
Armed groups allied to Sarraj moved machinegun-mounted vehicles from Misrata towards the Libyan capital to defend the city.
Sarraj also called on the international community to stop attempts to militarize the oil-rich country, in a veiled rebuke of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.
“And a last word to the countries that support Libyans fighting: fear God and stop interfering in our affairs. The tables will turn one day. God protect Libya,” he said.
A senior Libyan general said on Saturday that Haftar’s forces were using Emirati and Egyptian weapons in their push to capture the capital. Saudi Arabia has also given Haftar the green light for the offensive and supplied him with money, he added.
“The three Arab countries support Haftar’s militias in order to create a new Sisi in Libya,” said Mohammad al-Qunidi, who is chief of the military intelligence loyal to Sarraj, referring to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
According to British daily The Guardian, Haftar met King Salman of Saudi Arabia on March 27 in Riyadh apparently to discuss his offensive plans.
The United Nations has voiced deep concerns about the escalating tensions. It plans to hold a conference later this month in the Libyan city of Ghadames to discuss a political solution to the conflict.
Libya has been the scene of increasing violence since 2011, when former dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled from power after an uprising and a NATO military intervention.
His ouster created a huge power vacuum, leading to chaos and the emergence of numerous militant outfits, including the Daesh terrorist group.
The oil-rich country is now divided between two rival governments — the House of Representatives, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, and the government of Sarraj, or the Tripoli-based GNA.
Apart from the three Arab countries backing Haftar, some European governments that once contributed to the NATO military operation to oust Gaddafi have also offered the Libyan strongman some diplomatic support.
On Friday, Russia stressed that it had not assisted Haftar’s forces in their latest push to take over Tripoli, calling for a political solution to the recent flare-up of tensions in Libya.

The Ladder Of Divine Ascent And Moral Improvement,www.therussophile.org,Fr. Stephen FREEMAN,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-ladder-of-divine-ascent-and-moral-improvement.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The Fourth Sunday of Great Lent in the Orthodox Church, is dedicated to St. John Climacus, the author of the ancient work, The Ladder of Divine Ascent . It is a classic work describing “steps” within the life of the struggling ascetic. There is an icon associated with this work, picturing monastics climbing the rungs of a ladder to heaven, battling demons who are trying to pull them off. However, ladders are dangerous things to put in the hands of a modern Christian.
Modernity likes ladders. We like the idea of upward mobility, of continuing improvement, of moral progress. We speak of “career ladders” and the “ladder of success.” It is the myth of personal power. Modernity is a cultural phenomenon created by the theology of the Reformation and the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Freed from the constraints of inherited tradition (such as the Catholic Church) and the royal state (hurrah for democracy), modernity is a story told to individuals that they can now become whatever they want. Freedom and personal industry are the twin rails supporting the rungs of progress. As a philosophy, this idea and its associated notions are the bedrock of free-market capitalism. As theology, it is the foundation for self-help Christianity and the positive, motivational preaching of contemporary religion. “Be all that you can be, and Jesus can help!”
Nurtured in this culture, contemporary Orthodox believers are not immune to its allure, particularly if the images appear in the guise of desert monasticism and Byzantine/Russian-style striving. More than once I have heard the sad confession, “I don’t feel like I’m a very good Orthodox Christian.” Implied in this statement is that Orthodox Christians should, somehow, be better than other Christians. Some foolish people even call us the “marines” of the spiritual life.
Of course, all of this, particularly when applied to writings such as St. John’s Ladder , is pure distortion and delusion. Its most subtle and seductive version is that of moral progress . I wrote a series of articles last year denouncing the concept of moral progress, identifying it as largely a modern notion and not consistent with the mind of the fathers. Here, I reaffirm that without equivocation.
We simply are not saved by getting better. It is a false image and a false goal. Of course, critics will charge that I’m being defeatist and suggesting a path devoid of moral effort. I am doing nothing of the sort. Everyone should, at all times, struggle against sin. But measuring, even watching for improvement can be not only self-defeating but sinful in itself. The Ladder points to a very different path:
“You cannot escape shame except by shame,” St. John says (4.62).
We do not gradually improve and thereby leave our shame behind us. The way down is the way up. The ladder of divine ascent is actually a ladder of divine descent . The path to union with God is only found in making the descent with Him. “Lo, if I descend into hell, Thou art there” (Ps 139:8). St. Gregory the Theologian says, “If He descends into hell, go with Him” (Oration 45).
The path of modernity carries no humility. It breeds pride, and frequently contempt. Failure is its nemesis. We blame ourselves for laziness and sloth, certain that a little more effort will make the difference. Like a child given a bad grade, we plead that we’ll try harder. Confession is seen as the Second Chance, the opportunity to pull up our grades. “Loser!” is the taunt of the modern world (a word spawned in the pit of hell).
But St. John points us towards our shame. He does not describe a path of moral improvement. His path follows the Cross, which is the descent into Hades. My failure, not sought for its own sake (we do not sin in order to gain grace), is always and immediately the gate of Hades and the gate of Paradise. When I acknowledge my failure and refuse to hide from its shame, we can call out for Christ to comfort us. “I did not turn my face from the shame and the spitting” (Is. 50:6). He will meet us in our shame, and takes it upon Himself. My failure becomes the failure of God (2 Cor. 5:21). It does not separate me from Christ, but, ironically, unites me to Him in the paradox that is at the very heart of our salvation. God became what we are, that we might become what He is. God does not meet us in the middle. He meets us at the bottom and asks us to meet Him there as well.
It is within that place that true humility is born. Judgment ceases. If I accept my shame in union with Christ, how can I judge another? Indeed, it is largely my efforts to avoid my shame that makes me judge my brother. We can only avoid judging if we “see our own transgressions” (as we are taught in the Prayer of St. Ephrem ).
Modernity loves excellence. The moral improvement pitches of the motivational preachers love the drive for excellence. Our bosses and the owners demand that we strive for excellence. God is not our boss, nor does He place us in His debt (“freely you have received”). The constant nagging voice demanding improvement and excellence is not the voice of God. It is often nothing more than the neurotic echo of modernity sounding in our brains. It drives us with the threat of shame. However, Christ has trampled down shame by shame and invites us to do the same thing. “You cannot escape shame except by shame.”
Become a Christian who follows Christ. We do not seek to please Him with our excellence. We seek to imitate Him by going where He has gone."

Libya is in chaos since 2011 when the NATO intervened in the country and overthrew the government of Muammar Gaddafi.
Now, there are two governments in Libya: The Libyan Government of National Accord (LGNA), which is based in Tripoli and led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. It’s fomally recognized by the “international community”. the interim Cabinet of Abdullah Al-Thani who is acting in the country’s east together with the elected parliament and supported by the Libyan National Army of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar.
The LGNA formally controls Tripoli, Misrata and several other areas in northwestern Libya. It’s formally backed by the US and some other Western powers.
The LGNA has no real military force, but it’s formally supported by various armed groups receiving support from or having links with the US and its allies. One of them is the Suwwar Libya (Revolutionaries of Libya aka Libya Revolutionaries Joint Operations Room (LROR). It’s a strong alliance of insurgents who participated in the rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi government. They openly co-operate with Islamists. The Seventh Brigade, otherwise known as the Kanyat is also supporting the LGNA. They are joined by fighters from the Misrata and Zintan regions.
One of the most important figures supporting the LGNA is Abdel Rauf Kara, leader of the Special Deterrent Force (or Rada) which is based in the Maitiga complex. Armed groups from the Suq al-Jumaa area of Tripoli, including the Nawasi brigade, are also key to securing the LGNA.
The Libyan National Army (LNA), under the leadership of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, controls a large part of the country including its east and south. It is often mentioned in the media as backed up by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, France, and Russia.
Haftar’s LNA has also formed pacts and alliances with various Libyan communities. Many towns and tribes allied with Haftar out of desperation at the impotence of the Tripoli-based LGNA. Others did so to obtain leverage against local rivals. Click to see the full-size image
This week the LNA started a large-scale advance to take control of Tripoli. On April 4th, Haftar announced that “the time has come” to take Tripoli in an audio message, pledging to spare civilians and “state institutions.”
“To our army, that’s stationed on all axis in Tripoli’s outskirt, today we, God’s willing, resume our victorious march … Today we answer the call of our people in our precious capital as we promised them … Our date with the glorious liberation has come, so step forward … And enter it [Tripoli] with peace,” the Libyan Marshal said.
Just several hours after the announcement, the LNA began a sort of blitzkrieg capturing the city of Gharyan, only 80km south of Tripoli, from militants allied to the LGNA. During the announcement, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in the city to discuss the ongoing crisis in the country.
According to reports, Field Marshal Haftar spoke to Guterres on April 5th and told him that his forces would not stop until “terrorism” had been defeated.
Since then, Haftar’s forces have met some resistance from the LGNA, but have continued their advance and according to latest news are located about 10 km from Tripoli’s city center.
So far, upwards of 37 people were killed or wounded in clashes . The LGNA even used its small air force to target positions of the advancing LNA force. In turn, the LNA declared a no-fly zone for warplanes in this part of the country. On April 5 th , the forces loyal to the LGNA arrested more than 100 LNA fighters.
The success of the LNA operation is still unclear, since the LGNA is also offering heavy resistance and is carrying out airstrikes on targets near Tripoli. Therefore, the LNA may face significant difficulties with capturing the city itself. Nonethless, it’s a fact that Haftar’s force were able to reach the city itself.
Sarraj on April 6 th accused Haftar of “betraying” him.
“We have extended our hands towards peace but after the aggression that has taken place on the part of forces belonging to Haftar and his declaration of war against our cities and our capital… he will find nothing but strength and firmness,” Sarraj said in a televised speech.
The overall international community reaction is a call for peace.
The governments of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the EU High Representative said in a joint statement on April 6 th that they condemned the escalation of violence and warned, “Those who tamper with security in Tripoli or elsewhere in Libya that they will be held accountable for any such actions.”
“These attempts to weaken the legitimate Libyan authorities and hinder the ongoing political process are not acceptable,” the statement published by the French foreign ministry said.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the violence but for many Libyans, the UN-backed GNA has no real authority.
On Russia’s part, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the situation in Libya is being closely monitored and called for a peaceful resolution.
“We are watching the developments in Libya very closely. Without a doubt, we believe that it is essential that any actions must not lead to renewed bloodshed. We also deem it necessary to continue all possible efforts to fully settle the situation through peaceful, political means,” the Kremlin spokesman said.
Commenting on the actions by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar (and possibly anticipating accusations by the West), the Kremlin spokesman said: “Moscow is not participating in this in any way.”

I have a student who, if he could, would embed his iPhone and iPad and bliss out like a Nivenian wirehead . More than anything else he wants to famous for being famous and filthy rich like his idols: influencers . They make millions and millions by just being cool, Mr. Hess! Well, maybe not that much, but a lot. For now.
Anyone who watched the brilliant arc of Don Draper journey from shilling the curing of tobacco to teaching the world to sing understands how advertising works and the importance of celebrity endorsements. The final episode of Mad Men had Draper, sitting in meditation, realize that Coca Cola didn’t need a celebrity endorsement, Coke needed a lifestyle endorsement. Coke needed influencers.
That was the seed, but social media was the black loam. Where advertisers once sought celebrities to smoke, drink, shave, eat or wear their product, now thousands of people used the products—and touted them on social media for free—in hope of getting advertisers to fund their lifestyle. They hoped that their coolness would attract vapid members of their generation would seek to imitate them: to wear their shoes, to play their games, to eat their snacks, so that they too might be cool.
Cool is the problem. Richard Petty was once asked if STP —Petty’s major sponsor—helped his car go faster. He replied: It never seemed to hurt none . That’s cool.
Today, however, cool is so high school.
Sophie Elmhirst, writing in her Guardian long-read ‘It’s genuine, you know?’: why the online influencer industry is going ‘authentic’ , dives in:
Over the last decade, influencer marketing–the business of brands paying social media celebrities [People famous for being famous, JH] to advertise their wares–has become a well-established tactic. Influencers now have their own line on a brand’s marketing-spend spreadsheet alongside TV, radio and so on … If phase one was hyperactive expansion–bump the follower count, boss the Instagram algorithm, rack up the brand deals–then insiders say that phase two is about authenticity, about “coming back to quality again,” as Dominic Smales, CEO of [Fashion influencer Victoria] Magrath’s agency Gleam Futures, told me.
Coming back to quality again? Really? So, everything before was just drek?
In this new era of authenticity, influencers must display passion, a word that fills the air at Gleam. (It is the kind of office where instead of replying “yes” to a question, everyone says “100 percent!”) Magrath is like Gleam’s head girl, a role model for others: “Victoria is really passionate about Dior, for example,” said Smales. “She’ll hang out with the people at Dior because she loves that brand, she loves what they do, for no payment or anything like that. Not everything is transactional, it’s genuine, you know?”
Of course for Victoria and her ilk, everything is transactional. When anyone in advertising uses words like authentic , passionate , love or genuine , you know that whatever they’re talking about is the antithesis of all those qualities. Elmhirst continues.
Like many in the industry, Gleam have come to dislike the term “influencer”, finding it both misrepresentative and degrading. They describe themselves instead as a “digital-first talent agency”: if their talent have influence, that is simply a blessed byproduct of their creative abilities. Gleam pride themselves on being able to distinguish between the hollow Instagrammers in it for fame and cash, and the genuine talent who have the potential to broaden and prolong their career beyond the transient limits of a social media platform (hence digital-first: their talent might start online, but they could go anywhere, do anything). “We want to represent the absolute crème de la crème,” Lucy Loveridge, Gleam’s head of global talent, told me. “In the UK, there’s a lot of what I would call ‘influencers’. There’s less talent.”
In advertising you must first sell yourself, you can’t whore without being a whore.
You know what? I can’t finish this shit. I’m not saying that Elmhirst is a bad writer, she’s not. I’m just saying that time is too precious a commodity to waste on reading the rest of this.
Time to go do something useful like trim my toenails."
"Tahrir Al-Sham, White Helmets Mount Chemical Warheads on over 100 Missiles in Demilitarized Zone",www.therussophile.org,VT Editors,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/tahrir-al-sham-white-helmets-mount-chemical-warheads-on-over-100-missiles-in-demilitarized-zone.html/,"Tahrir Al-Sham, White Helmets Mount Chemical Warheads on over 100 Missiles in Demilitarized Zone
Tahrir al-Sham al-Hay’at (the Levant Liberation Board or the Al-Nusra Front) and the pro-militant White Helmets equipped 120 missiles with chemical warheads in cooperation with western experts to launch false-flag chemical attack in the demilitarized zone to later accuse the Syrian Army of the incident.
The Arabic-language website of Sputnik quoted local sources in Idlib province as saying on Thursday that Tahrir al-Sham and Turkistani terrorist groups have mounted chemical warheads on 120 missiles in one of the former’s strongholds in Sahl al-Rouj region in Western Idlib.
They added that the missiles had been transferred from one of Tahrir al-Sham’s arms caches to their stronghold in Sahl al-Rouj on 5 ambulance vehicles last Monday, noting that the White Helmets have also transferred special equipment from Khan Sheikhoun to the region.
The sources said that Belgian chemical experts collaborated in equipment of missiles with chemical materials, adding that they also supervised transfer of 8 chlorine gas capsules from one of Tahrir al-Sham positions in the town of al-Dana in Northern Idlib to the base.
According to the report, the missiles equipped with chemical warheads were delivered to Jeish al-Izza and Horras al-Din terrorists in Northern Hama and the regions occupied by Ansar al-Touhid in Sahl al-Ghab and Turkistani party in Northeastern Lattakia.
Relevant reports said last Sunday that the pro-militant White Helmets Organization in collaboration with the Western spy agencies were planning to carry out a fake chemical attack in Hama and Aleppo to later accuse the Syrian Army of the incident and annul the Turkish-Russian agreement.
The Arabic-language al-Mayadeen news channel quoted a local source in Aleppo as saying that the White Helmets have transferred a number of barrels containing toxic materials from their bases in Idlib to Northern Hama.
He added that the terrorists are plotting to launch a new false-flag chemical attack in cooperation with the western intelligence agents, noting that the scenario is due to be implemented in the demilitarized zone in Northern Hama and Aleppo where Jeish al-Izza terrorists are stationed.
The source said that the aim of such provocative acts is defeating the plans to return control of Idlib to the Syrian government without any conflicts, adding that the plot was hatched after commanders of Tahrir al-Sham, Horras al-Din and Turkistani terrorist groups rejected a Turkish-Russian plan to give in the control of Idlib to the Syrian government.

However, those fears have since been downplayed by Ecuadorian officials who released the following statement just hours ago: In a statement, Ecuador’s Foreign Minister denies that it will expel Assange “imminently”.

“If you look at the bigger context of this plus pressure put by Mike Pence on the Ecuadorian government which was last summer plus a 4.2 billion dollar IMF loan package that was awarded to Ecuador just last month’s in February – you put all these things together and it does look like there’s quite a few deals going on in the background, three-way deals, perhaps a backroom deal between the US the UK and the Ecuadorian government to basically deliver Julian Assange to the United States.”
Regarding what may, or may not, be going on behind the scenes, or whether Ecuadorian president Lenín Moreno was really motivated by retribution against Assange over Ecuador’s recent INA scandal for allegedly ‘hacking’ of his office and family’s personal accounts, Henningsen believes Moreno is using the same ‘deflect and distract’ tactics employed by Washington throughout the Russiagate debacle:
“Look at the claims by Moreno. He’s accusing WikiLeaks of hacking. So this hacking accusation – does this sound familiar? We’ve heard this before… this is exactly what the United States has been waging on WikiLeaks in terms of accusations with regards to Russia Gate and so with very little evidence to sort of back it up. So it seems like the Ecuadorian government is getting PR cues from Washington … also the deflection of the issue on to WikiLeaks, on to Assange – when WikiLeaks hasn’t published anything, to anyone’s knowledge, on the INA scandal. So this deflection is also familiar. This is what Washington has done to sort of deflect from Hillary Clinton (scandals) for the last two years – by creating Russiagate and sort of putting Trump and the Mueller investigation into motion.”

"Secret Document Reveals Plans for Civil War in Lebanon, Israeli False Flags, and Invasion",www.therussophile.org,Randi Nord,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/secret-document-reveals-plans-for-civil-war-in-lebanon-israeli-false-flags-and-invasion.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
( GPA ) – During his visit with US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, Lebanese President Michael Aoun reportedly received a US-Israeli document detailing plans for creating a civil war in Lebanon with covert false flag operations and possible Israeli invasion.
Although the source of the document is Israeli and created in partnership with Washington, no one knows who presented it to Aoun. The Lebanese TV station, Al-Jadeed , initially reported the document on Lebanese TV and a video on its website. Geopolitics Alert translated the report for this article. Israel and the United States Foment Civil War in Lebanon
The document details American plans to splinter the Lebanese Internal Security Forces, a domestic institution separate from the Lebanese Army. The plans involve Washington investing 200 million dollars into the Internal Security Forces (ISF) under the guise of keeping the peace but with the covert goal of creating sectarian conflict against Hezbollah with 2.5 million specifically dedicated to this purpose.
The document states the ultimate goal is to destabilize the country by creating a civil war in Lebanon which will “help Israel on the international scene.” The United States and Israel plan to accomplish this by supporting “democratic forces,” sounding remarkably similar to the same strategy used in Syria, Libya, Venezuela, and elsewhere.
According to the document, although “full load of our firepower will be unleashed,” they somehow do not anticipate any casualties. They do, however, expect the civil war to “trigger requests” for intervention from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) which Israel must only agree to after extreme reluctance.
The document says Israel will also play an important role by creating “covert false flag operations” as the conflict progresses. Perhaps these operations would include chemical attacks similar to the chemical attacks on civilians in Syria or even direct attacks on Lebanese or Israeli civilians to blame on Hezbollah and justify international intervention.
The document admits that the United States and Israel will need an unprecedented amount of credibility to pull this off and also admits that the Lebanese Army may be an obstacle, likely due to the Army’s diverse makeup. As a legitimate political party with members throughout all aspects of Lebanese society, Hezbollah already has members and allies throughout the ISF as well as the Army. Mike Pompeo Holds Meeting with Lebanese Officials
During his meeting with Lebanese President, Michael Aoun, US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo presented an ultimatum: contain Hezbollah or expect unprecedented consequences.
According to Foreign Policy , Pompeo told Aoun that if he fails to complete the impossible task of removing Hezbollah from government institutions and cracking down on its military activities, Lebanon should expect an end to US aid and even potential sanctions.
“It will take courage for the nation of Lebanon to stand up to Hezbollah’s criminality, terror, and threats,” Pompeo said.
At a dinner, Pompeo reportedly warned Lebanese officials that they themselves were potential targets for sanctions such as members of the Free Patriotic Movement, President Aoun’s party with the majority of its support coming from Lebanese Christians.
Potential sanctions will likely first target the Lebanese Health Ministry which is currently managed by an elected member of Hezbollah’s political party. Civilians across Lebanon rely on a functioning Health Ministry for subsidized medications and general medical care so these sanctions would create immense suffering for the entire Lebanese population.
The civil war plan detailed in the document is not likely to succeed according to US plans. The Lebanese Security forces are not a homogeneous group. Members of Hezbollah and their Christian allies hold many positions not only in the ISF but throughout the Lebanese Army and several branches of government. The Lebanese constitution and political system require all sects have adequate representation in government. As such, a potential manufactured civil war would likely focus on re-writing the Lebanese constitution as a top priority.
It is unclear if Pompeo’s staff presented Aoun with this document as a threat prior to their meeting. It is clear, however, that the US and Israel are plotting behind closed doors to create sectarian conflict in Lebanese society and its democratic political process, similar to actions in Syria, Lybia, Yemen, Venezuela, Iran, and so on.

"Liz Cheney Proposes Bill to Keep at Least 10,000 US Troops in Afghanistan",www.therussophile.org,Jason Ditz,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/liz-cheney-proposes-bill-to-keep-at-least-10000-us-troops-in-afghanistan.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
( ANTIWAR.COM ) — 18 years into the US occupation of Afghanistan, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) is looking to ensure that the war can continue to be a sinkhole for US troops and money for years to come, introducing the Ensuring a Security Afghanistan Act.
The bill, which Cheney is cosponsoring with Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Mike Waltz (R-FL), would forbid the president from reducing the US troop level in Afghanistan below 10,000 unless a broad and unlikely set of military requirements are first met.
Cheney argued that an unoccupied Afghanistan would be a “safe haven for terrorism,” claiming that al-Qaeda remains close to the Taliban and that the conditions on the ground don’t support the US leaving.
In reality, there is no sign of an active Taliban relationship with al-Qaeda at all, and the Taliban have openly promised that in any peace deal they would forbid al-Qaeda and ISIS from being present in Afghanistan.
She and her limited Congressional supporters argue that the deal in the process of being negotiated is a “bad deal,” and that the bill is designed to prevent it. They argue keeping US troops there will keep Afghanistan “stable and safe,” despite Afghanistan suffering repeated military defeats to the Taliban, and still nowhere near self-sufficient after a generation of war.

What Message Lies Behind the Latest Foreign Tour by Tsai Ing-Wen?,www.therussophile.org,Darryl Paolucci,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/what-message-lies-behind-the-latest-foreign-tour-by-tsai-ing-wen.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
On 21 March, the President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, embarked on an eight-day foreign tour, which included three countries in the Pacific Ocean (Palau, Nauru and the Marshall Islands). This trip once again refocused our attention on the topic of Taiwan’s role in the “global game of chess”, as the relationship between the two world powers (the United States and China) is shifting towards the “board’s” epicenter.
The previously mentioned topic includes many aspects, and one of these is often referred to as the “controversial international status” of Taiwan. The term “controversial”, however, is used mainly by U.S. political scientists, while in China the nation’s status is not described in this manner. In Beijing, the island is viewed as an integral part of “one China”, and the reasons why, at present, Taiwan is not de facto under the jurisdiction of the PRC are purely incidental and historical in nature.
The majority of world’s nations directly or indirectly share the previously mentioned stance. And, currently, only 17 countries maintain official diplomatic ties with Taipei. We would like to remind our readers that in 1971 Taiwan lost its seat at the United Nations to the PRC, and hence, it is no longer a member of this organization. The three, previously mentioned “mini”-nations in the Pacific Ocean, are among the 17 countries (also mostly “small” in size) that continue to view the Republic of China (the official name of the island) as a sovereign state under international law.
As a matter of fact, the aforementioned majority has also included the United States since 1979. However, as previously reported on a number of occasions in the New Eastern Outlook, Washington’s actual policy towards Taipei (which depends on the extent the key element, mentioned earlier, of the “global game of chess” manifests itself) increasingly begins to resemble a “normal intergovernmental” one.
The reason why the aforementioned foreign tour of three nations in the Pacific Ocean garnered attention is that Tsai Ing-wen, on her way back home, made a “stopover” in Hawaii, a U.S. territory, on 28 March. This “short visit” was meant to serve as an illustration of the “normal intergovernmental” ties between the United States and Taiwan. It is possible to state, with great certainty, that “the layover” in Hawaii was the main aim of the Taiwanese President’s latest foreign tour.
It is also important to clarify that the terms such as “stopover”, “incidental”, “happenstance”, “layover” are quite inappropriate in this particular case. If we take a look at the map of the Pacific Ocean, we can see that the order in which Tsai Ing-wen paid official visits to these islands (Palau, Nauru and the Marshall Islands) took her further and further away to the east from Taiwan. Instead, she came closer and closer to Hawaii, which happened to be a slightly shorter flight away from Taiwan in comparison to that from the Marshall Islands.
In an attempt to address anticipated criticism from China on the nature of such a “layover”, the US Department of State stated that this visit was “based on long-standing US practice, and is consistent with the unofficial nature of our relations with Taiwan”.
And, in reality, such activities are gradually turning into “long-established practices”. However, up until that point, geographic locations of the places that Tsai Ing-wen visited during her foreign tours allowed her to use any of the previously mentioned terms to define her “unofficial” stops in the United States .
In Hawaii, Tsai Ing-wen confirmed her request to the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) to purchase 60 F-16 fighter aircraft and a consignment of Abrams tanks, with the aim of ensuring “self defense” of Taiwan and “deterrence” of “you know who” . All of this happened despite the warning made by China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson a week earlier at a press conference, where he stated that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan would severely damage “the Sino-U.S. cooperation in important spheres “.
These additional developments associated with Tsai Ing-wen’s foreign tour overlapped with other noteworthy events of recent months, which involved Taiwan, the United States, the PRC and Japan.
First of all, speeches given by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and by US Indo-Pacific Commander Admiral Philip Davidson in front of two different committees of the US Congress on 29 March are certainly noteworthy .
It is important to highlight that a pro-Taiwan lobby has been active in Congress for decades. One of its latest moves was a letter addressed to President Trump from 16 senators from both parties . The authors of the letter requested that the U.S. President send a Cabinet-level official to Taiwan to the celebrations of “the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act” (a pivotal document approved by the United States Congress on 10 April, 1979), which is used to govern the U.S. ties with Taiwan.
The pro-Taiwan members of U.S. Congress never miss a more or less suitable opportunity to inundate administration officials with questions, such as “What exactly are you doing to support our Asian ally in its confrontation with our main opponent?”. An official then needs to demonstrate to these Congressmen that “concrete actions” are being taken in good measure.
For instance, Mike Pompeo highlighted that the administration and U.S. Congress worked together on adopting the so-called “Taiwan Travel Act” (H. R. 535) at the beginning of 2018 , which legally allows high-level officials of the United States to visit Taiwan and vice versa. After saying this, he was asked to invite the President of Taiwan to visit the United States (officially, and not via a “layover”).
Mike Pompeo avoided giving a direct answer to this question, and instead talked about another development that demonstrated U.S. “support” of Taiwan. In his opinion, this amounted to two U.S. Navy ships sailing through the Taiwan Strait on 24 March of this year. The event coincided with the previously mentioned foreign tour embarked on by Tsai Ing-wen. It is also worth noting that China’s leader Xi Jinping was also on his first for the year official trip abroad (in Europe) during the same period.
Admiral Philip Davidson’s speech in front of U.S. Congress was in line with the previously mentioned statements, made by Mike Pompeo. The military official said that Beijing was responsible for the rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait.
He also referred to Tsai Ing-wen’s commitment to “avoid confrontation and prevent surprises” in the strait in his speech. This is yet another illustration of the firm control that Washington has over key aspects of Taipei’s foreign policy.
Another recent event, worthy of note, was the fact that Japan joined Taiwan and the US “in co-hosting an international workshop “, whose all-encompassing title, Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF), allows its participants to discuss a wide range of international political issues.
The theme of the workshop, held on 27-28 March in Taipei, was the currently fashionable issue of “combating corruption in the public and private sectors”. The United States and Japan were represented at the workshop by the American Institute in Taiwan and the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association, respectively, which essentially function as de facto embassies of these countries in Taiwan.
It is quite important to note that most Taiwanese residents as well as the leadership of the island (irrespective of party affiliation) have a positive opinion of Japan. In fact, this favorable view also applies to the period when the island was occupied by the Empire of Japan, and this is what makes the relationship between Japan and Taiwan radically different from that between South Korea and Japan .
Finally, it also worth focusing on internal developments taking place in Taiwan, which began in anticipation of the upcoming presidential election, scheduled to be held at the end of next year. We would like to remind our readers that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suffered a substantial loss in the election for the Legislative Yuan, which took place on 24 November 2018.
Tsai Ing-wen accepted the responsibility for the defeat and left her post as the leader of the DPP party. As a result her participation in the upcoming presidential was in doubt. In order to dispel this uncertainty, Tsai Ing-wen definitively confirmed her participation in the election before her aforementioned foreign tour. Her suitable age, high qualifications, charm, energy and “work experience” (as they say) ensure that Tsai Ing-wen has a chance of being re-elected as the President of Taiwan.
And the latest foreign tour, among other things, was of utmost importance in the context of the upcoming battle (within the DPP as well as at the national level) for the top position in Taiwan.
If Tsai Ing-wen is re-elected as the President of Taiwan, it will mean that the period of serious trials and tribulations for the region and for the relations between the island and key countries will continue well past 2020, for at least 4 more years.

"Taiwan, The BRI, & The Geopolitical Chessboard",www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/taiwan-the-bri-the-geopolitical-chessboard.html/,"Authored by Pepe Escobar via The Asia Times,
What remains of Western unity does not represent a vision of the future any more…
It’s all about the cross-strait median. No, that’s not a drink in a Hong Kong bar. It’s the de facto maritime border between continental China and Taiwan.
Last Sunday morning, two Chinese J-11 fighters crossed the median and stayed on Taiwanese air space for about 10 minutes – even after Taiwanese interceptors were dispatched. Tsai Ing-wen, the President of Taiwan, defined the incursion by the PLA Air Force as “reckless and provocative.”
And, ominously, demanded the “forceful expulsion” of Chinese fighter jets if it ever happened again. Well, that used to happen, quite frequently, but only up to 1999, when Beijing and Taipei clinched a deal to make them stop.
US mainstream media predictably spun this latest incursion as yet another Chinese provocation, omitting the essential background to what is only one more move in an extremely complex – and dangerous – geopolitical chessboard.
Taiwan has made an official request to buy more than 60 F-16 fighter jets from the US. And the Trump administration tacitly approved it. It works like this. Trump’s advisers “encouraged” Taipei to make a formal request. They acted in tandem with Lockheed Martin, which builds the F-16s.
The request then became an actual proposal by the Pentagon and State Department. Finally, Congress has 30 days to consider whether the sale may go ahead. Considering this particular case suits not only the industrial-military complex, but also the overall US government agenda of containment of China, it might as well be considered a done deal. Call in your CHIPS
Without this crucial context, it’s impossible to understand the logic behind the Chinese “provocation.” And that is also directly linked to John Bolton torpedoing negotiations with North Korea (the DPRK) and the non-stop demonization of both Russia and Iran.
China, Russia and Iran are the essential nodes in the laborious, ongoing, long-term Eurasia integration process. Russia and China were also essential advisers to the DPRK in its nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.
The demonization of Russia and Iran proceeds in parallel with what is in effect a Washington-orchestrated SWIFT-CHIPS war.
CHIPS is the US dollar clearing system used by 88% of the transactions in global trade. This means that the US dollar is on one side of every international transaction 88% of the time.
If you are cut out of this system, it’s extremely difficult to conduct world trade – you need barter, trading in local currencies or an untested system like INSTEX , set up by the EU for non-dollar transactions with Iran after the Trump administration crashed out of the JCPOA, or Iran nuclear deal.
China is way more dependent on world trade than Russia as it needs to import massive amounts of natural resources that must be paid for by exports.
Russia, for its part, could very easily become self-sufficient, as it holds about 96% of the natural resources it needs. The US, by comparison, needs to import many vital natural resources for its advanced industries.
Recent history is filled with examples – for instance, Japan and South Korea – showing that national self-sufficiency works. China is fine-tuning the model as applied to the Made in China 2025 strategy.
The problem with Russia is that the Central Bank under Elvira Nabiullina arguably does not operate in the Russian national interest.
As I have extensively discussed with Russian analysts, a solution would be for the Russian Central Bank to create currency controls to prevent oligarchs from siphoning their wealth overseas, a move that only serves to further collapse the ruble. And also create credit to build the industries that would replace imports – a de facto massive import substitution. No credit should be issued for any other purpose.
Entering the next decade, what would constitute a sort of nuclear option would be for Russia to divert to China most of the natural resources sold to the West, whose retribution is packages of sanctions, while importing from China the advanced technologies required for Russia.
China is de facto an equal or even ahead of the US in plenty of technology areas – as documented, for instance, by Kai-Fu Lee on AI Super-Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order . Much is not visible yet because advances have not been commercialized.
All of the above is being debated in Moscow, in detail, on myriad levels. It’s not by accident that Russia is fully on board the New Silk Roads, or Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in connection with the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU).
The latest graphic example of the Russia-China economic partnership is the railroad bridge across the Amur river linking the Russian Far East with China’s Heilongjiang province. The future rises in the East
Throughout the next decade it will be clear how the entire Eurasian land mass is linked with, or by, the BRI. In comparison, Chas Freeman, a former US ambassador to China, is one of the few informed observers who have sounded the alarm ; Washington treats the BRI as a military strategic challenge.
Alastair Crooke has shown how a mini-BRI is already shaping up, linking Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. In fact, this is the emerging Southwest Asia BRI node.
At the same time, Beijing had made it very clear that – harsh methods included – Xinjiang, the key BRI hub in Western China, would not be allowed to become another Syria, Libya or Iraq. Xinjiang directly links with the essential BRI connectivity corridors to the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
The West, or what remains of its unity, does not represent a vision of the future any more. China is striving for the BRI to fulfill this role. That’s something a few extra F-16s patrolling the cross-strait median won’t be able to change.

Textron Delivers Next Generation Squad Weapon To Army,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/textron-delivers-next-generation-squad-weapon-to-army.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Textron Systems’ AAI Corporation, an aerospace and defense development and manufacturing firm, located in Hunt Valley, Maryland, announced last week the delivery of its initial Next Generation Squad Weapon-Technology (NGSW-T) prototype demonstrator to the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Armaments Center and Joint Services Small Arms Program (JSSAP), the company said in a statement .
“Moving from contract award to delivery of a revolutionary, next-generation weapon in just 15 months not only demonstrates the maturity of our Cased-Telescoped technology, but also the project execution excellence our team possesses to rapidly fill critical warfighter needs on schedule, ” said Textron Systems Senior Vice President of Applied Technologies & Advanced Programs Wayne Prender.
“Our Cased-Telescoped weapons and ammunition offer the growth path to a true next-generation small arms weapon for U.S. warfighters, including increased lethality at longer ranges, while also delivering significant weight reductions to the warfighter.”
In development since 2004, AAI’s NGSW-T offers increased lethality and weighs 40% less than current standard issue light machine guns. The weapon chambers a telescoped round between 6.5mm and 6.8mm and is expected to be the future replacement for the M16 rifle, M4 carbine, and M249 light machine gun.
In October, the Army selected the 6.8mm, next-generation round as the official requirements for the NGSW-T. The new bullet is designed to penetrate the world’s most advanced body armor at a range of up to 600 meters.
The Pentagon’s current shift from urban warfare in Iraq and Syria to the mountains and open terrain of Afghanistan have been the driving force behind modernizing standard issue weapons for infantry units. While standard rifles are well-suited for close combat in cities like Mosul and Raqqa, it lacks the range to kill adversaries in open stretches.
The Army is expected to test AAI’s NGSW-T weapon at firing ranges this summer. If the weapon meet’s the Army’s requirements for NGSW-T, then AAI could get a large contract to send the gun into series production to produce more than 250,000 units and 150 million rounds. The expected field date could be as early as 2020.

"Operation Gladio: The Unholy Alliance Between The Vatican, The CIA, & The Mafia",www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/operation-gladio-the-unholy-alliance-between-the-vatican-the-cia-the-mafia.html/,"Authored by via Off-Guardian.org,
On the hot summer morning of Aug. 2, 1980 a massive explosion ripped apart the main waiting room of the Bologna railway station. Eighty-five people were killed and hundreds more injured. Though at first blamed on Italy’s legendary urban guerrillas, The Red Brigades, it soon emerged that the attack had, in fact, originated from within the ‘deep state’ of the Italian government itself.
The full nature of this secret parallel state would only come to light a decade later when the Italian premier, Giulio Andreotti, under questioning from a special commission of inquiry, revealed the existence of arms caches stashed all around the country and which were at the disposal of an organization which later came to be identified as ‘Gladio’.
The members of this group turned out to include not only hundreds of far-right figures in the intelligence, military, government, media, Church and corporate sectors, but a motley assortment of unreconstructed WW2 fascists, psychopaths and criminal underworld types to boot. And despite Andreotti’s attempts to airbrush the group as ‘patriots’ it appeared evident to much of the rest of the Italian polity that these seemed rather more like pretty bad folk indeed. Little did they know. Follow-up research by the likes of Daniele Ganser, Claudio Celani, Jurgen Roth and Henrik Kruger traced connections to similar groups spread throughout Europe of which all were found to be deep state terrorist organizations, and all of which were found, ultimately, to be subservient unto the highest levels of the CIA and NATO command structures.
The moniker ‘Gladio’ (after the two-edged sword used in classical Rome) was eventually broadened to include a bewildering host of related deep state terrorist structures including : ‘P2’ In Italy, ‘P26’ in Switzerland, ‘Sveaborg’ in Sweden, ‘Counter-Guerrilla’ in Turkey and ‘Sheepskin’ in Greece. This (hardly definitive) European list was then found to have connections not only to virtually every US sponsored secret state terrorist organization the world over (including the likes of Operation Condor in Latin America), but also to many of the global drug cartels that provided the secretive wealth needed to fund and otherwise lubricate the whole rotting, corrupt shebang.
If all this sounds sinister enough, it pales in light of the detailed structure of the dazzlingly diabolical Gladio edifice. And it is to those details we now repair vis a vis an overview of the remarkable, if otherwise unheralded, 2015 work by journalist Paul L. Williams entitled, ‘Operation Gladio: The Unholy Alliance Between the Vatican, the CIA and the Mafia’. Though there are other books on the subject worthy of honourable mention (including Daniele Ganser’s seminal tome, ‘NATO’s Secret Armies’, and Richard Cottrell’s recent and stylishly written, ‘Gladio: NATO’s Dagger at the Heart of Europe’), it is to Williams that I believe we owe a particular debt of gratitude in having provided a more or less fully integrated portrait of the global machinations of Operation Gladio.
Before embarking on our grim, if yet fascinating, journey it is worth first noting that whilst ‘Gladio’ was officially acknowledged and condemned by the European Parliament (in Nov., 1990; Washington and NATO having ever after refused ‘comment’ on the matter), and its multifarious organs and factions ordered dismantled, it is hardly likely that the latter was ever fully enacted. The historical context of ‘Gladio’, then, is really the quintessential backdrop to understanding the trademark false flag events of the modern era. OF SPOOKS AND MADE MEN
The general origins of this labyrinthine network of deep state actors lay in the so-called ‘stay-behind-armies’ set up at the end of WW2 by the Allied powers (principally the US) ostensibly to act as resistance forces should the Soviets ever decide to invade Europe. Quickly, however, the raison d’etre of the ‘armies’ transmogrified into a mission to counteract, not external invasion, but ‘internal subversion’. Such would eventually result in the undermining not just of post-war European socialism, but of Italian, Greek – and later global – democracy itself.
But we get ahead of ourselves.
The primal author of the ‘stay-behind-armies’, Williams informs us, was General Reinhard Gehlen, the head of German military intelligence during the Second World War. Having foreseen early on that the Reich was doomed to defeat, Gehlen had “concocted the idea of forming clandestine guerilla squads composed of Hitler youth and die-hard fascist fanatics” ostensibly to fend off the inevitable Soviet invasion. These guerilla units he referred to as ‘werewolves’.
Not ones to miss a fascist opportunity when they saw it, the US Office of Strategic Services (the OSS, and the forerunner of the CIA), under the leadership of William ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan, quickly enlisted both Gehlen and SS General Karl Wolff (in 1945) in forming the Gehlen Organization (later to transform into the present-day German BND) and which received its initial funding from US Army G-2 intelligence resources.
The American point-man on this was Allen Dulles, the first president (in 1927) of the Council on Foreign Relations, and later the first head of the CIA. Duly incorporated into the American fold, the ‘werewolves’ were, given that their initial meddling took place in Italy, rebranded as ‘gladiators’. Operation Gladio was born.
In 1947 the CIA (having, that year, superseded the OSS) was faced with its first daunting task, i.e. how to prevent the Italian Communist Party (PCI) from forming the next government. Elections were scheduled for 1948 and the PCI was a virtual shoe-in not just in Italy proper, but in Sicily as well. Fortunately, ‘Gladio’ was ready and waiting. The gladiators had been training in a special camp set up in Sardinia under the local command of the former WW2 Italian fascist leader, Prince Junio Valerio Borghese.
In addition, hundreds of American mafioso began to arrive on the shores of Italy to lend a hand with the communist ‘problem’. The arrival of the ‘made men’ was the result of Donovan’s efforts from 1943 onward in working with American mobsters Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano and Vito Genovese to conger new (drug) funding for the OSS’s off-books’ operations, and to reinstall the Sicilian mafia on the island in the leadup to Operation Husky (the Allied invasion of Sicily). These forces were now unleashed on the Italian electorate, and through 1948 an average of five people a week were murdered by the CIA-backed terrorist units. The results were grimly predictable. Hallelujah, the PCI were defeated and the Christian Democrats returned to power.
Still, the threat remained. Fully half the Italian electorate were communist sympathizers and, moreover, leftist politics pervaded much of the rest of the diseased European body. More would have to be done. The problem, however, was money. There simply wasn’t enough of it. Thus, the initial $200 million in funding for Gladio (which had come from the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations) was quickly exhausted. And though the National Security Act of 1947 had provided the loophole that allowed for the CIA’s covert operations, it had not allowed for their overt Congressional funding. There lay the rub. Thankfully, Paul Helliwell knew how to salve the itch.
Paul Helliwell was an inner member of the original OSS (along with key scions of the Morgan, Mellon, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, DuPont and Ryan families) and, according to Williams, likely the greatest unsung hero of the nicknamed ‘Oh-So-Social’ club. It was he, who having cut his teeth in the drugs-for-arms trade by shepherding opium deals with the Kuomintang (KMT, the Chinese National Army fighting against Mao Zedung), conjured the brilliant inspiration to do the very same thing – in the United States itself.
Thus, it was at his suggestion that Donovan elected to forge the deep bond (and that exists to this day) between the nation’s intelligence services and organized crime. Enter stage left such notables as ‘Lucky’ Luciano, Vito Genovese, Meyer Lansky and the Trafficante and Gambino crime clans. Quickly the streets of, first, New York, and later many an American metropolis, were flooded with heroin. These early, halcyon days would soon lead to the infamous ‘French Connection’, thence to the ‘Golden Triangle’ (where the CIA’s very own ‘Air America’ transported drugs out of South East Asia during the Vietnam War) and, later, to the Balkan, Mexican, and Colombian drug cartels.
All very well and good. But, to begin with, there was yet a fly in the whole drugs-for-arms-for-terror ointment. To wit: how to pay off the mafioso without anyone noticing; indeed, how to stash, launder and hide all of this financial derring-do from the prying eyes of the authorities; you know, the real-enough authorities, the Treasury cops and so forth. How do you do that? THE VATICAN CONNECTION
Article 2 of the Lateran Treaty of 1929 was clear and unequivocal. The Article, which served to regulate matters between the Holy See and the Italian state, expressly forbade any interference of the latter in the affairs of the former. It is hardly conceivable, of course, that the framers of the Treaty ever foresaw what such immunity could actually mean in practice. But then they probably hadn’t reckoned on the fiendish formation of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), or more colloquially, the Vatican Bank.
Established by Pope Pius XII and Bernardino Nogara in 1942, the Bank would quickly come to serve as the principal repository post-war both for the Sicilian Mafia and for the OSS/CIA wherein all of the monies and documents relating to drug trafficking and to Gladio would be stored and laundered. Already in 1945 the pope had held private audiences with Donovan to discuss the implementation of Gladio and where, as Williams reports, Donovan was knighted as an anti-Communist crusader with the Grand Cross of the Order of Sylvester. Prior to this time Pius XII had proven himself a loyal ally in working with Dulles and the OSS to establish the ratlines used to help prominent Nazis escape Europe. Now, new horizons beckoned. The first duty at hand, of course, was to destroy the communist menace in respect of the 1948 elections. To this end the pope authorized his own terror squads (under Monsignor Bicchierai) to assist the gladiators and the ‘made men’ in intimidating the Italian electorate. Task accomplished.
The second duty at hand, however, was longer term. Communism, socialism and, indeed, any Godless form of progressive government, anywhere, had to be stamped out at source. For this money would be needed. Lots of money. Untraceable money. Drug money. Now in the months before the 1948 election the CIA deposited some $65 million into the Vatican Bank. The source of these monies came from heroin produced by the Italian pharmaceutical giant, Schiaparelli, and which was then transported by the Sicilian mob into Cuba where it was cut and then distributed to New Orleans, Miami and New York by the Santo Trafficante family. Lucrative though this trade was, it was not nearly enough to suit the needs of the CIA and ‘Gladio’. More would be required. More drug networks and more banks. Gladio was about to global.
To start with a new alliance was forged with the Corsican mafia. Unlike the Sicilian mob, the Corsicans had extensive experience in processing heroin, a skill they had picked up through years of working with Laotian, Cambodian and Vietnamese technicians in French Indochina. A supply route then emerged running from Burma through Turkey to Beirut and thence to Marseille. Alas, there was a slight hitch when the leftist dockworkers in Marseille, being sympathetic to the rebel army under Ho Chi Minh, refused to load and unload the boats from Indochina. No worries. A deft bit of terror administered by the Corsican boys (and funded by the CIA), and problem solved. By 1951, then, Marseille had become the center of the Western heroin industry. Voila, the ‘French Connection’.
Meanwhile, Wild Bill Donovan had ‘resigned’ from the CIA to form the World Commerce Corporation (WCC) whose primary function was to facilitate the arms-for-drugs deals with the KMT. Paul Helliwell lent a needed hand at the helm by heading up Sea Supply, Inc., a CIA front company gainfully employed in shipping heroin from Bangkok. By 1958 the whole operation was so successful that a second supply route was established running through Saigon. Here, the help of Ngo Dinh Diem, the US installed despot of South Vietnam, proved invaluable.
Still, there was a potential cloud on the horizon, i.e. word of all these shenanigans was bound to leak out. What to do? The first reflex, naturally, was to pin the blame for the West’s growing heroin problem on the Communist Chinese under Mao Zedung. Check. The second, more considered response, was to organize an ongoing campaign to deflect attention away from, and burnish the image of, the CIA. And to this end, in 1953, did the CIA establish ‘Operation Mockingbird’. Under ‘Mockingbird’ the Agency recruited hundreds of American journalists to spread false stories and propaganda about the Company’s ‘benign’ activities. Eventually, this depraved fabric of anti-journalism enlisted entire news networks including ABC, NBC, Newsweek, Associated Press, and The Saturday Evening Post. Now the guys and gals at Langley could relax. Henceforth, American (and global) eyes were dutifully prismed through the rose-coloured lens of ‘Mockingbird’.
But back to the Vatican. The IOR, solid banking pillar of the Gladio community that it was, could hardly be expected to do all the heavy lifting itself. After all, the global heroin industry would, by 1980, be pulling in a cool $400 billion annually. En route an extensive and orchestrated financial network would be required to supplement God’s Bank. As with any fine orchestra it helps to have a maestro of exquisite genius to run the show. A nice round of applause, then, for one Michele Sindona. The biography of Sindona begins, humbly enough, with his degree in tax law from the University of Messina in 1942 after which, in quick succession, he rockets to stardom as a leading financial adviser to the Sicilian mafia, an agent for the CIA, and, thereafter, a financial intimate of the Holy See. By the late 1950s Sindona had become the lynchpin in a nexus between the mob, the CIA and the Vatican that would eventually, as Williams chillingly puts it, “result in the toppling of governments, wholesale slaughter and financial devastation.”
Though a full elaboration of this bewilderingly complex financial system is best left to the author, it is worth briefly savouring a few highlights. To begin with Sindona purchased Fasco AG, a Liechtenstein holding company and through which he purchased his first bank – the Banca Privata Finanziaria (BPF). The BPF then became, by way of a Chicago-based intermediary bank, Continental Illinois, a principal conduit for transferring drug money from the IOR for the purposes of Gladio. In fact, it was this banking pipeline in particular which provided the filthy lucre that fueled the 1967 coup d’etat in Greece. But more on this heady stuff in a bit.
It was through his Chicago contacts that Sindona first met Monsignor Paul Marcinkus, popularly known as ‘the Gorilla’. The Gorilla was six foot four, “a gifted street fighter…and a lover of bourbon, fine cigars and young women”. Under Sindona’s patronage Marcinkus would soon rise to become both Pope Paul VI’s personal body guard and the head of the IOR. A third musketeer in the person of Roberto Calvi (the assistant – and later full – director of the famous, Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano) came to complete the three Vatican amigos. Together they would cut a dramatic, collective figure in the global banking underworld all through the ‘anni di Piombo’ (the Gladio ‘years of lead’ in Italy from 1969 to 1987). Exactly how dramatic is illustrated, par excellence, by Calvi’s eventual dark demise. Who among us, old enough to remember, can forget the macabre spectacle (June, 1982) of Calvi’s body hanging from Blackfriars Bridge, his feet dangling in the Thames and pockets stuffed with five masonry bricks. Sindona would also later be murdered (1986) by means of a cyanide-laced cup of coffee whilst in jail and under ‘maximum protective custody’.
Calvi was a key figure in establishing a series of eight shell companies (six in Panama, two in Europe) through which drug lords like Pablo Escobar in South America were encouraged to deposit their ill-gotten loot. (The CIA put shoulder to wheel by helping ferry the Escobar cocaine in a fleet of planes operating out of Scranton airport in Pennsylvania). The monies were then transferred via Banco Ambrosiano to the IOR which took a 15 to 20 percent processing fee. From there funds were distributed to a host of European banks set up by Sindona for use by Gladio units spread throughout the continent. In addition to the flow of cash from the cartels, funds were bled from Banco Ambrosiano into the eight shell companies – again for use by the CIA in funding its covert operations.
This points up a general operating procedure of the entire Gladio ‘banking’ system, i.e. the system, far from being designed to turn a profit, was expressly designed to ‘lose’ money; that is, to have it siphoned off into covert ops. Such explains the regular and spectacular failure of a host of CIA-related banks including: Franklin National Bank (purchased by Sindona), Castle Bank & Trust, Mercantile Bank & Trust (both set up by the ubiquitous Paul Helliwell), Nugan Hand Bank (in Australia, and from which funds were diverted to undermine Prime Minister Gough Whitlam during the Vietnam War), and the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (based in Karachi in aid, primarily, of the Southeast Asian heroin trade). Indeed, it was precisely the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano itself that brought both Calvi and Sindona to their untimely ends.
Finally, it is worth noting here that these august institutions were linked in a tight criminal embrace with many of the most prestigious financial firms in America including Citibank, the Bank of New York, and the Bank of Boston. The base of the iceberg, in short, extended far and wide. But then, what was all this money really doing? THE TERROR
Following the thwarting of Italian democracy in 1948 the Gladio ‘secret armies’ entered into a period of what one might characterize as pregnant incubation. Thus, it was during the 1950s that the various drug supply routes and financial networks were being created, as were some of the principal political organizations. Probably the most important of the latter was ‘Propaganda Due’ otherwise known as ‘P2’.
Created in 1877 as a Freemasonry lodge for the Piedmont nobility, it was banned by Mussolini in 1924 only to be resurrected post-war with the approval of Allen Dulles, himself a thirty-third degree Mason. The lodge, though at first dominated mainly by spooks, spies, military and mafia figures, would soon encompass a who’s who of Italian political, corporate, banking and media supremos to boot. Indeed, the organization would eventually spread shoots throughout Europe as well as North and South America, and its members would come to include such luminaries as Henry Kissinger and General Alexander Haig.
A ‘P2’ denizen of especial significance was Licio Gelli. The latter’s pedigree was impressive: a former volunteer in the 735th Black Shirts Battalion, a former member of the elite SS Division under Field Marshall Goering and, thereafter, a chummy employee of the US Counter Intelligence Corps of the Fifth Army. Working with William Colby, the OSS agent in France, and Allen Dulles, the OSS director, Gelli soon gained entry to the Vatican where he helped set up the Nazi escape routes to Argentina. His ties with Argentina would later prove critical in facilitating Operation Condor (the US-backed mass assassination program in 1970s and ‘80s South America). Moreover, in 1972, Gelli would emerge as P2’s supreme ‘Worshipful Master’ under whose leadership the lodge would reach its full, horrific flowering. Finally, it is worth mentioning at this juncture that it was as a result of a police raid on Gelli’s villa in 1981 that the full, tentacled structure of Gladio would come to light. But we digress.
One of the first substantive actions of Gladio was the Turkish coup of 1960. Here the incumbent Prime Minister, Adnan Menderes, made the fatal mistake of believing he was really in charge and thereafter initiating a visit to Moscow to secure economic aid. The ‘stay-behind-army’ in Turkey known as Counter-Guerilla, in alliance with the Turkish military, quickly disabused him of any such delusions by arresting and executing him. Throughout the 1970s both Counter-Guerilla and its youth wing, the Grey Wolves, would stage “ongoing terror attacks…that resulted in the deaths of over five thousand students, teachers, trade union leaders, booksellers and politicians”.
Counter-Guerilla would also figure in the Turkish coup of 1980 when its commander, General Kenan Evren, toppled the moderate government of Bulent Ecevit . According to Williams, US President Jimmy Carter phoned in his approval to the CIA station-chief in Ankara, Paul Henze, with a jubilant, ‘Your boys have done it!’ What they had done, of course, was set up a tyranny in which thousands more would be tortured while incarcerated. The Turkish Gladio boys would also be unleashed in the 1980s upon the PKK – the Kurdistan Workers Party. All of this was in keeping with Zbigniew Brzezinski’s (Carter’s national security advisor) core vision of the importance of controlling Central Asia to which Turkey was both a vital portal and, thus, a key NATO ally.
Alas, Gladio would prove something of a disappointment in France, where, after having backed a series of assassination attempts against the regrettably too independent President Charles de Gaulle, it found itself on the receiving end of de Gaulle’s boot. Actually, it was NATO itself – at the time, headquartered in Paris – that was unceremoniously kicked out of France (in 1966, whence it took up its present cozy and famously corrupt abode in Brussels). But, of course, de Gaulle was ahead of the curve and understood all too well who was really behind the mayhem and murder.
Greece, unfortunately, did not fare as well. In 1967 the ‘Hellenic Raiding Force’, a franchise of Gladio and playing to a NATO authored script entitled Operation Prometheus, overthrew the left-leaning government of George Papandreou. The ensuing military dictatorship would last until 1974 though this would hardly signal the end of Greece’s tribulations. From 1980 until near the turn of the millennium, the nation would suffer under a reign of terror and political assassinations nominally attributed to ‘November 17’, an alleged Marxist revolutionary group, but which in fact (and here I briefly tag-team with authors Cottrell and Ganser) was yet another faction of Greek-Gladio known as ‘Sheepskin’.
This illustrates a point originally brought home by Ganser’s research to the effect that virtually every alleged ‘leftist revolutionary’ group said to have been operating in Europe throughout the post-war years was, in truth, either a Gladio ‘secret army’ unit or else had been completely infiltrated by state intelligence services, and was subsequently being steered by them for Gladio-style state-terrorist ends.
Such is well documented for the ‘Red Brigades’ in Italy and the ‘Baader-Meinhof Gang’ in Germany (the ‘gang’ being conveniently and cold-bloodedly exterminated on the ‘night of the long knives’, Oct.18, 1977, whilst under custody in Stammheim prison). It also, just by the by, speaks to the universally attested prior association of many a modern-day ‘terrorist’ and their police and intelligence handlers.
In Spain, during the early ‘70s, Stefano delle Chiaie and fellow Gladio agents from Italy provided their consulting expertise to General Francisco Franco’s secret police who conducted over a thousand violent acts and some fifty murders. Following Franco’s death in 1975, delle Chiaie moved to Chile to lend a fatherly hand in helping the CIA-backed Augusto Pinochet set up his death squads. In later years the Spanish Gladio unit would find gainful employment hunting down and assassinating the leaders of the Basque separatist movement.
Of Italy we have already mentioned the ‘years of lead’, but just to capture a few highlights. The ‘strategy of tension’ unleashed in 1969 in Italy – the same year ‘Condor’ was unleashed in Latin America – was in response to the renewed popularity of Communism throughout the country and which, itself, was partly in response to the uptick in revolutionary sentiment globally as a result of antipathy towards the US war on Vietnam. The antidote, naturally, to this woeful state of progressive affairs was a healthy dose of terror. According to Williams, “Henry Kissinger, Nixon’s National Security Advisor, issued orders to Licio Gelli through his deputy, General Alexander Haig, for the implementation of terror attacks and coup attempts.” The terror attacks began on December 12, 1969 when a bomb exploded in the crowded lobby of a bank in Milan’s Piazza Fontana in which seventeen people were killed and eighty-eight injured. Over the ensuing years (from 1969 to 1987) there followed more than ‘14,000 acts of violence with a political motivation’. The most infamous of these was, of course, the Bologna bombing in August of 1980 and which led to the initial exposure of Gladio in Italy.
Of the many attempted coups and related high-level political machinations engineered by Gladio forces in Italy (1963, 1970, 1976) and Sicily (more or less continually on tap throughout the decade), the kidnapping on March 16, 1978 – and murder a month or so later – of Prime Minister Aldo Moro was likely the most sensational. Moro had dared to include communists in his new coalition government. At first blamed on the usual suspects, i.e. the Red Brigades, further investigation (to begin with by journalist Carmine ‘Mino’ Pecorelli who paid with his life) led to the real usual suspects including CIA operative Mario Moretti (eventually convicted of the killing) and thence up the line to Gelli, then to Italy’s interior minister Francesco Cossiga and onwards to Zbigniew Brzezinski.
The high-level intrigue did not stop at the murder of a prime minister however. At least two Popes felt the sharp end of the Gladio sword as well. In August of 1978, Pope Paul VI died. His successor, the preternaturally timid John Paul I, soon gave his handlers a very real shock when, after looking at the IOR accounts, he issued a ‘call for reform’. The very next day the otherwise fastidiously health-conscious pontiff – in office barely a month – was dead. Not just dead but expired with the telltale bulging eyes and horrific grimace of acute poisoning. His autopsy was definitively thwarted by an illegal and hastily contrived embalming, and his personal papers disappeared without a trace. Archbishop Marcinkus, having been temporarily removed prior, was returned to office whilst Calvi and Sindona, also under scrutiny at the time, breathed a (temporary) sigh of relief.
Having been (almost) burned once the overseers of Gladio made sure to engineer the follow-up Papal succession. Thus did Cardinal Karol Wojtyla shuffle onto the historical proscenium as Pope John Paul II. Now, at first, John Paul worked seamlessly with the CIA and Gladio. Together they oversaw the destruction of Liberation Theology in Latin America, the continued undermining of Italian democracy, and the dispensing of black funds for Solidarity in Poland. Ah, but how the best laid plans do oft go astray. By the spring of 1981 not only were events spinning out of control for Gladio itself, but so too were they for Banco Ambrosiano, and by extension, the IOR. The Pope, inexplicably, refused to act. Compounding this lapse was an unaccountable trifecta of moral turpitude that witnessed the Holy Father suddenly breaking into treasonous song singing the benefits of rapprochement with the Soviets; recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization; and, egads, nuclear disarmament. The order from on high was given: ‘Kill the Pope’.
But best blame it on the Soviets. So issued the ‘Bulgarian Thesis’ wherein a lowly Bulgarian airline employee (Sergei Antonov) was set up as the patsy. In truth, the key actors in the Papal plot came straight from Gladio central casting. The starring role in the drama fell to General Giuseppe Santovito, the head of Italy’s military intelligence (SISMI) and the commander of the Italian Gladio units. His co-star, Theodore Shackley, was the infamous CIA mastermind who had already served as executive producer on such epics as Operation Phoenix (involving the murder of some 40,000 non-combatants in Vietnam), Operation Condor, the setting up of Nugan Hand Bank, and, along with delle Chiaie, the murder of Salvador Allende. West Germany’s BND (the national security services) garnered a significant credit by harbouring and financing the two actual assassins, Mehmet Agca and Abdullah Cath (both from Turkish Gladio). And, of course, the Mighty Wurlitzer, i.e. Operation Mockingbird, figured prominently in the aftermath grinding out endless tunes on the ‘Bulgarian Thesis’– despite the fact of Agca’s eventual (lone) conviction in the shooting.
The production ended all somewhat anticlimactically when the Pope (on May 13, 1981) was only seriously wounded. In a fascinating denouement, however, on Christmas Day 1983, the Pope opted to publicly forgive Agca. Italian state television was allowed to record the moment when John Paul asked his assassin from whom he had received his orders. Leaning forward to hear Agca’s response the Pope appeared momentarily frozen, then clasped his hands to his face. Though the Pontiff kept it secret, there was little need to guess at the answer.
The adventures of both Agca and Cath are the stuff of legend. Indeed, Cath figures in events well beyond the time line of Gladio proper, enough to suggest that Gladio never really shut down at all. But that, as they say, is a whole other story – and one I leave to the author to take up.

Paul Williams has made a fine contribution here. Certainly, if the day ever comes when, seated across from some smug establishment interlocutor, you are taken to task for being a ‘conspiracy monger’– well, you need only lean back, smile gently, and utter but two words….’Operation Gladio’.

ISTANBUL, April 7. /TASS/. Akkuyu Nuclear, the company implementing the project on construction of the first nuclear power plant in Turkey, filed documents to the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK) for a license to build the third unit of NPP.
“The application has already been filed. Akkuyu Nuclear prepared and submitted the package of documents for the license to build the Unit 3 of the Akkuyu NPP,” the company’s press service responded to the question from TASS.
“The task for this year is also to complete the site relief forming,” the company said. “About 70% of the territory have been prepared to date. The remaining 30% will be formed by the year-end,” Akkuyu Nuclear added.
The company “plans to receive the basic license for the second unit construction and start concreting its foundation slab in,” the press service said. “Activities will be performed with consideration of experience obtained during the similar stage for the first unit,” it added.
Rosatom said in December 2018 that the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK) has provided Akkuyu NPP, which implements the first nuclear power plant project in Turkey, with a limited permit for construction of Unit 2 of Akkuyu NPP.
The permit allowed proceeding with the construction and installation works at facilities of the Unit except for that, which are important for nuclear island safety, Rosatom said, adding that excavation of the foundation pit, engineering surveys and other activities will commence under it.
The Akkuyu NPP is the project for construction of the first NPP in Turkey, which is implemented on the basis of the intergovernmental agreement signed between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Turkey in May 2010. VVER-1200 power units of Akkuyu NPP are based on Generation 3+ technologies that are the most modern technologies with enhanced safety systems meeting all existing requirements. When the construction of the Akkuyu NPP with an installed capacity of 4,800 MW is completed, it will generate about 35 bln kWh electricity per year.

LUGANSK, April 7. /TASS/. Ukraine’s forces opened fire against militia positions in the proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic ten times over the past 24 hours, the republican defense ministry reports on Sunday.
“Areas of Frunze, Donetsky and Kalinovo townships, Prishib, Nizhnee Lozovoe and Khoroshee villages were attacked by fire,” the LuganskInformCenter news agency says, citing a militia spokesperson. According to militia’s data, the fire was opened using mortars, MICV armament, grenade launchers and large caliber small arms.
Members of the security sub-group negotiated a new spring ceasefire during the video conference in the course of negotiations in Minsk. It entered force on March 8 but Ukrainian forces opened fire again in five minutes after it comes into force, thereby breaking the ceasefire agreement.

An extraordinary lost chapter in the history of World War I: the story of America’s year-long invasion of Russia, in which a contingency of brave soldiers fought the Red Army and brutal conditions during the fall and winter of 1918-1919.
In August 1918, the 339th regiment of the US Army – roughly 5,000 soldiers, most hailing from Michigan – sailed for Europe to fight in World War I. But instead of the Western Front, these troops were headed to Archangel, Russia, a vital port city 1,000 miles northeast of Moscow. There, in the frozen subarctic, amid the chaos of the Russian Civil War, one of the most extraordinary episodes of American history unfolded.
The American North Russia Expeditionary Force – self-dubbed “The Polar Bear Expedition”– was sent to fight the Red Army and aid anti-Bolshevik forces in hopes of reopening the Eastern Front against Germany. On the 100th anniversary of the campaign, award-winning historian James Carl Nelson recreates this harrowing, dramatic military operation in which Americans and Bolsheviks fought a series of pitched battles throughout a punishing fall and winter.
As the Great War officially ended in November 1918, American troops continued to battle the Red Army and an equally formidable enemy, “General Winter”. Subzero temperatures made machine guns and light artillery inoperable. In the blinding ice and snow, sentries suffered from frostbite while guarding against nearly invisible Bolos camouflaged by their white uniforms. Before the Polar Bears’ withdrawal in July 1919, more than 200 perished from battle, accidents, and the Spanish flu.
But the Polar Bears’ story does not end there. Ten years later, a contingent of veterans returned to Russia to recover the remains of more than 100 of their fallen comrades and lay them to rest in Michigan, where a monument honoring their service still stands: a massive marble polar bear guarding a cross that marks the grave of a fallen soldier."

In another video from my favorite new YouTube Channel, Fight Globalism, Lee Stranahan gives a definitive and “dangerous” lecture on the so-called ‘Deep State’, which he describes as “Not a conspiracy theory but an actual conspiracy…a conspiracy among secret societies .”
These secret and open societies and think tanks include, among others Yale University ’s Skull & Bones, Oxford University ’s Rhodes Scholarship , the Bilderberg meeting, the Atlantic Council and Davos . Behind all of these is a loose association of multi-generational billionaires, trillionaires, oil money and aristocracies. British and US intelligence agencies are connected to and were originally formed by these groups. The ongoing directive of the Deep State is to present the populace with false choices.
Stranahan says, that this podcast is “the one they’re going to Gary Webb me for,” referring to the late journalist, who wrote about CIA drug trafficking and ended up dead in 2004 of an apparent suicide at the age of 47.
This is long but it’s epic and incredibly eye-opening, even if you already know quite a bit about the subject. It’s the equivalent of a university course in parapolitics. So, if you want to know what the Deep State is, once and for all, this is where you can find out, as he traces its history and continually asks the question, “What is the Clintons’ relationship to Russia?”"

by Joel GehrkeWashington Examiner
President Trump plans to intensify economic pressure on Cuba over the communist regime’s support for Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, according to his top national security adviser.
“The Cuban regime has served as a primary accomplice to Maduro’s theft of Venezuela’s wealth & resources, and is complicit in Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis,” John Bolton, the White House national security adviser, tweeted Saturday. “The U.S. is prepared to hold accountable any country or company that facilitates the repression of the Venezuelan people.”
Bolton issued that warning after the Treasury Department blacklisted 34 ships that transport Venezuelan oil to the island. The Cuban regime denounced the tactics as “economic piracy,” but the U.S. officials maintain that they are stopping Maduro from providing payment for the Cuban security officials who are helping him maintain control of Venezuela in the midst of a severe political and economic crisis.
“The Department of the Treasury has sanctioned companies and vessels facilitating illegal oil transfers from the Maduro regime to Cuba,” Bolton also tweeted. “This is only a first step.” The legitimate Venezuelan National Assembly called for international support of its decree. The Department of the Treasury has sanctioned companies and vessels facilitating illegal oil transfers from the Maduro regime to Cuba. This is only a first step. https://t.co/ovylOAPPHs

Cuban diplomats described the sanctions as “Monroeist,” an invocation of the Monroe Doctrine, a U.S. policy of opposing European efforts to colonize Latin America that ultimately came to be reviled in the region as an assertion of Washington’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.
“I denounce the escalation of #US ‘Monroeist’ aggressions against #OurAmerica and the use of scandalous lies against #Cuba,” Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla tweeted Friday evening. “I strongly reject the new economic piracy measures adopted by Washington to damage #Venezuela and steal its resources. They’ll fail.”
U.S. officials and Cuba hawks say that Maduro is plundering Venezuelan government resources to enrich himself and buy international support.
“Cuba’s foreign ministry is raging about US sanctions on the Maduro regime,” Ana Quintana, a regional expert at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, tweeted Saturday . “Why? Because that means less money for the Cuban colonial masters.”

“Freak.”
Anyway, using the Twitters, Ocasio-CowFart basically melted down over the ridicule, using the absurd argument that this is how Alex from The Block does her thang, and if you were from The Block, you’d know that’s how a thang is done, and y’all need to forget Miss Thang grew up in, ahem, Westchester: Folks talking about my voice can step right off. Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech, same.

“Folks talking about my voice can step right off,” she tweeted. “Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech, same. Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what’s up. My Spanish is the same way.”
What a load of crap.
Even though, at the time, I was younger than she is (she’s currently 29 going on 14), I managed to live, work, and go to school in Milwaukee’s inner city for a total of five years. My whole “class enviro” during those years was predominantly black, but the thought of affecting an accent never even crossed my mind — not because I was woke or sensitive, but because I didn’t want to look like an asshole — because this is what Ocasio-Crazy looks like (NSFW):

What’s more, she’s lying…
As Ryan Saavedra at the Daily Wire discovered , her claim that this is not the first time she’s used a “distinct dialect,” that she did the same during her “Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech,” simply isn’t true.
Below is video footage of those two speeches, and all you hear is Jerry the Mouse:

In a second tweet, she lied again.
“As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home,” she tweeted.
Except she’s not from the Bronx. She’s from Westchester.
“It is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time,” she added, as though it wasn’t hurtful for us to have to watch her patronize a mostly black audience as though they were babies who require baby talk.
Man, she’s awful."
"How the PC Movement Is Destroying America, by Justin Spittler and Doug Casey",www.therussophile.org,Robert Gore,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/how-the-pc-movement-is-destroying-america-by-justin-spittler-and-doug-casey.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/805203347f71b4a9606694b65ac317ee?s=96&d=identicon&r=G
Control what people say and you can control what they think. Justin Spittler and Doug Casey at caseyresearch.com:
Justin’s note: As longtime readers know, our founder Doug Casey isn’t just a world-class speculator. He’s a rare, independent thinker and a walking encyclopedia. Best of all, he isn’t afraid to speak his mind… even if that means offending people.
That’s a rare commodity these days.
Today, people would rather be “politically correct”…
And that’s a big mistake.
According to Doug, this “PC” movement is just “one more termite eating away at the foundations of Western civilization itself.”
Read on to see why…
Justin Spittler: Doug, I want to ask you about political correctness. Obviously, PC culture’s nothing new, but it kind of seems like it’s spreading like cancer these days. Terms like “gender inclusivity,”“cultural appropriation,” and “white privilege” are everywhere.
A good example is an announcement by the University of Minnesota in 2017… saying it was dropping the names “king” and “queen” from its Homecoming festivities in favor of “royals.” It did this in the name of “gender inclusivity.”
Is PC culture getting totally out of hand, or am I going crazy?
Doug Casey: Parts of the culture are borderline insane. There’ve been news items regarding this on scores of different colleges and universities across the U.S. What you mentioned at the University of Minnesota was just part of a greater movement. Although I’ve got to say that I find the use of “Royals” objectionable. I dislike the idea of a hereditary aristocracy – kings and queens and royals. They’re basically just successful, silk-clad gangsters. Why the royal family in Britain is looked up to is a mystery to me. They, like all royals in the world, historically are just descendants of successful thugs.
But that’s not the point that the PC people are making. They don’t want to see people identified by their birth sex. They would rather that people “identify” as whatever gender – and I understand there are supposed to be about 40 – you feel you belong to. You can say you are whoever you think you are. And oddly enough, I’m somewhat sympathetic to that. I think you should be able to call yourself what you want, do what you want, say what you want, this is all fine. And let people judge you by how you identify yourself. Say that you’re a hermaphrodite dinosaur who was born on Mars, if you want. I don’t care; it’s your problem. But these PC types want to legislate that people have to treat the psychologically aberrated as if they were normal. They want laws and punishments governing what you can and can’t do and say and even feel. They want to force you to respect, and pay for, the fantasies of a minority. And change – overturn actually – the whole social culture of the country. It’s a very disturbing trend. It’s likely to end in violence.
I believe I first heard the term “political correctness” used on a Saturday Night Live show back in about 1980. And I thought it was just a joke – like most of the things on SNL. But it turned out to be a real thing, and it’s been building momentum, for at least the last two generations. Where is it going to end? I’m not sure, but it’s just one more termite eating away at the foundations of Western civilization itself. People that go along with this stuff aren’t just crazy. They’re actually evil. They’re the same types who rallied around Robespierre during the French Revolution, Lenin during the Russian Revolution, Hitler in ’30s Germany, and Mao in China. It’s a certain personality type.
The fact that the average American still puts up with this kind of nonsense and treats it with respect is a bad sign. PC values are continually inculcated into kids that go off to college – which, incidentally, is another idiotic mistake that most people make for both economic and philosophical reasons. It’s a real cause for pessimism.
Justin: I agree 100%, Doug. But here’s something our average reader might not realize.
The PC “movement” is actually happening across the world.
For example, Cardiff Metropolitan University in the U.K. banned words like “mankind,”“homosexual,”“housewife,”“manmade,” and “sportsmanship” in an effort to “promote fairness and equality through raising awareness about the effects of potentially discriminatory vocabulary.”
Here are some of the university’s approved alternatives…
Instead of “manpower,” students and faculty should say “human resources.”
Instead of “mankind,”“humanity.”
Instead of “sportsmanship,”“fairness.”
Instead of “polio victim,”“polio survivor.”
So here we have another university trying to legislate what people can and cannot say in the name of fairness and equality.
But I really don’t see how this accomplishes anything. Would you agree?
Doug: Completely. The words you use control the way you think. These people don’t have good intentions, they have bad intentions. Destructive intentions. They’re opposed to all the things that, starting with Ancient Greece, made Western civilization unique, and better than any other on Earth. They’re opposed to the concepts of individualism, personal freedom, capitalism, economic liberty, free thought, and the like. And it starts with controlling the words you use. George Orwell pointed that out in 1984 where he created “Newspeak,” which was a new version of the English language that used all kinds of different new words in order to change the way people think. And to make it impossible for them to think clearly, because the words were purposely misdefined, often to the opposite of the meanings that they actually have. So, sure, this is part of the continuing corruption of Western civilization itself.
And you’re right, it’s not just in American universities. It’s in universities everywhere, because the culture of universities everywhere has been controlled by this whole class of progressives, social justice warriors, cultural Marxists, socialists – they go under a number of names. I don’t know what’s going to be done about it, quite frankly, because the average person doesn’t have A) the backbone and B) the philosophical knowledge to counter these people. So there’s great cause for pessimism, watching this happen and accelerate. It’s not slowing down, it’s accelerating everywhere.
For instance, some years ago I sat on the Board of Trustees of two different universities. The other trustees weren’t academics, but normal, successful middle-class people. And they were completely snowed by these crazy trends. They were of good will, but they’d been brainwashed by their own educations, and the culture around them, into thinking that although perhaps the SJWs and such were going “too far,” they didn’t actively oppose them. I’m afraid the intellectual and psychological battle has been lost.
Justin: Exactly, it seems people across the world are waging a war on their own freedom of speech. Meanwhile, you have the government waging a war on people’s privacy…
Facebook and internet service providers are hawking private browsing data, Google is listening in on our conversations, the CIA is hacking people’s smartphones…
As disturbing as this all is, I can’t say I’m surprised. Are you?
Doug: No, I wasn’t at all surprised by it. But people’s reaction to these horrible things is that, “Well, the CIA should be reined in a bit, they should be brought under control.” But this is the wrong reaction. The CIA – along with the NSA, the DEA, and a bunch of others – should be abolished, because the CIA has become an actual Praetorian guard. It’s become a government within a government. They have their own armed forces, they have their own sources of income. You can go rogue within the CIA, and if you’re powerful enough or clever enough you can basically do what you want because you’re an armed government agent that’s a member of a very powerful group.
These people are completely out of control. And they have a powerful propaganda machine that works around the clock to convince ignorant and paranoid Boobus americanus that they’re actually good guys, working for his interests against the rest of the world.
The CIA should be abolished because it’s dysfunctional, but also because it serves no useful purpose. It’s never ever predicted, through its so-called “intelligence gathering,” anything of value – ever. The Korean War, the rise of Castro, the fall of the Shah, the rise of Islam, the fact that the Soviet Union was just an empty shell – you know, they thought the Soviet Union was actually competing with the U.S. from an economic point of view. They’re always absolutely wrong on everything. It defies the odds of pure chance. They’re not just useless, but extremely dangerous. All the coups and revolutions they’ve plotted were disasters.
Can you abolish them? Can you get rid of them at this point? No, they’re far too powerful. And anybody that tries is either going to be killed and/or discredited by their black propaganda. At this point the situation’s completely out of control, and we just have to see where it ends. As an individual American, you should try to insulate yourself from these people. Because they’re not going away; they’re going to become even more powerful.
Justin: How can the average American do that? Should they flee to another country? Delete their Facebook? Is this something people can even escape?
Doug: It’s now a very small world, so it’s very hard to escape. But you just mentioned something to consider. I spend two-thirds of the year in South America, and travel a lot. Believe it or not, I don’t personally have a cell phone, because I don’t like to feel tethered to an electronic device. Societies down here aren’t nearly as electronically oriented as they are in the U.S. Though my internet connection in Cafayate, Argentina is much better than the one I have in Aspen. So, yes, that’s one thing. It’s easier to be out of sight and out of mind of the bad guys if you’re out of the U.S., which is the epicenter of all of this. I think that’s important. And being physically absent and trying to limit your use of electronic devices and be careful when you do use them. That’s about all you can do at this point.
Or you can be a good little lamb, and never think out of the box. To mix metaphors, you can act like an ostrich and stick your head in the sand, believing you have nothing to hide, because you’re one of the herd who never does anything wrong. Too few people have read Harvey Silverglate’s book where he points out how the average American often commits about three felonies a day.
But that book is surely inaccurate. It’s 10 years old. Now it’s probably like five felonies a day.
Justin: Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today, Doug.
Doug: My pleasure, Justin."
"Russiagate Might Be Dead, but Big Tech Censorship Is Here to Stay, by Michael Krieger",www.therussophile.org,Robert Gore,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russiagate-might-be-dead-but-big-tech-censorship-is-here-to-stay-by-michael-krieger.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/805203347f71b4a9606694b65ac317ee?s=96&d=identicon&r=G
The fake news about Russian collusion was that there was Russian collusion with th. In response to a nonexistent threat from Russia, big tech implemented various forms of censorship. Now that the fake news has been exposed for what it is, don’t expect the censorship to be lifted. From Michael Krieger at libertyblitzkrieg.com :
I have certain rules I live by. My first rule: I don’t believe anything the government tells me. Nothing. Zero.
– George Carlin
Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community and they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
– Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in a 2017 interview on MSNBC
As someone whose website was slandered by the earliest manifestations of the hysterical Russiagate mob, I could go on and on now that’s the whole spectacle’s been disproven, but I’m not going to do that. Rather, I want to highlight how despite the whole thing blowing up, we’ll be living with severe direct consequences for years to come.
First, it’s important to point out that none of Russiagate’s most irresponsible grifters will face any serious repercussions for wasting the country’s time, money and energy on a fake story for the past two years. Russiagate was as much a business model as it was a conspiracy theory, and some of it’s most shameless peddlers made out like bandits over the past couple of years."
"How Brzezinski’s Chessboard Degenerated Into Brennan’s Russophobia, by Mike Whitney",www.therussophile.org,Robert Gore,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/how-brzezinskis-chessboard-degenerated-into-brennans-russophobia-by-mike-whitney-2.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/805203347f71b4a9606694b65ac317ee?s=96&d=identicon&r=G
Russiagate was part of an overall strategy cooked up by the Washington establishment to “contain” Russia and China. From Mike Whitney at unz.com : “Russia is an inalienable and organic part of Greater Europe and European civilization. Our citizens think of themselves as European. That’s why Russia proposes moving towards the creation of a common economic space from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, a community referred to by Russian experts as ‘the Union of Europe’ which will strengthen Russia’s potential in its economic pivot toward the ‘New Asia.’” Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, February 2012 The allegations of ‘Russian meddling’ only make sense if they’re put into a broader geopolitical context. Once we realize that Washington is implementing an aggressive “containment”strategy to militarily encircle Russia and China in order to spread its tentacles across Central Asian, then we begin to understand that Russia is not the perpetrator of the hostilities and propaganda, but the victim. The Russia hacking allegations are part of a larger asymmetrical-information war that has been joined by the entire Washington political establishment. The objective is to methodically weaken an emerging rival while reinforcing US global hegemony. Try to imagine for a minute, that the hacking claims were not part of a sinister plan by Vladimir Putin “to sow discord and division” in the United States, but were conjured up to create an external threat that would justify an aggressive response from Washington. That’s what Russiagate is really all about. US policymakers and their allies in the military and Intelligence agencies, know that relations with Russia are bound to get increasingly confrontational, mainly because Washington is determined to pursue its ambitious “pivot” to Asia plan. This new regional strategy focuses on “strengthening bilateral security alliances, expanding trade and investment, and forging a broad-based military presence.” In short, the US is determined to maintain its global supremacy by establishing military outposts across Eurasia, continuing to tighten the noose around Russia and China, and reinforcing its position as the dominant player in the most populous and prosperous region in the world. The plan was first presented in its skeletal form by the architect of Washington’s plan to rule the world, Zbigniew Brzezinski. Here’s how Jimmy Carter’s former national security advisor summed it up in his 1997 magnum opus, The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy And Its Geostrategic Imperatives: “For America, the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia… (p.30)….. Eurasia is the globe’s largest continent and is geopolitically axial. A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions. …. About 75 per cent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world’s physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the world’s GNP and about three-fourths of the world’s known energy resources.” (“The Grand Chessboard:American Primacy And Its Geostrategic Imperatives”, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Basic Books, page 31, 1997) 14 years after those words were written, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took up the banner of imperial expansion and demanded a dramatic shift in US foreign policy that would focus primarily on increasing America’s military footprint in Asia. It was Clinton who first coined the term “pivot” in a speech she delivered in 2010 titled “America’s Pacific Century”. Here’s an excerpt from the speech: “As the war in Iraq winds down and America begins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the United States stands at a pivot point. Over the last 10 years, we have allocated immense resources to those two theaters. In the next 10 years, we need to be smart and systematic about where we invest time and energy, so that we put ourselves in the best position to sustain our leadership, secure our interests, and advance our values. One of the most important tasks of American statecraft over the next decade will therefore be to lock in a substantially increased investment — diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise — in the Asia-Pacific region… Open markets in Asia provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and access to cutting-edge technology…..American firms (need) to tap into the vast and growing consumer base of Asia…The region already generates more than half of global output and nearly half of global trade. As we strive to meet President Obama’s goal of doubling exports by 2015, we are looking for opportunities to do even more business in Asia…and our investment opportunities in Asia’s dynamic markets.” (“America’s Pacific Century”, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton”, Foreign Policy Magazine, 2011) The pivot strategy is not some trifling rehash of the 19th century “Great Game” promoted by think-tank fantasists and conspiracy theorists. It is Washington’s premier foreign policy doctrine, a ‘rebalancing’ theory that focuses on increasing US military and diplomatic presence across the Asian landmass. Naturally, NATO’s ominous troop movements on Russia’s western flank and Washington’s provocative naval operations in the South China Sea have sent up red flags in Moscow and Beijing. Former Chinese President Hu Jintao summed it up like this: “The United States has strengthened its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region, strengthened the US-Japan military alliance, strengthened strategic cooperation with India, improved relations with Vietnam, inveigled Pakistan, established a pro-American government in Afghanistan, increased arms sales to Taiwan, and so on. They have extended outposts and placed pressure points on us from the east, south, and west.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has been equally critical of Washington’s erratic behavior. NATO’s eastward expansion has convinced Putin that the US will continue to be a disruptive force on the continent for the foreseeable future. Both leaders worry that Washington’s relentless provocations will lead to an unexpected clash that will end in war. Even so, the political class has fully embraced the pivot strategy as a last-gasp attempt to roll back the clock to the post war era when the world’s industrial centers were in ruins and America was the only game in town. Now the center of gravity has shifted from west to east, leaving Washington with just two options: Allow the emerging giants in Asia to connect their high-speed rail and gas pipelines to Europe creating the world’s biggest free trade zone, or try to overturn the applecart by bullying allies and threatening rivals, by implementing sanctions that slow growth and send currencies plunging, and by arming jihadist proxies to fuel ethnic hatred and foment political unrest. Clearly, the choice has already been made. Uncle Sam has decided to fight til the bitter end. Washington has many ways of dealing with its enemies, but none of these strategies have dampened the growth of its competitors in the east. China is poised to overtake the US as the world’s biggest economy sometime in the next 2 decades while Russia’s intervention in Syria has rolled back Washington’s plan to topple Bashar al Assad and consolidate its grip on the resource-rich Middle East. That plan has now collapsed forcing US policymakers to scrap the War on Terror altogether and switch to a “great power competition” which acknowledges that the US can no longer unilaterally impose its will wherever it goes. Challenges to America’s dominance are emerging everywhere particularly in the region where the US hopes to reign supreme, Asia. This is why the entire national security state now stands foursquare behind the improbable pivot plan. It’s a desperate “Hail Mary” attempt to preserve the decaying unipolar world order. What does that mean in practical terms? It means that the White House (the National Security Strategy) the Pentagon (National Defense Strategy) and the Intelligence Community (The Worldwide Threat Assessment) have all drawn up their own respective analyses of the biggest threats the US currently faces. Naturally, Russia is at the very top of those lists. Russia has derailed Washington’s proxy war in Syria, frustrated US attempts to establish itself across Central Asia, and strengthened ties with the EU hoping to “create a harmonious community of economies from Lisbon to Vladivostok.” (Putin) Keep in mind, the US does not feel threatened by the possibility of a Russian attack, but by Russia’s ability to thwart Washington’s grandiose imperial ambitions in Asia. As we noted, the National Security Strategy (NSS) is a statutorily mandated document produced by the White House that explains how the President intends to implement his national security vision. Not surprisingly, the document’s main focus is Russia and China. Here’s an excerpt: “China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence.” (Neither Russia nor China are attempting to erode American security and prosperity.” They are merely growing their economies and expanding their markets. If US corporations reinvested their capital into factories, employee training and R and D instead of stock buybacks and executive compensation, then they would be better able to complete globally.) Here’s more: “Through modernized forms of subversive tactics, Russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries around the world.” (This is a case of the ‘pot calling the kettle black.’) “Today, actors such as Russia are using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies. Adversaries target media, political processes, financial networks, and personal data.” (The western media behemoth is the biggest disinformation bullhorn the world has ever seen. RT and Sputnik don’t hold a candle to the ginormous MSM ‘Wurlitzer’ that controls the cable news stations, the newspapers and most of the print media. The Mueller Report proves beyond a doubt that the politically-motivated nonsense one reads in the media is neither reliably sourced nor trustworthy.) The Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community is even more explicit in its attacks on Russia. Check it out: “Threats to US national security will expand and diversify in the coming year, driven in part by China and Russia as they respectively compete more intensely with the United States and its traditional allies and partners…. We assess that Moscow will continue pursuing a range of objectives to expand its reach, including undermining the US-led liberal international order, dividing Western political and security institutions, demonstrating Russia’s ability to shape global issues, and bolstering Putin’s domestic legitimacy. We assess that Moscow has heightened confidence, based on its success in helping restore the Asad regime’s territorial control in Syria,…Russia seeks to boost its military presence and political influence in the Mediterranean and Red Seas… mediate conflicts, including engaging in the Middle East Peace Process and Afghanistan reconciliation…. Russia will continue pressing Central Asia’s leaders to support Russian-led economic and security initiatives and reduce engagement with Washington. …Russia and China are likely to intensify efforts to build influence in Europe at the expense of US interests…” (“The Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community”, USG ) Notice how the Intelligence Community summary does not suggest that Russia poses an imminent military threat to the US, only that Russia has restored order in Syria, strengthened ties with China, emerged as an “honest broker” among countries in the Middle East, and used the free market system to improve relations with its trading partners and grow its economy. The IC appears to find fault with Russia because it is using the system the US created to better advantage than the US. This is entirely understandable given Putin’s determination to draw Europe and Asia closer together through a region-wide economic integration plan. Here’s Putin: “We must consider more extensive cooperation in the energy sphere, up to and including the formation of a common European energy complex. The Nord Stream gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea and the South Stream pipeline under the Black Sea are important steps in that direction. These projects have the support of many governments and involve major European energy companies. Once the pipelines start operating at full capacity, Europe will have a reliable and flexible gas-supply system that does not depend on the political whims of any nation. This will strengthen the continent’s energy security not only in form but in substance. This is particularly relevant in the light of the decision of some European states to reduce or renounce nuclear energy.” The gas pipelines and high-speed rail are the arteries that will bind the continents together and strengthen the new EU-Asia superstate. This is Washington’s greatest nightmare, a massive, thriving free trade zone beyond its reach and not subject to its rules. In 2012, Hillary Clinton acknowledged this new threat and promised to do everything in her power to destroy it. Check out this excerpt: “U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described efforts to promote greater economic integration in Eurasia as “a move to re-Sovietize the region.”…. “We know what the goal is and we are trying to figure out effective ways to slow down or prevent it,” she said at an international conference in Dublin on December 6, 2012, Radio Free Europe.” “Slow down or prevent it”? Why? Because EU-Asia growth and prosperity will put pressure on US debt markets, US corporate interests, US (ballooning) national debt, and the US Dollar? Is that why Hillary is so committed to sabotaging Putin’s economic integration plan? Indeed, it is. Washington wants to block progress and prosperity in the east in order to extend the lifespan of a doddering and thoroughly-bankrupt state that is presently $22 trillion in the red but continues to write checks on an overdrawn account. But Russia shouldn’t be blamed for Washington’s profligate behavior, that’s not Putin’s fault. Moscow is merely using the free market system more effectively that the US. Now consider the Pentagon’s 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) which reiterates many of the same themes as the other two documents. “Today, we are emerging from a period of strategic atrophy, aware that our competitive military advantage has been eroding. We are facing increased global disorder, characterized by decline in the long-standing rules-based international order—creating a security environment more complex and volatile than any we have experienced in recent memory. Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security.” (Naturally, the “security environment” is going to be more challenging when ‘regime change’ is the cornerstone of one’s foreign policy. Of course, the NDS glosses over that sad fact. Here’s more:) “Russia has violated the borders of nearby nations and pursues veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbors…..(Baloney. Russia has been a force for stability in Syria and Ukraine. If Obama had his way, Syria would have wound up like Iraq, a hellish wastelands occupied by foreign mercenaries. Is that how the Pentagon measures success?) Here’s more: “China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model… “China and Russia are now undermining the international order from within the system……. “China and Russia are the principal priorities for the Department… because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S. security.” ( National Defense Strategy of the United States of America ) Get the picture? China and Russia, China and Russia, China and Russia. Bad, bad, bad. Why? Because they are successfully implementing their own development model which is NOT programed to favor US financial institutions and corporations. That’s the whole thing in a nutshell. The only reason Russia and China are a threat to the “rules-based system”, is because Washington insists on being the only one who makes the rules. That’s why foreign leaders are no longer falling in line, because it’s not a fair system. These assessments represent the prevailing opinion of senior-level policymakers across the spectrum. (The White House, the Pentagon and the Intelligence Community) The USG is unanimous in its judgement that a harsher more combative approach is needed to deal with Russia and China. Foreign policy elites want to put the nation on the path to more confrontation, more conflict and more war. At the same time, none of these three documents suggest that Russia has any intention of launching an attack on the United States. The greatest concern is the effect that emerging competitors will have on Washington’s provocative plan for military and economic expansion, the threat that Russia and China pose to America’s tenuous grip on global power. It is that fear that drives US foreign policy. And this is broader context into which we must fit the Russia investigation. The reason the Russia hacking furor has been allowed to flourish and spread despite the obvious lack of any supporting evidence, is because the vilifying of Russia segues perfectly with the geopolitical interests of elites in the government. The USG now works collaboratively with the media to influence public attitudes on issues that are important to the powerful foreign policy establishment. The ostensible goal of these psychological operations (PSYOP) is to selectively use information on “audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of… organizations, groups, and individuals.” The USG now sees the minds of ordinary Americans as a legitimate target for their influence campaigns. They regard attitudes and perceptions as “the cognitive domain of the battlespace” which they must exploit in order to build public support for their vastly unpopular wars and interventions. The relentless Russiagate narrative (which was first referred to the FBI by the chief architect of the Syrian War, former-CIA Director John Brennan) represents the disinformation component of the broader campaign against Russia. Foreign policy elites are determined to persuade the American people that Russia constitutes a material threat to their security that must be countered by tighter sanctions, more sabre-rattling, and eventually war.

"The Russian collusion hoax meets unbelievable end, by Rep. Devin Nunes",www.therussophile.org,Robert Gore,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-russian-collusion-hoax-meets-unbelievable-end-by-rep-devin-nunes.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/805203347f71b4a9606694b65ac317ee?s=96&d=identicon&r=G
It’s time to put the shoe on the other foot. From Representative Devin Nunes at washingtonexaminer.com :
As the Russia collusion hoax hurtles toward its demise, it’s important to consider how this destructive information operation rampaged through vital American institutions for more than two years, and what can be done to stop such a damaging episode from recurring.
While the hoax was fueled by a wide array of false accusations, misleading leaks of ostensibly classified information, and bad-faith investigative actions by government officials, one vital element was indispensable to the overall operation: the Steele dossier.
Funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee, which hid their payments from disclosure by funneling them through the law firm Perkins Coie, the dossier was a collection of false and often absurd accusations of collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials. These allegations, which relied heavily on Russian sources cultivated by Christopher Steele, were spoon-fed to Trump opponents in the U.S. government, including officials in law enforcement and intelligence.
The efforts to feed the dossier’s allegations into top levels of the U.S. government, particularly intelligence agencies, were championed by Steele, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, and various intermediaries. These allegations were given directly to the FBI and Justice Department, while similar allegations were fed into the State Department by long-time Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal.
Their efforts were remarkably effective. Officials within the FBI and DOJ, whether knowingly or unintentionally, provided essential support to the hoax conspirators, bypassing normal procedures and steering the information away from those who would view it critically. The dossier soon metastasized within the government, was cloaked in secrecy, and evaded serious scrutiny.
High-ranking officials such as then-FBI general counsel James Baker and then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr were among those whose actions advanced the hoax. Ohr, one of the most senior officials within the DOJ, took the unprecedented step of providing to Steele a back door into the FBI investigation. This enabled the former British spy to continue to feed information to investigators, even though he had been terminated by the FBI for leaking to the press and was no longer a valid source. Even worse, Ohr directly briefed Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad, two DOJ officials who were later assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. In short, the investigation was marked by glaring irregularities that would normally be deemed intolerable.
According to Ohr’s congressional testimony, he told top-level FBI officials as early as August or September 2016 that Steele was biased against Trump, that Steele’s work was connected to the Clinton campaign, and that Steele’s material was of questionable reliability. Steele himself confirmed that last point in a British court case in which he acknowledged his allegations included unverified information. Yet even after this revelation, intelligence leaders continued to cite the Steele dossier in applications to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
It is astonishing that intelligence leaders did not immediately recognize they were being manipulated in an information operation or understand the danger that the dossier could contain deliberate disinformation from Steele’s Russian sources. In fact, it is impossible to believe in light of everything we now know about the FBI’s conduct of this investigation, including the astounding level of anti-Trump animus shown by high-level FBI figures like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, as well as the inspector general’s discovery of a shocking number of leaks by FBI officials.
It’s now clear that top intelligence officials were perfectly well aware of the dubiousness of the dossier, but they embraced it anyway because it justified actions they wanted to take — turning the full force of our intelligence agencies first against a political candidate and then against a sitting president.
The hoax itself was a gift to our nation’s adversaries, most notably Russia. The abuse of intelligence for political purposes is insidious in any democracy. It undermines trust in democratic institutions, and it damages the reputation of the brave men and women who are working to keep us safe. This unethical conduct has had major repercussions on America’s body politic, creating a yearslong political crisis whose full effects remain to be seen.
Having extensively investigated this abuse, House Intelligence Committee Republicans will soon be submitting criminal referrals on numerous individuals involved in these matters. These people must be held to account to prevent similar abuses from occurring in the future. The men and women of our intelligence community perform an essential service defending American national security, and their ability to carry out their mission cannot be compromised by biased actors who seek to transform the intelligence agencies into weapons of political warfare.

"Warning Mr. Trump, by Raúl Ilargi Meijer",www.therussophile.org,Robert Gore,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/warning-mr-trump-by-raul-ilargi-meijer.html/,"Washington, DC 20500.
Mr. President,
I write to you because I’m seeing something unfold that concerns you, and I have no way of knowing if you’re aware of it, nor have I seen anyone else mention it. That is, sir, you are being set up, a trap is being set for you, and unless you are aware of it, you may well walk into that trap eyes wide open.
It may not be in your briefing this morning, but the WikiLeaks organization has reported that high-ranking Ecuadorean state officials have told them Julian Assange will be expelled from their London embassy in a matter of “hours to days”. Now, I don’t know what your personal opinion is of Mr. Assange, maybe you think he deserves punishment for leaking secret files to the public.
Your personal opinion of Mr. Assange, however, is not the most important issue here, no offense. What’s most important to your own situation, as well as that of Mr. Assange, is that the people who are after him are the very same people who have been after you for 3 years, and who will double their efforts after suffering a huge loss due to Robert Mueller’s No Collusion report.
What the trap set for you consists of is that if you let these -largely anonymous- deep state actors get their hands on Mr. Assange, you will greatly empower them (even further). But, sir, his enemies inside US intelligence are the same as yours, and empowering one’s enemies is not the way to do battle.
We know they are the same people because of Robert Mueller. Mr. Assange was the only way Mr. Mueller could think of to link you to “the Russians”. This is a narrative built upon the -false- notion that “Russians” hacked the DNC servers and sent the contents to Mr. Assange. The narrative has been fully discredited by multiple voices multiple times, but Mr. Mueller has never retracted it.
For good reason: this way he -and others- can leave the story, and suspicion, open that there is a link between you, Mr. Assange and the Russians, despite the Mueller report’s no collusion conclusion. And do note: it not only maintains the popular and media suspicion of Mr. Assange, it also leaves suspicion of you alive.
Former British ambassador Craig Murray explained the intricacies -again- a few days ago:
• Muellergate and the Discreet Lies of the Bourgeoisie
Robert Mueller repeats the assertion from the US security services that it was Russian hackers who obtained the DNC emails and passed them on to Wikileaks. I am telling you from my personal knowledge that this is not true . Neither Mueller’s team, not the FBI, nor the NSA, nor any US Intelligence agency, has ever carried out any forensic analysis on the DNC’s servers. The DNC consistently refused to make them available. The allegation against Russia is based purely on information from the DNC’s own consultants, Crowdstrike.
William Binney, former Technical Director of the NSA (America’s US$40 billion a year communications intercept organisation), has proven beyond argument that it is a technical impossibility for the DNC emails to have been transmitted by an external hack – they were rather downloaded locally, probably on to a memory stick. Binney’s analysis is fully endorsed by former NSA systems expert Ed Loomis. There simply are no two people on the planet more technically qualified to make this judgement. Yet, astonishingly, Mueller refused to call Binney or Loomis (or me) to testify. Compare this, for example, with his calling to testify my friend Randy Credico, who had no involvement whatsoever in the matter, but Mueller’s team hoped to finger as a Trump/Assange link.
The DNC servers have never been examined by intelligence agencies, law enforcement or by Mueller’s team. Binney and Loomis have written that it is impossible this was an external hack. Wikileaks have consistently stressed no state actor was involved. No evidence whatsoever has been produced of the transfer of the material from the “Russians” to Wikileaks. Wikileaks Vault 7 release of CIA documents shows that the planting of false Russian hacking “fingerprints” is an established CIA practice. Yet none of this is reflected at all by Mueller nor by the mainstream media. “Collusion” may be dead, but the “Russiagate” false narrative limps on.
Mr. Trump, sir, I don’t doubt you have realized by now that you are not rid yet of Robert Mueller. But Mr. Mueller is but one cog in the large wheel of intelligence running against you. Yes, the same wheel that runs against Mr. Assange. I’m sure you recognize that it’s hugely ironic, but there is a for now unbreakable bond between the two of you.
Not because of anything you did yourselves, but because Russiagate conspirators in the media, the Democratic party and the intelligence community have created it. And you need to be careful on account of that bond, because they’re going to -try to- use it against you.
I may be a lot more sympathetic to Mr. Assange than you are, but as I said before, this has nothing to do with personal opinion. This is about a trap being set for you. And Mr. Assange is an important part of that trap.
Through him, and especially if they keep him incommunicado, they can keep Russiagate alive, which allows for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual arms expenditures and the 24/7/365 threat of war.
Without the empty allegations against Mr. Assange, Robert Mueller would have had to drop his probe much earlier, but in keeping the allegations alive by silencing Mr. Assange, Russiagate can live on, because the link between Russian hackers and WikiLeaks can be left hanging in the air. And that, Mr. President, will be bad news for you, whether you like it or not, whether you acknowledge it or not.
We haven’t talked about the media yet, but there’s another giant irony in the US media clamoring about press freedom, and using it to smear you for 3 years, but not saying a single word to defend that same freedom when it comes to Mr. Assange. They, too, will continue to haunt you, using Mr. Assange as their bait. Don’t let them.
I don’t know what you intend to do about Russiagate and its main perpetrators, but I do know you can make things much easier for yourself if you solve the Assange conundrum first. And you can’t do that by allowing your own enemies to get their hands on him and rendition him; that will backfire on you.
You could pardon him, but that may be a step too far for you at this point. It might be better to simply allow him to go home to Australia.
What would amuse me to no end is if you would personally nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. That would piss off so many of your enemies it would be a sight to see. The biggest bird you can flip them all. And then after that, you know, go talk to Vladimir Putin and tell him you’re sorry for all this bad theater.
There’s this scene in the Godfather where Marlon Brando as the ageing Don tells Al Pacino how to recognize the traitor in his own midst: the one who suggests setting up a meeting. This is very similar: whoever comes to you to suggest the harshest treatment of Julian Assange, will be the one(s) intent on coming after you too.
One last thing, Mr. President: Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden are among the best, brightest and bravest people our world has to offer. We need people like them, and we need them badly. And it’s a lot more stupid than it is simply ironic, that they are the ones we are locking up and silencing. That way America will never be great again, guaranteed.
And you, sir (I know, more irony) may be their -and our- best and even last hope. You have the power to set free our best. Please use it wisely. And Mr. President, sir, be careful out there.
Know your enemies."

The “democratic political professional student” worked for U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and previously worked for Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) . He also previously worked or was an intern with the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) .
As reported by NY Post : A former Democratic congressional staffer pleaded guilty Friday to federal charges after he posted leaked personal information about Republican senators on Wikipedia, then threatened a witness who caught him.
Jackson Cosko, 27, of the District of Columbia, pleaded guilty to five offenses related to his “doxing” the senators — uploading their personal information online — including computer fraud, making public restricted personal information, witness tampering and obstruction of justice.
Prosecutors said he went after the lawmakers after one senator fired him and he got upset with the others while watching testimony on sexual assault allegations during Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings.
His targets included GOP Senate Judiciary Committee members Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, as well as Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul.
He faces nearly five years in prison when he is sentenced June 13.

Fake News After Mueller,www.therussophile.org,IWB,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/fake-news-after-mueller.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Raphael The school of Athens 1509-11
Allow me to start with a question: Has anyone seen any of the main newspapers and networks who went after Donald Trump for 3 years accusing him of colluding with “the Russians”, apologize to either Trump, or to their readers and viewers, for spreading all that fake news now that Robert Mueller said none of that stuff was real, that they all just made it up?
I’ve seen only one such apology, albeit a very good and thorough one, from Sharyl Attkisson for The Hill. But one is a very meager harvest of course. With over 500,000 articles on collusion published on the topic, as Axios said -leading to 245 million social media ‘interactions’, shouldn’t there be more apologies, if only so people can hold on to their faith in US media for a while longer?
Apologies to President Trump
With the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe now known to a significant degree, it seems apologies are in order. However, judging by the recent past, apologies are not likely forthcoming from the responsible parties. In this context, it matters not whether one is a supporter or a critic of President Trump. Whatever his supposed flaws, the rampant accusations and speculation that shrouded Trump’s presidency, even before it began, ultimately have proven unfounded. Just as Trump said all along. Yet, each time Trump said so, some of us in the media lampooned him.
We treated any words he spoke in his own defense as if they were automatically to be disbelieved because he had uttered them. Some even declared his words to be “lies,” although they had no evidence to back up their claims. We in the media allowed unproven charges and false accusations to dominate the news landscape for more than two years, in a way that was wildly unbalanced and disproportionate to the evidence. We did a poor job of tracking down leaks of false information. We failed to reasonably weigh the motives of anonymous sources and those claiming to have secret, special evidence of Trump’s “treason.”
As such, we reported a tremendous amount of false information, always to Trump’s detriment. And when we corrected our mistakes, we often doubled down more than we apologized. We may have been technically wrong on that tiny point, we would acknowledge. But, in the same breath, we would insist that Trump was so obviously guilty of being Russian President Vladimir Putin’s puppet that the technical details hardly mattered. So, a round of apologies seem in order.
It’s a shame Attkisson refrains from labeling the whole decrepit circus as “fake news”, even if she says it’s just that, in different words. It’s a shame because the term “fake news” can this way remain connected to Trump, something the mainstream media really like. Because it allows for the media to cast doubts on the Mueller report, and for the Democrats to cast doubt on AG Bill Barr.
But they, the MSM, CNN and the NYT, are the ones who, as Robert Mueller has proven, have been spreading fake news all that time, not Trump. And if you would suggest they apologize, they’ll tell you that you’re too early, wait for the report to be released, or that Bill Barr is holding tons of stuff back, or that Mueller didn’t have access to elementary info, or that Trump is a really bad person or or or.
Their reputations would be lost forever if they issue a mea culpa, and apologizing constitutes a mea culpa, so that’s not going to happen. And they all think their credibility remains sound and alive, because they live in echo chambers where they don’t have to listen to anyone prepared to cast any doubt on their credibility.
I first said it years ago: in the new -digital, social- media age, the mainstream media have only one chance of survival: report the naked truth, and be relentless about that. There are a billion voices who can write up rumors, slander, smear and other falsities, but none have the organizations to find out the truth.
Well, it looks like they gave up on that one chance. Russiagate has made it crystal clear that the MSM would rather make a quick buck than investigate, that money and political views trump veracity any day where they operate. So stick a fork in them and turn them over; they’re done.
April 1 was the perfect moment to add it all up, and the Babylon Bee did exactly that:
CNN Publishes Real News Story For April Fools’ Day
Fooling thousands of readers in a prank that the cable news organization said was “just for fun,” CNN published a real news story for April Fools’ Day this year. The story simply contained a list of facts, with no embellishment, editorializing, or invented details. The story also didn’t cite shaky “anonymous sources” and only quoted firsthand witnesses to the event. It was completely factual without any errors whatsoever. Baffled CNN fans immediately knew something was up.
“I was reading this story, and I was like, ‘Wait, what is this?’” said one man in New York who relies on CNN for his fake news every morning. “They really got me good. Then I looked up at the calendar and I realized I’d been duped. A classic gag!”“Those little rascals!” he added, shaking his head and laughing goodnaturedly. “As long as they return to their regularly scheduled fake news tomorrow, we’re good. We’re good.”
We could stop right there. What’s to add? It sums up America to the core. Then again, perhaps not quite yet. How about we add this from the BBC?
Is Facebook Winning The Fake News War?
For the people contracted by Facebook to clamp down on fake news and misinformation, doubt hangs over them every day. Is it working? “Are we changing minds?” wondered one fact-checker, based in Latin America, speaking to the BBC. “Is it having an impact? Is our work being read? I don’t think it is hard to keep track of this. But it’s not a priority for Facebook. “We want to understand better what we are doing, but we aren’t able to.”
[..] While there are efforts from fact-checking organisations to debunk dangerous rumours within the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook has yet to provide a tool – though it is experimenting with some ideas to help users report concerns.
Right, Facebook Fights Fake News. Right. 533,074 web articles on Trump-Russia collusion pre-Mueller report according to Axios, and 245 million ‘interactions’ -including likes, comments and shares- on Twitter and Facebook. Let’s say 100 million on Facebook.
How much did they catch as fake news in their valiant efforts? Not “the Russians” spreading fake news, but the New York Times? How about none? How many times did Facebook shut down the New York Times? Rachel Maddow? None. But Robert Mueller says all those articles about collusion were fake news.
Those reputations are gone forever. Nobody serious will ever again believe anything these people say. Oh, their own subscribers will, but they don’t count as serious people. They swallowed all the nonsense for all of that time. Get real.
Talking about reputations: I decided to try and follow the trails of the Steele dossier earlier, because I think if you figure out the road that dossier has traveled, who has been pushing it etc., you can get a long way towards finding out how how Russiagate came about.
I turned to Wikipedia first, where “Steele dossier” automatically becomes “Trump-Russia dossier”. I read the intro, and it was already so clear where Wikipedia stands on this: not on Trump’s side. Impartiality does not count as a virtue there either. And I know that this stuff is written by third parties, but does Jimmy Wales really want to devalue his life’s work for party politics?
Right below the intro of the very long entry, a familiar name pops up: Luke Harding, and I’m thinking HAHAHAHA!
Luke Harding, after making a mint with his book Collusion, which Robert Mueller has singlehandedly moved into the Fiction section of the bookstore, and co-writing Manafort Held Secret Talks With Assange In Ecuadorian Embassy last November, which Mueller fully discredited, is presented as a source for an entry about collusion? Oh boy.
A few paragraphs down I come upon the name Victoria Nuland, and again of course I think HAHAHAHA, what kind of source is she? Nuland became notorious for colluding with John McCain on Maidan Square in Kiyv, and she has less credibility than Harding, if such a thing is possible. A Nuland quote from the Wikipedia article:
“In the middle of July [2016], when he [Steele] was doing this other work and became concerned, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding and our immediate reaction to that was, ‘This is not in our purview’.”“This needs to go to the FBI if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian Federation. That’s something for the FBI to investigate.”
The entry continues:
It has remained unclear as to who exactly at the FBI was aware of Steele’s report through July and August, and what was done with it, but they did not immediately request additional material until late August or early September, when the FBI asked Steele for “all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos — some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI.”[57][56]
According to Nancy LeTourneau, political writer for the Washington Monthly, the report “was languishing in the FBI’s New York field office” for two months, and “was finally sent to the counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.”, in September 2016.[65]
Meanwhile, in the July to September time frame, according to The Washington Post, CIA Director John Brennan had started an investigation with a secret task force “composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI”. At the same time, he was busy creating his own dossier of material documenting that “Russia was not only attempting to interfere in the 2016 election, they were doing so in order to elect Donald Trump … [T]he entire intelligence community was on alert about this situation at least two months before [the dossier] became part of the investigation.”
Ergo: the fully deranged Nuland, then Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, gets the dossier to the FBI, where nothing happens with it despite Nuland’s insistence that it shows terrible things going on, until someone (McCain?!) gets it to Brennan, and then the ball gets rolling.
There’s all these people in the Hillary sphere of influence who pick it up, in the media, the House, and the FBI and CIA. Because the campaign decides a story about prostitutes peeing on a bed where Obama once slept can a be a winner, and by July 2016 a few nerves had started twitching. The entire machinery shifted into gear right then and there.
The index to the entry contains some 350 links to articles, almost all by the usual suspects and with the usual angles. It all oozes collusion. An exception is Bob Woodward in January 2017:
‘Garbage Document’: Woodward Says US Intel Should Apologize Over Trump Dossier
Woodward said on “Fox News Sunday” the dossier was a “garbage document” and that Trump’s point of view on the matter is being “under-reported.”Woodward said the dossier should never have been presented at an intelligence briefing and it was a mistake for U.S. intelligence officials to do so. “Trump’s right to be upset about that … Those intelligence chiefs, who were the best we’ve had, who were terrific and have done great work, made a mistake here.
And when people make mistakes, they should apologize,” said Woodward. Meantime, Woodward’s former partner in reporting on the Watergate scandal, helped report the news about the dossier on CNN last week. Carl Bernstein defended the reporting on the dossier, dismissing Trump’s contention that it was “fake news.” Bernstein argued that U.S. intelligence saw fit to present the material to President Obama and President-elect Trump.
“Mistakes” by the intelligence chiefs? Hard to believe, if you’ve followed Brennan, Clapper, Comey in the past 2 years.
Not sure I’m going to finish reading that Wikipedia entry on the Steele dossier. What’s the point? It’s fantasy advertized as fact in order to make money. It’s misleading, it’s fake and it seeks to damage people. It would appear we’d be better off discussing what fake news is (and what is not), and to not stick the label to everything Trump says, or the $50 million spent on the Mueller probe will have been entirely wasted.
What we can learn from it is that we can no longer trust the media we once had confidence in. Those days are gone and they won’t be back. They’ve been lying for a long time for their 30 pieces of silver, and once your credibility is gone, it’s gone for good.
That, by the way, is why we need Julian Assange so much, because we know he doesn’t lie. But of course that little fact has also already been buried in a big pile of fake news.
Orwell would be delighted.

Why Oil Prices Rallied 30% This Year,www.therussophile.org,IWB,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/why-oil-prices-rallied-30-this-year.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

By Tsvetana Paraskova
Oil prices gained around 30 percent in the first quarter this year, with both WTI and Brent posting their best quarterly performance in a decade —since the second quarter of 2009.
At the start of the second quarter of 2019, WTI Crude had already topped $60 last week and has been trading above that level in the first week of April, while Brent Crude has been flirting with the $70 mark for days.
At the end of last year, the analysts predicting such a fast rise in oil prices in 2019 were in the minority, after market participants panicked over gloomy forecasts about slowing oil demand growth this year that sent oil tumbling nearly 40 percent in Q4 2018.
A quarter into this year, signs have started to appear that concerns over faltering demand growth may have been overblown.
Demand has been resilient–actually it has been holding more resilient than many pundits had expected at the end of last year. Coupled with a tightening market due to OPEC and allies’ cuts and U.S. sanctions crippling Venezuelan and Iranian oil sales, oil prices may have surprised to the upside many forecasters.
Higher oil prices have naturally led to higher gasoline prices, and forecasts suggest that U.S. drivers should brace for further increases in gas prices as spring comes and motorists drive more. Refinery maintenance season in the U.S. is also weighing on gasoline stocks and prices, AAA said in an update on April 4.
“Until refineries return to normal operations, which will take a few weeks, American motorists should expect pump prices to continue increasing as gasoline demand gains steam,” according to AAA. Related: The World’s Cheapest Natural Gas
Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said on April 1:
“There’s no fooling motorists, gas prices have continued to surge. For the seventh straight week the national average has continued to rise, unabated, due to seasonal impacts. The run-up this spring has felt worse than prior years, and thus far, the national average is up nearly 50 cents per gallon from our 2019 low.”
“Unfortunately, this a rut we’ll be stuck in yet for at least a few more weeks,” DeHaan noted.
One of the drivers of higher oil prices so far this year has been “very resilient demand,” Michele Della Vigna, head of EMEA natural resources research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC this week.
“Everybody came into the year with a very negative view and actually demand has been resilient,” della Vigna said.
“Demand remains robust particularly in the emerging markets, which continue to buy a lot of crude,” Goldman’s expert noted.
The current price level works for everybody on the producer front—it helps to manage deficits in some OPEC members to sustainable levels, it is actually very profitable for the industry, and it’s enough for U.S. shale to keep growing, della Vigna told CNBC.
Goldman Sachs doesn’t see Brent Crude prices breaking significantly above $70 or below $60 a barrel in the coming weeks.
But there are events expected in coming weeks and a couple of months that could impact global oil supply and determine the trend in oil (and gasoline) prices into the summer.
Assuming that demand growth holds, as Goldman says it has so far this year, supply is expected to further tighten with the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and the upcoming review of the U.S. waivers for Iranian oil customers. The Trump Administration is not expected to cut off all Iranian buyers in early May, considering President Trump’s aversion to high gasoline prices and the current Brent price a hair’s breadth away from $70 a barrel.

OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies will review their production cut pact in late June, but at that meeting they will have a clearer picture of where supply might be going, because the U.S. will have already decided whether to extend and to whom to extend waivers for Iranian oil purchases.
OPEC leader Saudi Arabia has made it crystal clear that it would do whatever it takes to rebalance the market, with cuts potentially going through the end of 2019, while non-OPEC leader Russia is, as usual, signaling its reluctance over continued cuts.
On the demand side, there is always weakening global economic growth and the U.S.-China trade war lurking in the shadows to spook the oil market again.
The first quarter this year saw a combination of resilient demand and tightening supply pushing oil prices higher. U.S. sanctions policies toward Iran and Venezuela, the state of the global economy, emerging markets growth, trade disputes, OPEC members’ fiscal needs, or a sudden supply disruption, in Libya for example , will all determine—to various degrees—where oil prices will be in coming quarters.

The presidential candidate (he only entered the second round of voting through electoral fraud) and the acting head of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko forcefully struck a journalist from “Schemes” on the shoulder after he tried to ask him a question whilst being in his headquarters. A video of the incident surfaced on social media.
According to the media, the incident occurred at the campaign headquarters of Poroshenko on the day of the first round of voting on March 31st.
In the video it is seen how the journalist wants to ask a question to Poroshenko. At first he explains to him that it is impossible to do this as he isn’t giving an interview.
However, Poroshenko approaches and pushes a person from his escort aside, and then forcefully strikes the journalist’s shoulder and, in response to his question of whether the Prosecutor General will be replaced should he win the election, says: “We elect not the prosecutor here, but the president” .

Louise Welsh meets Jamaica's Poet Laureate Lorna Goodison,www.thenational.scot,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thenational.scot/news/17555287.louise-welsh-meets-jamaicas-poet-laureate-lorna-goodison/,"Louise Welsh meets Jamaica's Poet Laureate Lorna Goodison Menu By Louise Welsh Lorna Goodison, Jamaica’s first woman poet laureate WE pass the Mitchell Library on our way to Lorna Goodison’s hotel. The Jamaican Poet Laureate’s train was four hours late.
The streets beyond our cab windows are dark, the weather drear. I’m sitting in front, beside the driver, silently composing a stinging letter of complaint. “Dear Mr Branson, while you enjoy barefoot, Caribbean luxury on Necker Island, OAPs on their way to Glasgow are dumped at Preston...”
The Mitchell is gloriously illuminated. The female statue of literature that crowns the library’s dome raises an open book against the night sky. Aye, Write! Book Festival banners hang from lampposts outside the building, defying the rain . Professor Goodison touches her husband’s arm and points, “Look Ted, the library!”
The excitement in her voice dissolves my anxiety. It speaks to the heart of what has brought us together despite difficult miles and grim histories – poetry, the power of words, books.
The responsibility of talent can be a burden. As a young woman, Lorna Goodison once piled all her poems in the backyard and set fire to them. “I had no idea what do with these poetic offerings ... but they still insisted on coming”, she wrote.
Goodison is now a seasoned poet and Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan, whose Collected Poems (Carcanet Press) runs to more than 600 pages. She is the second person to hold the role of Jamaican Poet Laureate, and the first woman to do so. Goodison is in Glasgow at the invitation of Glasgow University for a free, public event the following evening, a celebration of her work, which I am hosting in my role as Professor of Creative Writing.
Lorna Goodison was born on August 1, 1947, in Kingston, Jamaica. Her birthday falls on Emancipation Day, when Jamaicans celebrate the liberation of enslaved peoples. She conflates the gift of poetry with her birthday. “I don’t think it is an accident that I was born on the first of August, and I don’t think it was an accident that I was given the gift of poetry ... I take that to mean that I am to write about those people and their condition.”
Goodison’s inaugural poem in the role of Laureate was In Celebration Of Emancipation. Written in the voices of enslaved peoples, the poem reminds readers that full emancipation did not come until four years after the 1834 declaration.
In it, an enslaved person addresses a weed with empathy: “... them order me, a human weed, / to dig you down, and root you up, and fling you / to one side, although your roots bind the ground / together. You’re as good as any other growing thing, / you are just planted where you’re less counted. / To me little weed you are sweet as any roses.”
The Mitchell is my local library. I’ve written a lot of words in its reading room, drank a lot of coffee in its cafe. I am proud of the way the Mitchell flings its doors wide. People come from across the globe and around the corner to research their family trees. It also houses the Stirling of Keir archive, one of Scotland ’s major collections for the study of Caribbean slavery.
READ MORE: Glasgow City Archives: Scotland’s Slavery Past
The library was founded by Stephen Mitchell of Linlithgow, a tobacco producer who died in 1874. The Union of 1707 had opened Scottish access to British colonies, laying the foundations that enabled the success of entrepreneurs like Mitchell.
'We discuss Robert Burns and his aborted decision to become a book-keeper in the West Indies. We both know the title ‘book-keeper’ was a euphemism for much worse and wonder how much Burns knew it too'
It used to be a shameful secret, absent from history books and school curriculums, that Scotland’s rise to prosperity in the 18th century was underpinned by slave labour. In recent years, recognition of Scotland’s slavery past has grown.
The University of Glasgow has played a significant role in that journey. Last year, it published a ground-breaking, comprehensive report into the institution’s historical links with racial slavery, co-authored by two of its historians, Professor Simon Newman and Dr Stephen Mullen.
READ MORE: University of Glasgow publishes report into historical slavery
The study acknowledges that while the university played a leading role in the abolitionist movement, it also received significant financial support from people whose wealth at least in part derived from slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Among the report’s many recommendations are increased cultural connections between the university and the Caribbean. But this is not the only reason for Lorna Goodison’s invitation. The truth is, I have been desperate to interview her for years.
THERE is a clarity common to great thinkers in the way that Goodison reflects the world. She has created her own iconography which weaves the history of her nation, its people and landscape, with her family history, international politics and re-imagined memories. The memories must be re-imagined because, unlike most Scottish visitors to the Mitchell Library, Goodison and other Jamaicans cannot research their family tree via archives and genealogy sites.
READ MORE: Researching African-Caribbean Family History
Enslaved people were considered property. They were given the names of those who oppressed them. Even if their descendants manage to trace their antecedents via slave owner compensation records (slaves received no compensation, but owners were richly reimbursed) the trail dies at the point at which their ancestors were abducted from Africa.
In Redemption Ground, a collection of essays published in 2017, Goodison writes: “If I wanted to write about my people I had to learn to listen carefully to family stories then imagine, and constantly re-imagine those stories ... All writers do this, but Caribbean writers face formidable or particular challenges because of the ways in which slavery, and then colonialism, erased or distorted so much of our lives that we have to learn to write ourselves into the story.”
From Harvey River, A Memoir Of My Mother And Her People (2007) took Lorna Goodison 12 years to write. It opens with Goodison’s family tree which stretches back to her great-grandfather William Harvey and his brother John who, “giddy at the prospect of imitating men like Christopher Columbus, Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake,”“settled” a clearing in the Jamaican jungle.
The path that led them there, “had been created by the feet of men and women fleeing from the beating and torture that was their only payment for making absentee landlords the richest in the world”.
At the event in Glasgow University’s Bute Hall, Lorna Goodison and I discuss Robert Burns and his aborted decision to become a book-keeper in the West Indies. The bard booked his passage three times but was saved by the success of the Kilmarnock Edition. We both know the title “book-keeper” was a euphemism for much worse and wonder how much Burns knew it too.
We agree the role would have broken him as a man and as a poet, though Lorna jokes that the women in Jamaica would have loved him. She learnt Sweet Afton at school and can recite it (and much more) by heart.
Like Burns, Goodison often writes with the rhythm and dialect of the people around her. Words are vital to all poets, but questions of language are critical to those whose countries and speech have been colonised. Writing lost histories in the language of the people is an act of reclamation and resurrection.
In a much-quoted passage from Lanark, Alasdair Gray’s Duncan Thaw muses, “if a city hasn’t been used by an artist, not even the inhabitants live there imaginatively”. The same must be a hundredfold true of a country whose population were historically trafficked from another continent, then violently enslaved for the economic enhancement of another nation.
As a child growing up in what was then a British colony, Goodison was taught poems written by “European men”. The love of much of this poetry is still with her. She can recite swathes of John Keats whose work she adores. But the intention of this education, to focus West Indians’ attention and sense of worth away from home, towards the distant “motherland” of Britain (which later betrayed their loyalty, notably through the Windrush Scandal) is not lost on her.
Street sport in Kingston, Jamaica
William Wordsworth’s The Daffodils made her ‘‘wonder why, as a Jamaican child of eight or nine, I was being made to memorise and recite a poem about a flower I had never seen, a flower that does not grow on the island.’’.
Her inner voice told her to ‘‘write a poem about the plants and flowers that grow in Jamaica”. She was helped in her quest when she encountered and fell in love with the work of Derek Walcott, whose poetry ‘‘alluded to people and landscapes with which I was familiar”. Through Walcott the young Goodison gained the realisation that ‘‘patois could be used for something other than humour’’.
The image of a weed as a flower by another name, which she explores in In Celebration Of Emancipation, reappears in Goodison’s life and work. Her poem To Us, All Flowers Are Roses, from the collection of the same title, weaves a celebration of Jamaican place names, including Carrickfergus and Dundee , through a history of the island. The poem acknowledges the human blood that has soaked into the earth and sea and marks the resilience of the country.
“Hope River in hot times goes under, / but pulses underground strong enough to rise / and swell again to new deep”
All Flowers Are Roses is also the name of a self-defence and poetry summer school Lorna Goodison founded in Jamaica in association with the National Library of Jamaica.

Initially designed for 11 to 14-year-old girls from inner-city communities, the programme has expanded to include boys’ classes.
The day after our drive through the rain, Lorna Goodison’s event at the University of Glasgow is attended by more than 300 people, some of whom have never walked through the gates of the university before. They are there to hear her read and she holds them, with her unique combination of steel and warmth. She ends with And I Hear From Two Rabbies, a poem written especially for Asif Khan, director of the Scottish Poetry Library. And then, united by her words and her presence, the audience get to their feet and applaud.
AND I HEAR FROM TWO RABBIES Poem by Lorna Goodison
Marley is on perpetual play in the Earthen Jar, where you pass as vegan to pick up his messages. Though the homeless of Ann Arbor are flown south on greyhound, and you’ve sprung from storage your mothballed wool wardrobe;
you have collected in your blood, some sixty odd seasons of hot sun. Solar sufficient for core heat. Keep your one heart warm, Red Rabbie messages.
Pay for a meatless meal. Return to the tower. Find a postcard come in the mail from Scotland Stamped with the fine profile of Rabbie Burns
Read then rest on a fluted red glass vase massed with red red roses. Oh Rabbie when pressure dropped you all but booked passage to leave auld Scotland.
Pressed hard you thought to take a book-keeper job on a sugar estate; and no man’s a good man for that. Your own book kept you in Scotland;
where you became darling Makar, people’s champion, precious national treasure greatest son of Caledonia. Still a man’s a man for a’ that.
Even if you passed on this chance to become rude-boy poet Rabbie Burns, boaster and toaster of Jamdown. And O the girls would have loved you; mad over you,
Burry boy Rabbie. Hard man with a sweet mouth. flow gently sweet Afton as you savor the scorch-kiss of red scotch-bonnet pepper on greens.
so let it be. Come all poets from murmering steams. Blue multiple mountain ranges murmering steams Banks braes rivers by the hundred murmering steams.

A World War Two codebreaking machine has been reconstructed after a seven-year project so it can run in public for the first time.
The Heath Robinson has been restored at The National Museum of Computing in Milton Keynes by a team of six.
The machine was an early attempt to automate code-cracking and, due to its complexity, was named after the illustrator W Heath Robinson.
Phil Hayes, of the museum, said the work was ""quite an achievement"".
He said it was completed using a hand-drawn circuit diagram along with replica circuits based on 1940s technology.
It was quite an achievement because all we had was a few photographs and a hand-drawn diagram,"" said Mr Hayes, the chief engineer on the project.
""It was a challenge to get the machine to work.""
Mr Hayes worked on the project alongside a team of five volunteers.
The machine, which went into operation at Bletchley Park in June 1943, is acknowledged as the inspiration for Colossus, the world's first programmable computer.
Peter Higginson, a great nephew of W Heath Robinson, was due to attend a ceremony on Saturday to unveil the machine, which is on display at the museum.
The Colossus, the world's first programmable computer, was designed off the back of work to try to improve the Heath Robinson

A handful of stars from the upcoming Avengers: Endgame film teamed up to celebrate a massive $5 million donation to help provide support to children around the globe with serious illnesses.
On Friday, cast members Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd and Brie Larson traveled to Disney California Adventure Park to attend Avengers Universe Unite, a charity event to unveil the massive donation.
“More than any time, it’s a time to give back to these courageous kids who inspire us,” Downey Jr., who plays Iron Man in the popular franchise, said at the event, according to the Associated Press.
As part of the sizable gift, Disney donated $1 million to the Starlight Children’s Foundation. The LEGO Group, Hasbro, Funko and Amazon also donated $4 million in Avengers: Endgame toys to hundreds of children’s hospitals across the globe, as well to the Florida nonprofit resort, Give Kids the World Village.
“From delivering hospital care packages to storytelling through Starlight Xperience virtual reality to our recent Disney-themed Starlight Gowns, millions of seriously ill children have benefited from our amazing relationship together.

Barcelona moved 11 points clear at the top of La Liga after two late goals ended the stubborn resistance of Atletico Madrid, who had Diego Costa sent off in the first half.
Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi scored superb goals to leave Barca huge favorites to win the fifth title in seven years.
Former Chelsea striker Costa was shown a straight red card for abusing referee Jesus Gil Manzano in the 27th minute.
And Suarez and Messi made Atletico pay.
For most of the game, it looked like Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak would be the hero to counteract Costa's villainy, making a string of superb saves to keep Barca out.
But with five minutes remaining, former Liverpool striker Suarez bent in a low shot from 25 yards that beat the Slovenian keeper and flicked in off the base of the post.
Just 60 seconds later, Messi was played though down the right, cut inside two defenders and beat Oblak with a low shot for his 33rd league goal of the season.
Diego Simeone's side was once again superbly organized and had to be after Costa's latest moment of ill-discipline. Apparently angered by Manzano's decision not to play advantage, the Spain international confronted the referee and was shown a straight red card.
Several players were involved in an ensuing altercation, with Gerard Pique eventually ensuring that Costa left the field.
""I asked the referee and he told me Costa said something to him,"" Simeone said. ""Other players have said things and not been sent off but that does not justify what Costa did.""
Left-back Jordi Alba had already hit the post after a glorious pass from Messi, and Oblak kept out Philippe Coutinho, Messi and substitute Malcom in another fine display. He eventually made eight saves.
Atleti's one good chance came as Rodrigo headed a free-kick over with 15 minutes left. But Suarez and Messi then struck to leave Simeone's side seemingly in a race with city rivals Real for second place.
Messi has now won more La Liga games than anyone in history - moving ahead of former Real keeper Iker Casillas on to 335 victories.

The Voice UK unveils this year's winner,ednews.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/culture/361465-the-voice-uk-unveils-this-years-winner,"1 2 3 4 5 The Voice UK unveils this year's winner A- A A+
The verdict is in and we now have this year's winner of The Voice UK: 18-year-old Molly Hocking.
It's been a rollercoaster ride over the last couple of months, with coaches Jennifer Hudson, Sir Tom Jones, will.i.am and Olly Murs all lucky enough to mentor some fine vocal talent along the way.
tonight's spectacular show witnessed Molly, Jimmy Ballito, Deana Walmsley, and Bethzienna Williams battle it out for the 2019 crown.
The running order saw each singer perform a new cover track, and later on, they were assigned special duets with their respective coaches.
This meant that both Tom and Olly performed twice, as the former had Bethzienna and Deana under his wing, whilst Olly mentored Molly and Jimmy.
Presenter Emma Willis then declared that the votes were frozen, with two finalists set to leave the competition. The two remaining singers would perform one more time for the studio audience.
As Jimmy and Bethzienna finished with the least votes, it was left to Deana and Molly to lock horns over the final wave of votes now that the lines had reopened.
Deana performed 'Autumn Leaves' once again (which was her semi-final round choice), whilst Molly mirrored this with a masterful version of 'I'll Never Love Again' for a second time.
After the traditional long pause, Emma Willis' revealed that Molly had won the competition.
""Someone pinch me,"" Molly reflected during her final interview. ""All I can say is thank you, from the bottom of my heart all I can say is, I'm shocked, thank you so much!""
Graceful in defeat, Deana noted: ""Thank you so much, it's been a pleasure. This doesn't stop now, I'll be out there, I'll get albums out there.
""I'm so happy for Molly, well done Molly.""

Israel PM vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected,ednews.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/world/361464-israel-pm-vows-to-annex-west-bank-settlements-if-re-elected,"1 2 3 4 5 Israel PM vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected A- A A+
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected.
Israelis go to the polls on Tuesday and Mr Netanyahu is competing for votes with right-wing parties who support annexing part of the West Bank.
The settlements are illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.
Last month the US recognized the occupied Golan Heights, seized from Syria in 1967, as Israeli territory.
Israel has settled about 400,000 Jews in West Bank settlements, with another 200,000 living in East Jerusalem. There are about 2.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank.
Palestinians want to establish a state in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.
What happens to the settlements is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians - Palestinians say the presence of settlements make a future independent state impossible.
Israel says the Palestinians are using the issue of settlements as a pretext to avoid direct peace talks. It says settlements are not a genuine obstacle to peace and are negotiable.
He was asked during an interview on Israeli TV why he had not extended Israeli sovereignty to large settlements in the West Bank.
""You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage - the answer is yes, we will move to the next stage,"" he said.

Yellow vest protestors hit French streets for 21st week,ednews.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/world/361458-yellow-vest-protestors-hit-french-streets-for-21st-week,"1 2 3 4 5 Yellow vest protestors hit French streets for 21st week A- A A+
Yellow Vest protestors on Saturday took to the streets across France, marking the 21st consecutive week of mass demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron.
The protestors gathered at Republique Square and marched towards La Defense, a major business district outside Paris. Brief brawls erupted between police and the protestors.
According to French media, 43 people were arrested in Paris.
Eight protestors, including Yellow Vest movement's leader Eric Drouet, were fined for attempting to stage the protest on Paris' Champs-Elysees Avenue. Last Saturday protests were banned on the street.
French interior ministry said that 22,300 people participated in Saturday's protests while yellow vests claimed this figure was 73,420.
In addition to Paris, protests were held in two northern cities of Rouen and Lille.
Yellow Vest protests began in November 2018 as a reaction to rising fuel costs, which later turned into deadly anti-government riots.
The protests have left 11 people dead and more than 2,000 injured, according to the French government.
Some 8,400 people have been arrested since the beginning of Yellow Vest protests and about 2,000 were remanded in custody.

Two rival rallies took place in Venezuela’s capital on Saturday after blackouts that left people without electricity and water.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro supporters marched to the presidential palace after he tweeted ""Let’s fill the streets of Caracas with joy.""
During the rally, Madura said he is willing to negotiate and support any step for dialogue.
In his remarks, he blamed cyberattacks from Colombia and Chile for the recent power outages.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president in late January, urged his supporters to be united and pressure the government until Maduro leaves.
The rival displays came days after Venezuela’s Constituent Assembly stripped opposition leader Juan Guaido of his parliamentary immunity on Tuesday, paving the way for his prosecution and possible arrest.
Venezuela has been rocked by protests since Jan. 10 when Nicolas Maduro was sworn in for a second term following a vote boycotted by the opposition.
Tensions flared when Guaido declared himself acting president on Jan. 23 -- a move supported by the U.S. and many European and Latin American countries.
Turkey, Russia, China, Iran, Bolivia, and Mexico have thrown their weight behind Maduro.

Libya's UN-backed prime minister has vowed to defend the capital Tripoli as forces loyal to a rival advance from the east.
In a televised address Fayez al-Serraj accused General Khalifa Haftar of launching a coup, saying his troops would be met with ""strength and power"".
The rebels are on the outskirts of the capital and say they have seized Tripoli's international airport.
Tripoli is the base of the UN-backed, internationally recognized government.
Rebel forces are advancing on Tripoli in a multi-pronged attack from the south and west of the city, although they have reportedly been slowed by pro-government fighters.
Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) troops seized the south of Libya and its oil fields earlier this year.
Gen Haftar - who was appointed the chief of the LNA under an earlier UN-backed administration - ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli on Thursday, as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in the city to discuss the ongoing crisis.
Gen Haftar spoke to Mr. Guterres in Benghazi on Friday and reportedly told him that his operation would not stop until his troops had defeated ""terrorism"".
Prime Minister al-Serraj said his government had ""extended our hands towards peace"" while Gen Haftar had declared a coup.
Forces have been ordered ""to deal with the threat of those striving to destabilize and intimidate civilians"", he said, adding those responsible will be brought to justice.

Kirsty Williams extends help to disadvantaged children in school,www.libdemvoice.org,The Voice,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.libdemvoice.org/kirsty-williams-extends-help-to-disadvantaged-children-in-school-60472.html,"Welsh Lib Dem education secretary Kirsty Williams has announced an increase in funding for disadvantaged children in school.
The announcement will provide support to an additional 14,000 learners.
Introduced in 2018, PDG-Access helps families cover the costs of school uniform, sports kits, as well as equipment for activities outside of the school. To receive the support, learners must be eligible for free school meals.
Currently, PDG-Access is worth £125 per eligible pupil entering reception class in primary school or Year 7. Today’s announcement means the scheme will be extended to include Year 3 and Year 10, and provide funding for looked after children (LAC) in every compulsory school year. Eligible families of Year 7 pupils will receive £200, instead of the current £125; relieving some of the increased costs associated with starting secondary school.
Extending the PDG was a key part of the Progressive Agreement between the First Minister and Kirsty Williams.
Welsh Liberal Democrat Leader Jane Dodds said:
The Pupil Development Grant (PDG) is a key Welsh Liberal Democrat policy that supports our most disadvantaged pupils. I am delighted we have been able to extend the policy further to support families with the cost of uniforms and school equipment.
This, alongside Kirsty Williams’ pledge to introduce statutory guidance to reduce the cost of schools uniforms, will go a long way in supporting families.
Kirsty said:
Breaking the cycle of poverty and disadvantage is paramount, and at the heart of our national mission to raise standards for all our learners.
The additional money announced today will mean that more learners will be eligible for funding, and more money will be available for parents of children transitioning from primary to secondary, which as we all know can be an expensive time"

— Jo Swinson (@joswinson) April 5, 2019
It is worth taking a couple of hours out of your life to watch Obama talk about investing in the next generation of leaders to work on securing action to combat gender inequality and climate change.
“Change happens because citizens are mobilised and force change” he said – an inspiration to those of us who are fighting the right and trying to create that “greater sense of hope.”
The first question was about consensus and compromise. He talked about being a community organiser and going to politicians and asking for stuff and they would say well, we can only do so much and how angry that made him. Then he talked about being President and having angry community organisers come to him and demand stuff that he couldn’t give. He understood stuff form both sides.
He knew when he signed off the Paris Climate accord that it wasn’t enough – he felt that it was worth doing it because if you could get every country signed up to doing something, then that becomes the “architecture” in place. We can then build on that.
He also says it’s important not to compromise on everything – you have to be clear what your principles are and where you are not prepared to compromise. This should inform our decision making at all levels – and I’m thinking about the fotthcoming Brexit votes. If it isn’t going to get us a People’s Vote or a revocation of Article 50, don’t vote for it. It’s that simple.
He talks about helping people to find their better selves – a great phrase.
Enjoy."

No breakthrough expected in EU-China summit,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2019/04/07/no-breakthrough-expected-in-eu-china-summit/,"No breakthrough expected in EU-China summit By - April 7, 2019 7:10 PM Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks at a news conference following the closing session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China on March 15, 2019. (Reuters pic)
BRUSSELS: Top EU leaders meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang this week at a summit in Brussels, but their hopes of winning solid commitments on trade look set for disappointment.
Brussels is trying to beef up its approach to the Asian giant as it shows little willingness to listen to longstanding complaints about industrial subsidies and access to its markets, and as fears grow about growing Chinese involvement in European infrastructure.
But the half-day summit on Tuesday is on course to fizzle out with little to show in terms of agreements, with European sources saying it looks highly unlikely a final joint statement will be agreed.
EU officials say China is unwilling to give binding commitments on their key demands, including the inclusion of industrial subsidies as part of World Trade Organisation reform, and they are reluctant to agree the kind of anodyne declaration of good intentions pushed out after last year’s summit in Beijing.
The European Commission last month issued a 10-point plan proposing a more assertive relationship with Beijing, labelling China a “systemic rival” – a move welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron as a belated awakening.
But while the EU’s 15 trillion euro market gives it significant economic clout, it struggles to maintain unity among its 28 members on issues of foreign policy, allowing China to pursue one-on-one deals with individual countries.
“When economic policy intersects with foreign policy and security, the EU lacks the will and capacity to act strategically,” Philippe Legrain, visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics’ European Institute, wrote in an analysis for Project Syndicate magazine.
“Apart from France and the UK, which is leaving the EU, member governments lack a geopolitical mindset.”
This most striking recent example came last month when Italy became the first G7 nation to sign up to China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), a massive network of transport and trade links stretching from Asia to Europe.
Concerns have been raised about the way the BRI saddles countries with Chinese debt and leaves key infrastructure nodes owned by a potential strategic rival, though Beijing insists the initiative is a “win-win” arrangement.
Former Greek finance minister and scourge of the EU, Yanis Varoufakis, said Europe only had itself to blame if Mediterranean countries turned to China.
“We created a vacuum and the Chinese are filling it. The Chinese are coming in because there is a dearth of investment in this continent… We are failing to generate investment that would give our business the opportunity to compete with them,” he said in Brussels last week.
‘The summit has already taken place’
Macron’s own China initiative last week – hosting President Xi Jinping for a summit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker – may also have been a double-edged sword for the EU.
The meeting in Paris gave the EU – through its two most powerful members – the chance to press its concerns directly with the paramount Chinese leader.
But analysts say it also seriously undercut this week’s summit in Brussels, where Li will hold talks not with heads of government but with Juncker and EU Council President Donald Tusk.
“The China summit has already taken place. It is not Europe for China without France and Germany in the same room,” Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the ECIPE Brussels think-tank, told AFP.
“Xi has already spoken. Xi has already shaken hands with his counterparts so by default the summit has already taken place. In a sense, they only bring out Li for Europe or when something bad is going to happen and somebody needs to take the blame.”
At the same time, Lee-Makiyama warned, Europe risks being left playing catch-up if ongoing US-China trade talks result in a deal between the world’s two biggest economies.
“China is going to probably offer us some watered down version of what they gave to the Americans, but that also means that we have to give something,” he said.
But while Tuesday’s meeting may not yield a breakthrough in the EU’s complex relationship with China, European officials insist it still has value in keeping up the pressure.
“There is broad agreement within the EU that it is important to communicate to China that we are at a point where we want to see… concrete steps forward on their willingness to work with us at the WTO,” an EU diplomat told AFP.
“What is important is that we give a signal to China that the EU is a partner but also a competitor and requires Beijing to make some steps.” "
Sarawak PH urges GPs to support amendment Bill,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Bernama,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/07/sarawak-ph-urges-gps-to-support-amendment-bill/,"Sarawak PH urges GPS to support amendment Bill By April 7, 2019 7:07 PM Sarawak Pakatan Harapan chairman Chong Chieng Jen. (Bernama pic)
KUCHING: Sarawak Pakatan Harapan chairman Chong Chieng Jen has urged Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) MPs to support the second reading of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019 due to be tabled on Tuesday in the Dewan Rakyat.
Chong, who is also deputy domestic trade and consumer affairs minister and Stampin MP, said the opposition MPs from GPS, which is in power in the state, should rethink their position and accept the Bill gracefully as a manifestation of goodwill from the PH government.
“It is crucial for GPS to support the Bill and put aside its ego and pride for the benefit of Sarawak.
“There is no reason to reject the Bill as Sarawak has nothing to lose but everything to gain with a change in constitutional status to regain its rightful position.
“This is only the start to put the framework into the right perspective,” he told reporters at the DAP headquarters here today.
Among those present were Sarawak PKR vice-chairman Ali Biju, who is also Saratok MP; Sarawak Amanah chairman Mohamad Fidzuan Zaidi; Bandar Kuching MP Dr Kelvin Yii; and Pending assemblywoman Violet Yong.
The first reading of the Bill was on Thursday.
It seeks to substitute Clause 2 of Article 1 of the Federal Constitution to specify that all the constituent states of the federation during the formation of Malaysia in 1963 is in line with the spirit of the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63).
Following the tabling of the amendment bill, the GPS MPs wanted it to be referred to a Parliamentary Select Committee first for a thorough study but Chong said negotiations could still continue should the Bill be passed in the Dewan Rakyat.
Chong, who is also state DAP chairman, said PH had invited the opposition MPs, including from GPS and Umno, for a briefing on the Amendment Bill tabling but they rejected the offer to give feedback on the matter.
“The important thing is whether GPS will put the interests of Sarawak as their priority.
“Now, it is something concrete that has been offered to Sarawak. Take it while you can still talk and discuss. Walking out is definitely not a choice,” he said.
Yesterday Chief Minister and GPS chairman Abang Johari Openg had said in Bintangor that no approval was given by the Sabah and Sarawak chief ministers pertaining to the amendment of Article 1(2) in its current form and it was not discussed by the Cabinet Committee on MA63. "

(AFP pic)
PARIS: Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has recorded a message in which he names the people he believes are to blame for his legal problems in Japan, his wife said in an interview on Sunday.
Ghosn was re-arrested last week in Japan over fresh allegations of financial misconduct which will see him held in custody until at least April 14.
Ghosn’s wife Carole told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in France that he had recorded a video interview in English before his detention.
“He names the people responsible for what has happened to him. The lawyers have it. It will be released soon,” she told the newspaper.
Carole Ghosn has flown to Paris to try to pressure the French government to do more for her husband whose 108-day imprisonment in Japan between Nov 19 and March 6 had left him a “different person,” she told The Financial Times in a separate interview.
France’s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Saturday he had raised the case during talks with his Japanese counterpart Taro Kono on the sidelines of the meeting of Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers in the French resort of Dinard.
Le Drian said he had “reminded him of our attachment to the presumption of innocence and the full rights of consular protection. "

According to Zacks, “Focus on fee-based revenue sources has been helping Principal Financial earn steadily and limiting its exposure to the interest rate environment as well. The company targets an ROE expansion of 30-60 basis points annually and a long-term earnings growth rate between 9% and 12%. Its inorganic growth story is impressive with buyouts fortifying the global footprint and adding fee-based businesses. Its assets under management have also seen a consistent rise. It aims at $1-$1.4-billion capital deployment in 2019 and targets to pay 40% of net income as dividend in future. However, higher leverage inducing an increase in interest and dilution from acquisition are headwinds for Principal Financial. Shares of the company have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. It is set to release its first-quarter results on Apr 25. A Zacks Rank #3 combined with Earnings ESP of +5.72% makes us reasonably confident of earnings beat.” Get Principal Financial Group alerts:

"In Aleppo, the fate of a legendary hotel hangs in balance",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP Relaxnews,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/07/in-aleppo-the-fate-of-a-legendary-hotel-hangs-in-balance/,"In Aleppo, the fate of a legendary hotel hangs in balance By - April 7, 2019 6:30 PM One of the oldest hotels in Syria, The Baron, in the former embattled city of Aleppo, three years after the Syrian regime regained rebel-held territory and took full control of the country’s second city. (AFP pic)
For generations her husband’s family managed the iconic Baron Hotel in northern Syria, but after years of war the inn is empty and Rubina Mazloumian says she is too tired to carry on.
The Baron Hotel was once the fanciest in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, visited by a long list of celebrated names.
But after four years of civil war in the former rebel stronghold, its suites and ballroom are empty, walls peeling – and its long, red carpet is gone.
The bar stools are vacant and its piano sits unplayed, collecting dust.
All 48 rooms are closed, barring one.
“I don’t know what we’re going to do with this place,” said Mazloumian, the 65-year-old widow of the hotel’s heir, and its current manager.
“It can no longer receive guests or friends,” said the hotel’s only resident.
“The only people that remain in the hotel are two employees, me and this dog,” she added, gesturing to a small pet with a curly brown coat playing nearby.
The hotel was founded in 1911 by the grandfather of Mazloumian’s husband, Armen Mazloumian, who died in 2016.
Carrying a set of keys, Mazloumian strolled through the entrance of the hotel and pointed towards a sweeping staircase.
“We used to roll a red carpet on these stairs when we received prominent leaders like king Faisal I (of Iraq and Syria) and Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser,” she said.
‘Raucous laughter’
She trudged up the stairs and stood in front of a closed wooden door.
Room 203 is where famous novelist Agatha Christie stayed, she said. Inside the hotel, she wrote parts of “Murder on the Orient Express”.
Mazloumian said the Baron Hotel is a testament to decades of Syrian history.
It is from here that King Faisal delivered a speech proclaiming Syrian independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1918.
The street housing it, formerly named after French general Henri Gouraud, was retitled “Baron Street” after French forces withdrew from the country in 1946.
Nasser delivered a speech from one of its balconies in 1958, the year Egypt and Syria formed the ill-fated United Arab Republic.
Other famous people also graced its rooms – US billionaire David Rockefeller, France’s wartime leader and later president Charles de Gaulle and American aviator Charles Lindbergh.
On her tour of the building, Mazloumian paused beside a disused wooden piano.
“It used to be a place full of raucous laughter, clinking glasses, and music – classical and from all over,” she said.
“Historical events were written here.”
But “today, this place is slowly becoming a piece of history itself.”
The contemporary history of the Baron Hotel is less glamorous and tells of the fate of Aleppo, which lies largely in ruins almost two years after battles ended.
Wartime shelter
The establishment was forced to close down in 2012 when the city became a main front in the war between the Syrian government and rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
The hotel was just a few metres from the front line.
Like much of the surrounding city, its walls are scarred with bullet holes and the power rarely comes on.
In 2014, when pitched battles in Aleppo sparked a wave of displacement, the hotel was taken over as a makeshift shelter.
It was the second time it was a refuge for the displaced, after hosting hundreds of Armenians who fled their homes during the mass murder perpetrated by the Ottomans in 1915.
The regime retook control of the city in late 2016, after a deadly offensive and a deal that saw tens of thousands forced to leave its once opposition-held east.
But this time around, recovery is unlikely, said Mazloumian, lamenting the hotel’s lost splendour.
“Only three wine glasses and six coffee cups remain in the hotel today,” she said, standing beside a polished bar, a few plates scattered on its countertop.
“A lot of things have been stolen,” she added.
When asked whether she would sell the hotel, Mazloumian hesitated, then replied cautiously.
“I’m an old woman,” said the manager, who co-owns the hotel with other relatives abroad.
“I don’t have it in me to continue running this hotel,” she added.
“I think it’s only natural for it to come under new hands.” "

KOTA KINABALU: De facto law minister Liew Vui Keong lost to a political secretary to the chief minister in the contest to become the Batu Sapi Warisan division chief yesterday.
According to party officials, the Batu Sapi MP was defeated by the incumbent division chief, Roslan Nasrun, who secured 74 votes to Liew’s 33 during the party polls.
Meanwhile, according to unofficial results, Sabah Law and Native Minister Aidi Mokhtar also lost in his bid to become the Papar division chief.
The Pantai Manis rep lost to Papar MP Ahmad Hassan.
Aidi’s assistant minister, Uda Sulai, also failed in the contest for the Putatan division chief post, losing to Awang Ahmad Sah.
According to unofficial results, Uda, who is the Petagas assemblyman, garnered 61 votes while Awang obtained 111 votes.
Warisan wrapped up its party elections and annual meetings, involving 26 divisions, including Labuan, today.
Sabah Chief Minister and Semporna MP Shafie Apdal was returned unopposed as the Semporna division chief. He is also Senallang assemblyman.
Deputy Chief Minister Jaujan Sambakong also retained his position as the Semporna deputy chief after defeating another political secretary to the chief minister, Jakariya Abdul Jalil.
Warisan held its first party divisional polls after being taken over by Shafie in late 2017 and after his party’s victory in the May 9 general election last year.
The vote counting is still in progress at the time of writing.
Before the party elections in Semporna today, Shafie had called on members to strengthen the party instead of thinking only of positions.
He said the party should learn from the past mistakes of other parties and advised members against internal fighting for positions as it would portray Warisan in a bad light and could lead to people rejecting the party. "

DUBAI: Etihad Airways PJSC is seeking a loan of about US$600 million to help make initial payments for planes, according to people familiar with the matter.
Abu Dhabi’s state-owned carrier is arranging the loan on its own and has reached out to banks that may be willing to provide the unsecured facility with a maturity of one or two years, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.
A spokesman for Etihad Airways said the company doesn’t comment on rumours or speculation.
Etihad Airways has 43 unfilled orders from the Boeing Co’s 787 family, according to a Boeing January report.
The carrier in February slashed orders worth US$21.4 billion at list prices for Boeing and Airbus SE jetliners, pushing forward with a drastic restructuring after years of operational losses.
It cut the order for Boeing 777-9 aircraft to six jets from 25, while cancelling the delivery of 42 Airbus A350 wide-bodies, leaving it with 20, it said at the time.
After reporting losses of US$4.8 billion over the past three years, Etihad Airways has cut thousands of positions, put the brakes on a costly expansion and scrapped marginal routes.
The airline is also being sued over an August 2017 decision to cut financial support for defunct German carrier Air Berlin Plc. "

Brexit Endgame | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/brexit-endgame,"
Authored by Michael Anthony via Off-Guardian.org,
This week, appropriately beginning 1st April, Brexit descended into farce after merely being a two-year comedy of errors. In fact it went beyond farce and became more like one of those Shakespearian tragedies like King Lear where doomed tragic heroes begin behaving like clowns and demented court jesters. The doomed tragic hero in this case is the United Kingdom itself and its venerable (some would say senile) parliamentary system.
Brexit had two toxic characteristics built into it.
The people voted to leave the EU by a clear majority, but they elected a parliament that was 75% in favour of Remain.
This is because of the class bias of the Brexit vote (the Remain chattering classes versus the Brexit deplorables.) This required a superhuman abnegation on the part of MPs to implement the will of the people when they thought the people had gone mad. Some MPs were capable of this spirit of intellectual self-sacrifice for democracy’s sake. Most were not and fought tooth and nail to stop Brexit or water it down to the point of it losing all purpose. They kept up a dishonest mantra that what was voted for was not deliverable. It was only not deliverable because of them.
The second toxic element was EU manoeuvring. The EU bosses had two goals: stop the UK leaving, or, if they couldn’t, make leaving such a disaster for the UK it would deter anyone else. (Their political goals of power and unity trumped the economic interests of their citizens.) They took advantage of the fact that after May’s reckless snap election she was dependent on the Northern Irish DUP for a majority, and needed every single Conservative MP on side.
May went for the full Brexit: outside the customs union and the single market, which meant she was relying totally on Conservative and DUP votes to get her deal through. The EU then slipped into the Withdrawal Agreement a poison pill: the Irish Backstop, a temporary membership of the Customs Union until a free trade deal was negotiated, so as to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This arrangement could only be ended by mutual agreement — that is, with EU permission. What is more it required alignment of Northern Ireland with single market rules. This poison pill could not be swallowed by the DUP, because it divided NI from GB, or by the hardline Brexiteers because it could be used by the EU to keep the UK in the Customs Union forever.
Theresa May should have pounded the table to demand a time limit on the Backstop or a UK right to leave it unilaterally, or else she would walk away. A dragon in the Commons but a mouse in Brussels, she funked it. The EU were adamant the Backstop must be unlimited in time, and then insisted that the whole deal was now signed and couldn’t be re-opened. (At most they would give a few toothless verbal reassurances that were not part of it.) This intransigence guaranteed that the Withdrawal Agreement would never pass through parliament. The votes against it by the DUP and hardline Brexiteers, when added to the Remainer and partisan votes of the Labour Party (which falsely labelled the deal a “Tory Brexit”) ensured crushing defeats every time May presented it.
The only logical solution would have been to threaten the Labour Party with a no deal Brexit to make them come on board, since the Withdrawal Agreement itself had nothing in it that the Labour Party could not support. It did not go into the details of the future trade relationship of the UK and EU to be negotiated afterwards (i.e. it did not exclude a customs union or single market) and the Political Declaration which sketched this future out could easily have been fudged to keep everyone happy. Instead, May has now decided to compromise with Labour and explicitly accept staying in the Customs Union in order to get their support. Her own hardline Brexiteers are now in open revolt. The dance is becoming frantic as the deadline approaches of 12th April, the new date at which the UK must exit or else ask the EU for a long extension of article 50.
It remains to be seen at this moment whether the compromise over a Customs Union (which makes it impossible for the UK to make its own trade deals, one of the key goals of Brexit) goes ahead. Since it can only be written into the non-binding Political Declaration (as an intention), not the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement, it is hard to see Labour having any faith in the promises of a PM already on the way out.
Most important will be the attitude of the EU when May asks for an extension next week.
Will they grant a long extension in the hope that Brexit fires will burn out and a second referendum will cancel it? (Resigning themselves to more of Farage’s harangues in the EU parliament, cheered on by hordes of French and Italian populists.)
Or will they call time and force the UK to choose between renouncing Brexit and leaving at once with no deal? (In other words, surrender or suffer — the endgame of the more Machiavellian plotters among them, but perhaps now also of the merely exasperated and despairing.)
If the EU chooses the second course, this may be a salutary kick in the pants for the most selfish, blinkered, factious political elite on the planet. It is always enlightening to learn how unloved and dispensable one is. If it happens, the ultimate revelation will be whether the UK parliament will still have enough tattered rags of pride left to walk away, or whether they will cringe and crawl one more time (this time forever) to the cracking of the whip of their masters in Brussels. This really will determine what sort of nation Britain is and will be. Login "
Pro-Trump Republicans plan 8-figure play for the Jewish vote in 2020 -,www.politico.com,ALEX ISENSTADT,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/07/donald-trump-jewish-vote-2020-1260172,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
LAS VEGAS — Republicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at fracturing the Democratic Party’s decadeslong stranglehold on the Jewish vote.
Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. On Friday morning, the group’s board members — many of them prominent Republican Party donors — gathered in a conference room at Adelson’s Venetian resort, where they were briefed on plans for a $10 million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President Donald Trump. The investment, people familiar with the early discussions said, will far surpass what the group spent in past presidential elections. Story Continued Below
With Democrats embroiled in a wrenching internal debate over anti-Semitism and support for Israel, Republicans are moving to capitalize with an aggressive campaign painting Trump — who has himself faced accusations of stoking anti-Semitism—as a fierce and unapologetic defender of the Jewish state.
“We’re at the intersection of a very unique moment in time where we have the most pro-Israel president ever in history in Donald Trump, and we also at the same time have the Democratic Party — because of the pressure of the progressive left— moving away from the traditional support for Israel that has existed going back to 1948,” said Matt Brooks, who has served as RJC executive director for nearly three decades.
“This strain within the Democratic Party is making those centrist and center-left Jews who care about these issues feel more and more uncomfortable, and with the strength of Donald Trump and the Republican Party on these issues, we believe that we’ll be able to bring those folks over to the Republican side,” Brooks added.

At a time when Trump’s approval rating remains mired in the low- to mid-40s, the offensive shows how Republicans are taking steps to contest any votes they can. Jews only account for about 2 percent of the U.S. population and have overwhelmingly supported Democrats in past elections. But GOP officials believe that siphoning off even a small portion the Jewish vote in a few battleground states could be critical in 2020.
“The Jewish vote will remain and largely loyal Democratic vote because of domestic issues largely, but if there was ever a cycle where Republicans could make inroads, it is this cycle,” said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush White House press secretary who now serves as an RJC board member. “If you accept that there are sizable Jewish populations in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania [and] Michigan, the Jewish vote — if we can make additional inroads — can be very helpful in putting you over the top. The White House knows that.”
The administration is all-in on the strategy. On Saturday, Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and three White House officials — Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt, and Avi Berkowitz — all made pilgrimages to the Venetian, where RJC members were gathered for the third day of their annual spring conference. Before a sea of supporters waving “We are Jews for Trump” signs, the president accused Democrats of opposing Israel and “advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history.”
Before taking the stage, Trump met privately with Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who together gave more than $120 million to Republican causes during the 2018 midterms. The 85-year-old Adelson, who’s been undergoing cancer treatment, hadn’t been expected to be in attendance. But those close to the billionaire said he was intent on making the Trump rally, and when he entered the auditorium on a motorized scooter and wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat , he was greeted with a standing ovation.
Democrats are deeply skeptical that the GOP will succeed in making inroads with Jews. Since 1992, according to exit polling data, the Jewish vote has remained remarkably stable, with Democrats winning between 69 percent and 79 percent in each presidential election.
Halie Soifer, the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said that recent polling her group had conducted showed that Jews remained confident in the Democratic Party’s posture on Israel and that they overwhelmingly disagreed with Trump on an array of domestic issues. And, she pointed out, Republicans had long vowed to make gains with Jewish voters only to fall short."

Why Beto and Buttigieg Pretend to Be Kennedys - Magazine,www.politico.com,Peter Canellos,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/07/beto-buttigieg-2020-campaign-kennedy-jfk-226575,"For the past six decades, Democrats have been mesmerized by the Kennedy style, like adult children searching for the forever-young father who left them before his time. The pressure for candidates to fit the Kennedy mold—in looks, style and political bearing—became so oppressive that the writer Garry Wills coined a term for it: “The Kennedy imprisonment.” The generation of politicians that immediately followed John F. Kennedy—John Kerry, John Tunney and even Republicans like John Lindsay—tried so hard to emulate JFK that they enacted impersonations: fastening the top button of their suit jackets to flap in precisely the same patterns as his, chopping the air with their hands like he did, extending their necks to mimic his chin-in-the-air stance at the lectern. In more recent years, such candidates felt freer to adopt their own mannerisms but their political posture remained pure JFK: that of the young and earnest outsider, alone on the stage, a prince suffused in a golden aura of charisma.
Story Continued Below
Now, as the 2020 contenders emerge from the wings, the Kennedy ghost is alive again, mostly in the person of former Texas Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke. Unlike the JFK mannequins, he has chosen to ape the tousled Bobby variant of the Kennedy style, honed after Dallas, that of the surviving brother searching for meaning in a strange and violent world. He even shares Bobby Kennedy’s first two names. But the 46-year-old O’Rourke must compete with an even younger Kennedy clone—the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend (Ind.), Pete Buttigieg, who (naturally) won the JFK Library’s Profile in Courage essay contest in 2000 as a sweaty-palmed high school senior. A decade later, in 2015, he won the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award from the Kennedy School at Harvard.
Among all the mini-dramas within the still-growing Democratic field, the 2020 primaries will also be a test of whether, after 60 years, after the fraying of the Kennedy family dynasty, and after the emergence of the #MeToo movement, the character of a Kennedyesque charismatic loner still stirs the Democratic imagination and excites the passions of the electorate. It’s a question that goes beyond just the horse-race odds of O’Rourke and Buttigieg, and to the core of the party’s ability to win the White House.

One would assume that, if the Kennedy political recipe was losing its flavor in 1981, when Wills conjured the term “the Kennedy imprisonment,” it must surely be rancid by now. But even if some of the outward trappings of the Kennedy image—the high fashion, the self-satisfied smile—have fallen out of vogue, the Kennedy approach to politics and, especially, to winning a presidential election as a Democrat, are as relevant in 2020 as they were in 1960. Far from being an anachronism, JFK’s evangelistic style of leadership is still the Democrats’ most potent weapon. His is not just a proven route to the White House, but has been, for more than a half century, literally the only route for a Democrat to win the White House.
This is an imprisonment the Democrats might choose to end at their peril.

John F. Kennedy was neither the most liberal nor the best-credentialed Democrat in the 1960 primaries, but he encapsulated the hopes and dreams of the electorate. He evoked themes that proved irresistible to liberals (generational change, a we-can-do-better scolding of a neglectful Republican stewardship, the need for national unity), but were vague enough not to alienate moderates who might be fearful of overreach.
While Kennedy’s persona—his glamour, sex appeal, erudition and speaking style—was a big part of his success, there was a more durable truth undergirding his breakthrough: Voters love Democratic values and aspirations, but are terrified of Democratic legislation. Kennedy’s vagueness on policy was as important to his success as his precision in articulating the challenges of the ’60s was.

The electorate wasn’t blind to these realities. The party’s liberal old guard, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, distrusted Kennedy and preferred Adlai Stevenson. In both the primaries and the general election, Kennedy stood accused of lacking specific policy proposals. But his reluctance to put a price tag on every priority, to make firm, unbreakable commitments, or to attach his name to every overloaded barge of a bill being pulled through the Senate served him well: Liberals saw a candidate who shared their fondest beliefs, while moderates saw a president whom they could trust to resist partisanship in favor of the broader national interest.
Kennedy’s nomination was a victory against his party’s congressional leadership, represented by his eventual running mate, Lyndon Johnson. Then, as now, close exposure to the sausage-making in the House and Senate did not inspire loyalty in the voting booth, at least for presidential aspirants. And the choice of JFK was also a rebuke to the principled left, represented by Stevenson, who had led the party to defeat in the two previous elections.
Three years later, Kennedy’s assassination produced an outpouring of sympathy so great that it carried Johnson to a record-breaking election victory in 1964. Thereafter, every Democrat who has been elected president has followed the JFK road map.
The record of the past 50-plus years is irrefutable: Whenever the party has nominated a former vice president (Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000) or a similar figure of long exposure to the public eye, such as Hillary Clinton in 2016, he or she has fallen short. The same has been the case with policy-oriented liberals like George McGovern in ’72 and Michael Dukakis in ’88.
The little-known Bill Clinton, however, passed around copies of a photo of himself as a bedazzled Boys Nation recruit pumping President Kennedy’s hand on the White House lawn. He preached a Kennedyesque message of generational change and we-can-do-better idealism to capture the party’s heart. Despite generating a suspicion that he put strategy ahead of principle, he cruised to two victories. The largely unknown Barack Obama asserted his own Camelot connection by campaigning alongside Ted and Caroline Kennedy, while Caroline penned a New York Times op-ed predicting he would be “ A President Like My Father .” Obama’s message of hope and change was castigated as vague and empty, but it served the crucial purpose of inspiring liberals without alarming moderates. He won twice. Finally, there was Jimmy Carter, who seemingly came out of nowhere to win the Democratic nomination in 1976. He too evoked generational change and a hopeful, I’ll-never-lie-to-you message, and prevailed in a close race.
John Kerry tried—oh, how he tried—to be Kennedyesque in 2004, with his Massachusetts roots, JFK initials and bromance with Ted. He stressed electability over ideological purity, and he arguably performed better than fellow nominees Humphrey, Dukakis and Hillary Clinton, who lost races that were possibly more winnable than his. But in important ways, Kerry broke the model. Unlike Carter, Clinton, or, later, Obama, he wasn’t a fresh face on the national scene, nor did he offer generational change. At 60, he had been in the Senate for two decades and had first achieved notice more than three decades earlier as a veteran opposing the Vietnam War.
Kerry’s campaign serves best, perhaps, as an object lesson in what parts of the Kennedy legacy—the looks, the accent, the association with actual Kennedy relatives—have diminished in significance over time, and which remain evergreen: youth, vigor, a sense of high purpose.
There is, of course, another, less admirable, aspect to Kennedy’s political style: maintaining a sense of what might generously be called flexibility on the issues, which may be every bit as important to achieving victory as the others. Younger brother Ted—the keeper of the flame who never quite lived up to the expectations that fate placed on his shoulders—violated this precept in his own national career. His unabashed liberalism and tireless commitment to legislating helped to bring about an era of progressive change, but probably contributed to his failure to win the White House.

Under Ted’s stewardship, the family brand became synonymous with policy-oriented liberalism, which probably convinced many people that Jack and Bobby had been equally earnest in pursuing Democratic legislative priorities. They were not, though they conveyed such a powerful sense of progressive values, the feeling that change was not only inevitable but righteous and necessary, building toward a greater country and a more equitable society, that they were forgiven any sins or omissions.
***
The events surrounding the assassinations of President Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy cleansed the family legacy of any residue of distrust or compromise. The nation’s sense of loss quickly grew into a sense of nostalgia. Particularly after the other agonies of the ’60s and ’70s—social change, Vietnam protests, economic reversals, Watergate—Kennedy’s thousand days in office began to feel like a memory of a better time, when politics was inspiring and politicians were admired.
The #MeToo movement, however, has forced a reconsideration of the “Mad Men” era of the Kennedy presidency, of the womanizing associated with JFK and some of the men of his administration. Kennedy’s personal image is now tarnished. But there are signs that Kennedy-style presidential politics can survive the hit.
O’Rourke, who makes no disguise of his admiration of the Kennedys, evokes the less sexually aggressive Bobby rather than JFK. There’s far less swagger in Bobby’s image, crafted late in his life, after the open-bar era of the early ’60s had ended. The Bobby Kennedy of the later ’60s strived to overcome an earlier reputation for conservatism, the vestige of having once worked for the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy, and for ruthlessness in having served as his brother’s political prod. Chastened by grief, the new Bobby climbed mountains, marched through Appalachia, and visited urban ghettos in search of understanding. He still wore suits like his brother’s and spoke with the same accent and emphasis, but he added shades of warmth and empathy. Bobby may have been late to the causes of the ’60s, but he presented his conversions as the product of deep, intensive soul-searching.
That is certainly Beto’s M.O. The onetime adolescent writer of poetry took to the road by himself in search of inspiration before deciding on a presidential run, only to find himself chastised by some observers for self-indulgence. Those same skeptics accuse him of being too conservative, despite the spirited idealism that surrounded his 2018 Senate run against Ted Cruz. His fundraising success suggests he retains a passionate grassroots following, but his early struggles on the campaign trail raise a legitimate question of whether current-day voters are simply too cynical to fall for a Kennedyesque candidate.
Should Beto succeed, it won’t be because of his mere resemblance to the Kennedys—a physical coincidence that elicits as much eye-rolling as admiration. Voters under 55 have no memory of the living Bobby Kennedy, even if a constant diet of miniseries and docudramas might lead them to think otherwise. Rather, Beto’s success would be built on the freshness of his presentation, his skateboarding spontaneity, his sense of being a man apart—apart from the corruption of Washington, the calculations of the party elites and the demands of the special interests. That’s the aspect of the Kennedy formula that remains potent.

Pete Buttigieg has followed a clear Kennedy path: attending Harvard, studying in England, serving in the military, and preaching generational change and “a fresh start.” Meanwhile, he has a natural means of erasing the predatory womanizing from the JFK image: He’s gay. His extroverted husband , ubiquitous on social media, provides both the reassurance of domestic tranquility and a reminder that the Buttigieg candidacy is groundbreaking in more than just his audacity in running for the White House while serving as a small-city mayor. His fearless pursuit of the nomination, while eschewing the usual credentialing process, marks him as a man apart, too. Democratic primary voters love to make a statement and voting for a gay man may feel more refreshing, and more like a symbolic repudiation of Donald Trump, than opting for a more conventional Kennedy stand-in.
The other Democrats are, more or less explicitly, repudiating the Kennedy style. Elizabeth Warren, who occupies the Massachusetts Senate seat that launched JFK to the presidency, seems to have the Kennedy formula backward. Her M.O. has been to offer specific proposals—and, more than that, specific proposals on new and cutting-edge issues. While she can be an inspiring speaker, she has chosen to stint on rhetoric in favor of showcasing her fighting spirit. Authenticity, not charisma, is her calling card.
Joe Biden, meanwhile, is stepping into the Happy Warrior mold of the garrulous Humphrey, his fellow VP. And Adlai Stevenson would see something of himself in Bernie Sanders’ rumpled-professor style. The women candidates—Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris in particular—might reasonably wonder if the Kennedy path is even open to them; JFK’s electoral magic rubbed off on a few of his male relatives, but not his sisters, niece or daughter.
And yet if JFK’s mannerisms are subtracted from the equation, there’s no reason that a politically appealing, slightly elusive, outsider woman couldn’t replicate some of his mystique. The enduring takeaway of the past half century is not that the candidates who looked and acted the most like JFK were successful. It is rather that those who embodied his spirit of generational change, inspiring rhetoric and arms-length distance from the party establishment have prevailed, while those lacking such attributes failed.
That’s not a coincidence or an accident of history. There’s a clear logic in the idea that the party of progressive change often wins the battle for hearts and minds, but loses on practicality: People want wider access to health care, but many don’t want their own health care changed. They share the party’s values but are wary of the vehicles for change.
Democratic candidates can’t ignore that pervasive reality. JFK would be unlikely to sign on to an unfocused “Green New Deal” or make a specific pledge to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Neither, for that matter, would Bill Clinton, who fretted about raising your taxes too much, or Obama, who campaigned against a health care mandate in 2008.
Their appeal to the majority rested on their sense of promise. Tomorrow belongs to the young, the vigorous, the idealistic—a notion that might register especially powerfully when running against a 74-year-old Donald Trump.
Now, as ever, the Kennedy imprisonment is regarded by the left as an electronic dog fence—one that traps the Democrats into relying too much on compromise to achieve victory, and an over-reliance on personal charisma over party organization. Still, it’s a lot better than losing, and at its best can feel so dazzling that the boundaries of the possible seem to fade away. For the Democrats of today, as much as in 1960 or 1980, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die."

They’re coming for Cornyn,offthekuff.com,Charles Kuffner,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=90248,"Let’s bring it on . Big John Cornyn
Texas Democrats are launching a multimillion-dollar initiative to help take down U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, regardless of who they ultimately choose as their nominee next year.
Emboldened after their gains in 2018 — including the closer-than-expected Senate race between U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke — the state party is establishing a “Cornyn War Room” to “define Cornyn before he defines himself,” according to a memo. It is unlike anything the party has done in recent history surrounding a U.S. Senate race, and it reflects the urgency with which Texas Democrats are approaching a potentially pivotal election cycle.
“In 2020, we must seize the opportunity to flip Texas,” says the memo from the state party, which was obtained by The Texas Tribune. It cites recent polling that found Texas “ essentially tied ” in the 2020 presidential election and that 64 percent of voters do not know or dislike Cornyn . “We cannot wait for the primary dust to settle before we launch our attacks on John Cornyn.”
The project, the memo adds, will “define Cornyn and reveal him for what he is — a coward, afraid of shadows on his right and left.”
The offensive has five fronts: digital, communications, messaging and polling, research, and data and targeting. There will be staff dedicated to the project and coordination with affiliated groups, county parties and activists.
The memo says the effort is “funded, in part, by record-breaking fundraising, including the most successful February totals in Texas Democratic Party history.” The memo does not specify the figures.
[…]
Several prominent Democrats are considering challenging Cornyn, perhaps most notably U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio and former congressional candidate M.J. Hegar, who said Tuesday she is “taking a very close look” at the race. Three lower-profile Democrats have already declared their candidacies.
With no disrespect intended to MJ Hegar, just as it was my assumption that the Senate race was Beto’s if he wanted it, it is now my assumption that it’s Joaquin’s if he wants it. Doesn’t mean anyone else has to agree with that, just that I’d expect the establishment – most of it , anyway – would fall in line with Joaquin if he follows through on his reported interest in the race. Some people are already in line , they just need Joaquin to get to the head of it. My guess is that Hegar’s “close look” is at least one part a “just in case Joaquin doesn’t run” contingency. Someone has to get to the front of that line, after all. But she might jump in anyway, and if she does she’d be formidable, and might put Joaquin on the spot. My advice to him would be to make his mind up quickly. Easy for me to say, I know, but still.
The polls in question don’t really mean much – the “essentially tied” poll tested Cornyn versus Beto, not Cornyn versus anyone else or Cornyn versus a generic Dem – but compared to what we’re used to, they’re not bad at all. The bottom line is that the conventional wisdom at this time is that Texas will be competitive in 2020. I don’t know about you, but I feel like I need to sit down every time I say that. We are in exciting times.
What the rest of this means remains to be seen. Beto’s campaign in 2018 was singular, and I have no idea how much of it is foundational to this effort. Be that as it may, this is the sort of thing that a viable, competitive statewide party needs to be doing, and having the resources for it is fantastic. I’ll be keeping an eye on this.

How many rail lines to Hobby do we need?,offthekuff.com,Charles Kuffner,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=90199,"Maybe just one .
Metropolitan Transit Authority board members on Thursday agreed to plan on one light rail line to Hobby Airport, as opposed to the two initially proposed as part of the agency’s long-term transportation plan.
The first draft of the plan, dubbed Metro Moving Forward, included extensions of both the Purple Line and Green Line to Hobby. The proposal had the Purple coming from southeast Houston near MacGregor Park and the Green coming from near Gus Wortham Golf Course. The projects represented roughly $1.8 billion of the $7.5 billion Metropolitan Transit Authority plans to spend on major projects and improvements over the next 40 years.
Both of the light rail extensions enjoy support from local officials and residents along the planned routes to Hobby, but the plan of two routes to the same airport also drew criticism. Each of the routes also had skeptics, who noted the Purple Line would travel a loosely developed industrial area for part of the trip, while the Green Line’s straightest path – along Broadway – would anger some residents and force Metro to rebuild a street that the city spent money sprucing up for the Super Bowl in 2017.
[…]
Metro CEO Tom Lambert said staff will study the options and return to the board with a suggestion of which line to advance. Based on board comments, however, the Green Line had an edge. Terri Morales noted after driving the Purple Line’s proposed route, she felt there were many more clusters along the Green Line that made sense as potential stations and places where people would want to go.
Metro chairwoman Carrin Patman agreed, noting the economic potential of an East End line.
“I do not think the Purple route as currently designed to Hobby makes sense,” Patman said.
The primary selling point of the Purple Line is it would directly connect the University of Houston and Texas Southern University to the airport.
That potential left the Purple Line some life, in one scenario officials will examine. At the pressing of board member Sanjay Ramabhadran, Lambert said officials will also study if there is an intersection point where it makes sense to extend the Green and Purple light rail lines, then have one of the routes continue the trip to Hobby. That way, both neighborhoods have easier access, without the higher cost of two distinct rail lines.
“I want to see if we have that flexibility to make something work,” Ramabhadran said.
Officials have about three months to work out the details of a final plan, with the revised rail proposal, and then seek more public input. The long-range plan is tentatively expected to be approved by Metro’s board on July 29. The latest Metro can place an item on the November ballot is Aug. 19.
See here for the previous update. There’s more ground covered in the story, so go read the rest of it. I like the idea of finding a way to join the Green and Purple lines on the way to Hobby so that both can ultimately go there. Maybe that means extending the Purple line to Broadway to join it up with the extended Green line. Seems like the simplest solution, though whether it would be the best, or even a workable one, is one for Metro to figure out. We’ll know soon enough. Related Posts:"

After eight weeks of games and less than one season into Alliance of American Football’s existence, league owner Tom Dundon has decided to suspend all operations, league co-founder Bill Polian confirmed to ESPN’s Chris Mortensen on Tuesday.
“I am extremely disappointed to learn Tom Dundon has decided to suspend all football operations of the Alliance of American Football,” Polian said in a statement Tuesday. “When Mr. Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all.
“The momentum generated by our players, coaches and football staff had us well positioned for future success. Regrettably, we will not have that opportunity.”
[…]
Players are being forced to pay for their own travel back home, a source told ESPN, confirming an SI.com report.
Despite a litany of issues, ratings had remained fairly consistent for the league, with between 400,000 and 500,000 viewers often tuning in for games, according to ratings reports. And the league got a bump in attention after Johnny Manziel signed last month and was allocated to Memphis.
Manziel offered some advice to AAF players on Twitter with Tuesday’s news.
The league signed all players to three-year, non-guaranteed contracts worth $70,000 in the first year, $80,000 in the second year and $100,000 in the third year. The hope, Polian said, was that the league would send players to the NFL.
In his statement Tuesday, Polian said he’ll do “all I can” to help the league’s players achieve that.
“My thanks go out to all who made our football product so competitive and professional,” Polian said. “I am certain there are many among them destined for future success in the NFL and I look forward to doing all I can to help them in their quest.”
Ebersol told ESPN in January that they had structured the league around a “sober business plan” because he believed he had learned lessons from his father, Dick Ebersol, who helped run the first version of the XFL.
Problems, however, popped up surrounding the nascent league that was trying to be a complement to the NFL.
See here for the background. The AAF had its challenges, but I thought they’d at least finish the season. Who knows, maybe they could have gotten an infusion of cash afterwards, and been able to keep going. I feel bad for the players, who of course will get screwed out of their last paychecks and stuck with hotel, travel, and healthcare expenses , and at a much lower level for the fans in San Antonio , the eternal bridesmaids of pro football fandom. Anyone wanna lay odds on how long the rebooted XFL will last? Related Posts:"
Iran Warns 'Idiotic' U.S. it Will 'Retaliate' if Republican Guards Designated as Terrorists,www.breitbart.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/04/07/iran-warns-idiotic-u-s-it-will-retaliate-if-republican-guards-designated-as-terrorists/," Iran Warns ‘Idiotic’ U.S. it Will ‘Retaliate’ if Republican Guards Designated as Terrorists AP Photo/Vahid Salemi SIMON KENT 7 Apr 2019 If Washington designates Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as terrorists then Tehran will immediately retailiate in kind, a majority of Iranian parliamentarians said on Sunday. The United States is expected to designate the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization, according to Reuters, marking the first time Washington has formally labeled another country’s military a terrorist group.
This has prompted an immediate response by 255 out of the 290 Iranian lawmakers, the domestic IRNA newsagency reported . They said:
We will answer any action taken against this force with a reciprocal action.
So the leaders of America, who themselves are the creators and supporters of terrorists in the (Middle East) region, will regret this inappropriate and idiotic action.
IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari warned in 2017 that if Trump went ahead with the long-anticipated move, “then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world”.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has advocated the change in U.S. policy as part of the Trump administration’s tough posture toward Tehran.
Dr. Sebastian Gorka, host of SALEM Radio’s National show AMERICA First, formerly Deputy Assistant to President Trump and Breitbart News National Security editor, appeared on Breitbart News Daily in 2017 and urged U.S. President Donald Trump to act against the IRGC.
“This is an organization that has cost the lives of scores of U.S. service men and women, that is a terrorist actor across the whole region,” Mr. Gorka charged.
If he did so, “Then he sends a very clear message that not only is this deal that we’ve inherited a disastrous deal, we are going to take the fight to the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world today. The designation of the IRGC would send that message.”
Established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi’ite clerical ruling system, the IRGC is Iran’s most powerful security organization. It has control over large sectors of the Iranian economy and has a huge influence in its political system.
