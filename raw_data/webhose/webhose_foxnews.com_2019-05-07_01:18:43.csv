Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx defends Jussie Smollett decision,www.foxnews.com,Jessica Sager,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-prosecutor-kim-foxx-defends-jussie-smollett-decision,"Last Update 10 hours ago Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx defends Jussie Smollett decision Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx defended her office's decision to dismiss charges against Jussie Smollett , claiming the ""Empire"" star didn't receive special treatment. ""I have been asking myself for the last two weeks what is this really about,"" Foxx said at the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr.'s Rainbow Push Coalition on Saturday. ""As someone who has lived in this city [Chicago], who came up in the projects of this city to serve as the first African American woman in this role, it is disheartening to me ... that when we get in these positions somehow the goalposts change.""
She also said she'd run for re-election when her current term is complete.
JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED HATE CRIME HOAX: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS
Foxx reportedly mentioned in her speech that she welcomes an independent investigation into her handling of the case, saying that nearly 6,000 other ""low-level defendants"" received the same treatment with deferred prosecution, adding that under the law, Smollett could've been fined a maximum of $10,000 — which he effectively paid when he forfeited his bond for the same amount.

Foxx recused herself from Smollett's case after communicating with one of his relatives during the police investigation into whether or not the musician and actor staged an alleged hate crime against himself. Her office later said she never actually formally recused herself from the case.
DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER DEFENDS JUSSIE SMOLLETT, LORI LOUGHLIN
Smollett's attorney said that his case was not one of deferred prosecution when she announced that the charges against him had been dropped.
In January, Smollett told police that two masked men attacked him, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. The actor, who is black and openly gay, said the masked men beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled, "" This is MAGA country "" before fleeing the scene.

However, the Chicago Police Department alleged that Smollett paid the two men, Abel and Ola Osundairo , by check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career."" The brothers were allegedly caught on surveillance footage purchasing the rope used in the staged ""attack"" on Smollett.
JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S DEADLINE TO REPAY INVESTIGATIVE COSTS LOOMS
The ""Sum of my Music"" singer was later arrested for allegedly filing a false police report and released on a $10,000 bond . Smollett pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of disorderly conduct stemming from the alleged hoax. All charges against Smollett were dropped in late March in a move that legal experts claimed was ""almost unheard of.""
Still, the star isn't entirely out of the woods yet: The FBI is investigating whether Smollett sent himself a threatening hate letter to the ""Empire"" set, which could potentially land him behind bars for a decade for mail fraud — a federal offense.

Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal. His attorneys previously told Fox News they've ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

While House Democrats have stymied many of President Trump’s plans, the party has had mixed results with its agenda since taking control due to the White House and Senate still sitting in Republican hands.

""Rommel"" the bloodhound was renamed after people complained the dog shared its name with a general who served under Adolf Hitler. (Lake County Sheriff's Office) ""Rommel,"" a sheriff's office bloodhound, was renamed after the office got complaints the dog shared a name with a general who served under Adolf Hitler . Announcing the news of its newest pal on Friday, the Lake County Sheriff's Office (LCSO) welcomed young ""Rommel"" on Twitter .
""He is a 10 week old liver colored bloodhound now assigned to Master Deputy Meintzschel,"" the department wrote . ""Rommel will soon begin his rigorous training to support the community by locating missing persons, fugitives, and evidence. Welcome aboard Rommel!""
However, some followers of the sheriff's office soon connected the dog's name to Erwin Rommel, a senior officer in the German Army who had commanded Adolf Hitler's military protection unit. He also led German troops sent to North Africa during World War II and killed himself in 1944 rather than face trial after he was linked to a plot to kill Hitler.

Protest and celebration in Brazil on Lula prison anniversary,www.foxnews.com,ANNA JEAN KAISER,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/protest-and-celebration-in-brazil-on-lula-prison-anniversary,"Da Silva is serving a 12-year sentence on a corruption and money laundering conviction. Prosecutors say he received a beachfront apartment from a construction company in exchange for a lucrative contract with the state-owned oil company Petrobras. He and his Worker&apos;s Party maintain he is innocent and say he was persecuted by the judiciary and political enemies to prevent him from running for president again. His imprisonment is at the center of a deeply polarizing debate between Brazilians who see him as a political prisoner for championing the poor and others who believe justice is being served for a corrupt politician.
Fernando Haddad, who ran for president in da Silva&apos;s place and lost a November runoff election to far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro, spoke at the rally outside the federal police station that is holding da Silva, who is widely known to Brazilians as Lula.
The country&apos;s elites ""wouldn&apos;t stop until they put possibly one of the worst Brazilians in the presidency and put one of the best Brazilians in prison,"" Haddad told protesters.
""Lula has been kidnapped by the bourgeoisie,"" said another speaker, João Pedro Stedile, a leader from the far-left Landless Workers Movement. ""The ransom is for us to stop fighting. They want to bring the Brazilian people to their knees.""
Protester Beth Dori, 65, called da Silva&apos;s arrest unjust. ""They did this so they could do what they&apos;re doing now with social security and workers&apos; rights laws,"" she said, referring to unpopular austerity measures taken on after the Worker&apos;s Party was no longer in power.
Meanwhile, on the boardwalk of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s Copacabana Beach, a rally supporting the attack on corruption cheered da Silva&apos;s continued incarceration.
""Today marks one whole year that Lula hasn&apos;t stolen!"" a protester yelled from the top of a sound car while the crowd applauded.
""I&apos;m very happy to see he&apos;s stayed in prison a whole year, and one year is nothing compared to what he&apos;s done to the Brazilian people,"" said Jose Elias, 67, a retired farm worker. ""Lula and the Worker&apos;s Party ruined this country with their corrupt, leftist mess.""
Da Silva is the most prominent figure jailed in an anti-corruption investigation called ""Operation Car Wash"" that has snared dozens of prominent politicians and business figures.
Anti-corruption demonstrators also demanded the continued take-down of ""old politicians,"" calling for the arrest of other corrupt politicians and applauding the judiciary that is going after them.
""I&apos;m here to call for the impeachment of the corrupt Supreme Court. As long as the court is corrupt, Lula and other corrupt politicians have a chance to be free,"" said Yasmin Albudane, a 24-year-old university student.

Nielsen met with Trump at the White House Sunday amid an ongoing influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border that has been taxing America&apos;s immigration system and sparking frustration within the administration. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.
Administration sources told Fox News Sunday evening that Nielsen&apos;s background in cybersecurity made her a poor fit to handle border issues, while McAleenan best fits Trump&apos;s requirement of being the ""toughest cop"" on the frontier.
Nielsen: Trump will take every action within his authority to stop flow of illegal immigrants Department of Homeland Security Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen addresses the ongoing migrant crisis at the southern border on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'
Nielsen skipped last week&apos;s meeting of interior ministers from the Group of Seven countries (G-7) in Paris to deal with the migration crisis, which she compared to the aftermath of a Category 5 hurricane.
She also had taken to social media in recent days, tweeting that Congress must give border and immigration officials the tools and resources needed to ""fulfill our humanitarian and security mission.""
Nielsen visited El Paso, Texas, on Wednesday, marking her first stop on a border tour aimed at assessing the surge of migrants and the department&apos;s response. ""Our system and facilities were never structured to withstand the current influx of immigrants,"" she said.
On Friday, Nielsen and Trump participated in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed Trump&apos;s comments on the situation at the border, though she ducked out of the room without explanation for some time while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers, Nielsen was at Trump&apos;s side, introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward on a Coast Guard Gulfstream, as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.
Trump nominated Nielsen as Homeland Security secretary in October 2017, replacing her former boss John Kelly, whom Trump had named White House chief of staff months earlier. She was confirmed by the Senate in December of that year.

Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides, particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller, both around the border and on other matters like protected status for some refugees. A senior administration official told Fox News Sunday that National Security Adviser John Bolton long felt that Nielsen was not the right person for the job and opposed her policy of using United Nations organizations to try to stem the flow of illegal migrants.
The official added that Bolton and Kelly had a heated disagreement over Nielsen&apos;s approach during an October 2018 policy meeting, after which Bolton went to Trump to protest what Nielsen was doing.
Once Kelly left the White House at the end of last year, Nielsen&apos;s days appeared to be numbered. She had expected to be pushed out last November, but her exit never materialized. And during the government shutdown over Trump&apos;s push for funding for a border wall, Nielsen&apos;s stock inside the White House even appeared to rise.
Trump nominated McAleenan as CBP commissioner on the first day of his presidency, but McAleenan was not confirmed by the Senate until March of 2018. He was appointed CBP deputy commissioner in November 2014 by President Barack Obama.
Sources tell Fox News that it remains to be seen whether McAleenan can handle the political duties required to be permanent homeland security secretary, though they noted that he has excellent relationships with the Pentagon, State Department, and National Security Council. McAleenan also has a reputation within CBP as a ""brilliant"" mind with ""tremendous organizational skills.""
Nielsen&apos;s departure is the latest staffing shakeup in the department, which was founded to combat terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
On Friday, Trump confirmed he had withdrawn the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Ron Vitiello to become the permanent head of the agency, telling reporters that ""Ron’s a good man, but we’re going in a tougher direction, we want to go in a tougher direction."" Administration sources tell Fox News that the withdrawal of Vitiello&apos;s nomination was the first step in Trump&apos;s plan to control the border crisis.
The second step was asking for Nielsen&apos;s resignation.

Carrie Underwood dazzles on 2019 ACM red carpet after revealing ‘bounce back’ struggles following child birth,www.foxnews.com,Julius Young,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carrie-underwood-dazzles-on-2019-acm-red-carpet-after-revealing-bounce-back-struggles-following-child-birth,"The “Jesus, Take The Wheel” singer arrived at the star-studded affair donning a shimmering over-the-shoulder black and gray sequin dress complete with two thigh slits that left both of her toned legs exposed.
Carrie Underwood arrives at the 54th annual Academy of Country Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Sunday, April 7, 2019, in Las Vegas.
Underwood looked confident despite sharing in an Instagram post last month where described in a lengthy note to her followers the difficult time she’s had “bouncing back” after giving birth to her second son Jacob on January 21 – just two months ago.
“I’m going to be honest, “bouncing back” after having Jacob has been much more difficult than after I had Isaiah and I’ve been pretty hard on myself lately. I go into the gym and I can’t run as fast or as far,” the “Before He Cheats” songstress wrote.
“I can’t lift as much weight or do as many reps as I could a year ago. I just want to feel like myself again...for my body to feel the way that I know it can. As I was working out today, I realized that for the past 11(ish) months, my body has not belonged to me. It was a perfect home for Jacob. And even now it belongs to him every time he drinks his milk.”
However, despite how difficult it’s been, the singer made a pledge to fans to stop over-analyzing her every flaw and appreciate what she is able to do in the wake of her recent pregnancy.
“As I prepare for red carpets and for life on tour, right now I make a promise to myself to start appreciating what my body CAN do and stop focusing on what it can’t. I promise to stop analyzing every angle and every curve and every pound and every meal,” the seven-time Grammy Award-winner told her fans. “I’m going to keep staying the path because it is a journey and as long as I’m always working towards my goals, one day I’ll reach them. I’m going to take it day by day, smile at the girl in the mirror, and work out because I love this body and all it has done and will continue to do!”
Underwood, who is slated to perform at the country music celebration is nominated for female vocalist at the 2019 ACM Awards.

Former acting ICE Director Tom Homan: Trump made the right move picking McAleenan for DHS,www.foxnews.com,Frank Miles,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ice-tom-homan-thinks-trump-made-the-right-move-putting-mcaleenan-in-charge-of-homeland-security,"Homan, a Fox News contributor, called McAleenan one of the smartest men with whom he has worked. “He knows border issues, and he can hit the ground running,” Homan told Jon Scott on “Fox Report.” “He knows the border... he will start day one.”
Nielsen resigned on Sunday amid the administration’s growing frustration over migrants approaching the Mexico border.
Video Trump thanked her for her work in a tweet and announced McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department. McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well-respected by members of Congress and within the administration. The decision to name an immigration officer to the post reflects Trump’s priority for a sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.
Homan said he blamed Congress and current U.S. law for the border crisis: “We are enticing people to come.”
However, he noted that McAleenan was the kind of man who could tackle the new wave of migration, which has taxed resources along the border.
“He will think outside the box,” Homan said. “Kevin will put his foot on the gas.”

Michael Bennet on cancer diagnosis: 'I don’t see this stopping me' from 2020 run,www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-bennet-on-cancer-diagnosis-i-dont-see-this-stopping-me,"The two-term Colorado Democrat – who announced last week that he recently was diagnosed with prostate cancer – told Fox News, “I feel really lucky. It was caught early and this is a really treatable form of cancer and we have insurance. I think I’m going to be fine. I hope I will because I really want to have the opportunity to run in 2020.” Bennet was interviewed Sunday as he campaigned in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.
Pointing to then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts – the 2004 Democratic nominee who had successful cancer surgery at the onset of his presidential campaign – Bennet, 54, said, “John was 59 when he had the same operation. He had it and two weeks later he was in California, doing what he needed to do out there to campaign. So I take this seriously, but if all goes well I don’t see this stopping me.”
Bennet didn’t bring up his diagnosis during a question-and-answer session with the Rockingham County Democrats that lasted over an hour, but members of the crowd wished him well.
“I don’t feel the need to bring it up myself. I’m glad to talk about it if people want to raise it,” he told Fox News.
The diagnosis apparently hasn’t slowed Bennet down on the campaign trail. The Exeter event was the second to last in a jam-packed two-day swing through New Hampshire. On Monday he’s headed to Iowa, which votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar.
Bennet, who said he had planned to declare his candidacy for president this month, explained that he hoped to jump into the White House race a few weeks after next week’s surgery, if he gets a clean bill of health.

That wouldn’t leave a lot of time for Bennet to make the stage at the first round of Democratic presidential primary debates, set for late June.
“We’ve made it a little bit harder on myself although I wouldn’t have asked for this issue,” he explained. “I think it’s important to be on the debate stage, whether it’s the first debate or the second debate, however you’re able to do it, and we will work to get on there. I don’t want to make excuses for it, but we slowed down a little bit.”
When Bennet likely jumps into the race, he’ll be facing off against a large field of Democratic contenders (it currently stands at 17), many with bigger name ID and bigger campaign war chests. And there’s already a candidate from Colorado in the race. The state’s former two-term governor – John Hickenlooper – launched his campaign last month.
Many of the leading contenders are supporters of the single-payer “Medicare for All” health care proposal, a top wish-list item for the progressive base of the Democratic Party.
However, Bennet isn’t endorsing “Medicare for All.” Instead, he teamed up with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia to come up with a plan called “Medicare-X” which would establish a public option for people maintaining their private insurance.
“I wouldn’t even call it extreme or left wing or too progressive or any of that stuff,” Bennet said when asked about “Medicare for All.” “I know people out there want to have a public option to compete with private insurance. I know they want to have a choice and I know they don’t want to be dictated by the federal government what that choice has to be. That’s how I developed the idea for &apos;Medicare X.&apos;”
He touted that his plan is “more achievable.”
And, pointing to President Trump’s efforts to scrap ObamaCare, Bennet argued that “we have a president who has spent his administration trying to take health care away from millions of Americans.”
Bennet, who served as superintendent of the Denver public school system before first winning election to the U.S. Senate in 2010, highlighted his push to reform education.
“This will make me unelectable but I’ll say it on the first day – I think kids should go to school six days a week. And, I don’t think they should go to school nine months a year. I think they should go to school off and on year-round,” Bennet told the crowd.
He highlighted that year-round school would narrow the achievement gap, saying that “in the summertime the more affluent kids gain proficiency, the less affluent kids lose proficiency.”
He also stressed that “this is a place with a lot of low hanging fruit where we can make an enormous difference... with some very smart strategic (federal) funding, we can revolutionize community colleges in this country and we could change dramatically what we’re doing in K-12.”
Bennet also urged that Democrats “need a president and leadership in Washington that’s as strategic as” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
“It’s not about nice. That guy is not nice. But it’s about following through on what he’s trying to do,” he said of the longtime Republican senator from Kentucky. “We need to be as strategic as McConnell.”
But he added, “I do not believe that we need to be as ruthless as McConnell.”

While this isn’t the first time Lambert, 35, has sung the updated rendition of the hit record, she has never done so with Shelton present – seemingly shading the “Voice” judge in front of his longtime girlfriend Gwen Stefani in the process.
Viewers quickly went to social media to share their reactions to Lambert’s diss with many applauding the songstress, while others voiced their displeasure calling it a low blow.

“If @mirandalambert is over Blake why take that dig. Don&apos;t forget at one time he was your sun and moon and you sure did have huge success with a song he wrote. I guess people in Oklahoma shouldnt support you as well right. You just dissed the entire state,” one Twitter user wrote.
Another user echoed the same sentiments, writing “That was a classless move towards Blake, no reason for that. #bitterness #getoverit.”
However, not everyone was dismayed with the “Over You” singer. One Twitter user said they related to Lambert’s expressive display, tweeting “When @mirandalambert said “I got the hell out of Oklahoma” with Blake in the room. I felt that. I may have screamed a little.”
“Miranda Lambert throwing shade at BS is why she will ALWAYS be the queen,” wrote another user.
Lambert announced on Valentine&apos;s Day that she secretly “got hitched” to New York City police officer Brenden McLoughlin , 27, though the pair have been scrutinized for their nuptials ever since as the “Pistol Annies” singer had only split from boyfriend Evan Felker in August 2018. Before that, she&apos;d rebounded from Shelton with rocker Anderson East. Lambert and East split in April 2018.
It’s unclear how long Lambert and McLoughlin had been dating before they wed, but the country crooner absolutely did not want to talk about her new marriage when she was asked about her newfound love two weeks after making the announcement.
""Please — can you leave me alone please?"" the Pistol Annie singer told Inside Edition. ""If I say something, will you leave please?""
She added, ""Like &apos;the world should mind their own f—king business.&apos;""

Hendricks, who sent over several other songs for Shelton to listen to, encouraged the singer to consider the rest of the singles, a recommendation Shelton declined.

Attorneys will continue questioning potential jurors in the case Monday. Mohamed Noor is charged with murder and manslaughter in the 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual Australian-U.S. citizen who was shot when she approached his squad car.
Attorneys spent last week paring a pool of 75. If they settle Monday on a panel of 12 jurors and four alternates, opening statements and testimony would follow.
The judge is considering a media request to allow access to graphic evidence shown to the jury. Noor has joined the challenge to evidence restrictions. Trending in US"

Bolsonaro's administration is considering a dramatic change in the council that oversees Brazil’s environmental policy, replacing a broad-based group stocked with independent voices with a small group of presidential appointees, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres, File) MADRID – The administration of President Jair Bolsonaro is considering a dramatic change in the council that oversees Brazil's environmental policy, replacing a broad-based panel of independent voices with a small group of political appointees, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. Activists say they fear the move, which reflects Bolsonaro's oft-stated skepticism about environmental organizations, could lead to more deforestation and less oversight in the nation that holds about 60% of the vast Amazon rainforest, which scientists see as crucial for efforts to slow global warming and for the world climate systems.
A policy roadmap drafted by Bolsonaro's transition team before he took office Jan. 1 proposes a decree creating a ""government council"" to replace Brazil's National Council of the Environment, which has almost 100 members, including representatives of independent environmental and business groups. The new body would consist of five presidential appointees plus Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, who is one of the authors of the plan.
The documents, first published by the Brazilian Climate Observatory environmental group, were obtained and verified by the AP.
Brazil's Environment Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
Part of the transition plan has already come into force. The country's forestry service, aimed at promoting ""knowledge, sustainable use and widening of forestry coverage,"" was transferred to the Agriculture Ministry on Bolsonaro's second day in office. On the same day, the Agriculture Ministry was given the power to determine the limits of indigenous lands, rather than Brazil's official indigenous rights agency.
As a congressman and candidate, Bolsonaro often questioned the reality of climate change and cast environmental groups as foreign-influenced meddlers restraining Brazil's economic growth by holding back mining and agriculture — stances that resemble those of U.S. President Donald Trump, who before taking office described the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a ""disgrace"" that largely should be dismantled.
The authors of Bolsonaro's transition plan say the current Environment Council, known as CONAMA, is a ""confusing"" body that ""acts emotionally, without due technique, being subjected to ideological interference.""
In another transition team document, lawyer Antonio Fernando Pinheiro Pedro argues that CONAMA's decisions have led to ""the emission of norms and standards that are far from reality.""
In an interview shortly after his election, Bolsonaro complained that it could sometimes take a decade to get an environmental license. ""That will not continue,"" he said.
While officials haven't yet formally proposed the smaller council, there has already been increased friction over CONAMA. Security guards blocked alternate members of the council from joining the main meeting at a March 20 session in the capital of Brasilia, breaking a long tradition of wide-open debate in Brazil's top environmental council.
Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, which includes several nonprofit groups, said he believes that chaotic meeting was ""more evidence that the plan (for a smaller council) is indeed being implemented.""
""Deforestation ended 2018 on the rise. It is on the rise in 2019, but we haven't heard a word from the minister about that. We have heard about limiting the access to civil society so we can't have a fair discussion,"" Rittl said.
Former Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero speculated the new administration may have delayed creating the new council due to public anger over the collapse of a mine dam near the city of Brumadinho in January that killed at least 223 people, with 70 still missing.
Ricupero noted that Bolsonaro's chief of staff suggested closing the environmental ministry during the campaign, but said that the powerful agribusiness lobby is afraid such a move would damage trade and has prevented any such move.
""Then Brumadinho showed that our problem is not excessive care in environmental licensing — it is the lack of it,"" Ricupero said.
He added that hopes Bolsonaro would engage with environmentalists have not come to pass.
Bolsonaro recently defended his environmental ideas at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying that Brazil ""is the country that most preserves the environment"" and that ""those that criticize us actually have a lot to learn from us.""
The Bolsonaro transition plan also suggested closing the federal agency that oversees conservation zones such as national parks and biological reserves and issues fines for violation of environmental laws there. Many of those penalties are never paid, but several Brazilian agribusiness leaders have complained about them over the years.
Pinheiro Pedro, the transition team lawyer, wrote that the agency should be folded into the Environment Institute, which enforces other environmental legislation and aims to promote the sustainable the use of natural resources. He said the two have ""the same objective"" and streamlining environmental governance is key to ""avoid international interference.""
Rittl, of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, said he believes that change would reduce oversight in key areas by diluting the focus of regulators.
Environmentalists also took umbrage at the language used in the transition documents, though the tone echoes Bolsonaro's own pronouncements.
The plan says NGOs involved in climate change discussions are ""uncontrollable organisms"" that need to be stopped so the system is ""closer to ministerial control."" It also contends Brazil's environmental governance is crafted to give jobs to political appointees, describing that as ""a risk to national sovereignty.""
Emilio Bruna, a tropical ecologist focused on the Amazon who is based at the University of Florida, said the transition plan shows the ""worst fears"" about Bolsonaro's presidency ""are starting to come true.""
""Scientists are not only concerned about the government not creating new protected areas, but also the downgrading of existing protections in the rainforest,"" he said. ""There was already a culture of impunity, but now it's being reinforced.""

FILE - In a Jan. 9, 2019 file photo, Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch speaks in the House of Delegates chamber in Annapolis, Md., the first day of the state's 2019 legislative session. Busch died Sunday, April 7, 2019 surrounded by loved ones, according to Alexandra Hughes, the speaker’s chief of staff. He was 72. (Associated Press) Michael Busch, a champion of the Chesapeake Bay and progressive causes during his record-tenure as Maryland 's Democratic House speaker, battled for the environment up until the end of his life. He died Sunday at age 72. His environmental policies were especially high-profile in his final days as he sponsored a bill to permanently protect five oyster sanctuaries under Maryland law. The measure drew a veto from Gov. Larry Hogan , but the House overrode the veto Friday, and the Senate was expected to vote on an override Monday — the last day of the legislative session.
Bush died after developing pneumonia arising from a follow-up procedure to a 2017 liver transplant after being diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a liver disease. He also had heart bypass surgery in September, after experiencing shortness of breath. Chief of staff Alexandra Hughes said Busch died surrounded by loved ones.
EX-MARYLAND GOV. HARRY R. HUGHES DIES AT 92; SERVED 2 TERMS
Alison Prost, the Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, praised Busch's legacy of defending the waterway's fragile ecosystem.
""The Chesapeake Bay lost a champion today,"" Prost said. ""While there were many issues that were near and dear to Speaker Busch, he elevated saving the Bay to a priority for the General Assembly, and legislators followed his lead."" ""The Chesapeake Bay lost a champion today. While there were many issues that were near and dear to Speaker Busch, he elevated saving the Bay to a priority for the General Assembly, and legislators followed his lead."" — Alison Prost, Maryland executive director, Chesapeake Bay Foundation
Busch also fought for expanded health care, educational improvements and other issues as Maryland's longest-serving House speaker. He was elected to the speakership in 2003.
""Nobody has done more to expand health care access and improve public health in Maryland than Speaker Mike Busch,"" said Vincent DeMarco, president of Maryland Citizens' Health Initiative.
A progressive Democrat, Busch as speaker oversaw Maryland's approval of same-sex marriage and the repeal of the death penalty. Legislation raising the state's minimum wage was passed twice under his House leadership.
Maryland Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller called Busch a model delegate who cared for every corner of the state.
""My heart is broken for Mike Busch's family, the State of Maryland, and the Speaker's extended family — elected officials and staff that he has been a mentor and coach to over his time in public service,"" said Miller, a Democrat who has been battling prostate cancer. ""Mike has been a friend for years, and has led the state to new heights of environmentalism and education.""
Hogan, a Republican, ordered flags flown at half-staff for Busch, calling him ""a giant in our government.""
""Speaker Busch and I came from different sides of the aisle, but we often came together in the best interests of the people of Maryland,"" Hogan said. ""He served with the decency and good nature of a teacher, a coach, and a family man. I was honored to ... work closely with him.""
It's unclear when the House will choose Busch's successor. The speaker is elected by the 141 House members. Since Busch's absence last month, Del. Adrienne Jones has presided as speaker pro tem.
Busch was first elected to the House in 1986. His district included the state capital of Annapolis, making him a frequent presence in the State House — even when the General Assembly wasn't in session.
He was known as a consensus builder and good listener, qualities that helped him manage the diverse chamber.
Busch had a strong commitment to equal rights that resulted from growing up in the 1960s during the height of the civil rights movement against racial segregation.
""That was ingrained in me from my grandparents to my parents and through the '60s,"" he told The Associated Press in 2002.
At the time, he recalled two pictures on his grandparents' mantel — Jesus and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Both sets of grandparents ""believed that Roosevelt gave average people a piece of the American dream,"" he said. ""I really believe government is there to give people opportunity.""
Busch, a Catholic, was born in Baltimore, and lived in Anne Arundel County from age 10 until he left for college.
He was a record-setting running back at Temple University in 1969, peaking in his junior year when he ran for 185 yards in a game. But for a leg injury, he might have pursued a pro career. The Dallas Cowboys sent him a letter telling him ""you are being considered by our ball club as one of our top draft choices,"" but the team didn't know his career was already over.

After getting a degree in education, he returned home and taught in public and parochial schools. He was a football and basketball coach at St. Mary's High School in Annapolis before quitting teaching in 1979.
His interest in politics was whetted in 1982 when he was a driver for Robert Pascal, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor. Busch finished fifth among 12 Democrats running for three House seats that year, then won in 1986.

Michael Callahan of Winchester was booked on the charges in the death of California Highway Patrol Sgt. Steve Licon, said Officer Steve Carapia.
Callahan is suspected of driving drunk Saturday afternoon when he crossed over the right shoulder of Interstate 15 in Lake Elsinore, crashing into Licon and a car he had pulled over for speeding.
Licon died at a nearby hospital. The family of four in the car he had pulled over weren&apos;t hurt.
It&apos;s unclear if Callahan has an attorney. Inmate records show he has a court appearance set for Wednesday.
Investigators believe the recommendation of a murder charge in the case is ""completely appropriate,"" said Mario Lucio, special services commander of CHP&apos;s Inland division.
""We have uncovered evidence which shows gross negligence both during and before this tragic collision,"" Lucio said at a Sunday news conference.
He declined to explain what the evidence was. Ultimately, prosecutors will decide what charges to file.
Licon was a 27-year veteran of the agency and is survived by his wife, daughter and stepdaughter.
Licon&apos;s body was taken to the coroner&apos;s office in a slow and somber procession on Saturday night.
Acting Gov. Eleni Kounalakis ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the state Capitol, and the California Highway Patrol is holding a bell tribute ceremony in his honor on Monday.
Carapia, who knew Licon for six years, said the sergeant was well-liked and known for his work ethic and a distinct and quirky high-pitched laugh.
""He had a great sense of humor,"" Carapia said. ""You could hear him laughing from the sergeant&apos;s office. You could hear him coming down the hallway ... Just an all-around great human being.""
He said Licon loved his job and the fact that his office was on a motorcycle.
""This is a tough one,"" he said. ""It hits you to the core.""
Lucio said Licon used to be his sergeant when he was coming up in the agency and helped shape his career and that of many other younger officers.
""He loved mentoring the troops,"" Lucio said. ""The guy really spent time developing the officers he supervised.""
He said the sergeant&apos;s death should be a strong reminder to the public that drinking and driving is never acceptable.
""We lost a darned good sergeant,"" he said. ""He&apos;s going to be missed.""
Police departments and officers across the state took to social media to post about Licon.
CHP Commissioner Warren Stanley said Licon was a great leader ""who sacrificed his life serving the people of California.""
CHP Headquarters tweeted that ""our hearts are heavy ... Rest easy brother, we have the watch from here."""
Ardern names judge to head royal inquiry into mosque attack | Fox News,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ardern-names-judge-to-head-royal-inquiry-into-mosque-attack,"The Royal Commission of Inquiry will look into the gunman&apos;s activities before the attack, including how he obtained a gun license in New Zealand and purchased weapons and ammunition, and his use of social media and possible connections with others in New Zealand or overseas. ""The Government will ensure no stone is left unturned as we examine as quickly as possible how the March 15 attack happened, what could have been done to stop it and how we can keep New Zealanders safe,"" Ardern said Monday in announcing the terms of the inquiry. ""The Royal Commission plays a critical role in our ongoing response to fully understand what happened in the lead-up to the attack and to ensure such an attack never happens again.""
The commission led by Sir William Young will have a budget of 8.2 million New Zealand dollars ($5.5 million) and will be expected to report its findings to the government by Dec. 10.
Ardern praised Young as having the extensive experience and skills required to lead the inquiry. ""I am confident that in his nearly nine years as a judge on our highest bench, Justice Young has the judgment, clarity and care to do the job, with a sound understanding of intelligence issues and experience working in the public eye.""
The commission will examine the actions of agencies including the Security Intelligence Service, Government Communications Security Bureau, New Zealand Police, customs and immigration, including what they knew about the gunman before the attack, what they did in response and what they could have done to prevent the attack.
It will question whether security agencies properly prioritized the use of their counter-terrorism resources. Critics have alleged the agencies focused on possible Islamic extremism but did not give enough priority to white extremism.
An Australian white supremacist, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, livestreamed the shootings and released an online manifesto in which he described planning the attacks at the two mosques in Christchurch. He was charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 of attempted murder and was ordered last week to undergo mental health assessments before his next court appearance in June.
A royal commission is the country&apos;s highest form of investigation and is run independently from the government. The commission has the power to compel witnesses to testify and organizations to hand over documents.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, second from right, walks out with San Salvador Mayor Ernesto Muyshondtof, far left, after they visited the tomb of Archbishop Oscar Romero at Metropolitan Cathedral in San Salvador, El Salvador. (Associated Press) California Gov. Gavin Newsom arrived in El Salvador on Sunday to begin a four-day trip to learn more about the root causes fueling migration to the U.S. and offer an alternative to what he regards as President Trump’s “demoralizing” rhetoric about the Central American nation . The trip comes on the heels of President Trump’s Friday visit to California’s stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. Newsom criticized Trump’s recent move to cut direct aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, nations who’ve seen many of their citizens flee north through Mexico in efforts to enter the U.S.
“Right now you have a president that talks down to people, talks past them, demoralizing folks living here and their relatives in the United States,” Newsom told reporters. “I think it’s important to let folks know that’s not our country — that’s an individual in our country who happens at this moment to be president.”
NEW MIGRANT CARAVAN OF 2,500 SETS OUT THROUGH MEXICO FOR US
Newsom , 51, a Democrat who took office in January after being elected in November to the top job in the nation’s most populous state, has taken the Trump administration to task on immigration, having sued over the president’s emergency declaration to build a southern border wall and pledging $25 million in state money to help asylum seekers .
Previously, Newsom and Trump battled on social media over costs associated with massive wildfires in California. Soon after Newsom took office, Trump argued that the state needed better forest management so the state would be less reliant on federal dollars for fire recovery.
“Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forrest fires that, with proper Forrest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!” Trump wrote.
Newsom’s office said the governor chose El Salvador for his first international trip because California is home to approximately 680,000 Salvadorans – the largest Salvadoran immigrant population in the U.S.
On Sunday, he visited the tomb of Saint Oscar Romero – the Salvadoran priest assassinated in 1980 at the start of the nation’s civil war – where he lit a candle and kneeled to pray.
Newsom will meet with President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, U.S. Ambassador Jean Manes and President-elect Nayib Bukele during his visit. He’ll also tour a reintegration center that processes Salvadorans deported from the U.S. and Mexico , see a cultural demonstration in a rural town, meet with human rights groups and discuss economic development and gang intervention.
Newsom said he’s figuring out what California can do to help tackle the root causes of migration, namely deep poverty and gang violence. El Salvador is one of the world’s most violent countries, with the gangs MS-13 and Barrio 18 exerting strong control.
MEXICO TO HAND OUT SOME HUMANITARIAN VISAS AS THOUSANDS OF CARAVAN MIGRANTS GATHER IN CHIAPAS
Republicans in California criticized Newsom’s purported aims, arguing that he should instead focus on poverty at home.
“The tragic circumstances that drive migrants from their homes should remind us that we have people living in crushing poverty in our own communities. Our attention and resources should be focused there,” Republican state Assemblyman Devon Mathis said in a statement.
Matt Fleming, a spokesman for the California Republican Party cited by the Sacramento Bee , said Newsom “should spend less time raising his national profile and more time in California serving the people who elected him.”
Newsom has defended the trip on the grounds that immigration is, more than in any other state, fundamental to California’s politics.
“How do you understand California without understanding all the diverse cultures that make it the most diverse state?” he said. “It’s fundamental, it seems to me, to governing a state. That’s why I’m here in the first months.”

Newsom said he hopes to show Salvadorans there’s “a completely different conversation” happening in the United States outside of Trump’s comments.
“There are people in the U.S. who think folks down here matter and we care to understand their plight and challenges and see if there’s ways we can soften things,” he said.

"Trump aides targeted in corporate blacklist effort by immigration, civil rights groups",www.foxnews.com,Bradford Betz,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/immigration-civil-rights-groups-pressure-fortune-500-companies-to-blacklist-former-trump-officials,"Trump aides targeted in corporate blacklist effort by immigration, civil rights groups Immigration and civil rights groups recently sent a list to the CEOs of American companies urging them not to hire Trump officials who were involved in last year's separation of migrant children from their families. As outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen looks for her next job following her resignation Sunday , she may find herself battling a liberal blacklisting effort against those who've served in the Trump administration. Nielsen's name appears on a list that a cabal of immigration and civil rights groups recently sent to the CEOs of American companies , urging them not to hire Trump officials who were involved in last year's separation of migrant children from their families.
Other current and former Trump administration officials targeted include John Kelly , the former White House chief of staff, and Sarah Sanders , the current White House press secretary.
MODERATE DEMS FUME OVER OCASIO-CORTEZ 'LIST THREAT
""Some of these individuals have left the administration in recent months,"" the letter to the CEOs states . ""Regardless of when they leave, they should not be allowed to seek refuge in your boardrooms or corner offices. Allowing them to step off the revolving door and into your welcoming arms should be a nonstarter.""
The letter was made public Friday, but was dated Saturday to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the ""zero tolerance"" border policy announced by then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
That policy led to the separation of more than 2,000 migrant children from their families at the border -- as well as an outpouring of condemnation . Ultimately, the Trump administration reversed the policy.
IDENTIFYING CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM FAMILIES AT BORDER COULD TAKE UP TO 2 YEARS, US SAYS
The letter was signed by 41 immigration and civil rights groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center , which has targeted Nielsen in the past.
That Montgomery, Ala., organization, which frequently targets conservative organizations and individuals, has itself come under fire in recent months over allegations of sexual misconduct and racial discrimination within its ranks that have prompted the resignations of several top executives.
The coalition targeting the Trump administration officials also purchased an ad in Sunday’s New York Times that read: Attention Corporate America: Don’t let hate into your boardroom.” The ad features a MAGA-like hat emblazoned with the slogan “Put Kids In Cages.”
The campaign was organized by Restore Public Trust, a predominantly Democratic public-interest group. Spokesman Karl Frisch told Bloomberg that the letter serves as a warning to corporations that hire former Trump administration officials.
He said that companies “need to think twice about what that will mean for their brand to be associating with somebody who is responsible for one of the most horrific policies this administration put forward and that speaks volumes.”

Ugandan police said Kim Endicott, from California, and her Ugandan driver were both safe, after the five-day ordeal during which they were taken from Queen Elizabeth National Park across the border to Congo.
Police said that no ransom was paid, although the kidnappers had demanded $500,000 after grabbing Endicott and her driver from a group of tourists on an evening game drive on April 2.
However, a tour official says a ransom was paid to secure Endicott's freedom.

Q&A: A look at the latest fighting in Libya,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/qa-a-look-at-the-latest-fighting-in-libya,"The battle for Tripoli could ignite civil war on the scale of the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. That conflict left behind a patchwork of local, tribal and Islamist militias governing various fiefdoms, often through extortion and brute force. It also transformed Libya into a haven for extremists and a major conduit for migrants making perilous journeys to Europe. Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, who has spent the last few years battling Islamic militants in eastern Libya, presents himself as a strong hand that can unify the country and rid it of extremists. But his opponents view him as another would-be strongman in the mold of Gadhafi.
HOW DID LIBYA GET HERE?
Inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings sweeping the region, Libyans rose up in February 2011 against Gadhafi, who responded with a fierce military crackdown. As the uprising quickly escalated into a civil war, Gadhafi massed tanks outside the eastern city of Benghazi and threatened to massacre the protesters street by street.
NATO responded with a bombing campaign against Gadhafi&apos;s forces, and eventually provided close air support to a loose alliance of rebel militias, helping them to drive him from power. The rebels captured Gadhafi in his home city of Sirte in October 2011 and killed him, later releasing video footage of him being beaten and humiliated.
Libya held free elections the following year, but the government was powerless to control the vast array of militias, and the democratic transition stalled. Fighting erupted in Tripoli in the summer of 2014, leaving the international airport largely destroyed and resulting in separate governments in the capital and in eastern Libya, each backed by various armed groups.
In 2015, the U.N. backed the formation of a transitional government in Tripoli, in the west, under the leadership of technocrat Fayez Sarraj. A separate government, based in the east and allied with Hifter, has rejected its authority.
___
WHO IS HIFTER?
Hifter helped Gadhafi seize power in a 1969 coup against the monarchy and rose through the ranks of the military, eventually commanding Libyan forces in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. But his reputation was left in tatters by Libya&apos;s disastrous defeat in the war with Chad in the 1980s, in which he was among thousands captured.
As the war wound down, he defected and joined the armed opposition to Gadhafi, orchestrating a number of failed coup attempts. He eventually relocated to the Washington, D.C. area, where he lived in exile for 20 years, leading to widespread speculation that he worked with the CIA.
He returned to Libya in 2011 and commanded forces during the uprising against Gadhafi. But he soured on the revolution during the chaos following the dictator&apos;s death, and soon organized a campaign against the various Islamic militant groups that took root in eastern Libya.
In recent years he has fought a series of battles there, leaving a swath of destruction but eventually retaking most of eastern Libya and its vital oil facilities. Over the last few months he has quietly expanded his influence across the south, winning over local tribes and factions.
He has cast his opponents as Islamic extremists and modeled himself on President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi in neighboring Egypt, who led the military overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013 and has since presided over an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.
Hifter is supported by Egypt, as well as the United Arab Emirates, Russia and France. His supporters see him as the best hope of stabilizing the troubled country and combatting extremists.
___
WHO IS HE FIGHTING?
Hifter is expected to face stiff resistance from powerful militias from the western cities of Misrata and Zawiya, two areas that saw heavy fighting during the 2011 uprising. The Zawiya militias captured 100 of Hifter&apos;s forces on Friday, the day after he launched his offensive. The battle-hardened Misratans led the fight against an Islamic State group affiliate in 2016, eventually driving it from its last stronghold in Sirte with U.S. air support.
The Tripoli factions present themselves as heirs to the 2011 revolution, but they are widely blamed for derailing the political transition through kidnappings — including of a transitional prime minister — extortion and violence.
They have received support from Turkey and Qatar as part of the regional rivalry between those two countries and Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. European countries have provided aid to local armed groups to stem the flow of migrants, battle extremists and protect oil supplies.
The U.N.-backed government has sought support from the militias as it has struggled to gain a foothold in the capital, while the militias have clashed with each other, most recently in September.
The U.N. Security Council has meanwhile called on Hifter to halt his advance and for all sides to de-escalate the situation. U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame says he still hopes to convene a national conference later this month to plan for elections.

Bill to force college campuses to provide ‘abortion pills’ advances in California,www.foxnews.com,Bradford Betz,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-dems-approve-bill-forcing-college-campuses-to-provide-abortion-pill,"Senate Bill 24, or the “College Student Right to Access Act,” was approved in a 7-3 vote last Wednesday by the California State Senate Health Committee. Former Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the same bill in October . He argued that abortion services were already “widely available off-campus,” making the bill unnecessary.
But state Sen. Connie Leyva , the bill’s chief sponsor, argued that “students should not have to travel off campus or miss class or work responsibilities in order to receive care that can easily be provided at a student health center.”
At the time, Gavin Newsom , the former lieutenant governor who succeeded Brown as governor in January , told the San Francisco Chronicle that he “would have supported that [bill]” and subscribes to “Planned Parenthood and NARAL’s position on that.”
Newsom’s outspoken position has assured the bill’s proponents of its guaranteed passage.
According to the legislation, the bill would kick in beginning 2023 and would require $10.2 million in private funds to cover equipment and training, the Washington Times reported .
To become law, the bill must pass through the state Senate’s education and appropriations committees before a full Senate vote. But with Democrats controlling both chambers, the bill’s passage is all but guaranteed.

The policy was recently expanded to cover summer public interest fellowships, post-graduate public interest fellowships, and loan forgiveness for careers in public interest, according to LifeSite News. In February, members of the Yale Federalist Society invited a lawyer from the Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom to speak on campus, a move that enraged Yale’s LGBT group “Outlaws.”
Outlaws wrote to school administrators demanding that it expand its discrimination policy to Christian groups, given some Christian groups&apos; stance on gay rights .
“[W]e are asking the Yale Law School administration to clarify its [Summer Public Interest Fellowship (‘SPIF’)] and admissions policies regarding organizations that discriminate against members of its community,” the group wrote.
On March 25, the school sent an email to its students announcing an expansion of nondiscrimination policy.
In a letter last Thursday to Yale Law’s Dean Heather Gerken, Quote: : “(It) appears that the policy arose from unconstitutional animus and a specific discriminatory intent both to blacklist Christian organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom and to punish Yale students whose values or religious faith lead them to work there.”
Cruz told Gerken that the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution is opening an investigation, a possible “referral to the Department of Justice for action against the law school.”
According to the Yale Daily News , administrators insisted that the policy applies solely to organizations’ “hiring practices” and not its “values,” adding that it “enthusiastically supports the efforts of Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, liberal, and conservative groups to hire our students.”
Cruz said the investigation may include a subpoena or a referral to the Department of Justice for action against Yale Law School.

American Airlines extends Boeing Max-related cancellations through June,www.foxnews.com,Marcy Gordon,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/american-airlines-extends-boeing-max-related-cancellations-through-june,"Boeing's software fix for the 737 Max is still weeks away The company had previously told reporters the enhancement to the anti-stall system had been in testing for months and would be submitted to the FAA for approval by the end of the week; Dan Springer reports from Seattle. American Airlines is extending by over a month its cancellations of about 90 daily flights as the troubled 737 Max plane remains grounded by regulators. American said Sunday it is extending the cancellations through June 5 from the earlier timeframe of April 24. The airline acknowledged in a statement that the prolonged cancellations could bring disruption for some travelers.
WATCH: AIRLINE PASSENGER DETAILED AFTER THROWING COINS AT PLANE FOR LUCK
The Boeing-made Max jets have been grounded in the U.S. and elsewhere since mid-March, following two deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Airlines that own them have been scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while canceling others.
American Airlines Group Inc., the largest U.S. airline by revenue, has 24 Max jets in its fleet. The Ft. Worth, Texas-based airline said it is awaiting information from U.S. regulators, and will contact customers affected by the cancellations with available re-bookings.
Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said last week the company needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in the two crashes. That means airlines could be forced to park their Max jets longer than they expected.
American said Sunday that by canceling the flights in advance, ""we are able to provide better service to our customers with availability and re-booking options,"" and to avoid last-minute flight disruptions.
PICS: AVIATION COMPANY MOCKED OVER DESIGN FOR NEW STANDING SEATS
American's reservations staff will contact affected customers directly by email or phone, the airline said. ""We know these cancellations and changes may affect some of our customers, and we are working to limit the impact to the smallest number of customers,"" the statement said.
Boeing said Friday that it will cut production of the Max jet, its best-selling plane, underscoring the mounting financial risk it faces the longer the airliner remains grounded.
Starting in mid-April, Boeing said, it will cut production of the plane to 42 from 52 planes per month so it can focus on fixing the flight-control software that has been implicated in the two crashes.
Preliminary investigations into the deadly accidents in Ethiopia and Indonesia found that faulty sensor readings erroneously triggered an anti-stall system that pushed down the plane's nose. Pilots of each plane struggled in vain to regain control over the automated system.
In all, 346 people died in the crashes. Boeing faces a growing number of lawsuits filed by families of the victims.

The announcement to cut production came after Boeing acknowledged that a second software issue has emerged that needs fixing on the Max — a discovery that explained why the aircraft maker had pushed back its ambitious schedule for getting the planes back in the air. Trending in Travel"
Mary Anne Marsh: Joe Biden’s biggest challenge in 2020 is … Joe Biden,www.foxnews.com,Mary Anne Marsh,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mary-anne-marsh-joe-bidens-biggest-challenge-in-2020-is-joe-biden,"And that’s the problem for Joe Biden . Biden does many things well but running for president isn’t one of them. He has run for president on two other occasions – 1988 and 2008 – never winning the nomination, let alone the presidency.
The reason Biden isn’t president is his poor performance as a candidate in his last two campaigns. Will the third time be the charm? Will he be a better candidate?
Alas, even after eight years of campaigning with Barack Obama, Biden is not a better presidential candidate, and there’s no sign he won’t commit the same mistakes that cost him those other two races.
That problem was on full display last week when several women accused Biden of inappropriate touching. It was the first test of the Biden for President campaign. Their response was to release three statements, one video, and a public appearance by Biden where he delivered several tone-deaf jokes about it. This was all immediately followed by a press availability for a clean-up on Aisle Biden – and everyone is still talking about it.
That one example shows the challenges Biden is facing and it’s not a promising start. When you’re explaining, you’re not winning. Joe Biden is explaining a lot these days and that fact alone makes this race an uphill battle for him.
What’s worse is that his campaign-in-waiting was so ineffective in dealing with a problem they had to have known was coming. And Biden’s performance only compounded it.
And it was only the first. There are more problems waiting in the wings that the Biden campaign will have to confront.
The controversy of this past week is a metaphor for the challenge Biden is going to face in the 2020 race: that his long tenure in politics is going to hurt him more than help him. There are many more topics that Biden will have to explain from the 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s that don’t look good in 2020.
For example, Biden recently stated he wished he could have given Anita Hill the hearing she deserved when she testified against the nomination of then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with accusations of sexual harassment. Biden was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time and he could have done it. He didn’t. The Anita Hill hearing, and Biden’s decision, looks worse in 2020 than 1991 and it was bad at the time. In fact, it was the response to that hearing led to the first wave of women elected to the Senate and the House in 1992.
Biden does not have a grassroots fundraising operation in place, which is critical to winning any campaign – especially a presidential campaign in 2020.
In addition, Biden’s positions on race, criminal justice, reproductive rights, and much more will have to be addressed. The historic victories in the 2018 election were fueled by women and voters of color. It is impossible to win the nomination, let alone the general election, without the support of women voters and voters of color – no matter how many candidates are in the race – and these issues are paramount to them.
Yes, Joe Biden leads the polls today because he is the best-known Democratic candidate. He is also one of the most popular candidates not only due to his service as Obama’s vice president, but also because of the lack of criticism or real scrutiny of him in the last ten years.
It is rare that any candidate is the front runner from the starting line to the finish line, and Biden is no exception. While it’s still early for any poll to be a reflection of what the race will look like a year from now, Biden’s best day may have been last week – before the controversy erupted – as his poll numbers were already starting to drop.
Everybody likes Joe Biden. He’s a great guy, and was a great vice president. But that doesn’t mean he’s in great political shape, thanks in large part to the fact that no one has laid a glove on him for over a decade.
Furthermore, Biden hasn’t had a campaign operation since his 2008 presidential run. He became part of the Obama operation, meaning he doesn’t have his own infrastructure that is up and running. Biden has also never been a great fundraiser and there are rumblings that he hasn’t changed.
Biden does not have a grassroots fundraising operation in place, which is critical to winning any campaign – especially a presidential campaign in 2020. The time, effort, and investment to build one are substantial. And it is not hard to imagine that Biden won’t have 65,000 donors by the first Democratic debates in June. It won’t preclude him from participating but that gives you an idea of where he stands getting into this race.
There’s no question Joe Biden has faced tougher challenges in his life than running for president. The loss of his first wife and daughter in a tragic car accident in 1972, just after winning his first Senate race, defines Biden’s life of triumph and tragedy. Sadly, that tragic legacy was further cemented when he lost his beloved son Beau to cancer in 2015. It is said that Biden promised Beau he would run for president again. If so then keeping a promise to his late son trumps traditional political considerations, including those outlined here.
A presidential campaign may not be the toughest fight in life but it is in politics. Nothing prepares you for it. Biden will take a beating and face all the problems a presidential campaign confronts you with, just like everyone else. How Biden responds will determine his fate. This past week showed once again that the biggest challenge to Joe Biden becoming president is Joe Biden.

""I mean, he&apos;s very public about where he&apos;s at right now and we&apos;re just proud of him,"" he added .
Estevez made the comments three months after Sheen told Extra he was celebrating one year of sobriety.
In 2015, Sheen revealed that he was HIV-positive and said he was diagnosed about four years before. He said he went public four years later mainly because he was being blackmailed by various people who knew about it and were demanding money to keep silent.

A year later, Charlie Sheen&apos;s HIV-positive status was front and center once again when the actor appeared on the ""Today"" show, ahead of the release of an exposé-style documentary that focused on the actor&apos;s sexual history.
At the time, Sheen admitted that he didn’t always disclose his HIV-positive status to his sexual partners, but he insisted he used condoms in those cases. His ex-fiancee, Brett Rossi, however, claimed the opposite, saying he had unprotected sex with her and did not disclose his HIV-positive status.
On the ""Today"" show, Sheen admitted he did not use a condom several times after his diagnosis but maintained the women whom he had unprotected sex with knew about his diagnosis.
“I regret not using a condom one or two times when this whole thing happened,” Sheen said at the time. He also said he regretted “ruining &apos;Two and a Half Men&apos;” and not being more involved in his children’s lives growing up.
Sheen was on the popular sitcom “Two and a Half Men” until 2011, when he had an infamous meltdown. He went to rehab and put the show on hiatus. He then insulted series creator Chuck Lorre and was fired from the show. His character was replaced by Ashton Kutcher until the show ended in 2015.

More families of victims of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia are suing Boeing Co. after its chief executive apologized last week and said a software update for the MAX 8 jet would prevent further disasters. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) JAKARTA, Indonesia – More families of victims of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia are suing Boeing Co. after its chief executive apologized and said a software update for the MAX 8 jet would prevent further disasters. Family members and lawyers said Monday that CEO Dennis Muilenburg's comment last week related to an automated flight system was an admission that helps their cases.
The anti-stall system is suspected as a cause of the Lion Air crash in October and an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March that also involved a MAX 8 jet. The two crashes killed a total of 346 people.
Preliminary reports into both crashes found that faulty sensor readings erroneously triggered the anti-stall system that pushed the plane's nose down. Pilots of each plane struggled in vain to regain control.
Families of 11 Lion Air victims said at a news conference organized by Jakarta law firm Kailimang & Ponto that they are joining dozens of other Indonesian families in filing lawsuits against Boeing.
""Boeing's CEO explicitly apologized to 346 passenger families,"" said Merdian Agustin, whose husband died in the crash. ""We hope this is good momentum to have compensation rights.""
Agustin, the mother of three children, said that she and dozens of other families have not received 1.2 billion rupiah ($85,000) compensation they are entitled to in Indonesia because they refused to sign a ""release and discharge"" document that extinguishes their right to sue Lion Air, Boeing or their subsidiaries.
""We refused to sign such a document containing statements that are treating our loved ones like lost baggage,"" Agustin said. ""It's ridiculous and hurts us.""
Boeing acknowledged that the sensor malfunctioned and Muilenburg said last week that a new software update would prevent future incidents. ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" Muilenburg said in a video statement. ""We own it, and we know how to do it.""
Lawyer Michael Indrajana said that since the crash, families in Indonesia have faced a complicated and painful process against Boeing and Lion Air in their battle to get compensation.
He said the Boeing CEO's statement shows the airline is now acknowledging responsibility.
""No amount of money can bring their loved ones back,"" he said. ""We want to fight for the orphans, so they have the opportunity to get a better future.""
Boeing said last week that it will cut production of its troubled 737 Max airliner this month, underscoring the growing financial risk it faces the longer that its best-selling plane remains grounded after the two crashes.
The company said that starting in mid-April it will cut production of the plane to 42 from 52 per month so it can focus its attention on fixing the flight-control software that has been implicated in the crashes.
The move was not a complete surprise. Boeing had already suspended deliveries of the Max last month after regulators around the world grounded the jet.
Boeing also announced it is creating a special board committee to review airplane design and development.
The announcement to cut production comes after Boeing acknowledged that a second software issue has emerged that needs fixing on the Max — a discovery that explained why the aircraft maker had pushed back its ambitious schedule for getting the planes back in the air. Trending in World"

Busch brothers take top 2 spots at Bristol NASCAR race as Kyle picks up 8th win,www.foxnews.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/busch-brothers-take-top-2-spots-at-bristol-nascar-race-as-kyle-picks-up-8th-win,"Busch grabbed his third Cup win of the season, eighth overall at Bristol, and 10th this year spanning all three of NASCAR&apos;s national series. He beat his older brother, who said if given the chance in Sunday&apos;s race, he&apos;d have wrecked him so that Kurt Busch was the one celebrating in victory lane.
Kurt (in black suit) said he would've wrecked Kyle (in red suit) to get the win if he had the chance.
""He told me in victory lane and I told him &apos;You can&apos;t tell people you&apos;re going to wreck them before you do it because when roles are reversed that person is going to wreck you because you already told them you were going to wreck them,&apos;"" Kyle Busch said. ""So I guess if I&apos;m ever running second to Kurt, I&apos;m going to wreck him. I&apos;m glad it didn&apos;t turn out that way.""
The Busch brothers lined up side-by-side on the final restart, but Kurt Busch had nothing to slow Kyle Busch&apos;s steamrolling of the competition this year. They&apos;d inherited the lead as the first in line not to pit for tires during the 11th caution, and it set up a final shootout between Bristol&apos;s two winningest active drivers.
""He gave it one hell of a fight,"" Kyle Busch said. ""Busch and Bristol, sounds familiar.""
Kurt Busch is a six-time winner at the .533-mile high-banked oval and lamented the loss over the P.A. system. When he said he would have wrecked Kyle Busch, the crowd roared and affirmed Kurt Busch&apos;s frustration with the final results. He&apos;s emerged as the top driver in the winless Chevrolet camp with seven finishes of 12th or higher in his debut with Chip Ganassi Racing.
""That one is tough. I really wanted to beat him. I was going to wreck him,"" Kurt Busch said. ""Figure he could give a little love to his brother. I wanted that one bad. Feel like him right now — I&apos;m all mad because I didn&apos;t win.""
The wins go to Kyle Busch, seemingly all the time this season, in anything he drives. Along with teammate Denny Hamlin, they&apos;ve given Joe Gibbs Racing five wins through the first eight races. If a Gibbs car doesn&apos;t win, then a Ford from Team Penske has, and that organization has the other three Cup victories this year.
The win was probably going to go to either Penske driver Brad Keselowski or Joey Logano until a late caution forced teams to choose. They could go in for tires or stay on track and try to maintain their position for the final 13 laps. The leaders — Logano and Keselowski — went to pit road, while Busch and his big brother moved to the front of the field.
""It was a no brainer for us,"" said crew chief Adam Stevens. ""We were just going to take our chances. I didn&apos;t think we would inherit the lead. That made it a little bit easier on us.""
The pit strategy set up the storybook final ending to a weekend spent honoring Hall of Famer Darrell Waltrip, the all-time winningest driver at Bristol with 12 victories. He used this venue to announce he&apos;ll retire as Fox Sports&apos; lead analyst after 19 seasons, and his success at making the concrete jungle his playground was celebrated as Waltrip waved the green flag to start the race. Waltrip also was wired by the network to give his trademark ""Boogity! Boogity! Boogity! Let&apos;s go racing, boys!"" call from the flagstand.
But Waltrip, an unapologetic Kyle Busch fanatic, barely had time to catch his breath before an accident on the second lap brought action to a halt. Caught up in the commotion? Kyle Busch, who had a damaged Toyota that sent him to pit road for repairs.
Team owner Joe Gibbs saw Busch spinning and thought, ""Oh, my gosh, our day is going to end early.""
""I think with Adam and Kyle, they have a way of fighting through adversity,"" Gibbs said. ""Adam told Kyle right off the bat &apos;Hey, the car is not really hurt.&apos; I think it probably took something away from the car, but they just did a great job fighting all day.""
Because what was once Waltrip&apos;s domain now belongs to Kyle Busch, and not much can stop him these days, especially at Bristol.
So it was fitting, then, that he found himself out front in an entertaining, old-fashioned Bristol barnburner. The race had 11 cautions, 21 lead changes and the 47 green-flag passes for the lead were the most since NASCAR began tracking that statistic in 2005.
The race also had a very familiar face in victory lane.
Kyle Busch and his brother have combined to win the last four Cup races at Bristol, and Kyle Busch has 22 total wins at the track. But success is measured in the Cup Series, and Kyle Busch has trophies to collect to catch Waltrip.
""It ain&apos;t 12, that&apos;s for sure. So I got more to go. We&apos;re getting there,"" Kyle Busch said.
HARVICK PENALIZED
Kevin Harvick&apos;s car failed inspection three times before the start of the race to draw race-crippling penalties. NASCAR ejected his engineer from the event, forced Harvick to give up his 13th-place starting spot and drop to the back of the field and serve a pass-thru penalty at the start. It was certain to drop him several laps behind the leader immediately, but a caution on the second lap of the race as Harvick was on pit road mitigated the damage.
Harvick had a myriad of issues during the race and at one point dropped four laps behind the leader, but he had scrambled to the lead lap for the final restart and managed to finish 13th — exactly where he would have started if his car had not failed inspection.
ALMIROLA OUT
Aric Almirola&apos;s race lasted just two laps before William Byron wiggled into him and sent Almirola&apos;s car into the wall. The damage ensured him a last-place finish after starting sixth.
Almirola chalked the incident up to second-year Cup driver Byron&apos;s inexperience and potential ""panic"" when cars began to pass him at the start of the race. Byron started second on the front row.
""He spun his tires on the start ... and he just lost it,"" Almirola said. ""He got loose underneath me, lost it and ran right into the side of us and wrecked us. Part of that comes with experience, I guess.""

John Oliver's parody book among most 'challenged' works,www.foxnews.com,HILLEL ITALIE,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/john-olivers-parody-book-among-most-challenged-works,"""Last Week Tonight With John Oliver Presents A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo,"" in which the Pence&apos;s family bunny turns out to be gay, was among the books most objected to in 2018 at the country&apos;s public libraries. The best-selling parody ranked No. 2 on the list of ""challenged"" books compiled by the American Library Association, with some complaining about its gay-themed content and political viewpoint. Oliver&apos;s book, credited to staff writer Jill Twiss, was a response to the Pences&apos; ""A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo"" and to the family&apos;s conservative social viewpoint. The Pences themselves did not publicly object, and daughter Charlotte Pence has even said she purchased a copy of the ""Last Week Tonight"" book, noting that proceeds were going to charities for AIDS and suicide prevention for LGBTQ youth.
The library association announced Monday that Alex Gino&apos;s ""George,"" a middle-grade novel about a transgender child, was No. 1 on its list. Others included Angie Thomas&apos; best-seller about a teen girl whose friend is shot by police, ""The Hate U Give"" (drug use, profanity, ""anti-cop"" bias); and Dav Pilkey&apos;s ""Captain Underpants"" series (same-sex couple, ""encouraging disruptive behavior"").
The report also includes Raina Telgemeier&apos;s ""Drama,"" Jay Asher&apos;s ""Thirteen Reasons Why,"" Sherman Alexie&apos;s prize-winning """"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,"" Mariko and Jillian Tamaki&apos;s ""This One Summer"" and Judy Schachner&apos;s ""Skippyjon Jones"" series. Books included on the list in previous years range from ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to the ""Harry Potter"" series.
The ALA usually lists 10 books, but included 11 this year because two tied for 10th place: Gayle E. Pitman&apos;s and Kristyna Litten&apos;s ""This Day in June,"" and David Leviathan&apos;s ""Two Boys Kissing,"" both cited for LGBTQIA+ content and both among those burned last October in Orange City, Iowa, by the director of a ""pro-family"" group called Rescue the Perishing.
Deborah Caldwell Stone, interim director of the library association&apos;s Office for Intellectual Freedom, said the protests from parents and other local residents about gay content reflected a ""pushback"" as ""writers work to be more inclusive of underrepresented or marginalized communities.""
The list is part of the association&apos;s ""State of America&apos;s Libraries Report"" and comes at the start of National Library Week, which begins Wednesday. The ALA defines a ""challenge"" as a ""formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness."" The list is based on news reports and on accounts submitted from libraries, although the ALA believes many challenges go unreported. The association tracked 347 challenges last year, compared to 356 in 2017.
""The number has been fairly steady over the past few years,"" Stone said.
The ALA did not have a number for books actually pulled from library shelves or moved to an adult section.

She warned that the increased violence is worsening the situation for migrants held in Tripoli&apos;s detention centers.
Fighting was underway Monday at the international airport, some 24 kilometers (15 miles) from central Tripoli.
The self-styled Libyan National Army, led by Khalifa Hifter, began an offensive against the capital last week.
Rival militias that support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli have vowed to recapture all the areas recently seized by Hifter&apos;s forces.

Rep. Bobby Rush calls Chicago police union the ‘sworn enemy of black people’,www.foxnews.com,Brooke Singman,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-bobby-rush-calls-chicago-police-union-the-sworn-enemy-of-black-people,"Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) slams Chicago's police union as 'the sworn enemy of black people' Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) slams Chicago's police union as 'the sworn enemy of black people,' amid the controversy surrounding prosecutor Kim Foxx and her handling of the Jussie Smollett case. Illinois Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush blasted the Chicago police union over the weekend as “the sworn enemy of black people,” pushing back at the controversy surrounding prosecutor Kim Foxx and her office's handling of the Jussie Smollett case. During a press conference on Saturday, Rush, D-Ill., tore into Chicago’s Fraternal Order of Police after members of the union participated in protests demanding Cook County State's Attorney Foxx resign from her post.
CHICAGO PROSECUTOR KIM FOXX DEFENDS JUSSIE SMOLLETT DECISION
“The FOP is the sworn enemy of black people, the sworn enemy of black people,” Rush said Saturday. “The FOP has always taken the position that black people can be shot down in the street by members of the Chicago Police Department, and suffer no consequences.”
He added: “Let’s be clear: Kim Foxx, her battle, is with the FOP and all of their cohorts.”
Rush’s comments came after hundreds of protesters, including members of the police union, gathered outside Foxx’s office last week. The union protesters were met with counter-protests from groups including the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, according to The Chicago Tribune. The Tribune also reported that members of white nationalist groups were at the union’s protest.
“The injection of white nationalists in this conversation for me, I will tell you personally, I was afraid,” Foxx said on Saturday. “I would certainly hope that the FOP and whatever their disagreements may be, whatever concerns that they may have about my ability or leadership, would at least expect the people of their union to not inject racism or white nationalists into the conversation.”
The union, though, told The Tribune Saturday that Rush’s comments were “ignorant, offensive, malicious and false.”
“These outrageous and irresponsible comments have demeaned each and every Chicago Police Officer, regardless of their race,” the union reportedly said.
JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED CHICAGO ATTACK DETAILS UNFOLD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS
Foxx has come under fire over her office’s decision to dismiss charges against Smollett following accusations he faked a hate crime. Foxx now claims the “Empire” star did not receive any special treatment.
“I have been asking myself for the last two weeks what is this really about,” Foxx said Saturday. “As someone who has lived in this city, who came up in the projects of this city to serve as the first African American woman in this role, it is disheartening to me…that when we get in these positions somehow the goalposts change.”
Foxx reportedly mentioned in her speech that she welcomes an independent investigation into her handling of the case, saying that nearly 6,000 other ""low-level defendants"" received the same treatment with deferred prosecution, adding that under the law, Smollett could've been fined a maximum of $10,000 — which he effectively paid when he forfeited his bond for the same amount.
Foxx publicly recused herself from Smollett's case after communicating with one of his relatives during the police investigation into whether or not he staged an alleged hate crime against himself. But her office later said she never formally recused herself. She has received widespread criticism -- not just from the police union -- for her handling of the case.
In January, Smollett told police that two masked men attacked him, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. The actor, who is black and openly gay, said the masked men beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" before fleeing the scene. Video
However, the Chicago Police Department alleged that Smollett paid the two men, Abel and Ola Osundairo, by check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career."" The brothers were allegedly caught on surveillance footage purchasing the rope used in the staged ""attack"" on Smollett.
The FBI is investigating whether Smollett sent himself a threatening hate letter to the ""Empire"" set, which could potentially land him behind bars for a decade for mail fraud — a federal offense.
Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal. His attorneys previously told Fox News they've ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Ronda Rousey takes a nasty fall in 'do-or-die' WrestleMania main event,www.foxnews.com,Andy Sahadeo,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ronda-rousey-takes-a-nasty-fall-in-do-or-die-wrestlemania-main-event,"The match, which also featured “The Man” Becky Lynch and “The Queen” Charlotte Flair , was a winner-take-all for the Raw and SmackDown Women’s Championship. In the brutal spot, Rousey applied an over-the-top-rope armbar to Flair, which ultimately ended with The Man kicking her right off the apron. Ahead of the historic event, the former UFC Bantamweight Champion expressed concerns over her WWE future beyond WrestleMania. When asked about her plans after the big night, Rousey kept things vague.
“I don’t know, I guess I’ll have to reconsider my life after Sunday,” she said. “It’s a do-or-die moment, so we’ll see.""
Representatives for Rousey did not immediately respond to Fox News&apos; questions about her future.
Rousey made her wrestling debut at last year’s WrestleMania event in a tag-team match — where she teamed with Hall of Famer Kurt Angle and defeated the team of Stephanie McMahon and Triple H .
Rousey had been Raw Women’s Champion since SummerSlam this past August, in which she defeated WrestleMania host Alexa Bliss. Following the event, Rousey began a warpath of tearing through the Raw women’s roster, which included the likes of Ruby Riott, Liv Morgan , Sarah Logan and Nikki Bella .
Moreover, Becky Lynch quickly won over the WWE Universe when she attacked Charlotte Flair at the SummerSlam event. Over the following months, the three female Superstars engaged in a bitter rivalry that ultimately culminated in the main event of WrestleMania.
In the ""do-or-die"" main event, Rousey eventually came up short, as it was Lynch who ultimately came out on top — ending Rousey&apos;s yearlong undefeated streak and becoming WWE’s first-ever double Women’s Champion to conclude the historic event.

She got most Republicans on her side, but couldn’t get a single Democrat to vote for the elimination of the loophole. And, like the president, she could get very few, if any Democrats, to even concede we have a crisis at the border.
It’s cruel and unrealistic to expect a commissioner to corral needed votes from a party that has already internally agreed to sacrifice national sovereignty for the purpose of allowing as many illegal aliens as possible into our country, knowing full well that it’s just a matter of time before they are granted amnesty, citizenship and the right to vote –thereby ensuring Democratic control of the two branches for at least a generation to come.
Nielsen’s job was made infinitely harder by the fact that the media, which is now in many ways an extension of the Democratic Party’s public relations arm, was aiding and abetting a scenario whereby television viewers were asked to ignore their own eyes and instead buy into the Orwellian talking points uttered by the crisis deniers.
If Trump or anyone else believes that Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan will be any more successful achieving a changing of the rules or expediting a Supreme Court decision going Trump’s way, they are brutally naive.
Video Chief John Roberts harbors a deep resentment over the president&apos;s chastising of the judiciary. Meanwhile, his court, despite a conservative majority, has already refused to expedite any of the major setbacks border enforcement advocates suffered in the liberal district courts on matters involving President Obama’s illegal DACA executive order, the battle over sanctuary cities, or the questions related to unaccompanied minors, asylum, or ending the dangerous catch and release policies.
Changing the rules related to asylum and unaccompanied minors must be McAleenan’s primary focus, even above the building of the wall.
The latest uncontrollable wave of illegal immigration didn’t start with Nielsen; it started in 2014, when President Obama sat idly by while coyotes started to take advantage of a George W. Bush-era law that was intended to protect children from sex traffickers. If unaccompanied minors were apprehended at the border with the coyotes intent on selling them in the states for prostitution, border agents were instructed by the well-meaning law to separate them and not send them back with their exploiters. When the law was written, it was never conceived that Central American parents would then start, at the urging of the coyotes, to deliberately send their children to cross the border alone, knowing border agents would be prevented from turning them back.
Interestingly, at the very outset of this new pattern, Obama wisely proclaimed he would lead an effort to modify the law, but quickly retreated when the first signs of discord were echoed by the illegal immigration lobby. Word got out that the borders were open to anyone living outside of Mexico. (For some strange reason the sex trafficking law did not prohibit the agents from turning Mexican children back at the border.) Nielsen was helpless to do anything about it. Only Congress could close the loopholes and Democrats on the Hill were having none of it. The consequences were daunting. In just a year or two, 8,000 unaccompanied minors, easy prey for gang recruitment, were settled on Long Island. This, in part, led to a metastasizing of the MS-13 gang and the murder of almost two dozen youths in Suffolk County shortly thereafter.
Neither could the drafters of our nation’s asylum laws have ever envisioned that the non-ideologically persecuted would be exploiting our generosity in the laws by seeking asylum to simply better their lives economically.
As long as the loopholes in these two laws stay on the books, the word will continue to be blasted out to hundreds of millions of indigent people around the world that if you can simply get to the states physically, you will be able to stay.
Whether the Department of Homeland Security is run by Nielsen, McAleenan or anyone else, the border crisis will only intensify unless the media and the public itself start holding accountable those Democrats who refuse to recognize the obvious – that we are facing a border crisis and that our asylum and unaccompanied minor laws must be amended.

Brooke Johns is now facing a disorderly conduct charge after letting her 3-year-old son urinate in the parking lot of a gas station, reports say. (Fox 5 Atlanta) A pregnant mom in Georgia -- who is expected to give birth later this month -- is now facing a court date for a disorderly conduct charge let her 3-year-old urinate in a gas station parking lot. Brooke Johns told FOX5 Atlanta she was driving around Augusta on Wednesday when her son alerted her he needed to make a pit stop. Johns says she pulled into a gas station parking lot and, after being unable to carry the child inside, let him urinate outside while covering him. That attracted the attention of a nearby police officer .
""I said 'accidents happen.' And he was like –‘take him in the bathroom,’"" Johns said to the station. ""What if I would have ran in the bathroom and someone had been in there? What was I going to let him do? Pee on the floor of the gas station?""
Johns now has a court date at the end of the month -- just days before she is due with her next child, FOX5 Atlanta reported.
The judge that is assigned to the case could drop the charges, but if not, Johns reportedly faces up to a thousand dollars in fines and 60 days of jail time. Trending in US"
