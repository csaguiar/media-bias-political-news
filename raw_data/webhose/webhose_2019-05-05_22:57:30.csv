"In NYC area, Goodwill targets buyers browsing websites of Amazon, Walmart",www.providencejournal.com,Jordyn HolmanBloomberg,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190406/in-nyc-area-goodwill-targets-buyers-browsing-websites-of-amazon-walmart,"By Jordyn HolmanBloomberg Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 12:31 PM
For a charity thrift store, Goodwill is going after unthinkably formidable rivals: Amazon and Walmart.
The nonprofit's New York-area organization has teamed up with Price.com to develop a browser add-on that alerts online shoppers at sites such as Amazon.com and Walmart's Jet.com when a product they're looking to buy — say, a mountain bike or a pair of shoes — is available on Goodwill's website. Shoppers can click a pop-up link to order the second-hand version shipped to them instead.
""We're offering the same exact goods that you can find on Amazon, that you can find on Jet, and we're offering them for a much lower price than those websites do,"" said Joe Jarroush, vice president of retail operations for Goodwill in greater New York and Northern New Jersey. ""I know when people think about Goodwill, they maybe don't think about these advancements in tech, but that's where we're headed.""
The launch of a Chrome browser extension may seem like an unusual move for a thrift-store operator known for its brick-and-mortar presence and low-cost shopping. But as new online thrift stores like Thredup and Poshmark grow and young consumers increasingly cotton to used and upcycled apparel, it gives Goodwill a chance to reach today's digital customers where they shop.
The popularity of second-hand clothing is on the rise and will be bigger than fast fashion within the decade, according to Thredup's 2019 Resale Report. Millennials and Generation Z shoppers are turning to reused clothing at the quickest pace, the survey found. And Americans appear to be giving away more stuff than usual after the launch of the show ""Tidying Up With Marie Kondo"" on Netflix.
""It's all adding up to this thrift buildup,"" Jarroush said. ""It's very encouraging that the thrift market is growing substantially.""
For now, the new browser add-on will be able to search only for similar products for sale at Goodwill Industries of Greater New York and Northern New Jersey, whose website currently attracts 6 million visitors a month, according to RJ Jain, chief executive officer of closely held startup Price.com.
Bloomberg's attempts to get the add-on to flag similar used items was patchy, with only a small selection of products triggering the pop-up. A representative for Price.com said that's because Goodwill's New York and New Jersey site has very limited inventory.
Eventually, the nonprofit wants to roll out the tool to include more inventory from other parts of the U.S. Still, Goodwill NYNJ said it doesn't see the online push cannibalizing its physical stores, where it trains and employs thousands of workers every year, including seniors, veterans and people with disabilities who might otherwise have a hard time finding a job.
""If we had an Oscar de la Renta runway piece ... typically we leave that for the thrifter, the local shopper who's going to their local Goodwill,"" Jarroush said. ""We don't want to rob them of that."""

PANAMA CITY — China's expansion in Latin America of its Belt and Road initiative to build ports and other trade-related facilities is stirring alarm in Washington over Beijing's ambitions in a region that American leaders since the 19th century have seen as off-limits to other powers.
China is hardly a newcomer to the region, but now it's focusing on countries in Central America such as Panama. It's a country of just 4 million people, but its canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans makes it one of the world's busiest trade arteries and strategically important both to Washington and Beijing.
As American officials express alarm at Beijing's ambitions in the U.S.-dominated Western Hemisphere, China has launched a charm offensive, wooing Panamanian politicians, professionals and journalists.
The Chinese ambassador, a Spanish-speaking Latin American veteran, has been talking up the benefits of Belt and Road on TV and Twitter. Beijing has flown professionals and journalists on junkets to China. It seems to be paying off.
""We see a big opportunity to connect Asia and America to Panama,"" Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela said during a visit to Hong Kong this week. He is due to attend a ""Belt and Road"" forum in Beijing with other foreign leaders this month, according to the Chinese government.
Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature foreign initiative, Belt and Road is building railways, ports, power plants and other projects in dozens of countries around the globe. But the U.S., Japan, Russia, India and other governments worry that Beijing is gaining economic and strategic influence at their expense.
""A strong U.S. reaction, whether it is obvious in public or not, is coming,"" said Matt Ferchen, an expert on China-Latin America relations at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.
Panama's leaders see China as a source of trade and investment but want to avoid conflict with Washington. Varela has said Panama's relationship with China ""will not affect relations with our strategic partner.""
Belt and Road is building on multibillion-dollar deals for loans and investments in oil and mining in South America that Beijing made beginning in the 1990s.
Venezuela has received $62 billion in Chinese loans. Brazil owes $42 billion and Argentina $18 billion. Ecuador has borrowed $17 billion.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he is considering joining Belt and Road. That would give it a foothold in a country bordering the U.S.
In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago agreed last May to take part. In September, a state-owned Chinese company was awarded a contract to build a dry dock.
American officials say governments should be wary.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited in October and met with Varela, whose term runs through July. Afterward, Pompeo told reporters Panama ""should keep its eyes wide open"" concerning Chinese investments.
""We are all concerned about China and by the way that China is entering those countries,"" Pompeo said at the Group of 20 meeting of major economies in Argentina in December. Such projects are not always driven by ""good intentions,"" he said.
In a coup for Beijing, Panama switched diplomatic recognition in June 2017 to China from Taiwan, the self-ruled island the communist mainland claims as its own territory. That cut Taiwan's biggest political tie to Latin America.
President Donald Trump's ""America first"" policies are not helping the U.S. cause in the region, said businessman Roberto Eisenmann, founder of Panama's most influential newspaper, La Prensa.
Trump has yet to name a replacement for U.S. Ambassador John Feeley, who announced his retirement in January 2018.
""They are leaving a vacuum of leadership that obviously the Chinese are trying to fill,"" said Eisenmann.
Two months after Pompeo stopped by, Varela welcomed Xi on an official visit and proclaimed his support for Belt and Road. Varela told Xi that Panama wants to ""play a front-line role"" in helping to build a more interconnected world.
The next day, Varela joined a ceremony where a consortium including two Chinese companies was awarded a contract to build a fourth bridge across the Panama Canal, whose ports of entry at its Atlantic and Pacific ends are operated by a Hong Kong consortium.
China, the canal's second-largest user after the United States, has ""considerable strategic interest"" in Panama, said Margaret Myers, director of Asia and Latin America for the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank in Washington.
""There are concerns about the possible effects on U.S. firms, on regional stability and, above all, on U.S. influence in the region,"" she said.
Launched in 2012, Belt and Road now encompasses most Chinese commercial initiatives abroad.
Most projects involve Chinese loans at commercial interest rates, adding to concerns Beijing is building a China-centered trade and political structure that might leave poor countries with too much debt.
Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia and some other countries have canceled or renegotiated projects due to costs or complaints they would do too little for local economies.
China has dismissed such concerns.
Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said Beijing is trying to reshape how the initiative is perceived. But there's no indication it is addressing problems that led to complaints that Sri Lanka, Kenya and other countries ended up with too much debt.
""I don't think they have learned the important lessons,"" said Tsang. ""What they have learned are the superficial ones.""
China's ambassador, Wei Qiang, has been laying groundwork for deeper involvement in Panama.
In March 2018, he met with members of the opposition Revolutionary Democratic Party, whose candidate for this May's presidential election, Laurentino Cortizo, is leading in polls.
Cortizo said he plans to meet with Wei to ""look at the future of this relationship.""
Wei has invited Eisenmann, the newspaper founder, to his official residence to discuss Panama's ""plans for the 'Silk Road.'""
China has proposed building a high-speed rail line from Panama City to the town of David near Panama's western border with Costa Rica.
So far, projects awarded to Chinese contractors — the canal bridge, a cruise-ship dock and a convention center — have been paid for by the Panamanian government. The country has yet to receive Chinese loans.

"""It's Not The Economy, Stupid... It's The State!"" | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/its-not-economy-its-state-stupid,"
Authored by Jeffrey Tucker via The American Institute for Economic Research, The number one problem of all public debate about politics and economics is the failure to name the state. If this would change, so would public opinion.
There is no shortage of examples. People talk about health care for all, solving climate change, providing security in old age, universal educational access, boosting wages, ending discrimination, and you can add to the list without end. That’s one side. The other speaks of national identity, protecting jobs, making us more moral, forming cultural cohesion, providing security against the foreign enemy, and so on. Obfuscation All of this, no matter how fancy the language, is obfuscation. What all of this really means is: put the state in charge. What’s strange is the unwillingness to say it outright. This is for a reason. The plans the politicians have for our lives would come across as far less compelling if they admitted the following brutal truth.
There really are only two ways to allocate goods and services in society: the markets (which rely on individual choice) and the state (which runs on compulsion). No one has ever found a third way. You can mix the two — some markets and some state-run operations — but there always is and always will be a toggling between the two. If you replace markets, the result will be more force via the state, which means bureaucratic administration and rule by force. If you reduce the role of the state, you rely more on markets. This is the logic of political choice, and there is no escaping it. The above paragraph is the great truth of political economy. I’ve never seen any evidence to dispute it. And yet it is the great unsayable truth. Seasons of political rhetoric fly by with no frank discussion of what precisely this or that proposal would require of the state and how that will affect our lives, much less a serious analysis of the risks of making a problem worse by replacing market forces. Diversity in Markets To be sure, when I say markets, I don’t only mean the money-exchange economy in which prices and accounting govern choices. Markets include philanthropy, familial organization, houses of religion, volunteering to work without pay, and everything else in the social order that relies on human volition. There are infinite varieties in the way markets instantiate themselves in human lives. The variations are contingent on culture, norms, traditions, and so on. There can be more or less voluntary ways the market expresses itself just like there can be more or less coercive forms of statism. But let us not deny that the choice is real. If this is correct, it is strange how much people complain about markets and how little the only alternative is discussed, studied, evaluated, and finally judged. This is because the statist means will also come up short. Depending on the state to deliver some social good depends on using the threat of violence to compel people to do what they otherwise would not choose to do. There is also no clean path to doing so; the bureaucracy always ends up as the everyday mediator between the individual and the point of a gun. You Don’t Like Government The reason we hear so little frank talk on this subject is that hardly anyone has ever really enjoyed their dealings with a state bureaucracy when it is imposed upon them. You think that the local DMV experience is subpar; wait until you face your first federal audit or FBI investigation, or seek benefits from some agency. Or perhaps you have a relative who is mixed up in the criminal-justice system. Whatever it is, no experience in the private sector can compare. It means unpredictable wait times. You aren’t really a customer; you are a bother — at best. Objecting to any aspect of the service is mostly pointless. Step out of line and you are in trouble. You are a subject, and the sullen faces and dreary postures of your fellow citizens in line underscores the point. The truth is that no one relishes dealing with the government at any level. Where would you rather be: the driver’s license bureau or McDonald’s? The school district office or a local bar? A military base or a car plant? The courthouse or the shopping mall? Want to deal with a government cop or a private security guard? There’s a pattern here. It’s a hugely important one. The relationship between the individual and the state, vs. the same individual and the market, is fundamentally different. We all know this intuitively. I personally know no one who relishes dealing with government. And yet I know plenty of people who support letting government take over ever more aspects of our lives, especially when they don’t understand that their favorite program means exactly that. How can we make sense of this paradox? Well, most expansions of government power are pushed without overt public approval, with plenty of deception, and with the unfair advantage that government itself has in the political process. In other words, it is not necessary that people actively favor government expansion for government to continue its imperial march through society. It only requires a certain level of passive compliance. The TSA The creation of the Department of Homeland Security — and the TSA as the centerpiece — is a great example. I was talking with Edward Lopez, economics professor at Western Carolina University, about how this came about. We were both around at the time and we compared notes.
How did it happen? Government took advantage of public fear and panic following 9-11 to impose what government had always wanted. There was private lobbying too: plenty of contractors have gotten rich, so their lobbying has paid off. The airlines might have played a role too in offloading security liabilities. Anyone who knew the nature of government could have predicted the results. There have been exploding costs. Individual rights have been violated. Our privacy and constitutional protections have been shredded. Inefficiencies have ballooned. And what for? No credible terrorist threats have really been stopped. Somehow, at the time this gigantic government apparatus was created, many people imagined that this time would be different, that government would magically do a better job at securing us than the private sector could or would do. Of course this time is never actually different. The bureaucracy gets created, and then people shake their fists at it. But, by then, it is actually too late. A bureaucracy created tends not to go away. It gets worse even as it expands and takes on a life of its own. The abuses, wastes, and inefficiencies mount, and no one can do anything about it. What I conclude from this is that the average person lives with a complete mental disconnect when it comes to government. We don’t like dealing with it. We know the truth in our hearts. And yet we keep suspending our incredulity on the belief that government must be doing some wonderful thing somewhere even if we don’t experience it ourselves. Government promises always fall short. Even worse, government wrecks what it touches. Wars increase violence. Moral crusades produce opposite results. Cultural planning backfires. Welfare programs break and fail to serve. Monetary policy from the Fed yields massive financial distortions. Government efforts to protect industry lead to inefficiency, shutdowns, and stagnation. Government security makes us less secure and subjects us to scary regiments of spooks and thugs. In other areas of life, we are seeing the rise of massive innovation in the private sector that shows the failure of government. Large companies are generating their own power. Global digital money is making new inroads. Local zoning laws and taxi monopolies are being strained by private initiative. And the daily excitement about private communication systems is breaking down the capacity of political elites to control the conversation. The tendency toward loss of political control has inspired new, more extreme, and more obscurantist forms of selling state control to us. As the dynamics of public vs. private continue to shift, we can look forward to ever more obfuscation about the reality of displacing market forces. But once you see what’s going on you, can’t unsee it. The most effective path toward helping others see too is simple: name the state. The bitter truth about most public policies being sold by the political class is that they give them more power to control our lives. If you favor some of these policies, be honest with the rest of us about what you mean, so that we can make more clear-headed judgments about the kind of society we want to live in. Tags "

""Everybody on the team actually wants to get this built,"" said Marc Collins, the CEO of Oceanix, a company that builds floating structures. ""We're not just theorizing."" The company believes a floating city project would address both dire housing shortages and threats from rising sea levels. The structures themselves would be designed to withstand all sorts of natural disasters, including floods, tsunamis, and Category 5 hurricanes.

If you follow Donald Trump’s tweets, you’re aware that Saturday morning is usually one of his quietest times. In fact it’s the rare morning he doesn’t typically explode in a semi-coherent ball of rage. But this morning, with Trump’s scandals now rapidly closing in on him from all sides, Trump’s morning went very differently. He posted one increasingly berserk tweet after another, and he gave some things away in the process.
Trump started it all with this nonsense: “I have not read the Mueller Report yet, even though I have every right to do so. Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion. Likewise, recommendations made to our great A.G. who found No Obstruction. 13 Angry Trump hating Dems (later brought to 18) given two years and $30 million, and they found No Collusion, No Obstruction. But the Democrats, no matter what we give them, will NEVER be satisfied. A total waste of time.” He then went on to quote one of his sycophants who said “Enough, America has had enough. What have you accomplished. Public is fed up.”
Trump is right when he says that the “public is fed up” – he just has it backwards. The polls all show that the majority of Americans are fed up with him in general, and the majority of Americans are fed up with his attempts at suppressing the Mueller report. But Trump was just getting started with his lies about the Mueller report.
Trump continued with a meltdown that didn’t contain a single true word: “So, let’s get this straight! There was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back against something I knew never existed, Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous!) – No Obstruction. This Russia Hoax must never happen to another President, and Law Enforcement must find out, HOW DID IT START?”
To be clear, “I just fought back” is literally a confession to felony obstruction of justice. When he’s someday on trial for obstruction, this tweet will be used against him as evidence in a court of law, and it’ll help ensure his conviction. Donald Trump is going to prison in the end. The only two questions are what path ends up taking him there, and how much more damage he can do to America on his way down. "
Planned Parenthood Exec Turned Pro-Life Advocate Abby Johnson Challenges Alyssa Milano On Abortion | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45639/planned-parenthood-exec-turned-pro-life-advocate-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Planned Parenthood Exec Turned Pro-Life Advocate Abby Johnson Challenges Alyssa Milano On Abortion Photo by Maury Phillips/Getty Images for Unplanned Movie, LLC//Photo by Gregg DeGuire/WireImage April 6, 2019 views
On Friday, Planned Parenthood executive turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson challenged actress Alyssa Milano over her efforts to expand abortion, most recently in the state of Georgia.
Johnson, who wrote the memoir which the pro-life film ""Unplanned"" is based on, essentially told Milano and her ""tiny bun"" to go see the film or shut her mouth.
""I’m hoping that Alyssa Milano will muster up the courage to go see the ""Unplanned"" movie,"" Johnson posted on Twitter, tagging the actress.
The fiery Texan added, ""If you are willing to advocate for abortion, but unwilling to actually see what you support, then you and your tiny bun really have no relevancy in this conversation."" I’m hoping that @Alyssa_Milano will muster up the courage to go see the @UnplannedMovie . If you are willing to advocate for abortion, but unwilling to actually see what you support, then you and your tiny bun really have no relevancy in this conversation. — Abby Johnson (@AbbyJohnson) April 5, 2019
To the shock of absolutely no one, Milano has yet to respond to Johnson, though the tweet has racked up close to 25,000 likes as of Saturday morning.
The former ""Who's the Boss"" actress has made herself the face of a campaign to stop a pro-life bill in Georgia, H.B. 481, the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act, dubbed the ""heartbeat bill."" The legislation, which is awaiting signature from Governor Brian Kemp (R-GA), will make it a crime to murder unborn children with a detectable heartbeat, which typically happens around six weeks gestation.
In a letter penned by Milano and signed by some 50 actors, Hollywood elites are threatening to boycott the state if the heartbeat bill passes.
""We can’t imagine being elected officials who had to say to their constituents, “I enacted a law that was so evil, it chased billions of dollars out of our state’s economy.” It’s not the most effective campaign slogan, but rest assured we’ll make it yours should it come to pass,"" the letter threatens . ""This is the precipice on which you stand."" I will be supporting the women of Georgia as we stand in solidarity for all women’s rights and hand deliver the below letter to Brian Kemp at 5pm EST this evening. I will broadcast live here on Twitter. #WeWontGoBack pic.twitter.com/gcZqlrW2kB — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 2, 2019
Johnson actually had a more direct reply to this on Facebook last week.
""You know, these actors who keep saying they are going to boycott certain states because they are trying to ban abortion...I just don’t believe them,"" posted the pro-life advocate. ""I mean, I wish they would just go ahead and do it. They said they were going to leave the country after Trump was elected and they are still flipping here. Just go away already! Stop getting our hopes up! And while they are at it, stay out of Texas, too.""
As stated on her website, Johnson spent eight years at the abortion mill, quickly rising through the ranks to become the company’s youngest clinic director at the time. She began to notice that ""[a]bortion was a product Planned Parenthood was selling, not an unfortunate necessity they were fighting to decrease.” In October 2009, Johnson resigned after assisting with an ultrasound-guided abortion of a 13-week-old baby.
“At that moment, she fully realized what abortion actually was and what she had dedicated her life to,” says the site. “As it washed over Abby, a dramatic transformation had occurred. Desperate and confused, Abby sought help from a local pro-life group. She swore that she would begin to advocate for life in the womb and expose abortion for what it truly is.”
“Unplanned” has exploded at the box office despite large TV networks refusing to run the film’s ads, big tech censorship, and a controversial “R” rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).
Milano claims to believe women, to care about “issues plaguing humanity,” but, as of now, she has yet to listen to the other side of the abortion debate, notably from a woman who’s experienced the horrors of abortion and its industry firsthand. "

ISLAMABAD, Apr 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan Saturday termed the raid of National Accountability Bureau team at Hamza Shahbaz 's residence legitimate and as per law.
Talking to a private news channel, he said National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) team conducted raid at Hamza's residence after obtaining arrest warrant order.
NAB was working independently without any pressure, he added.
Ali said Hamza Shahbaz should surrender himself before the law instead of hiding in his house and using his family members as shield.
The minister expressed the commitment that the accountability process would reach to its logical conclusion, putting foundation of a prosperous country.
He said recovery of the national kitty plundered by the corrupt elements was imperative to improve economic condition of the country.
He said Sharif brothers wanted that they should not be asked about the money plundered by them. But, he said, they would either have to return the looted money or face the cases of corruption .
The minister while criticizing the previous governments, said their policies had taken the country near to bankruptcy.
However, the PTI government 's initiatives were gradually bringing the economy back on track, he added."

PARIS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Libyan crisis cannot be resolved through ""a military victory"" as political settlement remains the only option in light of growing tensions in the Maghreb country, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Saturday.
On Thursday, France , jointly with Italy , the United States , the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates expressed concern over the latest outbreak of fighting in Libya .

The solution can only be a political one,"" Le Drian said at a press conference closing the meeting of G7 foreign ministers in France .
The political solution for Libyan crisis includes calling a national conference and a subsequent holding of elections, the French foreign minister noted.
""Now, for all of this to happen in a calm setting, we need many elements of the present situation to stop, and different players to restrain themselves,"" Le Drian underlined.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the commander of forces loyal to East Libya-based government , ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA)-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-supported government Fayez Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary."

PARIS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Libyan crisis cannot be resolved through ""a military victory"" as political settlement remains the only option in light of growing tensions in the Maghreb country, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Saturday.
On Thursday, France , jointly with Italy , the United States , the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates expressed concern over the latest outbreak of fighting in Libya .
""In Libya , we know what needs to be done. Yesterday evening, we set forth the communique with no difficulty. There is one basic principle which that in Libya there will not be a military victory. The solution can only be a political one,"" Le Drian said at a press conference closing the meeting of G7 foreign ministers in France .
The political solution for Libyan crisis includes calling a national conference and a subsequent holding of elections, the French foreign minister noted.
""Now, for all of this to happen in a calm setting, we need many elements of the present situation to stop, and different players to restrain themselves,"" Le Drian underlined.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the commander of forces loyal to East Libya-based government , ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA)-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-supported government Fayez Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary."

Aintree, United Kingdom, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Tiger Roll put his name alongside legend Red Rum on Saturday, winning back-to-back Grand Nationals in stunning style.
The 4-1 favourite, superbly ridden by Davy Russell, took up the running at the last fence, and although 66-1 outsider Magic of Light came back at him, the nine-year-old had enough to spare to emulate Red Rum's feat in 1973-74.
The 39-year-old Russell pumped his arms in delight and got a huge hug from trainer Gordon Elliott as the 70,000 crowd -- with a group dressed up as tigers -- raised the roof as jockey, trainer and horse returned to the winners enclosure.
""To win two successive Grand Nationals at my age, you could scarcely believe it,"" said Russell.
Russell -- whose father was present -- had dedicated his win last year to his late mother and recalled her again as the achievement began to sink in.
""She saw us through the good, the bad and the ugly. She was one heck of a lady,"" he said.
As Russell, who at one point in his career was fired by owner Michael O'Leary, waved his arms in celebration, Elliott, normally unreadable, was sobbing.
""I don't get upset very often... but this is unbelievable,"" said Elliott, who was winning his third Grand National.
""He is a tiger.
""Last year's win was for Davy's mum who had died , this year it is for my uncle (Willie) who died ."" O'Leary insisted that it was not about him making history.
""It is not me making history it is Gordon, Davy and the horse,"" he said.
""We have a once-in-a-lifetime horse who has given us a twice-in-a-lifetime experience."" The Ryanair chief's brother, Eddie, who buys his horses, summed Tiger Roll up simply.
""He is now a superstar."" - 'It was some thrill' - Two-and-three-quarter lengths behind Tiger Roll, Magic of Light put up a remarkable performance under Paddy Kennedy, lying up with the leaders throughout.
Having had an 11-year career, Kennedy only qualified to take part in the National in February , when he rode his 10th winner over fences.
Despite two terrible errors, including one at the usually formidable Chair, she was given an assured ride by Kennedy to come close to becoming the first mare to win the National since Nickel Coin in 1951.
""I didn't expect her to run that well,"" said her trainer Jessica Harrington, who at 72 was having her first runner in the race .
""She's only eight, was the only mare in the race -- it was some thrill."" Rathvinden had also been prominent throughout under Ruby Walsh and came in third for an Irish 1-2-3, with Walk in the Mill saving English honour by taking fourth.
""It was a lot of fun, just travelled really well... jumped for fun,"" said Walk in the Mill's jockey James Best .
""I did not see Tiger Roll till the last three fences. What a horse. What a ride by Davy.
""Great thrill."" Sadly for Rathvinden's trainer Willie Mullins, his Up For Review suffered a fatal injury when he was brought down at the first fence by the fancied Vintage Clouds.
Of the other fancied horses, top weight Anibale Fly made a bad mistake towards the end of the first circuit and ran on to finish fifth, with the 2017 winner One For Arthur sixth.
However, for champion jockey Richard Johnson, there would be no elusive first National, as on a record 21st ride, his mount Rock the Kasbah never looked at ease and came to grief early on the second circuit.
Last year's runner-up Pleasant Company also fell on the second circuit while looking dangerous.
There was to be no joy either for the two female jockeys bidding to become the first woman rider to win the great race .
Rachael Blackmore finished 10th on Valseur Lido, as Lizzie Kelly's well-backed Tea For Two failed to finish."

The members of Congress said in a joint statement from their offices that they were told they would be ""denied entry to the refugee resettlement facility in Homestead, [Fla.],"" which they planned to visit Monday, ""despite a new law mandating Congressional access there, and a recent announcement of plans to massively expand beds at the site amid lingering concerns over inadequate staffing, space and other services there."" In their joint statement, the lawmakers expressed concerns about the facility. ""During our last visit to Homestead, we witnessed children living in cramped, prison-like conditions,"" they said. ""The idea to force even more children into an already full detention facility is not only unsafe, but is cruel and violates basic tenets of human decency."" The Hill has reached out to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and the Department of Health and Human Services for comment. HHS confirmed the denial to access. “We have had significant interest for facility visits. To ensure a facility visit does not interfere with the safety and well-being of our [children], we require a minimum two-week notification at the convenience and availability of the facility. This has been policy since 2015,” the department told the Miami Herald in a statement Saturday. The Department of Health and Human Services announced Monday that it would expand the number of beds at the Homestead facility from 2,350 to 3,200 beginning in mid-April."

Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Former New Zealand international Malakai Fekitoa scored twice as Toulon ended Toulouse 's record 14-match unbeaten run in the French Top 14 with a 25-10 victory on Saturday.
Fekitoa, 26, dotted down after JP Pietersen's early try as the home side controlled a match played in greasy conditions at Marseille 's Velodrome.
Toulouse failed to make the most of a one-man advantage for the final 25 minutes after the home side's prop Florian Fresia was sent off for punching Lucas Tauzin.
The league leaders' last loss was against champions Castres in September . Their recent good form has propelled them to the top of the table and into a European Champions Cup semi-final, where they will face Leinster on April 21.
""It's our worst match for at least five months, it's just reward for Toulon who bring our run to an end,"" Toulouse forwards coach William Servat said.
""Today we failed to produce good play, we lacked energy, we were confronted physically by Toulon and we couldn't match it,"" he added.
Toulon backs coach Sebastien Tillous-Borde praised his outfit's ability to win without the red-carded Fresia.
""We adapted well to the weather conditions especially in the second-half when we were down to 14 men. It was a great performance,"" he said.
Toulon's Francois Trinh-Duc opened the scoring on four minutes with a penalty before Romain Ntamack replied with one of his own six minutes later.
The visitors made the most of their domination as South African Pietersen, playing at full back, crashed over for his third try of the season.
- Fekitoa on fire - Toulouse struggled as a soap-bar ball at the Velodrome restricted their free-flowing off-load game.
The home side made the most of a Toulouse handling error on 32 minutes.
Ex-All Black Fekitoa picked up the loose possession in his own half and passed wide.
Fiji winger Josua Tuisova made a break before finding Fekitoa on his inside for a try that stretched the advantage to 15-3 after Trinh-Duc's second succesful conversion.
Toulon were down to 14 seconds before the break as Tuisova was sin-binned for a high tackle on centre Theo Belan.
The slow second half sparked into life after 15 minutes. A powerful tackle by Toulon 's Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb provoked a scuffle.
Webb's teammate Fresia went face-to-face with Toulouse 's Tauzin and punched the winger to earn a red card.
Despite being down a man , Toulon continued to dominate.
Fekitoa, who is leaving for Wasps after the season, went over for his second try with 17 minutes to go.
He ran a powerful line, collected a Webb pass from the base of a scrum and touched down. Before Saturday he had only scored one Top 14 try all season.
France fly-half Anthony Belleau added a three-pointer five minutes later put Toulon 25-3 ahead.
Toulouse denied Toulon a bonus point with a 77th minute Pierre Pages try .
The game ended with the 50,000 crowd performing Mexican waves in the drizzling rain.
Elsewhere, one-from bottom Grenoble beat Stade Francais 21-17 as Piet van Zyl claimed a late bonus point for the Parisians.
Bordeaux-Begles solidified their hold on a play-off spot overcoming relegation-threatened Perpignan 31-22 and resurgent Montpellier hammered Agen 33-17.

Johannesburg, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa stunned record eight-time trophy holders Al Ahly of Egypt 5-0 Saturday in the first leg of a CAF Champions League quarter-final near Pretoria .
It was the heaviest defeat suffered by the Cairo Red Devils in a CAF match and leaves them with virtually no chance in the second leg next weekend.
Themba Zwane and Wayne Arendse scored to give the hosts a 2-0 half-time advantage at a packed 25,000-seat Lucas 'Masterpieces' Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville.
Brazilian Ricardo Nascimento converted a penalty two minutes into the second half and goals from Uruguayan Gaston Sirino and Ahly reject Phakamani Mahlambi completed the rout.
The clubs meet again next Saturday in Egypt and Ahly will have to score at least five goals to have a chance of avoiding elimination from the elite African club competition.
Beating Ahly, who have also won a record 19 CAF titles, by such a wide margin was beyond the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic Sundowns supporter.
Most believed a two-goal advantage and not conceding at home was the best the shock 2016 Champions League winners could hope for against such vaunted opponents.
Ahly have suffered several three-goal defeats since making their debut in the competition 43 years ago, but this humiliation puts the future of Uruguayan coach Martin Lasarte in doubt.
He took over this year from Frenchman Patrice Carteron, who was sacked after Ahly surrendered a 3-1 first-leg lead to lose the 2018 final against Esperance of Tunisia .
""We had a very bad match today, and we need to work hard in the coming period to fix many things,"" Lasarte told the Ahly website after the debacle.
""I apologise to Ahly fans, both those who were at the stadium or following via television .
""There is no time to talk about anything now, and we only have to work and focus on what is ahead."" BeIn Sport pundit and former star Ahly centre-back Wael Gomaa called the five-goal thrashing in South Africa a ""disgrace"".
Gomaa was part of the star-studded Ahly side that reached four consecutive Champions League finals from 2005, winning three.
In Dar es Salaam , Simba SC of Tanzania were held 0-0 by five-time champions TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
While the result confirms Mazembe as favourites to win the tie, they will tread warily after what occurred at the same stage last season.
Having forced a 0-0 draw at Primeiro Agosto of Angola , the Congolese side missed two penalties and had two goals disallowed in a second leg that ended 1-1 and they were eliminated on away goals.

""In Libya , we know what needs to be done. Yesterday evening, we set forth the communique with no difficulty. There is one basic principle which that in Libya there will not be a military victory. The solution can only be a political one,"" Le Drian said at a press conference closing the meeting of G7 foreign ministers in France .
The political solution for Libyan crisis includes calling a national conference and a subsequent holding of elections, the French foreign minister noted.
""Now, for all of this to happen in a calm setting, we need many elements of the present situation to stop, and different players to restrain themselves,"" Le Drian underlined.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the commander of forces loyal to East Libya-based government , ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA)-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-supported government Fayez Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary."

Madrid, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Zinedine Zidane refused to guarantee Gareth Bale's future at Real Madrid after the Welshman struggled again in a 2-1 victory over Eibar on Saturday.
Karim Benzema scored twice at the Santiago Bernabeu as Madrid came from behind after Marc Cardona, starting only after an injury to Pedro Leon in the warm-up, gave Eibar a surprise lead .
But Madrid improved and a pair of Benzema headers ensured the groans and whistles that had soured the atmosphere for much of the opening hour turned to cheers and applause at the end.
Much of the frustration was again directed at Bale, who started here after being dropped by Zidane for the defeat to Valencia on Wednesday.
Asked afterwards if Bale would be at Real Madrid next season, Zidane said: ""We'll see, I'm not going to tell you what's going to happen. Gareth is a Real Madrid player, he has two years left on his contract. We will see. It is not the time to talk about this."" Bale's below-par performances and a lack of support from either coach or fans seem so inter-linked now, it is difficult to know what comes first. He departed again to whistles with 14 minutes left, a conciliatory hand slap from Zidane offering little consolation as he trudged off.
Benzema's trajectory has been the opposite, the Frenchman now with six goals in five La Liga games, four of them since Zidane took over.
""Karim has had a great season,"" Zidane said. ""His goals have perhaps changed people's perception of him. But he has never changed as a player."" Madrid 's win means they are 10 points adrift of leaders Barcelona and two behind Atletico Madrid . Barca and Atletico play each other later on Saturday. Eibar stay 11th.
Zidane has insisted his players are not on trial but his changing line-ups at least suggest he is examining his options before the summer.
This time Sergio Ramos was rested, while Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Lucas Vazquez also dropped out. In came Nacho, Federico Valverde, Isco and Bale.
Bale's half began badly as he failed to control Valverde's overhit pass and then got worse as he missed a one-on-one when his finish was saved by Marko Dmitrovic.
-- Chorus of whistles -- The scattering of whistles became a chorus after he dragged a shot wide from 25 yards and it was no surprise his confidence drained away, a poor touch following shortly after.
Bale was not the only one. Madrid lacked precision or purpose, as opponents were allowed through unchecked and passes went astray.
In the 39th minute, as the fans' frustration was reaching its peak, Eibar scored, a crisp move down the left ending with a cute pass from Gonzalo Escalante to Cardona, who chipped into the net.
The second half started better for Madrid , with Benzema scoring only to be called back for offside before the Frenchman headed in the equaliser just before the hour. Marco Asensio did brilliantly to weave into space and dig out the cross.
Bale might have been in but Asensio's pass struck the back of his heel and the Welshman departed with 14 minutes left, to disgruntled whistles.
Madrid scored the winner without him. Kroos' whipped cross was again met by the forehead of Benzema and, again, the ball found the net.
Benzema should have completed his hat-trick late on but one finish was palmed away by Dmitrovic and another, with the goal gaping, looped over. He even hit the post with a bending effort in injury-time. The treble was not to be."

Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Lyon slipped to a second damaging defeat this week as a 3-1 loss to struggling Dijon and a hostile atmosphere at the Groupama Stadium piled the pressure on Bruno Genesio on Saturday.
The 52-year-old coach had been told by president Jean-Michel Aulas that he would be offered a two-year contract extension if Lyon reached the French Cup final and finished in the Ligue 1 top three.
But a 3-2 Cup semi-final defeat by Rennes on Tuesday put his future in doubt, and fans on Saturday unfurled banners calling for Genesio's departure.
""We had already been eliminated on Tuesday. It's unacceptable,"" said goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, who added that the players need to put Genesio's unstable situation to the back of their minds.
""We are professionals. We must know what to do. We know that it's football . Part of the decision on the (future of the) coach was made on Tuesday but we must know how to ignore all that.
""The truth is on the pitch. If we don't turn up on the pitch it can only be difficult in the future."" Martin Terrier's first-minute goal briefly placated the home support, but only six minutes later Lyon were behind.
Wesley Said danced through the hapless home defence to slot in a third-minute equaliser, before his speculative long-range effort was deflected past Lopes by Lyon centre-back Marcelo.
Genesio's beleaguered men never seriously threatened a response and put paid to their own hopes in comical circumstances midway through the second half.
Said's pull-back was inadvertently backheeled into the net by Lyon full-back Rafael, with the spin on the ball leaving Lopes grasping at thin air.
The result leaves Lyon only seven points clear of Saint-Etienne in the third and final Champions League spot, with Les Verts visiting Amiens later on Saturday.
A first league win since January lifted Dijon off the foot of the table and into the relegation play-off place."

Caracas, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Opposition supporters thronged the streets of Caracas and other cities on Saturday in protest against the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, as massive blackouts and the collapse of water supplies further exacerbated a growing political crisis.
The United States meanwhile stiffened its economic sanctions against the government , and one top US official on Saturday warned Venezuela 's military that it must protect the rights of peaceful protesters.
Late Friday, opposition leader Juan Guaido -- who is supported in his claim to be the legitimate interim leader by around 50 nations -- called for a huge turnout in Caracas , announcing in a phone message to supporters the start of ""the greatest escalation of pressure we have seen in our history."" Two opposition deputies were detained in an anti-government protest in the western city of Maracaibo , fellow legislator Adriana Pichardo said, denouncing the arrests as a violation of parliamentary immunity .
Deputy Elimar Diaz, who joined the Maracaibo protest , told AFP the protest there had encountered ""brutal repression,"" including the use of tanks and the firing of tear gas canisters from helicopters.
He said people in the area were going ""days without electricity "" amid ""inhumane rationing"" by the government .
Maduro, who blames US-backed sabotage for the massive blackouts that have deprived millions of power, called for a counter pro-government march ""in defense of peace"" that drew hundreds to the streets of Caracas .
- Crumbling economy - Facing intense pressure at home and abroad, the Maduro government has sought to weaken Guaido's position.
The government has stripped him of his parliamentary immunity , authorized his prosecution for proclaiming himself acting president in January and has banned him from holding public office for 15 years.
Guaido said earlier this week he feared abduction by government agents.
The United States meanwhile kept up the international pressure on Maduro to step down.
Vice President Mike Pence announced fresh sanctions against 34 vessels belonging to Venezuela 's state oil company and two companies that ship crude to Cuba .
He said in a speech in Houston that ""the United States will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy ."" ""Those looking on should know this: all options are on the table. And Nicolas Maduro would do well not to test the resolve of the United States of America."" ""This is only a first step,"" US national security advisor John Bolton tweeted on Saturday in reference to the sanctions.
He cautioned Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino in a separate tweet of his ""constitutional responsibility to protect innocent civilians who are peacefully demonstrating,"" adding: ""Do not let the Cubans or the 'colectivos' inflict violence against Venezuelan patriots."" The ""colectivos"" are armed paramilitary groups that support Maduro and are accused by the opposition of often resorting to violence.
- Security Council to meet - Maduro enjoys important backing from his nation's military as well as from China and Russia -- which on March 23 sent two heavily loaded military planes to Caracas -- as he clings to power.
The US and its allies view the socialist president as illegitimate since he took office in January for a second six-year term following elections seen as deeply flawed.
With its crude exports collapsing and international sanctions piling up, Venezuela 's country's oil economy has crumbled. Malnutrition and disease are on the rise as living conditions plummet.
In the face of the worsening humanitarian crisis, the US has convened a session of the UN Security Council for Wednesday.
Since Venezuela 's massive blackout of March 7, the country has been subject to intermittent power cuts, with power being rationed outside of Caracas .
The blackouts have knocked out water supplies as well as transport and communications, forcing many people to trim their work days to six hours.
""We are tired,"" said Verony Mendez, 48, whose water was cut off two months ago.
""But we have to take to the streets because it is the only way to get these people out!"" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Glasgow, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A tense Scottish derby between Hibernian and Edinburgh rivals Hearts was disrupted on Saturday -- by a coconut.
Hibs came from behind at Tynecastle to win 2-1 but the game was marred by crowd trouble including a coconut, thrown on to the pitch in the wake of Daryl Horgan's 28th-minute equaliser.
The winger scored again early in the second half to complete the Hibs comeback.
Smoke bombs -- in the two clubs' colours of maroon and green -- were also hurled on to the pitch before and during the first half, in which Peter Haring gave Hearts the lead .
Meanwhile, Celtic's charge towards another Scottish Premiership title was delayed by a surprise 0-0 draw against Livingston .
Neil Lennon's side were frustrated by a string of first-half saves from Livingston keeper Liam Kelly as the visitors dug in for a point at Parkhead.
Celtic remain well on course to win an eighth successive Scottish title despite the frustrating result .
The champions sit 14 points clear of Rangers , who travel to Motherwell on Sunday , but will have to wait at least two weeks for their inevitable coronation.
Third-placed Kilmarnock moved to within five points of Rangers with a 2-0 win over 10-man St Johnstone.
An own goal from Christopher Kane after 17 minutes set the hosts on their way, with Kris Boyd doubling their lead from the penalty spot two minutes before the break.
St Johnstone's misery was complete when Jason Kerr was sent off for a second yellow card in the 68th minute.
Aberdeen joined Killie on 58 points thanks to a 2-0 win at basement boys Dundee , who slipped three points adrift at the foot of the table.
Sam Cosgrove's 59th-minute penalty broke the deadlock. He made it two in the 77th minute.
Second-bottom St Mirren gave themselves hope of a relegation play-off spot as they came from behind to draw 1-1 at Hamilton .
Steve Davies put Hamilton ahead after 63 minutes, but Anders Dreyer levelled with a penalty three minutes later."

London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Ashley Barnes went from zero to hero as Burnley boosted their bid for Premier League survival with a crucial 3-1 win against Bournemouth on Saturday.
Sean Dyche's side made the worst possible start at Dean Court when Barnes headed into his own net as he tried to clear under pressure from Bournemouth 's Nathan Ake in the fourth minute.
However, Burnley were gifted an equaliser in the 18th minute as Bournemouth keeper Asmir Begovic let Ashley Westwood's corner go straight through his hands and Chris Wood nodded in at the far post .
Inspired by the New Zealand forward's 11th goal this season, the Clarets struck again two minutes later, with Westwood firing home after Chris Mepham failed to clear Dwight McNeil's cross.
Burnley were well on top and Barnes struck at the right end in the 57th minute.
Once again Begovic was guilty of poor handling, allowing the ball to slip to Wood, who laid it back for Barnes to slot into the empty net.
Burnley are eight points clear of the relegation zone, and although third bottom Cardiff have a game in hand, Dyche's men have taken a major step towards staying up.
""There was no nervousness and we stayed clear-minded. We had some real moments of quality too,"" Dyche said.
""Twenty-four points since Christmas is a very strong return. It puts us in a much healthier situation than we were two games ago. We want to finish the season well."" Leicester powered to a 4-1 rout of relegated Huddersfield as Brendan Rodgers' side moved into seventh.

Vardy doubled Leicester 's lead three minutes after half-time, collecting Ricardo Pereira 's cross and slotting home after rounding keeper Ben Hamer.
Huddersfield midfielder Aaron Mooy reduced the deficit with a 52nd minute penalty controversially awarded for Caglar Soyuncu's challenge on Karlan Grant.
James Maddison put the result beyond doubt with a fine free-kick in the 79th minute.

Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Thousands of ""yellow vest"" protesters marched Saturday for the 21st consecutive week to denounce French government policies, as the authorities prepare to unveil the results of a nationwide consultative exercise designed to address public grievances.
From Rouen in the north and Lyon in the southeast -- as well as the capital Paris -- protesters took to the streets carrying banners denouncing French President Emmanuel Macron. In the west, French and German activists joined forces on the border .
Some masked protestors clashed with police in Rouen , but there was nothing like the scale of violence seen in previous weeks' protests, such as the March 16 riots in Paris that saw luxury stores on the Champs-Elysees ransacked.
Interior ministry figures -- consistently dismissed as underestimates by the protesters -- put the turnout across France at 6,300 at 2:00 pm (1300 GMT) of which 3,100 were in Paris .
That was significantly down on the 282,000 who turned out for the first yellow vest rally in November last year -- but many of the remaining activists have made it clear they will keep marching until they get satisfaction from the government .
""What will get me to stop, is the resignation of ( Interior Minister Christophe) Castaner, because of the police violence,"" said Catherine, 59, a demonstrator in Paris .
Castaner has been heavily criticised both by yellow vest activists and opposition politicians for having played down reports of police violence despite growing numbers of serious injuries among protesters.
- Results of consultation - Next week, the government will announce the results of the ""Great National Debate"", a series of town hall meetings launched across France in January to take the temperature of the nation -- and get Emmanuel Macron's troubled presidency back on course.
The idea is to collate grievances and decide on solutions. Macron's office said the president would announce the first measures to be taken by the middle of April .
Many yellow vest activists have denounced the exercise as a smoke screen designed to take their movement off the streets.
And an opinion poll published Thursday by pollsters Delabre suggested that the public was not convinced either. Of 1,002 surveyed, 68 percent did not think that people's views would be taken into account; 79 percent did not think it would resolve the current political crisis.
The government received another setback last Thursday when France 's Constitutional Council struck down a measure that would have let authorities ban certain individuals from protesting.
It was a key element of the government 's plan to crack down on violence at ""yellow vest"" demonstrations, but the council, which rules on the validity of laws, said the proposal gave officials ""excessive latitude"".
A new law will nevertheless allow the authorities to impose heavy fines on people organising unauthorised demonstrations and for anyone covering their face during a protest .
France has been rocked by months of weekly Saturday protests by the yellow vests, which emerged over fuel taxes before snowballing into a broad revolt against Macron.

Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Brazilian football legend Pele, who has been in hospital in Paris , will return to Brazil on Monday, his advisor told AFP on Saturday.
""We're going back to Sao Paulo on Monday,"" said the advisor, without providing any more details.
The three-time World Cup winner was admitted to a Paris hospital with a urinary tract infection on Wednesday, the day after appearing at a promotional event with France striker Kylian Mbappe.
The hospital has not said when the 78-year-old will be discharged.
Brazilian news website G1 reported that Pele had intended to come out of hospital on Saturday to return to Brazil but had been delayed by further tests and would stay under observation until he was 100 percent.
The infection was not serious and was under control, according to members of Pele's entourage.
""Thank you so much for all the love! The antibiotics are working,"" Pele tweeted on Friday. ""I'm feeling much better and I think I'm ready to play again!"" The event in Paris was originally scheduled for November but the Brazilian ""was not in a position to travel "".
Pele has had several health issues in recent years.
A similar infection put him in intensive care in November 2014.
In 2016 , Pele, who played 1,363 professional matches scoring 1,281 goals, was unable to light the flame at the Rio Olympics because of severe pain in the hip.
""I was not physically fit to participate in the opening of the Games,"" he said at the time.
In January 2018 , he cancelled a trip to London fearing a ""stressful"" and ""tiring"" journey."

London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Ashley Barnes went from zero to hero as Burnley boosted their bid for Premier League survival with a crucial 3-1 win against Bournemouth on Saturday.
Sean Dyche's side made the worst possible start at Dean Court when Barnes headed into his own net as he tried to clear under pressure from Bournemouth 's Nathan Ake in the fourth minute.
However, Burnley were gifted an equaliser in the 18th minute as Bournemouth keeper Asmir Begovic let Ashley Westwood's corner go straight through his hands and Chris Wood nodded in at the far post .
Inspired by the New Zealand forward's 11th goal this season, the Clarets struck again two minutes later, with Westwood firing home after Chris Mepham failed to clear Dwight McNeil's cross.
Burnley were well on top and Barnes struck at the right end in the 57th minute.
Once again Begovic was guilty of poor handling, allowing the ball to slip to Wood, who laid it back for Barnes to slot into the empty net.
Burnley are eight points clear of the relegation zone, and although third bottom Cardiff have a game in hand, Dyche's men have taken a major step towards staying up.
Leicester powered to a 4-1 rout of relegated Huddersfield as Brendan Rodgers' side moved into seventh.
Youri Tielemans put Leicester ahead at the John Smith's Stadium with his second goal since joining on loan from Monaco .
The Belgian midfielder netted with a deflected strike from the edge of the area after Huddersfield were unable to clear Jamie Vardy's miscued shot in the 24th minute.
Vardy doubled Leicester 's lead three minutes after half-time, collecting Ricardo Pereira 's cross and slotting home after rounding keeper Ben Hamer.
Huddersfield midfielder Aaron Mooy reduced the deficit with a 52nd minute penalty controversially awarded for Caglar Soyuncu's challenge on Karlan Grant.
James Maddison put the result beyond doubt with a fine free-kick in the 79th minute.
Bottom of the table Huddersfield, playing their first home match since relegation was confirmed, endured one last blow when Vardy stroked in an 84th minute penalty after the England striker was brought down by Terrence Kongolo .
Luka Milivojevic extended his superb penalty record as Crystal Palace won 1-0 at Newcastle to climb 11 points clear of the bottom three.
Newcastle defender Florian Lejeune was stretchered off with his left knee heavily strapped after a nasty second half collision with Andros Townsend that left him needing a hospital scan.

Fekitoa, 26, dotted down after JP Pietersen's early try as the home side controlled a match played in greasy conditions at Marseille 's Velodrome.
Toulouse failed to make the most of a one-man advantage for the final 25 minutes after the home side's prop Florian Fresia was sent off for punching Lucas Tauzin.
The league leaders' last loss was against champions Castres in September . Their recent good form has propelled them to the top of the table and into a European Champions Cup semi-final, where they will face Leinster on April 21.
""It's our worst match for at least five months, it's just reward for Toulon who bring our run to an end,"" Toulouse forwards coach Yannick Bru said.
""Today we failed to produce good play, we lacked energy, we were confronted physically by Toulon and we couldn't match it,"" he added.
Toulon coach Sebastien Tillous-Borde praised his outfit's ability to win without the red-carded Fresia.
""We adapted well to the weather conditions especially in the second-half when we were down to 14 men. It was a great performance,"" he said.
Toulon's Francois Trinh-Duc opened the scoring on four minutes with a penalty before Romain Ntamack replied with one of his own six minutes later.
The visitors made the most of their domination as South African Pietersen, playing at full back, crashed over for his third try of the season.
Toulouse struggled as a soap-bar ball at the Velodrome restricted their free-flowing off-load game.
The home side made the most of a Toulouse handling error on 32 minutes.
Ex-All Black Fekitoa picked up the loose possession in his own half and passed wide.
Fiji winger Josua Tuisova made a break before finding Fekitoa on his inside for a try that stretched the advantage to 15-3 after Trinh-Duc's second succesful conversion.
Toulon were down to 14 seconds before the break as Tuisova was sin-binned for a high tackle on centre Theo Belan.
The slow second half sparked into life after 15 minutes. A powerful tackle by Toulon 's Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb provoked a scuffle.
Webb's teammate Fresia went face-to-face with Toulouse 's Tauzin and punched the winger to earn a red card.
Despite being down a man , Toulon continued to dominate.
Fekitoa, who is leaving for Wasps after the season, went over for his second try with 17 minutes to go.
He ran a powerful line, collected a Webb pass from the base of a scrum and touched down. Before Saturday he had only scored one Top 14 try all season.
France fly-half Anthony Belleau added a three-pointer five minutes later put Toulon 25-3 ahead.
Toulouse denied Toulon a bonus point with a 77th minute Pierre Pages try .

Dinard, France, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :EU foreign ministers on Saturday upped pressure on Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar to halt his offensive on Tripoli , urging the strongman to commit to a political solution.
Khalifa's dramatic bid to take Tripoli came as a meeting of Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers was being held in northern France with the club issuing a statement on Friday urging an immediate halt to "" all military activity and movements toward Tripoli "".
Several European ministers on Saturday warned Haftar not to countenance any further military action, saying that this could destroy a UN-backed peace process.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the Tripoli operations as ""untimely initiatives"" that could further destabilise Libya .
""There is a fundamental principle in Libya . There will be no military victory. The solution can only be a political solution,"" he added.
He said that France and Italy , the two European powers with the most influence in north Africa , were ""on the same wavelength"".
""It is important that all of the international community takes the same line,"" Le Drian added.
Experts say Haftar had had backing from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia , as well as France , which is seen as his closest ally in Europe .
- 'Overcome past differences' - Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said that the G7 statement, which was also echoed by the UN Security Council, showed that the international community was not prepared to tolerate military action.
""We think the military initiatives are not the best ones to grant peaceful developments in Libya and a constructive path forward for stabilising the country,"" he said.
Asked if sanctions could be imposed against Haftar were he to fail to comply with the demands of the international community, he replied: ""We have stated quite clearly what our position is and we very much hope that he (Haftar) will take it into consideration. If this will not happen, then we can see what can next be done."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said there should be pressure on all the actors in Libya ""especially general Haftar"".
He said it was important to ""make sure that there is no further military escalation"".
The growing international pressure on Haftar came as fresh fighting flared Saturday south of Tripoli between the pro-government forces and Haftar's troops.
On Friday Haftar's forces were pushed back from a key checkpoint west of the capital, less than 24 hours after seizing it during the lightning offensive towards Tripoli .
Despite the flare-up, UN envoy Ghassan Salame insisted Saturday that talks planned to be held next week in Libya would go ahead.
Le Drian expressed particular frustration over the escalation given that Haftar and the head of the Tripoli-based government , Fayez al-Sarraj, had come to agreements earlier this year in talks in Abu Dhabi .
""They need now to overcome their past differences in the interest of the Libyan people. The Libyan people have had enough of this violence,"" the French minister said. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Augusta, United States, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Striking blows for gender equality with every swing, women players competed for a trophy for the first time Saturday at former men-only enclave Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters.
At a club that opened in 1933 but didn't admit its first women members until 2012, LPGA legends Pak Se Ri, Annika Sorenstam, Lorena Ochoa and Nancy Lopez hit ceremonial shots off the first tee to launch the historic final round of the inaugural Augusta National Women 's Amateur.
""It's just exciting to be a part of history,"" Lopez said. ""A day of history for us, for the amateurs that are here and for Augusta National."" A field of 72 played the first 36 holes at nearby Champions Retreat before the event moved to the famed Masters layout, with the top 30 advancing to the last 18 holes at Augusta National.
""It's a dream come true. I'm so happy for them,"" Sorenstam said. ""This has huge potential to not just inspire young girls but golfers, other women in sports and women in business ."" American Anna Redding , a University of Virginia senior, was the first competitor to tee off, eight strokes adrift of US leader Jennifer Kupcho, a Wake Forest University senior.
World women 's amateur number one Kupcho teed off on 5-under par with a one-stroke lead over Mexico 's Maria Fassi, a University of Arkansas senior, and American Kaitlyn Papp.
""They know how special it is,"" Ochoa said. ""Hitting that first tee shot is probably going to be the highlight of their career."" Augusta National's all-male status led to a 2003 protest across the street from the club but it was not until August 2012 when businesswoman Darla Moore and former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice were named the club's first women members.
Another move was 2014's debut of the Drive, Chip and Putt Championship, where young girls and boys won titles with a decisive putt on Augusta National's famed 18th green -- three Women 's Amateur players having taken part as youths.
Pak struck the first ceremonial tee shot followed in order by Ochoa, Lopez and Sorenstam, handling the duties in a similar fashion to how Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and the late Arnold Palmer have done at the Masters.
""First time in a long time I get nervous,"" Pak said. ""I have honor to lead .""""For them to kind of make us like Arnold, Jack and Gary , it's a real big honor to be here and hit that first shot,"" Lopez said.
Nicklaus tweeted his appreciation for women playing at Augusta , writing, ""Always considered Augusta National GC & @TheMasters the best at balancing respect for golf's history & tradition with innovative ways to grow our game. Inaugural @anwagolf is the latest great example."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

The Hague, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A campaign by the Dutch railway infrastructure operator to shock young people into responsible behaviour near rail tracks using ripped clothes to symbolise the mangled garb of victims hit by trains unleashed uproar on Saturday.
Operator ProRail said it used the controversial images to show the potential consequences of straying too close to railay lines.
But their ""Vict_m Fashion - created by accident "" strapline, accompanying ripped clothing was widely branded as shocking.
""I have expressed our surprise, displeasure and horror to the management of ProRail,"" the head of Dutch rail operator NS Marjan Rintel told ANP news agency, while drivers and politicians were also highly critical.
ProRail, which manages Dutch track infrastructure, launched the campaign Thursday, showing replicas of badly ripped garments -- some missing an entire shirt sleeve or trouser leg.
Other photos show shredded shoes and dresses. ProRail says the shocking images are necessary ""to wake young people up and give them a shake. "" The company said: ""Sadly, bad things still happen too often on and around railtracks because of lack of attention and recklessness,"" ProRail said.
It added it had ""deliberately"" set out to shock in a campaign aimed at 12- to 18-year-olds.
Deaths on and around Dutch railtracks have steadily risen in recent years from six in 2016 , to 12 in 2017 and 17 last year with minors among the fatalities.
ProRail said many accidents are down to people's attention being fixed on their smartphones.
While NS notably said it felt the nature of the campaign went too far, minister of infrastructure, Stientje van Veldhoven was slightly more measured in his criticism.
""Everyone favours less dangerous behaviour around railway tracks. And communication on this subject is important.
""But the campaign as it has been organised is unduly harsh for drivers (notably those who have witnessed accidents) and the relatives of those killed on the tracks,"" the minister said."

Controversy has swirled around Jared Kushner and the validity of his security clearance over the last few months. One of the main issues with Kushner’s clearance is that he constantly revises his financial information. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images
A Newsweek story from May of 2018 revealed that Kushner had revised the information at least 40 times at that point. The president’s son-in-law and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, are seemingly at it again. According a new report from CREW, Jared Kusher and Ivanka Trump have revised their financial disclosures 10 times over the last month alone.
The watchdog group says , “Kushner’s submission had to be revised five times, including four separate times this March, while Trump’s required eight updates, including on five occasions in March and once on April 2.”
These revisions are part of a continuous pattern for Kushner. Jordan Libowitz from CREW says , “It’s mind-boggling how someone can have that many errors and that many amendments and keep their job. If anything, one or two amendments, but we’re at 40 at this point. If he were not married to the president’s daughter, it would be shocking that he still is a presidential adviser.”
As people heavily involved in business, Kusher and Ivanka were always going to have a more thorough financial disclosure process. The sheer volume of revisions, however, might encourage lawmakers to take a closer look. Follow Us On: Facebook and Twitter Previous Post "
'Superstar' Tiger Roll emulates National legend Red Rum,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/superstar-tiger-roll-emulates-national-lege-587812.html,"'Superstar' Tiger Roll Emulates National Legend Red Rum Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 5 minutes ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 11:55 PM
Aintree, United Kingdom, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Tiger Roll put his name alongside legend Red Rum on Saturday, winning back-to-back Grand Nationals in stunning style.
The 4-1 favourite, superbly ridden by Davy Russell, took up the running at the last fence, and although 66-1 outsider Magic of Light came back at him, the nine-year-old had enough to spare to emulate Red Rum's feat in 1973-74.
The 39-year-old Russell pumped his arms in delight and got a huge hug from trainer Gordon Elliott as the 70,000 crowd -- with a group dressed up as tigers -- raised the roof as jockey, trainer and horse returned to the winners enclosure.
""To win two successive Grand Nationals at my age, you could scarcely believe it,"" said Russell.
Russell -- whose father was present -- had dedicated his win last year to his late mother and recalled her again as the achievement began to sink in.
""She saw us through the good, the bad and the ugly. She was one heck of a lady,"" he said.
As Russell, who at one point in his career was fired by owner Michael O'Leary, waved his arms in celebration, Elliott, normally unreadable, was sobbing.
""I don't get upset very often... but this is unbelievable,"" said Elliott, who was winning his third Grand National.
""He is a tiger.
""Last year's win was for Davy's mum who had died , this year it is for my uncle (Willie) who died ."" O'Leary insisted that it was not about him making history.
""It is not me making history it is Gordon, Davy and the horse,"" he said.
""We have a once-in-a-lifetime horse who has given us a twice-in-a-lifetime experience."" The Ryanair chief's brother, Eddie, who buys his horses, summed Tiger Roll up simply.
""He is now a superstar."" - 'It was some thrill' - Two-and-three-quarter lengths behind Tiger Roll, Magic of Light put up a remarkable performance under Paddy Kennedy, lying up with the leaders throughout.
Having had an 11-year career, Kennedy only qualified to take part in the National in February , when he rode his 10th winner over fences.
Despite two terrible errors, including one at the usually formidable Chair, she was given an assured ride by Kennedy to come close to becoming the first mare to win the National since Nickel Coin in 1951.
""I didn't expect her to run that well,"" said her trainer Jessica Harrington, who at 72 was having her first runner in the race .
""She's only eight, was the only mare in the race -- it was some thrill."" Rathvinden had also been prominent throughout under Ruby Walsh and came in third for an Irish 1-2-3, with Walk in the Mill saving English honour by taking fourth.
""It was a lot of fun, just travelled really well... jumped for fun,"" said Walk in the Mill's jockey James Best .
""I did not see Tiger Roll till the last three fences. What a horse. What a ride by Davy.
""Great thrill."" Sadly for Rathvinden's trainer Willie Mullins, his Up For Review suffered a fatal injury when he was brought down at the first fence by the fancied Vintage Clouds.
Of the other fancied horses, top weight Anibale Fly made a bad mistake towards the end of the first circuit and ran on to finish fifth, with the 2017 winner One For Arthur sixth.
However, for champion jockey Richard Johnson, there would be no elusive first National, as on a record 21st ride, his mount Rock the Kasbah never looked at ease and came to grief early on the second circuit.
Last year's runner-up Pleasant Company also fell on the second circuit while looking dangerous.
There was to be no joy either for the two female jockeys bidding to become the first woman rider to win the great race .
Rachael Blackmore finished 10th on Valseur Lido, as Lizzie Kelly's well-backed Tea For Two failed to finish."

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain has said that both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan were making efforts to present the true soft image of islam before the world .
Saudi Arab was playing an important role for the integrity of Muslim Ummah, safeguarding it from prevailing threats, he said in an interview with the Saudi newspaper 'Al-Riyadh'.

Johannesburg, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa stunned record eight-time trophy holders Al Ahly of Egypt 5-0 Saturday in the first leg of a CAF Champions League quarter-final near Pretoria .
It was the heaviest defeat suffered by the Cairo Red Devils in a CAF match and leaves them with virtually no chance in the second leg next weekend.
Themba Zwane and Wayne Arendse scored to give the hosts a 2-0 half-time advantage at a packed 25,000-seat Lucas 'Masterpieces' Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville.
Brazilian Ricardo Nascimento converted a penalty two minutes into the second half and goals from Uruguayan Gaston Sirino and Ahly reject Phakamani Mahlambi completed the rout.
The clubs meet again next Saturday in Egypt and Ahly will have to score at least five goals to have a chance of avoiding elimination from the elite African club competition.
Beating Ahly, who have also won a record 19 CAF titles, by such a wide margin was beyond the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic Sundowns supporter.
Most believed a two-goal advantage and not conceding at home was the best the shock 2016 Champions League winners could hope for against such vaunted opponents.
Ahly have suffered several three-goal defeats since making their debut in the competition 43 years ago, but this humiliation puts the future of Uruguayan coach Martin Lasarte in doubt.
He took over this year from Frenchman Patrice Carteron, who was sacked after Ahly surrendered a 3-1 first-leg lead to lose the 2018 final against Esperance of Tunisia .
""We had a very bad match today, and we need to work hard in the coming period to fix many things,"" Lasarte told the Ahly website after the debacle.
""I apologise to Ahly fans, both those who were at the stadium or following via television .
""There is no time to talk about anything now, and we only have to work and focus on what is ahead."" BeIn Sport pundit and former star Ahly centre-back Wael Gomaa called the five-goal thrashing in South Africa a ""disgrace"".
Gomaa was part of the star-studded Ahly side that reached four consecutive Champions League finals from 2005, winning three.
In Dar es Salaam , Simba SC of Tanzania were held 0-0 by five-time champions TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
While the result confirms Mazembe as favourites to win the tie, they will tread warily after what occurred at the same stage last season.
Having forced a 0-0 draw at Primeiro Agosto of Angola , the Congolese side missed two penalties and had two goals disallowed in a second leg that ended 1-1 and they were eliminated on away goals.

PARIS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Libyan crisis cannot be resolved through ""a military victory"" as political settlement remains the only option in light of growing tensions in the Maghreb country, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Saturday.
On Thursday, France , jointly with Italy , the United States , the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates expressed concern over the latest outbreak of fighting in Libya .
""In Libya , we know what needs to be done. Yesterday evening, we set forth the communique with no difficulty. There is one basic principle which that in Libya there will not be a military victory. The solution can only be a political one,"" Le Drian said at a press conference closing the meeting of G7 foreign ministers in France .
The political solution for Libyan crisis includes calling a national conference and a subsequent holding of elections, the French foreign minister noted.
""Now, for all of this to happen in a calm setting, we need many elements of the present situation to stop, and different players to restrain themselves,"" Le Drian underlined.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the commander of forces loyal to East Libya-based government , ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA)-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-supported government Fayez Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary."
Zidane vague on Bale's future after scrappy win over Eibar,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/zidane-vague-on-bales-future-after-scrappy-w-587802.html,"Zidane Vague On Bale's Future After Scrappy Win Over Eibar Sumaira FH 5 minutes ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 11:25 PM
Madrid, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Zinedine Zidane refused to guarantee Gareth Bale's future at Real Madrid after the Welshman struggled again in a 2-1 victory over Eibar on Saturday.
Karim Benzema scored twice at the Santiago Bernabeu as Madrid came from behind after Marc Cardona, starting only after an injury to Pedro Leon in the warm-up, gave Eibar a surprise lead .
But Madrid improved and a pair of Benzema headers ensured the groans and whistles that had soured the atmosphere for much of the opening hour turned to cheers and applause at the end.
Much of the frustration was again directed at Bale, who started here after being dropped by Zidane for the defeat to Valencia on Wednesday.
Asked afterwards if Bale would be at Real Madrid next season, Zidane said: ""We'll see, I'm not going to tell you what's going to happen. Gareth is a Real Madrid player, he has two years left on his contract. We will see. It is not the time to talk about this."" Bale's below-par performances and a lack of support from either coach or fans seem so inter-linked now, it is difficult to know what comes first. He departed again to whistles with 14 minutes left, a conciliatory hand slap from Zidane offering little consolation as he trudged off.
Benzema's trajectory has been the opposite, the Frenchman now with six goals in five La Liga games, four of them since Zidane took over.
""Karim has had a great season,"" Zidane said. ""His goals have perhaps changed people's perception of him. But he has never changed as a player."" Madrid 's win means they are 10 points adrift of leaders Barcelona and two behind Atletico Madrid . Barca and Atletico play each other later on Saturday. Eibar stay 11th.
Zidane has insisted his players are not on trial but his changing line-ups at least suggest he is examining his options before the summer.
This time Sergio Ramos was rested, while Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Lucas Vazquez also dropped out. In came Nacho, Federico Valverde, Isco and Bale.
Bale's half began badly as he failed to control Valverde's overhit pass and then got worse as he missed a one-on-one when his finish was saved by Marko Dmitrovic.
-- Chorus of whistles -- The scattering of whistles became a chorus after he dragged a shot wide from 25 yards and it was no surprise his confidence drained away, a poor touch following shortly after.
Bale was not the only one. Madrid lacked precision or purpose, as opponents were allowed through unchecked and passes went astray.
In the 39th minute, as the fans' frustration was reaching its peak, Eibar scored, a crisp move down the left ending with a cute pass from Gonzalo Escalante to Cardona, who chipped into the net.
The second half started better for Madrid , with Benzema scoring only to be called back for offside before the Frenchman headed in the equaliser just before the hour. Marco Asensio did brilliantly to weave into space and dig out the cross.
Bale might have been in but Asensio's pass struck the back of his heel and the Welshman departed with 14 minutes left, to disgruntled whistles.
Madrid scored the winner without him. Kroos' whipped cross was again met by the forehead of Benzema and, again, the ball found the net.
Benzema should have completed his hat-trick late on but one finish was palmed away by Dmitrovic and another, with the goal gaping, looped over. He even hit the post with a bending effort in injury-time. The treble was not to be."
Pressure mounts on Genesio as 'unacceptable' Lyon beaten by Dijon,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/pressure-mounts-on-genesio-as-unacceptable-587801.html,"Pressure Mounts On Genesio As 'unacceptable' Lyon Beaten By Dijon Faizan Hashmi 6 minutes ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 11:25 PM
Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Lyon slipped to a second damaging defeat this week as a 3-1 loss to struggling Dijon and a hostile atmosphere at the Groupama Stadium piled the pressure on Bruno Genesio on Saturday.
The 52-year-old coach had been told by president Jean-Michel Aulas that he would be offered a two-year contract extension if Lyon reached the French Cup final and finished in the Ligue 1 top three.
But a 3-2 Cup semi-final defeat by Rennes on Tuesday put his future in doubt, and fans on Saturday unfurled banners calling for Genesio's departure.
""We had already been eliminated on Tuesday. It's unacceptable,"" said goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, who added that the players need to put Genesio's unstable situation to the back of their minds.
""We are professionals. We must know what to do. We know that it's football . Part of the decision on the (future of the) coach was made on Tuesday but we must know how to ignore all that.
""The truth is on the pitch. If we don't turn up on the pitch it can only be difficult in the future."" Martin Terrier's first-minute goal briefly placated the home support, but only six minutes later Lyon were behind.
Wesley Said danced through the hapless home defence to slot in a third-minute equaliser, before his speculative long-range effort was deflected past Lopes by Lyon centre-back Marcelo.
Genesio's beleaguered men never seriously threatened a response and put paid to their own hopes in comical circumstances midway through the second half.
Said's pull-back was inadvertently backheeled into the net by Lyon full-back Rafael, with the spin on the ball leaving Lopes grasping at thin air.
The result leaves Lyon only seven points clear of Saint-Etienne in the third and final Champions League spot, with Les Verts visiting Amiens later on Saturday.
A first league win since January lifted Dijon off the foot of the table and into the relegation play-off place."
Venezuelans protest as Guaido declares history's 'greatest escalation',www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/venezuelans-protest-as-guaido-declares-histor-587800.html,"Venezuelans Protest As Guaido Declares History's 'greatest Escalation' Faizan Hashmi 5 minutes ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 11:25 PM
Caracas, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Opposition supporters thronged the streets of Caracas and other cities on Saturday in protest against the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, as massive blackouts and the collapse of water supplies further exacerbated a growing political crisis.
The United States meanwhile stiffened its economic sanctions against the government , and one top US official on Saturday warned Venezuela 's military that it must protect the rights of peaceful protesters.
Late Friday, opposition leader Juan Guaido -- who is supported in his claim to be the legitimate interim leader by around 50 nations -- called for a huge turnout in Caracas , announcing in a phone message to supporters the start of ""the greatest escalation of pressure we have seen in our history."" Two opposition deputies were detained in an anti-government protest in the western city of Maracaibo , fellow legislator Adriana Pichardo said, denouncing the arrests as a violation of parliamentary immunity .
Deputy Elimar Diaz, who joined the Maracaibo protest , told AFP the protest there had encountered ""brutal repression,"" including the use of tanks and the firing of tear gas canisters from helicopters.
He said people in the area were going ""days without electricity "" amid ""inhumane rationing"" by the government .
Maduro, who blames US-backed sabotage for the massive blackouts that have deprived millions of power, called for a counter pro-government march ""in defense of peace"" that drew hundreds to the streets of Caracas .
- Crumbling economy - Facing intense pressure at home and abroad, the Maduro government has sought to weaken Guaido's position.
The government has stripped him of his parliamentary immunity , authorized his prosecution for proclaiming himself acting president in January and has banned him from holding public office for 15 years.
Guaido said earlier this week he feared abduction by government agents.
The United States meanwhile kept up the international pressure on Maduro to step down.
Vice President Mike Pence announced fresh sanctions against 34 vessels belonging to Venezuela 's state oil company and two companies that ship crude to Cuba .
He said in a speech in Houston that ""the United States will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy ."" ""Those looking on should know this: all options are on the table. And Nicolas Maduro would do well not to test the resolve of the United States of America."" ""This is only a first step,"" US national security advisor John Bolton tweeted on Saturday in reference to the sanctions.
He cautioned Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino in a separate tweet of his ""constitutional responsibility to protect innocent civilians who are peacefully demonstrating,"" adding: ""Do not let the Cubans or the 'colectivos' inflict violence against Venezuelan patriots."" The ""colectivos"" are armed paramilitary groups that support Maduro and are accused by the opposition of often resorting to violence.
- Security Council to meet - Maduro enjoys important backing from his nation's military as well as from China and Russia -- which on March 23 sent two heavily loaded military planes to Caracas -- as he clings to power.
The US and its allies view the socialist president as illegitimate since he took office in January for a second six-year term following elections seen as deeply flawed.
With its crude exports collapsing and international sanctions piling up, Venezuela 's country's oil economy has crumbled. Malnutrition and disease are on the rise as living conditions plummet.
In the face of the worsening humanitarian crisis, the US has convened a session of the UN Security Council for Wednesday.
Since Venezuela 's massive blackout of March 7, the country has been subject to intermittent power cuts, with power being rationed outside of Caracas .
The blackouts have knocked out water supplies as well as transport and communications, forcing many people to trim their work days to six hours.
""We are tired,"" said Verony Mendez, 48, whose water was cut off two months ago.
""But we have to take to the streets because it is the only way to get these people out!"" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Glasgow, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A tense Scottish derby between Hibernian and Edinburgh rivals Hearts was disrupted on Saturday -- by a coconut.
Hibs came from behind at Tynecastle to win 2-1 but the game was marred by crowd trouble including a coconut, thrown on to the pitch in the wake of Daryl Horgan's 28th-minute equaliser.
The winger scored again early in the second half to complete the Hibs comeback.
Smoke bombs -- in the two clubs' colours of maroon and green -- were also hurled on to the pitch before and during the first half, in which Peter Haring gave Hearts the lead .
Meanwhile, Celtic's charge towards another Scottish Premiership title was delayed by a surprise 0-0 draw against Livingston .
Neil Lennon's side were frustrated by a string of first-half saves from Livingston keeper Liam Kelly as the visitors dug in for a point at Parkhead.
Celtic remain well on course to win an eighth successive Scottish title despite the frustrating result .
The champions sit 14 points clear of Rangers , who travel to Motherwell on Sunday , but will have to wait at least two weeks for their inevitable coronation.
Third-placed Kilmarnock moved to within five points of Rangers with a 2-0 win over 10-man St Johnstone.
An own goal from Christopher Kane after 17 minutes set the hosts on their way, with Kris Boyd doubling their lead from the penalty spot two minutes before the break.
St Johnstone's misery was complete when Jason Kerr was sent off for a second yellow card in the 68th minute.
Aberdeen joined Killie on 58 points thanks to a 2-0 win at basement boys Dundee , who slipped three points adrift at the foot of the table.
Sam Cosgrove's 59th-minute penalty broke the deadlock. He made it two in the 77th minute.
Second-bottom St Mirren gave themselves hope of a relegation play-off spot as they came from behind to draw 1-1 at Hamilton .
Steve Davies put Hamilton ahead after 63 minutes, but Anders Dreyer levelled with a penalty three minutes later."
