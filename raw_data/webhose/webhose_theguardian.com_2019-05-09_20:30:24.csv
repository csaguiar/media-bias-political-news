It's my experience that, too often, people are encouraged to persist with treatments that will have little or no affect. They just prolong the agony, as it were.

Anti-abortion activists lose bid to overturn clinic safe access zones in two states | World news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Melissa Davey,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/10/anti-abortion-activists-lose-bid-to-overturn-clinic-safe-access-zones-in-two-states,"High court throws out cases from anti-abortion campaigners in Victoria and Tasmania. Safe access zone laws in Victoria and Tasmania preventing anti-abortion protesters from harassing women seeking medical treatment will stay, following a judgment delivered by the high court on Wednesday.
The court threw out the cases brought by anti-abortion campaigners Kathleen Clubb and Graham Preston in a comprehensive, 200-page decision.
Abortion clinic safe-access zones face challenge in Australia's high court Read more
The Victorian case was brought by Clubb, who was the first person to be convicted of breaking Victoria’s safe access zone laws . The laws mean anti-abortion protesters cannot protest within 150 metres of health and fertility clinics. Clubb was fined $5,000 for communicating about abortion to a woman attending an East Melbourne medical clinic. Clubb’s conduct was found to be “reasonably likely to cause distress or anxiety”.
Preston, a Christian campaigner, was the first person convicted under similar laws in Tasmania, and he was fined $3,000 in 2016. Clubb and Preston challenged the laws in their respective states, arguing the legislation stifled free speech .
But the court found “given that the proscription leaves protesters free to conduct protests in relation to terminations outside the access zone, and that there is no evidence or other reason to accept that political protest against terminations outside the access zone is any less effective as a tool of political persuasion than protest within”, any impediment the safe access zones had on political freedom was “negligible”.
Clubb wrote on her Instagram page that she prayed at the safe access zone “with mixed feelings” ahead of the judgment being delivered.

“Whatever happens, no one can ever stop any of us from praying to end abortion,” she wrote. In her submission to the court, she wrote “notoriously, communications on that topic [abortion] are likely to occur and be most politically resonant”.
“The prohibition applies whether or not discomfort is caused and irrespective of the political significance of the communication in the circumstances.”
The Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic and the Human Rights Law Centre both made submissions in the case and defended the safe access laws. They argued free speech was not a license to harm others with impunity. For decades, anti-abortionists caused serious distress, fear and anxiety to patients and staff, and even caused some women to delay medical treatment . Even women seeking treatments such as pap smears and check-ups had to face the protesters.
Victoria abortion protest laws take effect after being fast-tracked by government Read more
There have also been instances of violence. In 2002, anti-abortion activist Peter James Knight was sentenced to life in prison after he entered the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic with a gun and shot and killed a security guard working there.
Adrianne Walters, senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Centre, said the high court’s decision acknowledged the importance of privacy, safety and equality in access to healthcare.
“With today’s decision, women in Victoria and Tasmania never again need to worry about being forced to run a gauntlet of abuse to access abortion care,” she said. “Safe access zones are here to stay.
“Anti-abortionists outside clinics cause serious distress, fear and anxiety to patients and staff.
Women shouldn't have to travel interstate for abortions, doctor says Read more
“Right now, women seeking reproductive healthcare in WA and SA are being harassed by anti-abortionists because their governments have failed to protect them. There can be no excuse for delaying safe access zone laws.”
However, Tasmanian women still have to struggle for safe and easy access to abortion, with those needing surgical abortions forced to travel to Victoria to get the procedure , leaving their families and taking time off education or work. Tasmania’s last private abortion clinic closed in January, and the public hospital system has not filled the gap.
Victoria introduced safe access zone laws in 2016, while Tasmania introduced them as part decriminalising abortion in 2013. New South Wales, the ACT, the Northern Territory and Queensland also have safe access zone laws.
Dr Susie Allanson, who worked as a clinical psychologist at the Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic for 26 years, said the judgment reinforcing the Tasmanian and Victorian laws was a win for women.
“Since the safe zones came into effect, women and staff are no longer a target when they walk up to the clinic, and women no longer carry the heavy burden of being publicly attacked for seeking medical care,” she said. “This is a great result that enshrines respect for women’s choices.”

Albanian police have arrested four people and questioned 40 others after armed robbers stole millions of euros from an Austria Airlines aeroplane in a deadly heist.
Armed men broke onto the runway of Tirana airport on Tuesday and stole the money due to be transported to a bank in Vienna, police said.
Foreign banks operating in Albania send their hard currency to Vienna because Albania’s central bank does not accept such deposits.
The robbers entered the runway of the international Mother Teresa airport through a gate used by firefighters.

Police said three armed robbers dressed in military fatigues showed up and threatened the employees handling luggage, eventually stealing the money.
One of the gunmen was killed in an exchange of fire with the police.
According to initial reports, the amount stolen was €2.5m ($2.8m), but local media claimed it could be a five times higher.
Austrian Airlines spokeswoman Tanja Gruber said the cash was being loaded when the robbery happened.
“Boarding had just taken place. There was never any danger for crew and passengers,” she said.
The plane’s departure was delayed by nearly three hours.
As a security measure, there will be no further cash transfers from Tirana to Vienna, she said.
Robbers have staged such heists at least two more times in last three years at the airport.

UK drug firm made false claims about opioid treatment's safety: indictment | US news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,msn.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/09/opioid-addiction-indivior-indictment,"British company accused of illegal marketing of Suboxone Film to drug addicts. The British pharmaceutical company Indivior had more than £560m wiped from its market value on Wednesday after the US justice department charged it with fraudulent marketing of its treatment for people addicted to opioids.
The indictment demanded the forfeiture of $3bn in cash, as well as all of Invidior’s main business divisions, bank accounts, trademarks and patents – effectively meaning the company would cease to exist if found guilty.
A grand jury in the federal court in Abingdon, in the US state of Virginia, said Indivior marketed Suboxone Film, an opioid-based drug, as a safe and controllable treatment for opioid and heroin addiction.
However, the indictment on Tuesday said that Indivior – until 2014 part of Reckitt Benckiser – sought to boost sales by telling healthcare providers and programmes that Suboxone Film, which contains the opioid buprenorphine, was better and safer than similar drugs, when in fact it was not.
Sackler family asks judge to toss out Massachusetts suit over ‘inaccuracies’ Read more
The company also set up a telephone line for patients to call to be connected to a doctor for opioid addiction and dependence treatment; the indictment says Indivior connected patients to doctors it knew were prescribing Suboxone and/or other opioids in a careless and clinically unwarranted manner.
The US department of justice accused Indivior of a fraud targeting people addicted to opioids. The increase in addiction to opioids has become a central issue in politics in the US and the UK in recent years, prompting intense scrutiny on pharmaceutical firms. The US president, Donald Trump, declared the opioids crisis a public health emergency in 2017.
Jody Hunt, an assistant attorney general at the DoJ, said: “Opioid addiction is a national epidemic. The indictment alleges that, rather than marketing its opioid-addiction drug responsibly, Indivior promoted it with a disregard for the truth about its safety and despite known risks of diversion and abuse.”
Indivior, which made more than $800m in revenues from the sale of the drug in 2014 alone, was charged with 28 counts of healthcare fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud related to the marketing of Suboxone Film.
The grand jury alleged: “Indivior’s fraudulent scheme lasted for years and hindered patients’, healthcare ... providers’ and health care benefit programmes’ accurate assessments regarding opioid-addiction treatment in order to increase the company’s profits.”
Indivior has denied the allegations.
However,the scandal also threatened to drag in the former parent company, Reckitt, which is listed on the FTSE 100 and has its headquarters in Slough, Berkshire. In 2018, Reckitt set aside £313m to cover any legal costs. In its annual report the firm acknowledged that final costs could be significantly higher and that it had engaged in talks with the US Department of Justice.
In a statement to the stock market, Indivior said the alleged wrongdoing had “occurred almost exclusively prior to Indivior becoming an independent company”.
Shares in Reckitt Benckiser fell by 6% on Wednesday to £60.09.
In a statement, Reckitt said: “This indictment is not against RB Group Plc or any other group company and we currently have no additional or new information in respect of this matter, apart from what has been publicly issued by the [US] department of justice and Indivior Plc.”
Shares in Indivior crashed 74% to 28p on Wednesday morning.
The company’s market value has already plummeted in the past year as it has tried to prevent a generic rival to Suboxone Film from entering the market. Shares traded at a record high above 500p as recently as June last year but slumped after US courts allowed the sale of the cheaper, generic rival manufactured by India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.
Indivior, which also has operations in Slough , as well as Richmond, in the US state of Virginia, called the indictment “wholly unsupported by either the facts or the law”.
However, Indivior said it had “made numerous attempts to reach a settlement that went far beyond what it believes the facts of the case support”.
The company said the justice department “has apparently decided it would rather pursue self-serving headlines on a matter of national significance than achieve an appropriate resolution”.
“We will contest this case vigorously and we look forward to the full facts coming out in court.”

--
The EPA tested fragrances for chemicals in 1991 and found a list of the following toxic perfume chemical ingredients: acetone, benzaldehyde, benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, camphor, ethanol, ethyl acetate, limonene, linalool and methylene chloride – usually in some combination.
Why is fragrance toxic?
These toxic villains are very hard to avoid because manufacturers are not required to list them on ingredient labels. Fragrance chemicals, like other toxic chemicals, can pass from the skin and into the blood. ... So called “natural fragrances” can be just as toxic as synthetic fragrances.--
Is natural fragrance toxic?
Typical Fragrance Oils are made in a laboratory from synthetic compounds and composed almost entirely of petroleum by-products such as benzene derivatives, aldehydes, toluene, and other known toxic chemicals. ... However, the addition of a little bit of essential oil does not mean they are natural.Mar 13, 2018-
Scent of Danger: Are There Toxic Ingredients in Perfumes and Colognes?
--
Ahhh...the sweet smell of petrochemicals! The Environmental Working Group (EWG) reports that, while many popular perfumes, colognes and body sprays contain trace amounts of natural essences, they also typically contain a dozen or more potentially hazardous synthetic chemicals, some of which are derived from petroleum. To protect trade secrets, makers are allowed to withhold fragrance ingredients, so consumers can’t rely on labels to know what hazards may lurk inside that new bottle of perfume.
“A rose may be a rose,” reports EWG. “But that rose-like fragrance in your perfume may be something else entirely, concocted from any number of the fragrance industry’s 3,100 stock chemical ingredients, the blend of which is almost always kept hidden from the consumer.”
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/toxic-perfumes-and-colognes /
Listen, ANYTHING you put on your skin is absorbed into your body,
the OVER 3100 chemicals that are used by the fragrance industry ,
some are known to be toxic since the 1990's,
The over 13,000 lobbyists in Washington DC are paid by BIG companies to keep the consumer in the dark.

here is where they are banning "" fragrance ""
-
Googling “fragrance ban” or “fragrance health concerns” will take you to many stories about these initiatives. In the US more and more municipal authorities are banning fragranced products: Detroit City, Minnosota educational institutions, Cecil College ( Maryland) and Portland State University are all some of the many fragrance-free workplaces. In Santa Cruz, California, the municipality has banned the wearing of fragranced products at public meetings. At Marin County in California, restaurants now offer “fragrance-free” areas for customers.
In Canada, Halifax, Nova Scotia, has a policy of “no scents makes good sense” and discourages the wearing of fragranced products in municipal office, libraries, hospitals, classrooms, courts and buses.
49 municipalities in Gothenburg, Sweden, are considering banning the wearing of fragranced products in all hospitals in the region. An estimated 6% of the Swedish population is sensitive to fragrance and suffer allergic reactions.
In many case these bans are a response to successful lawsuits brought by people whose ability to work or study is compromised by other peoples’ fragrance - “second-hand fragrance”. As in the case of tobacco, breathing someone else’s perfume is not a choice. A person can choose to eat organic food, but you can't choose not to breathe your colleague's fragrance.
Fragrance, like tobacco, is a high-profit industry. Not surprisingly, the fragrance industry opposes regulation or limitation, arguing that its own procedures ( see “who does the tesing?) are enough of a safeguard.

Spoiler alert! How TV and film are trying to protect their blockbusters | Television & radio,www.theguardian.com,Balthazars,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/09/spolier-alert-tv-and-film-protect-their-blockbusters#127919686,"An interesting article for an interesting phenomenon. I personally am not particularly concerned about spoilers, because often if I'm interested in something, I already have quite a lot of ideas about how the movie/series/book will proceed and I actually don't mind getting early confirmation of those theories. But I'm also happy to go into something 'spoiler free' and experience it for the first time.
Personally I feel there is a definitely an element of deliberateness by producers to create the 'avoid spoilers' mentality because, in my opinion, it has a degree of 'reverse psychology' on fans. When you try to deny something from someone, if that person really likes or values whatever it is that you are denying them from having, they tend to react by wanting that thing even more, because they end up with this perspective that ""it must be really good, which is why you don't want to share"".
So it works a bit like this: these established franchises have large existing fan-bases which are very keen to learn details about their craze. So, if you tell them ""you can't have this information about the story"", it actually enhances expectation and desire in the fans because the fans think: ""wow, they won't let us know about this thing, so it must be really amazing, hence I now really want to know it"".
The problem is that mentality encourages fans to leak and dig out every single last little detail, which depending on the way your story is set up, could in fact end up quashing any 'big reveals' you hope to leave on people, so it becomes a bit of a two-edged sword. But overall, it is a win for the producers because those that spoil themselves are likely those who don't really mind being spoiled and will likely still enjoy the experience anyway. Sure, there are some who hate spoilers who will stumble across them and end up frustrated, but they are probably in the minority."

Steve Bell on May requesting a Brexit delay from Macron – cartoon | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,The Deptford Bounder,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2019/apr/09/steve-bell-on-may-requesting-a-brexit-delay-from-macron#127919779,"May wired to self-destruct, due to her own pig-headed obsessive intransigence. Seeing as she has pretty much lost the Tory party she has spent the last two and a half years disastrously trying to keep together, there is another way she could now go. By coming clean and admitting she has calamitously mismanaged the situation, that she is profoundly sorry, the Tories have been hijacked by raving lunatics and that she will now take executive action and revoke article 50 because it is clear all the alternatives are so much worse than remaining in the EU. Go on Mrs May, you've quite literally got nothing to lose."

Embarrassing, considering it was a VAR-reviewed, ""forwards' tackle"" worthy of a yellow at most."

Leroy Sane and Kevin De Bruyne should have been in the starting lineup or at least should have been brought on earlier in the second half. It was quite clear that Maherz was ineffective and Aguero has just returned from injury so wasn't fully match fit. Fortunately for Man City they have just conceded one goal so there is plenty to play for in the second leg on their home ground. Yet they must beat Spurs by at least 2 clear goals.

They have been very resilient and professional in this CL ever since they bounced back in the group-stages.
I have a sneaky feeling that Spurs may reach the final to face Liverpool."

I should be clearer on that. I have no doubt that the pension fund was involved in, and approved, the designs."

She has a lot of 'stuff' done though I imagine. If I went in there for the usual short at the sides, sweep the top over a bit to hide the thinning sections (it's not a comb over just yet ... or is it ... only others can judge) how would I be able to judge the improvements out of the extra $760 in cost. USD! I can't imagine going there even if I was filthy rich. If imagine was a part of my job I'd probably prefer to do a Beyonce and have someone at my beck and call (the being at your beck and call part justifying the extra cost)."
