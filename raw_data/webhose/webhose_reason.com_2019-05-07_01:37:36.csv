Plants have been sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere for about 2 billion years and that already caused one great die off when global O2 levels exploded from nothing to 20% of the atmosphere, so it's not unprecedented that plants can change the atmosphere drastically enough to affect all life on the planet.
CO2 reached dangerous lows going from 0.2% of the atmosphere 200 million years ago to 0.028%, that's an 86% reduction in CO2. Plant life needs a minimum of .018% of CO2 in the atmosphere for photosynthesis, so we were only 0.01% or 100ppm away from an environmental calamity. It certainly wouldn't be the first time some life form caused itself to die off because it consumed all of its available food supply, but if plant life goes, all of us go with them
Thank God, humanity discovered where the plants hid a lot of that carbon in coal and oil and converted it to life sustaining CO2 in order to keep the planet healthy and reduce our margin of error for CO2 starvation."

A similar error is to claim that entering a password has broader
testimonial significance because it is akin to translating the entire encrypted
contents from ciphertext to plaintext. On this thinking, entering the password
is like a witness taking the stand and translating documents from a secret
language into English. But this analogy doesn't work. Assuming that an act
of translation could be incriminating,68 and that the act of production doctrine
would apply to it, the testimonial aspect of translation is knowing how to
translate from one language to another. In contrast, entering a password
implies no such knowledge. Take the case of my sister's phone. If I enter the
password and the phone unlocks, my entering the password implies no
knowledge about how the phone's encryption software works. I don't even
know what kind of phone my sister has. The only testimony implicit in
unlocking her phone is the only thing I know: The password."

Of course it'll pass. Bits and pieces, over time, eventually all adding up to the same thing. It's been going on for years. These things tend to accelerate. Graph taxation, state expenditure, regulatory control and notice how they start off at a low level and grow like a rolling snowball. Just imagine a green snowball. Ain't it pretty.
That ball has been rolling for quite some time now. Pretty soon it'll be hard to jump out of its way.
All over the world governments -- democratically elected governments -- in plain sight, as a result of long consultation processes, have implemented everything from carbon taxes to plastic bag bans. Most importantly, the Green agenda has been taught in all levels of education for at least a couple of decades. Children go on class trips for Earth Day and to protest climate change. It's official education policy and it's the default worldview of the millions of new voters being pumped out of the schools each and every year. This isn't a future event; this is now. It's a done deal; it just hasn't been voted on yet. But that's a minor detail. reply to this log in or register to reply TBlakely | 4.8.19 @ 2:24PM | #

I would like to try to pierce the informational bubble, most comments agree heavily with the author of the piece.. In doing so, I'm venturing out of my own usual bubble to try to read, consume and reciprocate with new information.
The author's underlining main conclusion, ""the green new deal is anti-democratic"" is based off of past perception and general cynical opinion from anything coming from the public sector in my opinion. I can tell you, that it isn't based on at least two things:
1) The green new deal policy proposal. I know this because there is no green new deal policy proposal.
2) The green new deal resolution that was introduced in congress. This was a resolution, its more like a vision statement, a set of principles, a guidance document, an outline of the scope and solutions they are working towards. All of the details are non-existent, and ""THE GREEN NEW DEAL"" is basically the brain-child of one organization. Whereas a general green new deal is any number of policy discussions and prescriptions that anyone that believes we should motivate as much US resources as possible to transition to a green economy might support. reply to this log in or register to reply Sevo | | #

The main idea put forth is that the advocates of the Green new deal will look to coercive govt policies in general. I admit that is absolutely an approach that some might take. But its actually completely the opposite of the actual text of the resolution that started this debate.
To realize that point, I want to encourage everyone to at least consume some information from the actual architects of the green new deal.
https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast
The episode entitled ""Meet the policy architect of the green new deal""
A huge portion of this conversation is explicitly about how the final polices she is developing have crucial democratic input, where she meets with all the stakeholders, the wonks, the impacted communities, the legislatures, the skeptics, etc. She explains how important it is to not create polices that harm the same communities that fossil fuel pollution and transitions disproportionately. Now this is an extremely complicated task, and we at this point have no idea how true any final plan will be to those goals. But the emphasis and care is there.
I read this reason article because I was in search of critics of a green new deal, a general idea that I am in much favor of. I am hoping you'll do the same. reply to this log in or register to reply Sevo | | #
